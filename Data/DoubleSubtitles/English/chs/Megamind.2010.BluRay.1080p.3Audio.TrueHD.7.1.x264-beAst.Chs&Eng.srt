2
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,660
这是我迄今走过的岁月
Here's my day so far:

3
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,500
进过监狱 失去了我的梦中情人
Went to jail, lost the girl of my dreams,

4
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,970
被别人打得屁滚尿流
and got my butt kicked pretty good.

5
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,670
不过 更糟的事还在后头
Still, things could be a lot worse.

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,410
噢 没错
Oh, that's right.

7
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,810
我快要掉下去摔死了
I'm falling to my death.

8
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,850
估计没更糟的了
Guess they can't.

9
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,280
你要问 怎么会成这样？
How'd it all come to this, you ask?

10
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,350
我的结局开始就已注定
My end starts at the beginning.

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,520
最初的开始
The very beginning.

12
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,060
没错 这就是我
Yes, that's me.

13
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,530
我童年相当正常
I had a fairly standard childhood.

14
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,540
我来自 你们可能会叫做 一个破碎的家庭
I came from, what you might call, a broken home.

15
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,460
确实很破碎
Literally broken.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,010
我都八天大了 还跟父母住在一起
I was eight days old and still living with my parents.

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,370
多悲哀啊？
How sad is that?

18
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,640
显然 生活该向前了
Clearly it was time to move on.

19
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,580
这是你的仆人 他会照顾你的
Here is your Minion. He will take care of you.

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,180
给你宾奇奶嘴
And here is your Binky.

21
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,120
你命中注定成为…
You are destined for...

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,520
我没听到最后那部分 不过似乎很重要
I didn't quite hear that last part, but it sounded important.

23
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,320
- 命中注定成为…  - 什么？
- Destined for...  - What?

24
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,830
我登上行程 去寻找自己的命运
I set out to find my destiny.

25
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,700
结果 一个Glaupunkt信号区的孩子和我的想法如出一辙
Turns out a kid from the Glaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea.

26
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,110
就是那天 我见到了假正经先生…
That was the day I met Mr. Goody Two-Shoes...

27
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,490
我们宏伟的较量从此开始
and our glorious rivalry was born.

28
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,430
这将是我的命运吗？
Could this be what I was destined for?

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,060
奢华 梦幻的生活
A dream life filled with luxury.

30
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,370
显然不是
Apparently not.

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,810
就连命运也有自己的喜好
Even fate picks its favorites.

32
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,440
没什么大不了
No big deal.

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,270
一个截然不同的命运等待着我
A much different fate awaited me.

34
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,400
[欢迎来到犯罪天才的大都会市监狱]

35
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,690
一个婴儿！好贴心啊
A baby! How thoughtful.

36
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,620
噢 对 对啊 我看到它 就想到了你
Oh, yes. Yes, I saw it and thought of you.

37
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,560
幸运地是 我找到了一个可爱的小地方来当家
Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home.

38
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,890
我们可以养它吗？
Can we keep it?

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,630
这个地方教会了我对…
A place that taught me the differences between right...

40
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,130
与错
and wrong.

41
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,630
而另一边 假正经先生
Mr. Goody Two-Shoes, on the other hand,

42
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,300
不费吹灰之力就过上了好日子
had life handed to him on a silver platter.

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,940
我们的宝贝会飞啊
Our baby can fly.

44
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,340
是啊 是啊 对你来说最棒了 亲爱的
Yes, yes, nothing but the best for you, darling.

45
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,780
翱翔之力 刀枪不入 发型超棒
The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair.

46
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,120
但是我有厉害许多的地方
But I had something far, far greater.

47
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,590
我智慧惊人…
My amazing intellect...

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,280
还有创造破坏工具的本领超棒
and knack for building objects of mayhem.

49
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,070
过了几年 因为表现良好
After a few years, and with some time off for good behavior,

50
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,100
我得到机会进行学习 自我改善…
I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning...

51
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,500
还是在一个陌生的地方 叫什么校
at a strange place called Shool.

52
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,270
天才儿童学校 “专为天才儿童打造” 在那儿 我再次遇上了假正经先生
It was there that I once again ran into Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.

53
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,280
他那时已经有了一大批没大脑的粉丝
He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft-headed groupies.

54
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,750
他就靠着大秀演技 还有挥霍精美小礼品
He bought their affections with showmanship

55
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,260
来赚取他们的喜爱
and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.

56
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,260
所以我也要做出爆玉米花 把那些没大脑的白痴给争取过来
So I, too, will make this popp-ed corn and win over those mindless drones.

57
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,800
熄灯
Lights out.

58
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,890
就是那时 我学到了一个艰难的道理:
That's when I learned a very hard lesson:

59
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,720
好人获得所有的表扬和奉承
Good receives all the praise and adulation,

60
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,760
而坏人只能在角落面壁思过
while evil is sent to quiet-time in the corner.

61
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,200
所以能否融入群体 真不是我能左右的
So fitting in wasn't really an option.

62
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,640
当他们学习儿歌“海绵泡沫纸板书”的时候…
While they were learning the Ltsy Bitsy Spider...

63
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,810
我在学习如何随心所欲地让活化物体脱水 再水化
I learned how to dehydrate animate objects and rehydrate them at will.

64
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,780
有段时间 就好像只有我和我的仆人与世界为敌
Some days, it felt like it was just me and Minion against the world.

65
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,910
不管我多么努力
No matter how hard I tried,

66
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,150
我总是个局外人
I was always the odd man out,

67
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,090
被抛弃的人
the last one picked,

68
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,350
出乱子的人 害群之马…
the screw-up, the black sheep...

69
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,890
砸他！
Get him!

70
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,330
坏小孩
The bad boy.

71
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,430
怪人！
Weirdo!

72
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,970
这就是我的命运了？
Was this my destiny?

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,870
等下 可能就是
Wait, maybe it was.

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,850
我唯一擅长的就是做坏事
Being bad is the one thing I'm good at.

75
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,120
然后我恍然大悟: 如果我是个坏小孩
Then it hit me: If I was the bad boy,

76
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,280
那我就要做所有人中最坏的那个
then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all.

77
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,620
我命中注定成为超级大坏蛋
I was destined to be a super-villain,

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,430
我们注定要成为对头
and we were destined to be rivals.

79
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,530
既知难逃一死
The die had been cast,

80
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,900
那就开始好好经营我永恒 壮丽的终生事业吧
and so began an enduring, epic, lifelong career.

81
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,100
我爱它
And I loved it.

82
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,410
我们之间的战争愈演愈烈
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.

83
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,580
他赢了很多次
He would win some.

84
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,220
我很多时候也险些获胜
I would almost win others.

85
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,690
他取名为大都会侠 意为大都会市的保护者
He took the name Metro Man, defender of Metrocity.

86
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,480
我决定要取个谦虚点的名号: 超级大坏蛋…
I decided to pick something a little more humble: Megamind...

87
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,430
不可思议的帅气犯罪天才 精通所有的坏事
incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy.

88
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,100
超级大坏蛋

89
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,040
下班时间再看吧 开门
Read on your own time. Open up.

90
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,490
- 嘿！ - 嘣！
- Hey!  - Boo!

91
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,820
噢 早上好啊 监狱长
Oh, good morning, Warden.

92
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,930
超级大新闻: 我已经改过自新啦 而且…
Great news: I'm a changed man, and...

93
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,830
我已经准备好重新踏入社会 当个好市民了
and I'm ready to re-enter society as a solid citizen.

94
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,400
你是个大坏蛋 而且永远都是大坏蛋
You're a villain, and you'll always be a villain.

95
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,230
你永远不会改过自新 而且永远也不能离开这儿
You'll never change, and you'll never leave.

96
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,700
你真好玩
You're fun.

97
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,140
有人给你寄来个礼物
You got a present in the mail.

98
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,670
是小狗吗？
Is it a puppy?

99
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,010
大都会侠寄的 “让你算清八十五个无期徒刑的每一秒”
From Metro Man. "To count every second of your 85 life sentences."

100
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,450
很奇怪啊 没想到大都会侠也会沾沾自喜
That's funny. Never thought Metro Man was the gloating type.

101
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,320
噢 不过他品味确实不错 我就留下吧
Oh, but he does have nice taste. I think I'll keep it.

102
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,620
你可以告诉我现在几点了吗？
Any chance you could give me the time?

103
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,730
我可不想在大都会侠博物馆开幕式上迟到
I don't want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man Museum.

104
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,430
啊 不好 看样子你必定要错过它
Oh no. Looks like you're gonna miss it,

105
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,500
迟到个几千年了
by several thousand years.

106
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,030
噢 是吗？
Oh, am I?

107
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,070
大都会市市民们 大都会侠日快乐
Happy Metro Man Day, Metro City.

108
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,110
今天天气很好 我们在美丽的市中心
It's a beautiful day in beautiful downtown,

109
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,380
在此授予一位杰出人士 大都会侠以荣誉
where we're here to honor a beautiful man, Metro Man.

110
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,120
他的心海纳百川 包罗万象
His heart is an ocean that's inside a bigger ocean.

111
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,590
这么多年来 他以自己超凡的视觉注视着我们
For years he's been watching us with his super-vision,

112
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,290
以超凡的力量拯救着我们 以超凡的心关爱着我们
saving us with his super-strength and caring for us with his super-heart.

113
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,260
现在该我们给他些回报了
Now it's our turn to give something back.

114
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,370
来自罗珊・罗奇 在大都会侠博物馆
This is Roxanne Ritchi, reporting live

115
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,970
落成典礼发回的现场报道
from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.

116
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,770
哇 好了 现场直播让你说这种东西
Wow. OK, the stuff they make you read on-air,

117
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,210
真是让人太难以置信了 简直疯了
that's un-freaking-believable. It's crazy.

118
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,610
是我自己写的稿子 哈尔
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.

119
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,180
我其实是想说
What I was trying to say was,

120
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,050
我很难相信在现代社会中
I can't believe that in our modern society,

121
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,710
他们会让这种真正的艺术出现在新闻里
they let, like, actual art get onto the news.

122
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,190
- 真会圆场啊 哈尔  - 我们要不…
- Nice save, Hal.  - What are we...

123
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,450
去喝杯咖啡什么的吧
Like, let's just get a coffee or something.

124
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,290
拜托 该好好去体验下大都会侠日了
Come on, it's time to get in the Metro Man Day spirit.

125
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,860
好吧 如果我是大都会侠
Well, if I were Metro Man,

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,860
超级大坏蛋就不能老是绑架你成功了
Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,370
- 这是其一  - 嘴真甜 哈尔
- That's the first thing.  - That's sweet, Hal.

128
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,830
我一定会好好看着你 就像澳洲野狗看护小孩子一样
And I'd be watching you, like a dingo watches a human baby.

129
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,270
好吧 听起来…
OK, that sounded...

130
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,700
- 好吧 听起来有点奇怪  - 是有点 嗯
- OK, that sounded a little weird.  - A little bit. Yeah.

131
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,070
你现在这个奇怪的表情 让我感觉也怪怪的了
And you're making a weird face, and that's making me feel weird.

132
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,640
重点是 我会好好看着你 就像…
The point is, I would watch you like someone...

133
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,110
不是爱人 我们没在恋爱 我不是说我爱你
Not love. We're not in love. I'm not saying I love you.

134
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,510
嘿 我爱你 管它的
Hey, I love you. Whatever.

135
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,620
但是我不是说我爱上了你 我是说…
But I'm not saying like I'm in love with you. I'm saying...

136
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,750
罗珊？Roxaroo？人呢
Roxanne? Roxaroo?

137
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,830
- 哇… 怎么回事？ - 嘿…
- Whoa... What?  - Hey...

138
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,000
回去工作 市民花钱不是让你们来玩的
Get back to work. The city doesn't pay you to loaf.

139
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,170
- 站住！ - 喔 你们要干嘛 伙计？
- Freeze!  - Whoa. What are you doing, guys?

140
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,140
是我啊！监狱长啊
It's me! It's the warden.

141
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,310
嘿！开门！
Hey! Open up!

142
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,020
不 你们这些笨蛋 他骗了我们
No, you fools. He's tricked us.

143
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,620
说对了
You were right.

144
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,020
我永远会是个大坏蛋
I'll always be a villain.

145
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,480
噢 好啊 帅哥 要搭便车吗？
Well, hello good-looking. Need a lift?

146
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,010
当然啦 你这条可爱小鱼
Certainly do, you fantastic fish, you.

147
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,680
- 你快上车吧  - 我自由了！
- Get in the car, you.  - I'm free!

148
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,290
是吗？
Right?

149
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,420
仆人 干得好啊 送我这块表
Nice work sending me the watch, Minion.

150
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,960
- 当然啦 头儿  - 冲啊！
- You got it, boss.  - Punch it!

151
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,600
好 举起你们的双手
All right, put your hands in the air.

152
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,140
女士们 先生们 你们的大都会侠来了！
Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man!

153
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,510
- 谁是你们的英雄？ - 大都会侠！
- Who's your man?  - Metro Man!

154
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,240
没错 大都会市市民！
Yeah, Metro City!

155
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,510
来一下 来吧 来一下
Gimme some. Come on. Give it now.

156
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,550
跟我来 来吧 祝福我吧 好了
Give it to me. Right on. Gimme the good stuff. All right.

157
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,130
嘿 大都会市
Hey, Metro City.

158
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,530
嘿 嘿
Hey. Hey.

159
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,970
大家现在声音小一点好吗
You know, you know, I just want to bring it down a bit.

160
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,240
孩子 小点声 谢谢 伙计
Boys, a little lower. Thank you, fellas.

161
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,650
我们来说点现实的
Let's get real for a moment.

162
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,080
对 没错 说得对
That's right. That's right. That's right.

163
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,780
虽然拥有一整个博物馆是超级棒 超级棒的事
Although getting a whole museum is super-cool, is super-cool,

164
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,190
但是你们知道 你们给我最大的荣誉是什么吗？
you want to know what the greatest honor you've given me is?

165
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,090
你们真的想知道吗？真的吗？
Do you really want to know? Really?

166
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,730
我告诉你们
I'll tell you.

167
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,310
你们给我最大的荣誉就是 让我为你们服务
The greatest honor you've given me is letting me serve you,

168
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,030
为大都会市无助的民众服务
the helpless people of Metro City.

169
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,940
每天快结束的时候
And at the end of every day,

170
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,170
我就经常问自己…
well, I often ask myself...

171
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,740
没了你们 我又将是谁？
who would I be without you?

172
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,850
- 我爱你 大都会侠！ - 我爱你们 每位市民
- I love you, Metro Man!  - And I love you, random citizen.

173
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,960
我告诉你哦 仆人 金窝银窝比不上自己的狗窝啊
I tell you, Minion. There's no place like evil lair.

174
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,230
头儿 我为您一直把这儿保持得阴冷潮湿
I've kept it cold and damp just for you, sir.

175
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,000
我看起来怎样 仆人？看起来很坏吧？
How do I look, Minion? Do I look bad?

176
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,040
特别令人毛骨悚然 头儿
Disgustingly horrifying, sir.

177
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,730
你真会说话
You always know what to say.

178
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,040
噢 头儿 这些中央机器人都想死你了
Oh, the brain-bots certainly missed you, sir.

179
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,680
你们想爸爸了吗？谁是邪恶的小机器人？
Did you miss your daddy? Who's a menacing little cyborg?

180
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,080
你是 没错 你是 不许咬人
You are. Yes, you are. No biting.

181
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,210
不行 不行 不行哦
No, no, no, no, no, no.

182
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,480
想要这个扳手？去追吧
You want the wrench? Go get the wrench.

183
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,560
- 噢 看看那儿  - 现在 我们继续嗨
- Oh, look at that.  - Now, back to laughing.

184
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,000
她醒了 快 开工吧
She's awake. Quick, to work.

185
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,940
荔枝小姐 我们又见面了
Miss Ritchi, we meet again.

186
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,950
你就不能洗一下那个袋子？
Would it kill you to wash the bag?

187
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,210
荔枝小姐 你可以随便尖叫
You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi.

188
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,480
没人能听到的
I'm afraid no one can hear you.

189
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,120
为… 为什么她不叫？
Wh... Why isn't she screaming?

190
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,920
荔枝小姐 你不介意的话 叫一下？
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind?

191
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,620
像这样…
Like this...

192
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,530
不过这个 这个是很烂的女士叫法
But that's, that's a poor lady scream.

193
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,130
他叫得好些了
He's a little better.

194
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,970
是不是有什么讨厌的超级大坏蛋的网站
Is there some kind of nerdy super-villain web site

195
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,970
让你弄来这些特斯拉感应圈和闪闪亮的表盘？
where you get Tesla coils and blinky dials?

196
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,700
实际上 这些东西大多是专营店弄来的 就在…
Actually, most of it comes from an outlet store in...

197
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,180
不许答这个问题
Don't answer that.

198
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,310
- 罗马尼亚  - 不许！别说！
- Romania.  - Don't! Stop!

199
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,710
她这是运用自己记者的追问技巧
She's using her nosy reporter skills

200
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,320
从你意志薄弱的小脑瓜里挖出我们所有的秘密
on your weak-willed mind to find out all our secrets.

201
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,390
这种小把戏对我没用的…
Such tricks won't work on me...

202
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,220
- 请慢点说  - 小妖精
- Please talk slower.  - temptress.

203
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,490
什么秘密啊？一眼就看穿你了
What secrets? You're so predictable.

204
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,660
你说我好看穿？你说我好看穿？
Predictable? Predictable?

205
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,430
噢 你管这样容易看穿？
Oh, you call this predictable?

206
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,340
你那些短吻鳄吗 没错
Your alligators. Yes.

207
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,200
没错 我这一路上就想着会这样了
Yeah, I was thinking about it on the way over.

208
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,750
那这样呢？砰！到你脸上
What's this? Boom! In your face.

209
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,940
- 老把戏  - 不！看 看好了
- Cliche.  - No! Look, watch.

210
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,010
- 幼稚  - 震撼吧
- Juvenile.  - Shock and awe.

211
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,590
- 俗  - 噢 明明很吓人啊！
- Tacky.  - Oh, it's so scary!

212
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,380
- 见过了  - 那这个呢？
- Seen it.  - What's this one do?

213
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,350
臭显摆
Garish.

214
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,520
- 好吧 蜘蛛有创意  - 蜘蛛？
- OK, the spider's new.  - Spider?

215
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,840
是的 蜘… 蜘蛛
Yes. The... the spee-ider.

216
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,340
即使被它碰一下
Even the smallest bite from Arachnis deathicus

217
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,000
也会马上瘫痪…
will instantly paralyze...

218
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,210
快弄掉！咬到我了！
Get it off! It bit me!

219
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,640
算了吧你 超级大坏蛋 你的阴谋就没得逞过
Give it up, Megamind. Your plans never work.

220
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,570
不要浪费时间了 让你那穿紧身衣的男朋友来救你吧
Let's stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights, shall we?

221
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,060
我很荣幸为大都会侠展示他的新博物馆
It is with great pleasure that I present to Metro Man his new museum.

222
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,560
请
If you please.

223
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,560
- 大都会侠！ - 嘿！你挡住我孩子了
- Metro Man!  - Hey! My kid can't see.

224
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,190
- 超级大坏蛋！ - 噢 好啊 大都会侠
- Megamind!  - Oh, bravo, Metro Man.

225
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,930
嘘！
Boo!

226
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,940
我也会 嘘！
Yes, I can play along too. Boo!

227
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,200
早该知道你会来捣乱的
Should've known you'd try to crash the party.

228
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,540
哦 我可不只想捣乱
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.

229
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,270
今天会是个让你和大都市永远铭记的日子
This is a day you and Metrocity shall not soon forget.

230
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,470
应该读大都会市
It's pronounced Metro City!

231
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,520
大同小异
Potato-tomato, potato-tomato.

232
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,050
大家都知道今天会是怎样一个结局: 那就是你进大牢
We all know how this ends: With you behind bars.

233
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,820
我好怕怕哦
I'm shaking in my custom baby seal leather boots.

234
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,560
你必须离开大都市 否则这将是你最后一次
You will leave Metrocity, or this will be the last

235
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,460
看到罗珊・罗奇
you ever hear of Roxanne Ritchi.

236
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,930
罗珊！别害怕 洛茜
Roxanne! Don't panic, Roxie.

237
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,940
- 我马上就来  - 是的 我不害怕
- I'm on my way.  - Yeah, I'm not panicking.

238
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,170
要阻止我 你得先找到我 大都会侠
In order to stop me, you need to find me first, Metro Man.

239
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,830
我们在废弃的天文台
We're at the abandoned observatory.

240
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,040
没有 我们不在那！
No, we're not!

241
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,240
别听她的 她疯了
Don't listen to her. She's crazy.

242
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,540
大都会侠来了 阁下
Metro Man approaching, sir.

243
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,750
等一下
Hold on a second.

244
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,790
哦 天哪！
Oh, good heavens!

245
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,870
你不知道你是在真正的天文台 是吗？
You didn't think you were in the real observatory, did you?

246
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,040
准备发射死亡之光 仆人
Ready the death ray, Minion.

247
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,010
死亡之光 正在准备
Death ray, readying.

248
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,410
这边 老朋友
Over here, old friend.

249
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:14,080
提醒你一下 你已经进入了我的圈套
In case you haven't noticed, you've fallen right into my trap.

250
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,230
你无法困住正义 它是一个想法 一种信念
You can't trap justice. It's an idea, a belief.

251
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,590
即使最忠诚的信仰也经不起时间的侵蚀
Even the most heartfelt belief can be corroded over time.

252
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,230
正义是一种永不锈蚀的金属
Justice is a non-corrosive metal.

253
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,890
但金属可以被扶仇之心熔化
But metals can be melted by the heat of revange.

254
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,970
应该读“复仇” 而它冰冷之时最有用
It's "revenge," and it's best served cold.

255
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,940
但很容易在邪恶的微波中变热
But it can be easily reheated in the microwave of evil.

256
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,100
我想你的微波过质保了
Well, I think your warranty is about to expire.

257
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,440
也许质保又延长了
Maybe I got an extended warranty.

258
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,240
如果你不合理使用产品 质保是无效的
Warranties are invalid if you don't use the product for its intended purpose.

259
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,510
噢 两位小女生 别斗嘴了 现在我可以回家了吗？
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty. Can I go home now?

260
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,090
当然 如果大都会侠可以经受全部的
Of course. That is, if Metro Man can withstand the full,

261
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,750
集中的太阳光炙烤！
concentrated power of the sun!

262
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,060
发射！
Fire!

263
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,460
奴才 发射啊？
Minion. Fire?

264
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,110
- 还在预热中 阁下  - 什么？
- It's still warming up, sir.  - Come again?

265
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,640
- 预热 阁下  - 预热？太阳还需要预热？
- Warming up, sir.  - Warming up? The sun is warming up?

266
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,940
还有一秒钟…
One second more and...

267
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,950
滴答 滴答 滴答
just tippy-tappy tippy-tap-tap, tip-top more,

268
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,320
- 马上…  - 不是吧！
- and we are ready in just...  - Honestly!

269
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,650
马上来救你 洛茜
On my way, Roxie.

270
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,920
我早告诉你把一切都准备好 说了多少次了
I told you to have things ready. I told you countless times.

271
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,960
你怎么总是责备我？
Why do you always blame me?

272
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,960
蜘蛛的毒性发作了
My spider bite is acting up.

273
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,400
你的阴谋破产了 接受现实吧
Your plan is failing. Just admit it.

274
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,970
是的 祝你好运吧
Yeah, good luck with that one.

275
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,500
你站哪一边的？
Whose side are you on?

276
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,500
- 失败的一边  - 谢谢
- The losing side.  - Thank you.

277
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,400
有人可以给我的绑票会员卡上盖个章吗？
Could someone stamp my Frequent Kidnapping Card?

278
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,710
所有人都知道 我们已经停止该促销活动了
You of all people know we discontinued that promotion.

279
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,820
- 大家再见了！ - 下周见？
- Ciao-ciao, all!  - Same time next week?

280
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,880
石灰！蟹块！
Dag! Crab nuggets!

281
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,650
- 他说什么了？ - “蟹块”？
- What did he just say?  - "Crab nuggets"?

282
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,080
海鲜薄饼！
Fackled fish cracker!

283
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,250
十秒钟后发射
Ten seconds to full power.

284
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,730
- 上帝啊 我出不去了  - 十…
- Good lord, I'm trapped.  - Ten...

285
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,730
- 怎么回事？ - 九…
- What kind of trickery is this?  - Nine...

286
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,600
- 你这个天才疯子  - 八…
- You mad genius.  - Eight...

287
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,500
- 你邪恶的天赋终见成效了  - 七…
- Your dark gift has finally paid off.  - Seven...

288
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,330
- 它… 它成了？ - 六…
- It... it has?  - Six...

289
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,270
显然这个屋顶铺上了铜片
This dome is obviously lined with copper.

290
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,740
- 是的？那又怎样？ - 主人…
- Yeah? So?  - Sir...

291
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,280
- 铜能摧毁我的能量  - 二…
- Copper drains my powers.  - Two...

292
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,850
- 你的弱点是铜？ - 一…
- Your weakness is copper?  - One.

293
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,450
- 你在开玩笑 是吧？ - 预热完毕
- You're kidding, right?  - Full power.

294
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,040
即使这个大英雄这回也难逃一死了
I don't think even he could survive that.

295
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,210
不要高兴太早
Well, let's not get our hopes up just yet.

296
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,880
- 看！ - 大都会侠！
- Look!  - Metro Man!

297
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,920
大都会侠
Metro Man.

298
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,490
大都会侠！
Metro Man!

299
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,740
- 你… 你成功了 主人  - 我成功了？
- You... You did it, sir.  - I did it?

300
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,810
他成功了
He did it.

301
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,110
- 我成功了？ - 他成功了
- I did it?  - He did it.

302
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,620
- 你成功了 主人  - 我成功了！
- You did it, sir.  - I did it!

303
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,780
- 你成功了！ - 我成功了！大都市归我了！
- You did it!  - I did it! Metrocity is mine!

304
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,830
- 你成功了 先生！ - 我成功了！是的 是我 是我！
- You did it, sir!  - I did it! Yeah, me, me!

305
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,360
- 是的 我成功了！ - 我俩！我俩成功了！
- Yes, I did it!  - Us! We both did it!

306
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,330
- 不是我俩！是我！ - 你的功劳
- Not us! I!  - You, a little more

307
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,230
- 比我大一点点 但是 讲点道理好吧！ - 我功劳比你大多了
- than me but still, come on!  - A lot more than you.

308
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,700
当他们颁奖时
When they're giving out the awards,

309
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,310
- 我会站在你身旁  - 什么奖？什么奖 为什么？
- I'm gonna be right there next to you.  - What awards? What awards, for what?

310
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,370
音乐！
Hit it!

311
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,060
把枪放下！
Drop 'em!

312
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,570
首先 来的人真多啊
First off, what a turnout.

313
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,730
太给力了！
How wild is this?

314
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:02,500
我只是把全宇宙最强大的人干掉了
All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe.

315
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,410
-  有人提问题吗？尽管提  - 这边！ - 那个站后面的
-  Are there any questions? Go on.  - Yes!  - You in the back.

316
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,540
我相信大家都想知道 你想把我们和这个城市怎么样
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan to do with us and this city.

317
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,360
问得好 很高兴你问这个问题
Good, I'm glad you asked that.

318
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,020
想象一下你能想到的
Imagine the most horrible, terrifying,

319
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,160
最可怕 恐怖 邪恶的事
evil thing you can possibly think of,

320
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,200
再乘以… 六！
and multiply it... by six!

321
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,840
同时
In the meantime,

322
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,240
我希望你们继续过着你们普通人
I want you to carry on with the dreary, normal things

323
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,930
无聊的日常生活
you normal people do.

324
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,240
大家玩得开心 高兴点
Let's just have fun with this. Come on.

325
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,880
回见
And I will get back to you.

326
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,790
用力关门
Now slam the door really hard.

327
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,980
他们… 他们还能看见你
They... they can still see you.

328
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,490
- 现在呢？ - 胳膊肘
- Now?  - Your elbow's still in.

329
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,030
好了
Good.

330
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,000
邪恶霸王先生驾到
There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord

331
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,730
哦 仆人 你想过这一天吗？
Oh, Minion, did you think this day would ever come?

332
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,070
绝对没有 一点都没有 主人
No way. Not at all, sir.

333
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,230
从没 从来没有… 我的意思是…
Never. Never in a million... I mean...

334
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,440
- 我想过  - 看着这精致的装饰
- Yes, I did.  - Look at the intricate mouldings.

335
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,480
看到了 看到了
I'm looking. I'm looking.

336
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,410
这是什么？
And what's this?

337
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,610
像我们小窝的超大显示器
It's like one of the giant monitors in the lair.

338
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
但貌似只播一个台
But it seems to only carry one station.

339
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,860
噢 那个 先生 叫窗户
Oh, that, sir, is called a window.

340
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,500
- 窗户？ - 所有孩子都喜欢透过它朝外看
- Window?  - All the kids are looking through them.

341
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,360
我从没见过这么好的视野
I've never had a view before.

342
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,830
大都市 仆人 都是我的了
Metrocity, Minion, it's all mine.

343
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,340
如果我的父母现在能看见我就好了
If my parents could see me now.

344
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:42,540
主人 我相信他们正从邪恶的天堂朝这微笑呢
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down from evil heaven.

345
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,110
现在假正经先生滚蛋了
And now that Mr. Goody Two-Shoes is out of the way,

346
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,810
我能拥有一切
I can have everything I want,

347
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,320
无人能挡！
and there's no one to stop me!

348
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,230
知道 知道
I know. I know.

349
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,170
口渴难耐 永不知足
Always thirsty, never satisfied.

350
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,340
你和我同命相连 漂亮的小鸟
I understand you, little well-dressed bird.

351
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,780
无为 空虚 整个就像在真空里 不是吗
Purposeless, emptiness. It's a vacuum, isn't it?

352
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,640
它是… 你的真空是怎样的？
It's... What's your vacuum like?

353
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,620
- 嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿！ - 现在不是时候 仆人
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!  - Not now, Minion.

354
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,890
我正在和这只瞎眼塑料玩具
I'm in a heated, existential discussion

355
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,690
激烈地探讨存在价值呢
with this dead-eyed, plastic desk toy.

356
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,440
出… 出什么问题了吗 主人？
Is... is something wrong, sir?

357
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,800
好好想想
Just think about it.

358
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,530
我们应有尽有
We have it all.

359
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,240
然而也一无所有
Yet, we have nothing.

360
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,740
一切都太轻松了
It's just too easy now.

361
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,610
对不起 我不明白 先生
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.

362
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,120
我意思是 我们成功了 对吗？
I mean, we did it, right?

363
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,550
你成功了 阁下
Well, you did it, sir.

364
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,220
是的 你很强调这一点
Yes, you've made that perfectly clear.

365
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,300
那为什么我觉得这么… 忧沉呢？
Then why do I feel so... mel-on-choly.

366
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,960
“忧沉”？
"Mel-on-choly"?

367
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,760
- 不开心  - 那好…
- Unhappy.  - Well...

368
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,530
那明天
What if tomorrow,

369
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,110
我们绑架罗珊・罗奇吧
we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.

370
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,210
这事总让你兴奋
That always seems to lift your spirits.

371
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,870
好主意 仆人 但他走了 意义何在？
Good idea, Minion. But without him, what's the point?

372
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,020
- “他” 先生？ - 没什么
- "Him," sir?  - Nothing.

373
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,750
好 那我们… 需要考虑一下…
OK, all right. We'll just... that's something to consider...

374
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,900
他曾经总守护在我们身边 那么值得信赖
He was always there for us. Dependable.

375
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,570
也许我们习以为常了 也许
Perhaps we took him for granted. You know, maybe,

376
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,940
直到他逝去了 我们才真正明白他的价值
we never really know how good we have it until it's gone.

377
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,010
我们想你 大都会侠 我想你
We miss you, Metro Man. I miss you.

378
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,610
我只有一个问题想问超级大坏蛋:现在你开心吗？
And I have just one question for Megamind: Are you happy now?

379
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,660
罗珊・罗奇来自一个失去英雄的城市的报道
This is Roxanne Ritchi, reporting from a city without a hero.

380
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,540
接下来 你准备好做奴隶了吗？你所需知道的一切
Coming up next, are you ready to be a slave army? What you need to know.

381
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,010
接着… 把那包起来 送给孩子当圣诞礼物
And... wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas,

382
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,980
- 因为我们做完了  - 好的 明天见 哈尔
- 'cause we're done.  - OK. See you tomorrow, Hal.

383
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,250
等等 洛茜 我家有个聚会
Wait. Roxie, I'm having a party at my house.

384
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,180
暂时忘却痛苦
It's gonna be, like, off the hook, or whatever.

385
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,020
希望你能参加 我找了个DJ
You should come over. I got a deejay,

386
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,060
租了个充气屋 备了美酒
rented a bouncy house, made a gallon of dip.

387
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,190
会很有意思的
It's gonna be sick.

388
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,950
噢 我… 我不知道 哈尔
Oh. I... I don't know, Hal.

389
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,150
我现在不想待在人多的地方
I don't really feel like being around a bunch of people.

390
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,320
不 不 不 最棒的正在此 聚会只有你和我两人
No, no, no, that's the best part. It'll just be like you and me.

391
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,130
哇 那… 那确实很吸引人 但是…
Wow. That... that's certainly very tempting, but...

392
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,710
我邀请了一名婚纱摄影师 只为万一我们
I did hire a wedding photographer. That's just in case we were like,

393
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,570
做了一些很疯狂的事 希望拍照留念
something crazy happened and we wanted a picture of it.

394
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,180
譬如 也许我们应该把这个 像回忆一样永久收藏  懂我意思吗？
Like, maybe we should have this for, like, ever. Like a memory, you know?

395
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,110
我还是不去了
I'm gonna pass.

396
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,950
而且我在这还有些工作要做
I have some work here that I need to do, anyway.

397
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,350
好吧 那星期四怎样？
Cool. So Thursday? Soft Thursday?

398
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,790
- 晚安 哈尔  - 那你算委婉地答应了
- Good night, Hal.  - That's a soft yes on Thursday.

399
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,690
我是不是有病啊？租了个充气屋？
What's wrong with me? Rented a bouncy house?

400
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,560
女生不喜欢充气屋
Chicks don't like bouncy houses.

401
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,320
他们喜欢小丑
They like clowns.

402
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,460
垃圾车！你伤了我的手指！
Stupid van! You broke my finger!

403
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,810
我犯了个可怕的错误
I've made a horrible mistake.

404
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,410
我本不想毁灭你的
I didn't mean to destroy you.

405
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,410
我的意思是 我想毁灭你
I mean, I meant to destroy you,

406
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,680
但我不认为我能做到
but I didn't think it would really work.

407
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,280
我们该怎么办？
What are we supposed to do?

408
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,120
没有你 邪恶肆无忌惮地横行于每个角落
Without you, evil is running rampant through the streets.

409
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,820
我已经厌倦了横行无忌
I'm so tired of running rampant through the streets.

410
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,920
当没有正义挺身而出的时候
What's the point of being bad

411
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,330
做坏人还有什么意思？
when there's no good to try and stop you?

412
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,230
得有人阻止超级大坏蛋
Someone has to stop Megamind.

413
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,030
- 嘿 我们马上关门了  - 你吓到我了
- Hey, we're closing soon.  - You scared me.

414
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,540
- 巴里 是吗？ - 伯纳德
- Barry, right?  - Bernard.

415
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,010
伯纳德 我只是… 好吧 我是在自言自语
Bernard. I was just... Well, I was talking to myself.

416
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,770
也许你会觉得我有点神经不正常
You probably think I'm a little bit nuts.

417
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,710
我不可以侮辱顾客
I'm not allowed to insult guests directly.

418
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,780
谢谢 只是… 伯纳德 我还要待几分钟
Thank you. Just... Bernard, I'll just be another minute.

419
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,550
好吧
OK.

420
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,740
谢谢
Thanks.

421
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,320
我准备了许多犯罪计划
I had so many evil plans in the works.

422
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,720
文盲光波
The illiteracy beam.

423
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,560
台风奶酪
Typhoon cheese.

424
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,390
机器羊
Robo-sheep.

425
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,330
我们已无法在这些战争中一决高下了
Battles we will now never have.

426
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,570
你知道的 我没能与你道别
You know, I never had the chance to say goodbye.

427
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,040
所以现在 在我摧毁这个地方之前
So it's good that we have this time now.

428
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,270
有这段时光真好
You know, before I destroy the place.

429
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,710
不是针对你 只是它唤起太多痛苦的记忆
Nothing personal, it just brings back too many painful memories.

430
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,980
有人吗？
Hello?

431
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,120
- 谁在那？ - 罗珊
- Hello?  - Roxanne.

432
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,400
- 这扮相太没品味了  - 扮相？
- That's a pretty tasteless costume.  - Costume?

433
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,330
超级大坏蛋的头没那么夸张
Megamind's head is not that grossly exaggerated.

434
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,640
你甚至做了他的脱水枪的山寨版 怎样…
And you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun. How...

435
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,410
嗨？谁在那？
Hello? Is someone there?

436
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,010
嗨？谁在那？
Hello? Who's there?

437
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,280
居然是你 伯纳德
It's just you, Bernard.

438
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,420
是的 当然是我 伯纳德
Yes. It's just me. Bernard.

439
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,460
嗯 多谢你让我待着
Well, thank you for letting me stay.

440
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,100
听着 如果我是你 两分三十七秒内我会离开这里
Look, I wouldn't stay here for more than two minutes and 37 seconds

441
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,860
我们要拆墙壁和天花板了
if I were you. We're having the walls and ceiling removed.

442
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,230
喔 听起来要搞大翻修
Wow, that sounds like quite the renovation.

443
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,030
那我要搭你的顺风车下去了
I guess I'll catch a ride down with you then.

444
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,440
我还在想 他能在最后关头逃出来
I kept thinking he was gonna do one of his last-minute escapes.

445
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,910
是啊 他相当擅长这些
Yeah. He was really good at those.

446
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,790
噢 如果这个世界有重置键就好了
Oh, if only the world had a reset button.

447
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,850
我研究过重置键
I've looked into the reset button.

448
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,720
科技无法办到
The science is impossible.

449
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,520
噢 伯纳德…
Oh, Bernard...

450
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,430
我不知道你有… 感触 你还好吗？
I didn't know you had... feelings. Are you OK?

451
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,940
大都会侠死了 那么现在没人可以挑战超级大坏蛋了
Metro Man's gone. And now there's no one left to challenge Megamind.

452
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,370
噢 拜托 伯纳德
Oh, come on, Bernard.

453
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,240
只要存在邪恶 正义就会奋起阻止它
As long as there's evil, good will rise up against it.

454
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,640
噢 希望如此
Oh, I wish.

455
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,510
我相信将会有人站出来制住超级大坏蛋的
I believe someone is gonna stand up to Megamind.

456
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,010
- 你真的这么想吗？ - 是的 我是说 就像他们说的那样
- You really think so?  - Yeah. I mean, it's like they say,

457
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,680
“英雄并非生来如此 他们可以制造出来”
"Heroes aren't born, they're made."

458
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,150
英雄可以制造出来 就是它！
Heroes can be made. That's it!

459
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,350
你要的只是正确的素材
All you need are the right ingredients.

460
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,460
- 是的 勇敢  - 是的
- Yeah. Bravery.  - Yes.

461
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,620
- 力量  - 必须的
- Strength.  - Of course.

462
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,990
- 果断  - 决绝！
- Determination.  - Imperative!

463
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,160
还要一点点DNA 噢 有了这些 谁都可以是英雄！
And a smidgen of DNA. Oh, with that, anyone can be a hero!

464
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,700
太棒了！
Yeah!

465
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,940
我们得赶紧离开！
I think we should run!

466
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,670
再见！
Bye!

467
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,610
我们该忘却过去了
Time to put the past behind us.

468
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,980
只有未来…
Only the future...

469
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,510
我靠太近了！这次我真的被吓到了
I'm too close! I'm genuinely scared right now.

470
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,650
希望没人看到这一幕！
I hope no one's seeing this!

471
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,480
创造一个英雄？等一下？你干嘛要这样做？
Create a hero? Wait, wait, what? Why would you do that?

472
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,490
这样就有人与我为敌了
So I have someone to fight.

473
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,150
仆人 我是个没有英雄对抗的坏蛋
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.

474
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,190
无阳之阴
A yin with no yang.

475
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,300
无牛可斗的斗牛士
A bullfighter with no bull to fight.

476
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,930
换句话说 我没有目标
In other words, I have no purpose.

477
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,230
现在 问我要怎么做 来吧 问我！
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it. Go on! Ask!

478
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,900
你要怎么做？
How are you gonna do it?

479
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,480
我要赋予某人… 我还不知道是谁…
I'm going to give someone... I don't know who yet...

480
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,140
大都会侠的能力
Metro Man's powers.

481
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,410
我要把这个人训练成大都市的新英雄
I'm going to train that someone to become Metrocity's new hero.

482
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,650
看这里！过来！
Over here! Follow!

483
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,320
最后 我将与这个英雄进行
And then finally, I'm going to fight that hero

484
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,190
一场史诗级的正邪之战
in an epic battle of good and evil.

485
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,060
到时候一切都将回到原点…
Which will put everything back the way it was...

486
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,530
世界将变得幸福美好
when the world was perfect and rosy.

487
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,100
看 仆人 大都会侠的披风
Behold, Minion, Metro Man's cape.

488
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,710
凑近点看 告诉我你看到了什么
Look closely. Tell me what you see.

489
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,600
- 头皮屑？ - 是的 这是他的DNA
- Dandruff?  - Yes. It's his DNA.

490
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,610
由此 我们可以提取出大都会侠超能力的基因
From this, we'll extract the source of Metro Man's awesome power.

491
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,610
老大 我觉得这主意很烂
Sir, I think this is a bad idea.

492
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:21,190
是的 制造更厉害的英雄 这主意真够邪恶 真够烂啊
Yes! This is a very wickedly bad idea for the greater good of man.

493
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,190
但是我说它很烂是…
But I'm saying this is a kind of bad that...

494
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,230
好吧 也许从你非正常的眼光来看 这主意不错
OK, you might think is good in your bad perception,

495
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,370
但从正常眼光来看… 它真的挺烂的
but from a good perception it... it's just plain bad.

496
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,060
噢 你不懂何为好 何为坏
Oh, you don't know what's good for bad.

497
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,410
现在 我们有且只有这一发
Now, we have just one shot at this.

498
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,980
我们必须找到合适的目标 拥有高贵的心灵和思想的人
We must find a suitable subject, someone of noble heart and mind.

499
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,200
[注 入]

500
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,700
能将他人利益置于个人利益之上的人
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.

501
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,440
究竟是什么在叫？
What on Earth is that?

502
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,060
像是从那儿发出来的 老大
It seems to be emanating from there, sir.

503
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,760
姨好
Ollo.

504
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,220
是“你好”啦
It's "Hello."

505
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,730
你好？这样说吗？
Hello? Like that?

506
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,230
- 伯纳德 我是罗珊  - 是罗珊
- Bernard, it's Roxanne.  - It's Roxanne.

507
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,390
我只是想跟你说声感谢 感谢你前些天给我打气
I just wanted to thank you for inspiring me the other day.

508
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,100
- 噢 你也鼓励了我  - 好的！
- Oh, you inspired me too.  - Great!

509
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,670
我们应该起来抵抗超级大坏蛋 告诉他不能任意摆布我们
It's time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can't push us around.

510
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,830
噢 真的吗？她太可爱了
Oh, really? She's so cute.

511
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,310
我已经追踪到他了
I'm already hot on his trail.

512
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,740
- 怎么说？ - 老大？
- And what gives you that idea?  - Sir?

513
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,610
我已经找到他的秘密藏身处了
I just found his secret hideout.

514
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,380
她是怎么找到我的藏身处的？！
How did she find my hideout?!

515
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,980
你是怎么找到他的藏身处的？
How did you find his hideout?

516
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,460
全大都会市只有这栋建筑的屋顶上有假观望台
This is the only building in Metro City with a fake observatory on the roof.

517
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,460
好吧 她绝不可能发现秘密入口
OK. There's no way she'll find the secret entrance.

518
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,660
这儿有个门垫写着“必密入口”！
There's a doormat here that says "Secrit Entrance"!

519
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,700
- 仆人！ - 我都忘了它在那里了
- Minion!  - I kept forgetting where it was.

520
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,500
她会发现我们所有秘密的！
She'll discover all our secrets!

521
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,370
- 噢 不！ - 你这个低智商的科学创造物！
- Oh, no!  - You dim-witted creation of science!

522
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,030
- 什么？ - 什么？噢 不 不是说你 罗珊
- What?  - What? Oh, no, not you, Roxanne.

523
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,680
不 我只是在对着… 我妈的骨灰盒吼
No, I was just yelling at my... mother's urn.

524
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,510
别乱动 我马上到
Don't do anything. I'll be right there.

525
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,140
罗珊呢？
Roxanne?

526
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,790
噢 不 又来！
Oh no, not again!

527
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,390
罗珊吗？
Roxanne?

528
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,330
很高兴你来了 等等 你怎么来得这么快？
I'm glad you're here. Wait, how did you get here so fast?

529
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,130
呃 你打来电话时 我… 我刚好竞走经过这里
Well, I... I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called.

530
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,400
穿着西装？
In a suit?

531
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,130
这是所谓的… 正装竞走 但这不重要
It's called... formal speed walking, but that's not important.

532
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,440
我在前面开路吧 这条路看起来很刺激
I better take the lead. This way looks exciting.

533
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,940
不 上面写着“出口”
No, it says "Exit."

534
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,810
“寻刺激之口”的缩写不正是它吗？
Which is the abbreviation for "exciting," right?

535
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,250
这才是金矿！
This is the mother lode!

536
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,180
- 哇 快看呐  - 哇
- Wow. Just look at this thing.  - Wow.

537
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,880
你知道吗 有你帮忙我可以破译所有这些东西
You know, I really could use your help in deciphering all this.

538
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,420
- 是吗？ - 你是个专家
- Really?  - You're an expert

539
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,060
- 超级大坏蛋的所有事 你都在行 对吗？ - 是的 没错
- on all things Megamind, right?  - Yes. Right.

540
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,960
我们一起 可以识破他关于这座城市的诡计 及时阻止他
Together, we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it.

541
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,820
- 你加入吗？ - 噢 很有意思！
- Are you in?  - Oh, what fun!

542
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,060
我就是想听这句话
That's what I want to hear.

543
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,330
仆人 指令: 让中央机器人们进来
Minion, Code: Send In The Brain-bots.

544
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,530
你知道 呼叫的意义在于…
You know, the whole point of a code is...

545
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,700
噢 指令: 照做就是了 仆人
Oh, Code: Just Do lt, Minion.

546
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,310
闯入者！闯入者！闯入者！
Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!

547
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,840
- 是我 你们这些笨蛋！ - 伯纳德！
- It's me, you fools!  - Bernard!

548
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,480
是老爸我！
It's Daddy!

549
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,350
超级大坏蛋
Megamind.

550
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,050
- 你对伯纳德做了什么？ - 噢 伯纳德？噢 是的
- What have you done with Bernard?  - Oh, Bernard? Oh, yes.

551
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,280
我正对他做很可怕的事情
I'm doing horrible things to that man.

552
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,930
例如激光啊 钉刺神马的 希望我别上迷了
I don't want to get into it, but lasers, spikes.

553
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,330
不 求你了！不！别用激光 别用钉刺！
No, please! No! Not the lasers and the spikes!

554
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,700
- 你知道钻孔机的  - 噢 不！别用钻孔机！
- You know the drill.  - Oh, no! Not the drill!

555
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,270
- 放开他 要不然…  - 不然怎样？
- Let him go or...  - Or what?

556
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,530
不然我就试试这把怪枪有什么用
Or I'm gonna find out what this weird-looking gun does.

557
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,970
不 别开枪！别开枪！
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot that gun!

558
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,580
我马上去救他
I'll just go get him.

559
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,210
- 放开我 你这个魔鬼！ - 决不！
- Unhand me, you fiend!  - Never!

560
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,580
他的力量太强了！
His strength's too much!

561
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,120
噢 我经常锻炼身体！
Oh, I work out!

562
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,950
呃 很有效啊！你太有力了
Well, it's really paying off! You're so fit,

563
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,220
天赐神力啊
and strangely charismatic.

564
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,990
你还好吗？
Are you OK?

565
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,000
我尽力了 但是他太强大了
I did my best, but he's too fantastic.

566
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,220
给我 我帮你拿这把沉重的枪
Here. Let me carry that heavy gun for you.

567
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,830
我来掩护
I got us covered.

568
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,100
- 放手 这是我的！ - 伯纳德 快跑！
- Let go. It's mine!  - Bernard, run!

569
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,470
罗珊你在哪？
Roxanne?

570
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,440
- 你会弄坏它的！ - 把它给我！
- You're going to break it!  - Give it to me!

571
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,270
噢 不！
Oh, no!

572
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,510
罗珊是你吗？！
Roxanne?!

573
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,990
这到底是谁？
Who on Earth is that?

574
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,140
- 救命！ - 罗珊！
- Help!  - Roxanne!

575
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,710
伯纳德！你说对了 那扇门很刺激
Bernard! You were right about that door being exciting.

576
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,270
- 闯入者！闯入者！ - 这边走
- Intruder! Intruder!  - This way.

577
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,900
闯入者！闯入者！闯入者！
Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!

578
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,150
你要干什么？
What are you doing?

579
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,150
这能拦住他们 给！
This'll stop them. Here!

580
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,120
有点过份了 不是吗？
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?

581
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,720
- 扔出去就行了！ - 老爸对不起你们
- Just throw it!  - Daddy's sorry.

582
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,200
- 喔 这相当刺激  - 是啊
- Wow. That was really exciting.  - Yeah.

583
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,970
- 你在里面很勇敢  - 我知道
- You were very strong in there.  - I know.

584
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,970
我从没见过谁能这么对付他 除了大都会侠
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that.

585
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,200
- 发生什么事了？ - 哈尔 怎么了？
- What's going on?  - Hal, what happened?

586
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,140
我觉得有只蜜蜂飞进了我的鼻子
I think a bee flew up my nose.

587
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,940
我正想发动正面攻势来解救你
I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you,

588
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,810
但是大约有五十个忍者袭击了我 所以我不得不痛扁他们
but like 50 ninjas tried to attack me, so I had to beat 'em all up,

589
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,890
而且我 我让… 他们全部哭爹喊娘
and I did, and I... They were all, like, crying and stuff...

590
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,220
- 喔 勇敢的人 不是吗？ - 你是谁？
- Wow, a brave one, isn't he?  - Who are you?

591
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,520
噢 这… 这是伯纳德 他是我的搭档
Oh, thi... this is Bernard. He's my partner.

592
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,060
- 搭档？ - 是的 是的 搭档
- Partner?  - Yes. Yes. Partner.

593
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,330
噢 听着 “搭档” 我是她的搭档 她不知道她在说什么
Well, look, "partner," I'm her partner. She doesn't know what she's saying.

594
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,830
她刚从一次痛苦经历中走出来
She's been through a traumatic experience.

595
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,440
我得送他回家 再次感谢 伯纳德
I'd better take him home. Thanks again, Bernard.

596
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,680
我明天给你打电话 拍档
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.

597
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,180
好 好的 我很荣幸
Yeah, OK. I'd like that.

598
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,980
这对大家来说很怪
That was weird for everybody,

599
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,180
因为你突然拥抱了他 而不是我
'cause you accidentally hugged him instead of me.

600
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,590
老大？老大！
Sir? Sir!

601
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,160
指令: 你弄清他是谁了吗？
Code: Did You Find Out Who It Was?

602
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,920
指令: 把车开来
Code: Get The Car.

603
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,260
收到指令: 马上来 老大
Code: Right Away, Sir.

604
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,500
- 拜拜！ - 明天见 哈尔
- Bye-bye!  - See you tomorrow, Hal.

605
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,080
我会把门开着 以便你等会儿来探望我
I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later.

606
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,310
这个被我们灌输了神力的人是谁呢？
Who is this man we've infused with godlike power?

607
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,060
呃 老大 他叫哈尔・斯图尔特 二十八岁
Well, sir, his name's Hal Stewart. He's 28 years old.

608
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,490
无不良记录 准确的说 根本没有资料
No criminal record. Actually no records at all.

609
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,220
显然这个人一事无成
Apparently this man hasn't accomplished anything.

610
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,200
暂时没有 仆人 暂时… 没有
Not yet, Minion. Not... yet.

611
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,170
今天还能更糟点么？
Could this day get anymore fun-tastic?

612
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:46,330
这样 在错误扩大之前 我去把他的能量抽出来
So, I will just go ahead and diffuse him since this is clearly a mistake.

613
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,480
不 仆人！现在发生的事无比神奇
No, Minion! There's something much more powerful at work here.

614
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:53,180
这不是错误 这是命中注定
This is no mistake. It's destiny.

615
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,810
哈尔・斯图尔特！准备好接受你的命运吧！
Hal Shtewart! Prepare for your destiny!

616
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,320
哈尔？哈尔・斯图尔特呢？
Hal? Hal Shtewart?

617
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,260
- 嘿！在床里！ - 我这样说对吗？
- Hey! In the bed!  - Am I saying it right?

618
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,760
是“斯图尔特”啦
"Stewart."

619
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,690
是抢劫吗？
Is this a robbery?

620
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,260
走廊另一边那个太太比我有钱多了
'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me.

621
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,560
噢 看呐 这是哈尔・斯图尔特 快 喷雾
Oh, look, it's Hal Stewart. Quick, the spray.

622
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,060
用光了
All out.

623
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,430
- 噢 用“忘了我”棍子  - 噢 对哦
- Well, use the Forget-Me Stick.  - Oh, right.

624
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,740
好好看看他
Just look at him.

625
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:26,380
不 依我看 他没有个英雄样
No, he doesn't look quite the hero-type to me.

626
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,280
噢 你可真够让人讨厌的
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.

627
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,450
东西好坏不在材料
A potter couldn't ask for finer clay.

628
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,980
我闻到了英雄的味道
I smell a hero.

629
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,520
我闻到东西烧着的味道
I smell something burning.

630
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,720
我想它起作用了 就位！就位！
I think it's working. Places! Places!

631
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,020
就位！就位！快就位
Places! Places! Places.

632
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,530
你的变装呢？
Do you have your disguise?

633
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,500
怎么了？
What?

634
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,310
哦 你看起来很棒
Oh, you look fantastic.

635
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,690
觉醒吧 我的荣耀之作
Rise my glorious creation.

636
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,650
觉醒吧 来爸爸这
Rise, and come to Papa.

637
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,020
- 这是怎么了？ - 放轻松 孩子
- What's going on?  - Easy my child.

638
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,420
- 你是谁？ - 我为了教你正义 荣誉
- Who are you?  - I sent you to this planet

639
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,500
和高尚的品德 而将你送到这个星球
to teach you about justice, honor, and nobility.

640
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,800
我是你的父亲
I am your father.

641
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,930
那你就算是我的太空爸爸？
So you're like my space dad?

642
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,830
对 我就算是你的太空爸爸了
Yeah, I'm like your space dad.

643
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,110
那你又是什么？
And you are what?

644
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,000
我是你的太空后妈
I'm your space stepmom.

645
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,080
我最近做了点美容
I've had some work done recently.

646
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,050
这是在做梦吗？
Is this some kind of dream?

647
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,280
这是梦想成真
This is a dream come true.

648
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,620
你已被赐予深不可测的力量
You've been blessed with unfathomable power.

649
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,690
- 什么样的力量？ - 深不可测
- What kind of power?  - Unfathomable.

650
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,190
就是深… 没有深度的
It's unf... without fathom.

651
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,590
是的 我们是来引导你
Yeah. We've come to guide you

652
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:54,460
成为大都市的新英雄
on your path to be Metrocity's new hero

653
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,800
并与超级大坏蛋的超级才智搏斗
and battle the super-genius of Megamind.

654
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,100
我知道这一时有点难以接受
I know this is a lot to take in.

655
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,370
你可能需要花几个月才能接受
It may take months for you to come to grips.

656
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,310
不可能吧！
No freaking way!

657
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,320
我还没说完呢
I wasn't finished.

658
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,560
我要当英雄了！
I'm gonna be a hero!

659
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,350
我要当英雄了！
I'm gonna be a hero!

660
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,360
看吧 仆人 他太合适了！
See, Minion, he's perfect!

661
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,990
预备… 开始！
And... action!

662
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,830
- 来人啊 救救我！ - 我没事！
- Someone help me!  - I'm OK!

663
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,700
你… 大坏蛋！
You... Bad!

664
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,440
我的邪恶之火正熊熊燃烧
The flames of my evil burn bright.

665
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,180
现在换你对我说点狠话
Now you say something cool back at me.

666
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,350
看呐 一点都不疼 甚至都没感觉
Look. It doesn't even hurt. Don't even feel it.

667
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,190
不 不 不 不 不 肚子朝下 手抬起来 像大都会侠那样
No, no, no, no, no. Stomach down, hands up. Like Metro Man.

668
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,230
- 喔啊！等等！ - 小心
- Whoa! Wait!  - Watch out.

669
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,830
他简直无可救药！无可救药！
He's hopeless. Hopeless!

670
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,560
- 或许我们应该换个策略  - 你真这么想？
- Maybe we should change tactics.  - You think so?

671
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,300
哦 你应该了解男孩们
Oh, you know how boys are.

672
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,810
他们喜欢玩电子游戏
They love video games.

673
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,540
- 我可以把几个零件组装一下  - 等不及了
- I could throw a few parts together.  - Can't wait.

674
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,550
大笑吧 再来个笑脸
LOL. Smiley face.

675
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,010
等不及要干什么 老大？
Can't wait for what, sir?

676
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,150
那故事太好笑了
That was such a funny story.

677
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,020
还有 讲得也很精彩
And brilliantly told, by the way.

678
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,710
好吧 现在换你讲
OK, now you tell one.

679
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,360
伯纳德 我从来不知道你这么风趣
Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.

680
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,960
而我也从来没听到你这样大笑
And I never heard you laugh before.

681
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,260
嗯 很久没大笑过了 感觉很好
Yeah, it's been a while. Feels pretty good.

682
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,840
开始
And action.

683
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,240
搞定！
Gotcha!

684
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,240
- 你不经常出门吧？ - 哦 真好玩！
- You don't get out much, do you?  - Oh, what fun!

685
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,550
我小时候常常和妈妈来这里
I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid.

686
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,390
这是我最喜欢做的事情之一
It was one of my favorite things to do.

687
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,820
现在再看这 就是个垃圾场
Now look at it. It's a dump.

688
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,640
头 我们为什么要打扫城市？
Why are we cleaning up the city, sir?

689
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,280
嗯 我们也不想在垃圾场 和我们的新英雄开战吧？
Well, we don't want to battle our new hero in a dump now, do we?

690
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,350
它们全变回原样了 但这是怎么回事？为什么会这样？
They're all back. But how? Why?

691
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,880
也许超级大坏蛋并不是那么坏吧
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.

692
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,450
就是这样
That's it.

693
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,030
自由飞翔吧 我漂亮的小鸽子！
Be free, my beautiful dove!

694
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,930
好吧 好吧
OK, OK.

695
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,370
大都会侠跟我 从来就不是一对
Metro Man and I were never a couple.

696
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,630
- 但我以为你们俩…  - 我知道 大家都以为
- But I thought you two were...  - I know. Everybody did.

697
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,470
只是… 其实他不是我喜欢的类型
It's just... Well, he was never really my type.

698
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,940
真的？
Really?

699
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,140
好了 现在换你跟我说了
OK, now you tell me something.

700
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,040
说你从没跟别人说过的事
Something you've never told anyone.

701
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,320
嗯 在鞋… 学校…
Well, in sh... school...

702
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:02,220
其他孩子都不喜欢我
none of the other kids really liked me.

703
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,650
无论什么事 我都是落单的那个
I was always the last one picked for everything.

704
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,070
如果我们上的是同一所学校就好了
It's too bad that we didn't go to the same school.

705
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:18,300
哈尔 我认为你已经准备好了
Hal, I think you're ready for this.

706
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,410
- 给我儿子的？ - 不是
- Do I have a son?  - No.

707
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,210
你真会搞笑
You make me laugh.

708
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,350
这是有弹性的 是给你的
It stretches. It's for you.

709
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,140
嘿 T代表什么啊？
Hey, what's the T stand for?

710
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,650
太阳神(英文由T开头)
Titan.

711
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,760
“太阳神”？那是什么意思？
"Titan"? What's that supposed to mean?

712
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:36,450
是我唯一能想到的贯耳之名
It was the only name I could trademark.

713
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,500
哈尔 你生命中有比较特殊的人吗？
Do you have someone special in your life, Hal?

714
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:45,700
没 还没有 不过… 有个真的 真的很漂亮的女孩
No, not yet. But... there's this really, really good-looking one

715
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,960
我最近一直在关注她
I've got my eye on currently.

716
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,480
那很好啊
That's very good.

717
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,940
- 浪漫爱情是很鼓舞人的  - 我听说也是
- Romance is very inspiring.  - That's what I hear.

718
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,980
你只需救她一次 她就是你的了
All you have to do is save her and she'll be yours.

719
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,750
- 谁想要西班牙油条？ - 我要！
- Who wants churros?  - I do!

720
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,020
- 我要 嗯 谢谢 太空后妈  - 发油条啦
- I do, yeah. Thanks, Space Stepmom.  - Churros all the way around.

721
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,790
我数到三 拔出你们的油条
On the count of three, unsheathe your churro.

722
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,550
一 二 三！
One, two, three!

723
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:13,860
致太阳神！
To Titan!

724
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:19,200
明天 你将迎战超级大坏蛋 整个城市将铭记住你的名字
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind, and the city will know your name.

725
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,860
城市的公园恢复了往日的美丽
The city's parks restored to their original glory,

726
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,910
街道从未如此安全 银行重新开业
the streets the safest they've been, the banks reopened.

727
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,010
莫非超级大坏蛋出了什么事？
Has something happened to Megamind?

728
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,880
难道有人驯服了这头怪兽？
Has someone tamed this monster?

729
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:36,210
持审慎乐观态度 且处于愉悦的困扰中的
This is Roxanne Ritchi, cautiously optimistic,

730
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,410
罗珊・罗奇报道
and pleasantly confused.

731
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,580
嗯 你今晚貌似心情不错啊 老大
Well, you seem in a very good mood tonight, sir.

732
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:44,420
噢 对啊 这要花多久 仆人？
Oh, yes. How long is this going to take, Minion?

733
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:46,490
只要再改几处 老大 我马上将做好
Just a few alterations, sir, and I will be done

734
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,790
您有史以来最令人恐惧的披风！
with your most terrifying cape yet!

735
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,330
我要给它取名为…
I'm calling it...

736
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,690
黑暗眼镜蛇…
the Black Mamba...

737
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,500
黑暗眼镜蛇 很好
Black Mamba. Perfect.

738
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,410
天 我要迟到了 我得走了
Gosh, I am running late. I have to go.

739
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,640
什么？你… 你要去哪 老大？
What? Where... where are you going, sir?

740
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:04,080
明早 我们还要跟太阳神进行首次战斗
We have our debut battle with Titan tomorrow morning.

741
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,220
我们还没测试你的大战斗套装呢
We haven't even tested your big battle suit yet.

742
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,290
那些小问题你处理就好 仆人 我得… 赶快去帮人跑趟腿
You attend to the details, Minion. I have to... run a quick errand.

743
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,710
你从不干跑腿这事的
You don't run errands.

744
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,190
- 今个是怎么了？ - 什么？
- What's going on here?  - What?

745
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,590
哦 等等
Oh, wait a minute.

746
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:20,290
你是不是喷了让・保罗・戈尔捷的男士香水？
Are you wearing Jean Paul Gaultier's Pour Homme?

747
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,830
只不过是我的天然麝香 车钥匙呢？
It's just my natural musk. Now, where are the car keys?

748
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,390
这事跟荔枝小姐有关 对吧？
This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it?

749
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:30,000
你要跟她约会
You're going on a date with her.

750
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,700
不 我的核心助手 别瞎想了
No, my main man. Get out of town.

751
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,540
哦 坏了 这下可不好 你已经爱上她了
Oh, this is bad. This is bad. You've fallen in love with her.

752
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,080
你忘了你的身份 仆人 给我钥匙
You are forgetting your place, Minion. Now give me the keys.

753
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,250
如果罗珊发现你的真实身份怎么办？
What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are?

754
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,880
她不会发现的 这是骗人的重点
She will never find out. That's the point of lying.

755
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,520
说实话 如果我不了解你
Honestly, if I didn't know any better,

756
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,630
我会以为你是头一天当坏人
I'd think this was your first day of being evil.

757
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,200
不行！
No!

758
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,630
这事就到此为止了
This has gone far enough!

759
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,800
哦 这么做还真是成熟！
Oh, that was really grown-up!

760
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,040
老大 老大 求你了 这是为你自己好
Sir, sir, please. It's for your own good.

761
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,640
哦 你知道什么啊？
Oh, what do you know?

762
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,040
我知道的可能不多 但有点我很确定:
I may not know much, but I do know this:

763
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,950
坏人得不到女主角
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.

764
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,920
也许我不想再当坏人了
Maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

765
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,090
你听到我说了！
You heard me!

766
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,990
你是谁？
Who are you?

767
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,030
- 现在 给我钥匙！ - 不！
- Now, give me the keys!  - No!

768
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,700
我活着的唯一目的就是照顾好你
My sole purpose in life is to look after you.

769
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,860
嗯 我不需要你照顾我
Well, I don't need you to look after me.

770
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,300
你在说… 你在说什么？你不需要我？
What are you s... what are you saying? You don't need me?

771
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,040
我说明白吧 指令: 我不需要你
Let me make it clear. Code: I Don't Need You.

772
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,040
你知道吗？你知道吗？
You know what? You know what?

773
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,080
收到指令: 那我就收拾东西走人！
Code: I'll Just Pack My Thing And Go!

774
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,050
- 指令：随你！ - 收到指令：也随你！
- Code: Fine!  - Code: Fine Back!

775
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,150
- 哼 祝你约会好运！ - 我会的！
- Well, good luck on your date!  - I will!

776
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:01,020
- 那话不作数！ - 我就知道！
- That doesn't even make any sense!  - I know!

777
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,390
我知道就差一点了 我能感觉到
I know I am so close. I can feel it.

778
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,670
好吧 好吧 我只需要后退一步
OK, OK. I just have to take a step back.

779
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,000
等等
Wait a minute.

780
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,580
“太阳神”
"Titan."

781
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,890
- 太阳神是什么？- 我的超级耳朵在燃烧
- What's a Titan?  - My super-ears are burning.

782
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:13,130
我通常只听到罪犯的声音 你最近没捣蛋吧？
I usually just hear criminals. You haven't been naughty, have you?

783
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,230
我跟你闹着玩呢 我跟你闹着玩呢
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing with you.

784
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,070
- 我叫太阳神  - 太阳神
- The name's Titan.  - Titan.

785
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,730
是你的绝对酷毙了的个人英雄卫士
Your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome.

786
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,110
你叫什么名字？开玩笑的 我了解你的一切
What's your name? Just kidding. I know everything about you.

787
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,910
还有我… 我带了些花来
And I... And I brought some flowers.

788
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,580
不知道你喜欢什么 所以就 全拿来了
Didn't know what you liked, so I just grabbed, you know, all of them.

789
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,790
好吧 你不喜欢花？那好 别管花了
OK. You don't like flowers? OK, forget the flowers.

790
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,050
你想干什么？
What do you want?

791
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,560
觉得咱俩也许可以来点环城小飞行
Thought maybe we could go for a little flight around town.

792
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,220
互相了解一下
Get to know each other first.

793
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:42,830
你肯定很兴奋吧
This must be very thrilling for you.

794
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,330
你以为你在干什么啊？！
What do you think you're doing?!

795
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,770
哦 我进度太快了？你说的可能没错
Oh, am I moving too fast? You're probably right.

796
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,670
我应该先救你几次 然后再搞浪漫
I should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic.

797
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:52,670
救了你啦
Saved ya.

798
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,710
有我这么个大英雄在 你真幸运
You are lucky to have such a great hero here.

799
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:57,740
- 你敢再…  - 哦 不！来人帮帮忙啊！
- Don't you ever...  - Oh, no! Somebody do something!

800
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,850
哦 对了 对了 笨呐 我来了 我来了
Oh, right, right, duh. I gotcha. I gotcha.

801
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,260
刚才够惊险的 你差点就死了
That was a close one. You almost died,

802
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,090
- 但我救了你  - 有楼！
- but I saved you.  - Building!

803
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,160
接住啦！对不起 你刚才说什么？
Gotcha! I'm sorry. What were you saying?

804
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,200
我救你的声音太大 没听到你说什么
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life.

805
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,930
放我下来！快点！
Put me down! Right now!

806
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:25,560
好吧 好吧 等一下
OK, all right. All right, hold on.

807
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,640
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

808
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,980
我大概有点 有点 为你疯狂
I suppose I'm a, I'm a little crazy, about you.

809
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,410
你到底是谁啊？
Who are you, really?

810
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:40,020
哦 对了 好 准备大吃一惊吧 小淑女
Oh, right. Well, prepare to have your mind blown, little lady.

811
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,680
- 哒哒  - 哈尔？
- Ta-da.  - Hal?

812
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,660
对 是不是很棒？现在没什么能把我们分开了
Yeah. Isn't this great? Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

813
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:51,130
- 不 一点都不棒  - 哇哦 第一次吵架
- No. It's not great.  - Wow. Our first fight.

814
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,990
太像一对了 咱们就跟老夫老妻一样
This is so us. We're like an old married couple.

815
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,140
听着 没有“咱们”好吗？永远也不会有“咱们”
Look, there is no "us," OK? There will never be an "us."

816
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,130
但是… 我有超能力了
But... I have powers.

817
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,170
我还有披风 我是好人
I have a cape. I'm the good guy.

818
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,810
你是好人 哈尔 但你不明白
You are a good guy, Hal, but you don't understand.

819
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,850
- 我们得搞清楚为什么…  - 不 不 这…
- We need to find out why...  - No, no. This...

820
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,610
- 哈尔 深呼吸  - 这样不对！
- Hal, just take a deep breath  - This isn't right!

821
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,550
- 先听我说句话  - 你应该跟我在一起！
- And listen to me for a moment.  - You're supposed to be with me!

822
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,020
我只是想警告你 哈尔
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.

823
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:16,680
是太阳神 是太阳神 不是哈尔！
It's Titan! It's Titan, not Hal!

824
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,180
- 伯纳德  - 罗珊 来了啊
- Bernard.  - Roxanne.

825
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:45,650
- 抱歉我迟到了 - 哇哦 你的发型看起来很刺激
- Sorry I'm late.  - Wow, your hair looks exciting.

826
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,720
这可不是今晚唯一的刺激
Not the only exciting development of the night.

827
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,450
超级大坏蛋创造了一个新英雄 我知道为什么
Megamind's created a new hero, and I know why.

828
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,000
现在都说得通了 他怀念有人扁他的日子
It all makes sense now. He missed getting his butt kicked,

829
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,460
于是他创造了一个新英雄
so he created a new hero

830
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,300
- 来帮他扁自己  - 对
- to kick it for him.  - Yeah.

831
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,870
但他为什么要挑哈尔呢？
But why would he pick Hal?

832
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,370
挑谁也比挑哈尔好啊
Hal is the worst possible person you could pick.

833
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,870
哇哦 我有点不懂了
Wow. That's a lot to take in.

834
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,840
这事把我搞糊涂了
It boggles my mind.

835
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,210
我也很糊涂 不过 我相信我们会弄明白
I am extremely boggled. You know, I'm sure we'll get

836
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,150
到底谁要扁谁
to the bottom of who's kicking whose butt.

837
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,950
不过同时 咱们也享受一下彼此的陪伴吧
But in the meantime, let's enjoy each other's company.

838
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,790
对不起 伯纳德 当然 你说得没错
I'm sorry, Bernard, of course, you're right.

839
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,620
你知道 我说得太多了
You know, I could use a breather.

840
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,090
敬伯纳德
To Bernard,

841
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:31,560
在我极度混乱的世界中 他是唯一正常的人
for being the only normal thing in my crazy, upside-down world.

842
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:35,000
敬… 正常的人
To... being normal.

843
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,150
- 罗珊？ - 嗯？
- Roxanne?  - Yes?

844
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:51,010
假如说 我不是那么正常
Say I wasn't so normal.

845
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,820
比如说 我是秃顶 而且肤色是
Let's say I was bald and had the complexion of,

846
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:59,930
三原色中很流行的那种 我随便说说 没有特指谁
of a popular primary color, as a random, nonspecific example.

847
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,730
- 你还会喜欢和我在一起吗？ - 当然！
- Would you still enjoy my company?  - Of course!

848
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:07,800
人不可貌相 海水不可斗量
You don't judge a book by its cover or a person from the outside.

849
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,160
听你这么说 我就放心了
That's a relief to hear.

850
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,200
评论一个人 要看他的行动
You judge them based on their actions.

851
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,000
呃 那也很片面啊 不是吗？
Well, that seems kind of petty, don't you think?

852
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,770
怎么了？怎么了？
What? What?

853
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,700
别看我！只是技术故障！
Don't look at me! Just a technical glitch!

854
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,140
先别看！好了 没事了
Don't look yet! Well, never mind that.

855
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:55,670
好了
OK.

856
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,350
我们说到哪儿了？
Where were we?

857
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,550
- 你…  - 等等 等等
- You...  - Now, now, hold on.

858
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,190
原来是你！
You!

859
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,940
请让我解释！
I can explain!

860
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,290
你刚刚说的话 都不算数吗？
What about everything you just said?

861
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,480
不能以貌取人的啊？
About judging a book by its cover?

862
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,560
对 我们就得看本质 不是吗？
Well, let's take a look at the contents then, shall we?

863
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:38,850
你毁了大都会侠 霸占了这座城市
You destroyed Metro Man, you took over the city,

864
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,790
现在 你骗得了我的关心！
and then, you actually got me to care about you!

865
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:47,630
你怎么这样坏？竟然耍我？
Why are you so evil? Tricking me?

866
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,810
你究竟想得到什么啊？
What could you possibly hope to gain?

867
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:59,910
等等 我不信
Wait a minute. I don't believe this.

868
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,820
你真的以为 我会和你在一起吗？
Do you really think that I would ever be with you?

869
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:10,890
不是
No.

870
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:46,520
好吧 仆人！你说得没错！
OK, Minion! You were right!

871
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,630
是我… 是我错了！
I was... less right!

872
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,530
我们应该继续干我们所擅长的… 使坏
We should stick to what we're good at... being bad.

873
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,740
仆人 在吗？

874
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
[正义与邪恶]

875
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,020
你 去那儿！
You there!

876
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,020
对 就是你
Yeah, you.

877
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,060
把黑色眼镜蛇披风拿来
Bring out the Black Mamba.

878
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,760
好了 太阳神 等着被我打败吧
OK, Titan. It's time to go down in style.

879
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:26,460
听说又有新的英雄 想挑战我的邪恶啊
I hear there's a new hero who dares challenge my evil.

880
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:29,290
那个叫太阳神的呢？
Where is the one they call Titan?

881
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:36,130
有种你就来啊！
Challenge me if you dare!

882
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,490
噢 不 要撞坏了！
Oh no. We're gonna crash!

883
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:06,030
真是尴尬啊
This is embarrassing.

884
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,870
真是太不体谅人 愚蠢…
Of all the inconsiderate, bone-headed...

885
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,980
不负责任 野蛮…
irresponsible, rude...

886
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,640
不专业 就是这样！
unprofessional, that's what this is!

887
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,050
大都会侠会让我久等吗？
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?

888
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,220
当然不会！他可是超专业的！
Of course not! He was a pro!

889
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:31,330
嘿 超级大坏蛋！我正要去找你呢
Hey, Megamind! You're actually the guy I want to see.

890
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:32,860
还有 我这里有门的
Also, there's a door here.

891
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:36,800
你知道我等你等了多久吗？
Do you have any idea how long I waited for you?

892
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:38,330
不 不 不 我完全明白你在说什么
No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying.

893
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,800
你能先闭嘴吗 等我打通了这关再说
Could you just, just shut up for one second. I'm trying to beat this level.

894
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,340
你到底有没有想过出来和我挑战啊？
Were you even planning on showing up?

895
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,640
这是什么？
What's this?

896
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:49,600
你从哪儿弄的？
Where did you get all this stuff?

897
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,370
不是我的
It doesn't belong to me.

898
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,450
- 偷来的？ - 很酷 是吧？
- You stole it?  - Pretty cool, right?

899
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,980
- 不 不 不 不！你可是个英雄啊！ - 做英雄是失败者的游戏！
- No, no, no, no! You're a hero!  - Being a hero is for losers!

900
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:00,020
英雄总是不停地工作 一周无休的 为的是什么啊？
It's work, work, work, 24/7, and for what?

901
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,320
我本来想跟她约会 表白的
I only took the gig to get the girl,

902
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,820
但罗珊却不想和我有任何瓜葛
and it turns out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.

903
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,720
- 你是说罗珊・罗奇？ - 没错！罗珊・罗奇！
- Roxanne Ritchi?  - Yeah! Roxanne Ritchi!

904
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,260
我看到她在和一个书呆子吃饭
I saw her having dinner and making googly eyes

905
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,370
还和他眉来眼去！
at some intellectual dweeb!

906
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,760
竟然有人敢打扰我的计划？
Who needs all that noise?

907
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,840
所以我想我们应该合作
That's why I think we should team up.

908
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:19,800
你… 等等… 什么？
You... wait... what?

909
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,070
以我的能力 再加上你的聪明才智
With my power, and your big-headedness,

910
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,300
- 我们可以统治这个城市！ - 你想合作？
- we could rule the city!  - You want to team up?

911
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,110
我还设计了新服装 你看？
I even drew up some new costume designs, see?

912
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,580
- 设计服装？ - 你脑袋聪明
- Costume designs?  - You'd be the brains,

913
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,080
因此 你的衣服有个小脑袋
so you'd get a little brain,

914
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,720
还要配上眼镜之类的
wearing glasses on your costume, or something.

915
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:33,880
既然我很酷 我就有 比如
And since I'm the cool one, I'd have, like,

916
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,450
两把厉害的剑…
two tanks swordfighting...

917
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,820
真不敢相信
I can't believe you.

918
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,620
所有你的才能 你的能力
All your gifts, all your powers,

919
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:45,390
你… 你竟然用来为自己牟利
and you... you squander them for your own personal gain.

920
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:48,500
- 没错！ - 不行！我才是坏蛋！
- Yes!  - No! I'm the villain!

921
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,700
你是好人！我才应该干坏事
You're the good guy! I do something bad,

922
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:54,370
你应该来抓我！我是为此才创造你的啊
and you come and get me! That's why I created you.

923
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:58,380
是吗 好吧 你这个傻瓜 太空爸爸告诉我…
Yeah, right. You're nuts. Space dad told me...

924
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,780
听着 我就是你的太空爸爸！
Look, I'm your space dad!

925
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,390
你应该向大都会侠学学
You should be more like Metro Man.

926
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,320
- 你耍我？ - 噢 不喜欢吗？
- You tricked me?  - Oh, don't like that?

927
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,680
不止呢
Well, there's more.

928
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:15,190
我还是那个和罗珊约会的书呆子呢
I'm also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne.

929
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,100
- 不会吧  - 我们还热吻了呢！
- No.  - And we were smooching up a storm!

930
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,390
要是让我抓到你 我就…
When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna...

931
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:26,230
对！对 我知道！将我绳之于法吧
Yes! Yes, I know! Bring me to justice.

932
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,840
哦 天啊 好久都没这样了
Oh God, how I've missed this.

933
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:34,810
英雄总是先发制人
And the hero strikes the first blow.

934
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,280
而坏蛋则是后发制人！
But evil returns with a backhand!

935
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,890
太棒了！
Yes!

936
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:53,330
出来啊 你个懦夫！
Come out, you little freak!

937
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:56,900
我想看看你被痛扁的样子！
I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement!

938
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,480
你连最简单的伎俩都应付不过来！
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book!

939
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,880
你这个蓝色的白痴！
You little blue twerp!

940
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:13,010
准备好了！
En garde!

941
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:20,030
哦 这样才对嘛！
Oh, now that's the spirit!

942
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,690
躲闪！出击！再躲！
Parry! Thrust! Parry again!

943
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:26,100
现在我们终于要正式开战了！
Now it's time for some witty back and forth banter!

944
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,100
你先来！
You go first!

945
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,710
好吧！听着 你这样我可没办法！
OK! Look, I'm not sure where to go with that!

946
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,470
这一击 是因为你抢了我的女朋友！
This one's for stealing my girlfriend!

947
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,740
这一击 是因为你假扮太空爸爸耍我！
This one's for Space Dad making a fool out of me!

948
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:54,860
还有 超级大坏蛋 这一击 是为了太空后妈！你骗了她！
And, Megamind, this one's for Space Stepmom! You lied to her!

949
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,360
不错嘛 我觉得你打得真的非常 非常棒
Well done. I thought that battle went really, really well.

950
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,530
- 我是说 我还想说明几点  - 说明？
- I mean, I have a few notes.  - Notes?

951
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,760
不过不急着说 现在你可以把我送进监狱了
But they can wait. You can take me to jail now.

952
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:07,700
哦 不 不 不 我在想要不要再狠点 你死定了！
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking more like the morgue. You're dead!

953
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,070
哇 哇 哇 游戏可不是这样玩的
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't how you play the game.

954
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,210
游戏结束
Game over.

955
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,700
[如果出现紧急情况 按此按钮]

956
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,310
中央机器人！
Brain-bots!

957
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:26,550
我要休战！
I'm calling time out!

958
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,400
休战？休战！休战！
Time out? Time out! Time out!

959
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,910
中央机器人 开启故障安全模式
Brain-bots, initiate the fail-safe.

960
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:54,410
猜猜怎么了 巴斯特・布朗先生？这可是铜做的
Guess what, Buster Brown? It's made from copper.

961
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:56,220
对它 你可是束手无策啊
You're powerless against it.

962
01:03:56,390 --> 01:04:00,730
我就是用它来打败… 大都会侠？
It's the very same metal used to defeat... Metro Man?

963
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,430
不要拿我和大都会侠比！
You should stop comparing me to Metro Man!

964
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,540
你躲得了一时 超级大坏蛋 你躲不了一世！
You can run, Megamind, but you can't hide!

965
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,740
我们得救了！我们得救了！
We're saved! We're saved!

966
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:20,380
你叫什么名字  新一代的英雄？
What's your name, new hero?

967
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,740
- 我叫太阳神  - 谢谢你！
- It's Titan.  - Thank you!

968
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,480
谢谢你！太阳神让我们重获自由了！
Thank you! Titan has freed us!

969
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:30,150
哦 那可不是什么“自由” 而是在新的统治之下
Oh, I wouldn't say "free." More like under new management.

970
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:38,060
- 你想干什么？ - 太阳神变得邪恶了
- What do you want?  - Titan's turned evil.

971
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,190
祝贺你 你的杰作再次让你事与愿违
Congratulations. Another one of your genius plans has backfired on you.

972
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:43,570
为什么我的管家 会让你上来呢？
And why did my doorman let you up?

973
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:46,170
卡洛斯啊
Carlos.

974
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,330
求你了 罗珊 别 别这样 我需要你的帮助
Please, Roxanne, no. No. I need your help.

975
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,170
你怎么会需要我的帮助？
Why do you need my help?

976
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,720
因为你是我所知道的 最聪明的人
Because you're the smartest person I know.

977
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,580
但你不能藏在这里啊
But you can't hide here.

978
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,920
铜球应该有效啊 为什么会没用呢？
The copper should have worked. Why didn't the copper work?

979
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:02,580
上次铜就很成功啊
The copper worked perfectly well last time.

980
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,590
铜球？你在说什么啊
Copper? You're not making any sense.

981
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,520
听着 如果我们找不到太阳神的弱点
Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness,

982
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,250
他会毁了整座城市
he'll destroy the whole city.

983
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,760
- 好吧 要我怎么帮你？ - 我们需要找到答案
- OK, how can I help?  - We need to find answers.

984
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:17,600
你最了解大都会侠 他有什么可以藏身的地方吗？洞穴？
You knew Metro Man best. Did he have a hideout? A cave?

985
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:22,470
僻静的堡垒什么的？只要能给我们提供线索就行
A solitary fortress of some kind? Anything that would give us clues.

986
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,270
好吧… 我倒是知道一个地方
Well... there is one place I know.

987
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:30,510
是你赋予了他超能力 你就不能解除吗？
You gave him these powers. Can't you just take them away?

988
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:35,250
我不能 我忘记隐形车停哪儿了 扩压器枪也就丢了
I can't. I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car.

989
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:40,260
那晚你丢下我 独自一人 在雨中行走
The night you dumped me. Alone. In the rain.

990
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:42,860
你有回头看吗？
Did you ever look back?

991
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:46,200
- 没有！ - 我巨大的蓝脑袋啊！
- No!  - My giant blue head!

992
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:47,490
我们到了
I guess we're here.

993
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:53,200
他就藏在这里啊
So, this is where he hid it.

994
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:57,740
时光飞逝啊 这是我以前的学校
After all these years. My old shcoolhouse.

995
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:03,310
对于那天晚上 我想跟你道歉
You know, I think there's an apology in order for the other night.

996
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:05,510
好吧 这还差不多 但快点说
OK, that would be nice, but make it quick.

997
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:07,660
我们还有很多棘手的问题要解决
We have much more pressing matters to deal with.

998
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,220
哇噢 真不敢相信 他一直都留着这些东西
Wow. I can't believe he kept all this stuff.

999
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:19,030
我还记得他穿着这衣服的样子
I remember when he wore that.

1000
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,690
- 我们不该在这儿专心点吗？ - 没错 当然 好的 专心
- Shouldn't we try to stay focused here?  - Yes, of course. Right. Focused.

1001
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:25,870
嘿 快过来看啊
Hey. Come over and look at this.

1002
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,140
怎么了？你发现什么了？
What is it? What did you find?

1003
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,240
看啊
Look.

1004
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,240
杯子里有冰块
This glass has ice cubes in it.

1005
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,750
没错 这在天气变冷的情况下 很常见
Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold.

1006
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,080
不是 我想说的是 冰到现在都没有融化
No, what I'm saying is, don't you think it's a little odd

1007
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,450
你不觉得奇怪吗？
that the ice hasn't melted yet?

1008
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:45,290
这就是生命伟大的奥秘之一
One of life's great mysteries.

1009
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,160
嘿
Hey.

1010
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,740
我们目前收到确切消息
We now have confirmed reports.

1011
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,650
太阳神 本以为是这座城市新一代的英雄 现已变得邪恶
Titan, first thought to be this city's new hero, has turned evil.

1012
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:13,690
这座城市从未被如此摧残过
The city has never seen this level of destruction.

1013
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,790
要是大都会侠还活着该有多好
If only Metro Man were still alive.

1014
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,790
- 你还活着？ - 你竟然没死
- You're alive?  - You're alive.

1015
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,730
- 我没死  - 但我 我们…
- I'm alive.  - But I, we...

1016
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:23,020
我们看到了你的尸体啊！你是死了啊！
We saw your skeleton! You were dead!

1017
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,170
你是鬼吗？
Are you a ghost?

1018
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:28,630
你最好能有个好理由 解释一下这件事
There had better be an amazing explanation for this.

1019
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,770
说话啊  幽灵
Speak, apparition.

1020
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,540
好 好 好
OK. OK, OK, OK.

1021
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,410
你们应该知道真相
You both deserve the truth.

1022
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,820
一切还要从天文台说起
It all started back at the observatory.

1023
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,220
罗珊被绑架了 我准备去阻止你
Roxanne was kidnapped. I was gonna stop you.

1024
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,600
我那天状态不好
My head wasn't in the game that day.

1025
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,890
我们就像走过场一样
We were kind of going through the motions.

1026
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:01,060
因此… 利用我的超级速度
So... using my super-speed,

1027
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:02,430
我决定先清醒清醒
I decided to go clear my head.

1028
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:03,940
开火！
Fire!

1029
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:06,270
我突然意识到
Then I realized,

1030
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,380
我们这辈子一直在玩不变的愚蠢的扮演游戏
we had done this same silly charade our entire lives.

1031
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:14,010
我想抛掉这种感觉
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling,

1032
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:16,120
但我还是感到压抑
but I just felt stuck.

1033
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:21,150
我开始意识到 除了超能力
I began to realize, despite all my powers,

1034
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:25,780
大都会市的每个人都有我所没有的东西: 选择
each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn't: A choice.

1035
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,890
从我记事以来 总是城市需要我干什么 我就干什么
Ever since I can remember, I've always had to be what the city wanted me to be.

1036
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:34,260
有没有想过我想做什么呢？
But what about what I wanted to do?

1037
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,000
然后 我突然想到
Then it suddenly hit me.

1038
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:39,870
我是有的选的
I do have a choice.

1039
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:43,240
我想怎样就怎样
I can be whatever I want to be.

1040
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:45,810
没人要求你一生都要是个英雄
No one said this hero thing had to be a lifetime gig.

1041
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:48,040
但你也不能说不干就不干
You can't just quit, either.

1042
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:54,050
就是在那个时候 我想到了一个绝妙的注意… 伪造我的死亡
That's when I got the brilliant idea... to fake my death.

1043
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:57,420
铜夺走了我的能量
Copper drains my powers.

1044
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,530
你害怕铜？
Your weakness is copper?

1045
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:04,490
你的死亡光线射出的那瞬间 我从未感觉如此轻松过
Once your death ray hit, I'd never felt so alive.

1046
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,760
因此我从附近的医学院借了一具骷髅
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school.

1047
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,270
大都会侠终于死了
Metro Man was finally dead.

1048
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,600
音乐男诞生了！
And Music Man was born!

1049
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:15,040
- 音乐男？ - 那样我可以继续用这个图标
- Music Man?  - That way I could keep my logo.

1050
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:16,270
- 为什么？ - 你再说一遍？
- 'Cause of wha?  - Come again?

1051
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:19,970
我终于可以自由地发挥我的能量…
I was finally free to get in touch with my true power...

1052
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,510
比如编写一首抒情的歌啦
weaving lyrical magic.

1053
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:23,910
来听听这个怎么样
Check this out.

1054
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:27,150
# 我有一双慧眼 #
# I have eyes that can see #

1055
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,260
# 可以看清整个世界… #
# Right through lead... #

1056
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:33,420
- 你太差劲了！ - 很显然 你很有音乐方面的天赋
- You're horrible!  - Granted, you have talent.

1057
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,290
但现在外面有一个疯子要摧毁我们的… 你的城市
But there's a mad man out there destroying our... your city.

1058
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,490
你怎么能这样？！
How could you do this?!

1059
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,640
市民都那么信任你 而你却抛弃了他们
The people of this city relied on you, and you deserted them!

1060
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:46,570
你把我们落在了他手上！
You left us in the hands of him!

1061
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:49,110
- 你别见怪  - 不会 我跟你想的一样
- No offense.  - No, I'm with you.

1062
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,250
听着 我们需要你
Look, we need your help.

1063
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:54,040
对不起 真的对不起
I'm sorry. I really am.

1064
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,710
我不会出去的
I'm done.

1065
01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:00,380
你知道吗 小兄弟 世间有阴就有阳
You know, little buddy, there's a yin for every yang.

1066
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,650
哪里有邪恶 哪里就会有正义与之对抗
If there's bad, good will rise up against it.

1067
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,130
我用了很长的时间才找到自己的使命
It's taken me a long time to find my calling.

1068
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,800
现在你也该寻找自己的使命了
Now it's about time you find yours.

1069
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:17,900
嘿 谁需要他帮忙？
Hey, who needs him?

1070
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,760
我们自己就可以打败太阳神
We can beat Titan ourselves.

1071
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,910
我们可以会坏蛋老巢 带一些激光枪
I say we go back to the evil lair, grab some ray guns,

1072
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,670
偷偷躲起来 然后一举消灭他
hold him sideways, and just go all gangsta on him.

1073
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,880
我们做不到的
We can't.

1074
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,850
难道就这样了吗？你就这么放弃了？
So that's it? You're just giving up?

1075
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:35,050
我是坏人 我不能拯救世界 我不能上天堂
I'm the bad guy. I don't save the day, I don't fly off into the sunset,

1076
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,820
我也不能跟喜欢的女孩在一起
and I don't get the girl.

1077
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,850
我要回家了
I'm going home.

1078
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:13,290
除非有人出手营救我们 不然一切将被摧毁
Unless someone comes to our aid soon, all may be lost.

1079
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,790
成千上万的人们已经离开了这座城市
Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus.

1080
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:21,900
剩下的市民如果没有接到进一步通知 只能呆在室内
Remaining citizens are warned to stay indoors until further notice.

1081
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,130
政府部分已经发出警告
Authorities have issued a warning

1082
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:28,640
要人们千万不要靠近市中心区域
to stay out of the downtown area at all costs.

1083
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:42,180
哈尔啊！
Hal!

1084
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,560
哈尔啊！
Hal!

1085
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:48,520
让我猜猜 看到我这么厉害
Let me guess. After seeing how awesome I am,

1086
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,030
你终于想要跟我在一起了？但我已经不在乎你了
you've finally come to your senses? Well, I'm over you.

1087
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,400
- 我是来阻止你的 哈尔  - 就凭你？哦 哇塞
- I've come to stop you, Hal.  - You? Oh, wow.

1088
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,560
好啊 你打算怎么做 把我报道死吗？
OK, what are you gonna do, report me to death?

1089
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,760
我想要跟你讲道理
I was going to try reasoning with you.

1090
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:04,040
你和我 我们一起工作了很长时间 我了解你
You and I, we worked together for a long time. I know you.

1091
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:07,740
你根本就不了解我 你从来就没有花过时间来了解我
You don't know me. You never took the time to know me.

1092
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,250
这是我们第一次在外面晃悠
This is the first time we've hung out socially,

1093
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,250
我就要摧毁这座城市了！
and it's when I'm about to destroy the city!

1094
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,150
我要跟那个真实的哈尔说话
I want to talk to the real Hal.

1095
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,590
那个曾经喜欢做一个摄影记者
I want to talk to the guy who loved being a cameraman,

1096
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,160
喜欢吃调味酱 喜欢看书的哈尔
and eating dip, and being a nerd,

1097
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,420
而不是像你现在这样疯狂的哈尔
and being not as scary as the Tighten Hal.

1098
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,760
太晚了！
Too late!

1099
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:25,960
打乱了我们的安排…
interrupting our scheduled...

1100
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,930
发生离奇事件…
extraordinary events taking place...

1101
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,870
山谷的大量热量和…
Heat in the valley and...

1102
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:31,200
超级大坏蛋！
Megamind!

1103
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:36,140
你跟我的恩怨还没有了结呢
You and I have some unfinished business.

1104
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,870
我会在都会巨塔等你
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower.

1105
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:40,480
哦 为了让你不放我鸽子…
Oh, and just so you don't get cold feet...

1106
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,550
是罗珊
Roxanne.

1107
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,350
来吧 洛茜 呼唤你的英雄来救你
Come on, Roxie, call for your hero to come rescue you.

1108
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:53,230
超级大坏蛋 我不知道你有没有在听 但如果你在听
Megamind, I don't even know if you're listening, but if you are,

1109
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:55,660
你不可以放弃
you can't give up.

1110
01:12:57,630 --> 01:13:01,160
我认识的那个超级大坏蛋从来不会轻易言败的
The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight,

1111
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:04,860
就算他知道他的胜算为零
even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning.

1112
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:07,510
那就是你最大的优点
It was your best quality.

1113
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,770
现在 你需要做回你自己
You need to be that guy right now.

1114
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,110
这个城市需要你
The city needs you.

1115
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,310
我需要你
I need you.

1116
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:19,580
罗珊啊
Roxanne.

1117
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,090
你有一个小时
You have one hour.

1118
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,590
不要让我久等
Don't keep me waiting.

1119
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:29,420
监狱长！监狱长！听我说！你必须放我出去！
Warden! Warden! Listen to me! You have to let me go!

1120
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,560
必须有人要去阻止这一切！
Tighten has to be stopped!

1121
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:35,170
抱歉 超级大坏蛋 你还有八十八个终身监禁在身
Sorry, Megamind. You still have 88 life sentences to go.

1122
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:37,500
你有足够的时间反省你所做的一切
Plenty of time to reflect on what you've done.

1123
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:41,510
你要我说出来吗？我来说
Did you want to hear me say it? I'll say it.

1124
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,180
好吧 发自我最肮脏的肺腑
Here it is, from the blackest part of my heart.

1125
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,880
对不起！
I am sorry!

1126
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:55,220
我不相信
Not buying it.

1127
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:59,320
我不怪你
I don't blame you.

1128
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,660
我曾让这个城市无数次陷入恐慌
I've terrorized this city countless times.

1129
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:06,390
创造出一个英雄 结果却发现是一个恶棍
Created a hero who's turned out to be a villain.

1130
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:10,000
我对罗珊撒了谎 还有…
I lied to Roxanne, and...

1131
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:14,970
我最好的朋友 仆人 我将其视为草芥
my best friend Minion, I treated like dirt.

1132
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:19,480
请不要让这座城市…
Please don't make this city...

1133
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:24,010
还有罗珊为我的错误行为买单
don't make Roxanne pay for my wrongdoings.

1134
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,810
我接受你的道歉
Apology accepted.

1135
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:36,700
仆人 你这条出色的小鱼 是你
Oh, Minion, you fantastic fish, you.

1136
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:39,800
我们还等什么呢？出发吧
What are we waiting for? We'd better get going.

1137
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:44,160
你骗到我了
You got me.

1138
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,110
- 祝你们好运 伙计们！ - 我们去送死啦！
- Good luck, fellas!  - We're gonna die!

1139
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:51,640
等等 你说什么？
Wait, what?

1140
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:55,940
嘿 大都会的窝囊废们 这里是都会巨塔
Hey, Metro losers. This is Metro Tower.

1141
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:59,250
有人说这应该是我们城市实力的象征
They say it's supposed to be a symbol of our city's strength.

1142
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:01,480
但对我来说 它让我想起那天
But for me, it's a reminder of the day

1143
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:07,060
这个女人深深地伤透了我的心 所以我恨死它了！
this woman ferociously ripped out my heart. And I hate reminders!

1144
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,630
救命！
Help!

1145
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:27,470
求你不要这样 我知道你还有善良的一面的 哈尔
Please don't do this. I know there's still good in you, Hal.

1146
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:29,140
你太天真了 洛茜
You're so naive, Roxie.

1147
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,290
即使人们一点都不善良 你也总能看到他们善良的一面
You see the good in everybody, even when it's not there.

1148
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:34,550
你真会幻想
You're living a fantasy.

1149
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:37,950
世界上根本就没有复活之神 没有牙仙
There is no Easter Bunny, there is no Tooth Fairy,

1150
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,960
也没有英国女王
and there is no Queen of England.

1151
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:44,130
这才是现实 你醒醒吧！
This is the real world, and you need to wake up!

1152
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:59,110
你居然敢挑战超级大坏蛋？
You dare challenge Megamind?

1153
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,340
一山难容二虎！
This town isn't big enough for two super-villains!

1154
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:07,150
哦 你是个老虎 没错！但只是个纸老虎！
Oh, you're a villain all right! Just not a super one!

1155
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,220
是吗？有区别吗？
Yeah? What's the difference?

1156
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:14,660
你好好看看吧！
Presentation!

1157
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:37,740
- 我知道你一定会回来的  - 好吧 我也是被逼无奈
- I knew you'd come back.  - Well, that made one of us.

1158
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:08,980
- 你有什么计划？ - 呃 计划就是不能死掉
- What's the plan?  - Well, it mostly involves not dying.

1159
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:10,410
我喜欢这个计划
I like that plan.

1160
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,770
塔！
Building!

1161
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:33,270
快一点！让这玩意儿跑快点！
Go faster! Make this thing go faster!

1162
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,140
我失去控制了！
I can't control it!

1163
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:52,820
不
No.

1164
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,290
嗯 真是易如反掌
Well, that was easy.

1165
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,760
看来现在就剩一个没解决了
Looks like there's only one loose end now.

1166
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:14,170
请爱护我们的公共交通工具
Please, let's have a little respect for public transportation.

1167
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,310
你回来了！
You came back!

1168
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,610
你说的对 罗珊 我本来就不应该走的
You were right, Roxanne. I never should have left.

1169
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,080
你… 你不是死了吗
I... I thought you were dead.

1170
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:25,490
我… 我怎么可能死呢
My death was... greatly exaggerated.

1171
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:28,420
看来 你就是大家说的那个混蛋了
So, you're the punk I've heard about.

1172
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:45,410
对不起 我已经尽力了
I'm sorry. I did the best I could.

1173
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,910
我为你感到骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1174
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:54,180
仆人？
Minion?

1175
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:56,850
哒哒 吓一跳吧！
Surprise!

1176
01:18:58,090 --> 01:18:59,920
他才是真正的英雄
He's the real hero.

1177
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:08,130
超级大坏蛋
Megamind.

1178
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,430
除了监狱
Going somewhere?

1179
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:13,470
你还想去哪儿啊？
Besides jail?

1180
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:22,480
别 别打脸 哥们 求你了
No, not in the face, man. Please.

1181
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:26,090
如果你知道为自己着想 太阳神 就滚出大都会市！
If you know what's good for you, Titan, you'll stay out of Metrocity!

1182
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:27,690
- 我会滚的！ - 永远别回来！
- You got it!  - For good!

1183
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:04,820
演得不错 小姐
Pretty sneaky, sis.

1184
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:08,120
不过我认识的人中 只有一个把这里称作“大都会市”
But there's only one person I know who calls this town "Metrocity."

1185
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,300
就是你
You.

1186
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,730
你一定觉得很好玩吧？
Bet you think it's really funny?

1187
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:20,200
你们都来嘲笑这个真正的大英雄吧？
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy?

1188
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:25,180
呵 不过也笑不了多久了
Well, you're not gonna be laughing for long.

1189
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,350
隐形汽车
The invisible car.

1190
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,510
嘿！还记得我把你甩了的那个晚上吗？
Hey! Remember that night that I dumped you?

1191
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:33,050
你现在跟我谈这个？
You're bringing this up now?

1192
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,420
好吧 当时我确实回头了！
Well, I did look back!

1193
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,750
你回头了？真的？
You did? You did?

1194
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:42,420
是的 你现在也要回头看一下！
Yes! And you should look back right now!

1195
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:45,320
哦 我懂了！
Oh, I get it!

1196
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,770
这是你最后一次耍我了！
This is the last time you make a fool out of me!

1197
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,210
是我让你变成大英雄的
I made you a hero.

1198
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:02,440
只是你自作孽不可活
You did the fool thing all by yourself.

1199
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:10,220
你真可怜
You're so pathetic.

1200
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:13,990
不管你站在哪一边 你总是失败者
No matter what side you're on, you're always the loser.

1201
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,290
失败也是有好处的
There's a benefit to losing.

1202
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,730
失败乃成功之母
You get to learn from your mistakes.

1203
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:25,640
哦 开什么玩笑！
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

1204
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:28,070
仆人 如果我能活下来 要让你吃不了兜着走
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.

1205
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,350
好好飞一下吧！
Enjoy your flight!

1206
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,010
超级大坏蛋！
Megamind!

1207
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,860
这就是事情的经过了
So this is how it ends.

1208
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,160
要是平时我一定会记上 这是我最后一次光荣的失败
Normally, I'd chalk this up to my last glorious failure.

1209
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,240
但是今天不行
But not today.

1210
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:05,350
怎么说呢？固习难除吧
What can I say? Old habits die hard.

1211
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:13,980
永别了 洛茜
Say bye-bye, Roxie.

1212
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,690
哈罗
Ollo.

1213
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:33,030
坏家伙的下场 就是失败！
The thing about bad guys, they always lose!

1214
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,080
- 你成功了 你赢了  - 嗯…
- You did it. You won.  - Well...

1215
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:44,670
我终于有理由去赢了 就是你
I finally had a reason to win. You.

1216
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:54,920
仆人！
Minion!

1217
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:59,200
我看不到了 这又冷… 又热 漆黑一片 头晕脑胀的
Can't see. It's cold and... warm, and dark and light.

1218
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:01,390
是我 仆人 我就在这儿
It's me, Minion. I'm right here.

1219
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:04,630
你和我 我们一起经历了很多的冒险
We've had a lot of adventures together, you and I.

1220
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:06,400
是的 仆人
We have, Minion.

1221
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:13,200
虽然说… 大多时候都输的很惨
I mean... most of them ended in horrible failure,

1222
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,910
但今天我们赢了 是吧 老大？
but we won today. Didn't we, sir?

1223
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:21,750
是的 仆人 多亏了你 我们成功了
Yes, Minion, we did it. Thanks to you.

1224
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:26,190
指令: 咱们现在是好人了
Code: We're the good guys now.

1225
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:29,130
收到指令: 我猜是的
Code: I guess we are.

1226
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:33,370
哦 哦 哦 我要死了！也许 就这样了！
Oh, oh, oh, I'm going! I think this, this is it!

1227
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:36,490
我要… 要死了…
I'm going... going far...

1228
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:48,370
真是堪称影后啊
What a drama queen.

1229
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,440
嗯 感觉好多了 可能只要游个泳就好了
You know, I'm feeling much better now. I guess I just needed a swim.

1230
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:54,180
他吓到你了吧？
He had you, didn't he?

1231
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,450
可爱的仆人 不要那样看着我
Classic Minion. Don't give me that face.

1232
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,180
他那张小脸蛋会让你神魂颠倒的
He reels you in with that little face.

1233
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,190
- 看他的表情  - 我们成功啦！
- Look at that face.  - We did it!

1234
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,990
我们赢啦！
We did it!

1235
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,890
- 第一场胜利拿下！ - 你成功了！
- Fist pump!  - You did it!

1236
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:05,620
我们赢咯 赢咯 赢咯！
We won, we won, we won!

1237
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,640
别过来 你们这些野蛮人！
Get back, you savages!

1238
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,970
抱歉！抱歉 他只是还没有习惯接受赞扬
Sorry! Sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback.

1239
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:21,040
真有趣 也许命运并不是上天注定的…
Funny, I guess destiny is not the path given to us...

1240
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,980
而是掌握在我们自己手里
but the path we choose for ourselves.

1241
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:37,500
好了 把你的手举起来
All right, put your hands in the air.

1242
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:42,230
现在把你们的钱包都拿过来
Now hand over your wallets.

1243
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,160
开玩笑的！
I'm just kidding!

1244
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:47,400
玩笑而已！
Just kidding!

1245
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:51,810
我必须承认 好人有好报
I have to admit, being good has its perks.

1246
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:55,740
你知道吗 你穿白色衣服还真不错
You know, you look pretty good in white.

1247
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,150
超级大坏蛋 你可不可以…
Megamind, if you plea...

1248
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,490
喂 你挡着我的孩子了
Hey. My kid can't see.

1249
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:07,530
不好意思 朋友
Sorry, my friend.

1250
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:11,490
做的不错 小兄弟 我知道你可以的
Way to go, little buddy. I knew he had it in him.

1251
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:13,630
女士们 先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

1252
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,860
超级大坏蛋 大都会市的守护者！
Megamind, defender of Metro City!

1253
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:22,900
知道吗 我喜欢这样的音乐
You know, I like the sound of that.

1254
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:24,370
放音乐！
Hit it!

1255
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:37,510
超级大坏蛋！超级大坏蛋！超级大坏蛋！超级大坏蛋！
Megamind! Megamind! Megamind! Megamind!

1256
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:47,430
我是坏人！我是坏人！对 就是这样！
I'm bad! I'm bad! That's right. Yeah!

1257
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,060
老大 你真的需要经常掏掏口袋了
Sir, you really need to empty your pockets more often.

1258
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:40,470
这是我一生中最糟糕的一天了
This has been the worst day of my entire life.

1259
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:42,160
不用担心
No worries.
