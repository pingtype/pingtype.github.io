抓了个违反3A条例的
I got a Section 3A.

171

顺便告诉你 纽约不允许养神奇动物
By the way, we don't allow the breeding of magical creatures in New York.

172

It's terrorizing No-Majs

187
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,830
而麻鸡们感到恐惧 他们会发动攻击
and when No-Majs are afraid, they attack.

188
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,740

00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,160
但假如真的很严重 他会
but if it was really serious, he'd have...

276
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,230
怎样
What?

277
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,050
首先的症状是从肛门喷出火花
Well, the first symptom would be flames out of his anus...

278
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,870
真是一团糟
This is balled up!

279
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,930
最多只会持续四十八小时
It'll last forty-eight hours at most!

280
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,750
- 假如你愿意我可以带着他  - 带着他
- I can keep him if you want me to.  - Oh, keep him?

281
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,310
我们不能带着他们
We don't keep them!

282
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,690
斯卡曼德先生
Mr. Scamander,

283
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,650
你对美国的巫师社群有任何的了解吗
do you know anything about the wizarding community in America?

284
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,150
我确实略有耳闻
I do know a few things, actually.

285
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,780
我知道你们处理巫师和非魔法人士关系的
I know you have rather backwards laws

286
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,570
相关法律还比较落后
about relations with non-magic people.

287
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,980
你们不能和他们做朋友
That you're not meant to befriend them,

288
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,830
不能和他们结婚
that you can't marry them,

289
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,840
这在我看来有些可笑
which seems mildly absurd to me.

290
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,000
谁会愿意和他结婚啊
Who's going to marry him?

291
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,680
你俩都得跟我走
You're both coming with me.

292
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,630
我不明白为什么我也得跟着你
I don't see why I need to come with you.

293
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,680
- 搭把手  - 我是在做梦吧
- Help me!  - I'm dreaming, right?

294
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,720
- 拜托了  - 没错 我累了
- Please.  - Yeah, I'm tired,

295
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,190
我就没去银行
I never went to the bank.

296
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,490
这只是一场噩梦 对吗
This is all just some big nightmare, right?

297
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,310
对我也是噩梦 科瓦斯基先生
For the both of us, Mr. Kowalski.

298
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:17,740
[神奇魔法]

299
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,480
这里就是新闻室了 来吧
And so this is the newsroom. Let's go.

300
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,760
你们好 给巴尔博恩一家让路
Hey, how are you? Make way for the Barebones!

301
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,960
报纸正在进行所谓的上版备印
Now, they're just putting the papers to bed, as they say.

302
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,470
先生 肖先生正在和参议员谈话
Mr. Shaw, sir, he's with the senator.

303
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,910
行了 巴克 我要见我父亲
Never mind that, Barker, I wanna see my father!

304
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,050
很抱歉 肖先生 但您儿子坚持要进来
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shaw, but your son insisted.

305
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,380
父亲 您一定不会想错过这个的
Father, you're going to want to hear this.

306
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,460
我找到了个大新闻
I've got something huge!

307
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,640
你哥哥和我正忙着呢 兰登
Your brother and I are busy here, Langdon.

308
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,560
在忙他竞选的事
Working on his election campaign.

309
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,130
我们没时间听这个
We don't have time for this.

310
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,970
这位是玛丽·卢·巴尔博恩
This is Mary Lou Barebone

311
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,490
她来自新塞勒姆慈善社
from the New Salem Preservation Society,

312
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,150
她给您带来了个大新闻
and she's got a big story for you!

313
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,320
可不是嘛
Oh, she has, has she?

314
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,820
全市各处都发生了奇怪的事情
There's strange things going on all over the city.

315
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,690
造成这一切的人 他们和你我不同
The people behind this, they are not like you and me.

316
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,790
这是巫术 您看不出来吗
This is witchcraft, don't you see.

317
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,180
- 兰登  - 她不要报酬
- Langdon.  - She doesn't want any money.

318
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,700
那么不是她的故事是假的
Then either her story is worthless,

319
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,040
就是她不要报酬的话是假的
or she's lying about the cost.

320
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,120
没人会给你免费的午餐 兰登
Nobody gives away anything valuable for free, Langdon.

321
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,680
您说的没错 肖先生
You are right, Mr. Shaw.

322
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,930
我们渴求远比金钱更宝贵的东西
What we desire is infinitely more valuable than money.

323
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,960
您的影响力
It's your influence.

324
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,110
上百万人订阅您发行的报纸
Millions of people read your newspapers

325
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,380
得有人让他们意识到面前的危机
and they need to be made aware about this danger.

326
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,380
地铁灾难事件 您看看照片就知道了
The crazy disturbances in the subway, just look at the pictures!

327
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,550
请你和你的朋友们马上离开
I'd like you and your friends to leave.

328
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,870
不 你怎么就不明白
No, you're missing a trick here.

329
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,690
- 睁眼看看这些事实  - 闹够了吗
- Just look at the evidence.  - Really.

330
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,770
兰登 听父亲的话 走吧
Langdon, just listen to Father and go. And...

331
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,780
把这些怪胎也一起带走
Take the freaks with you.

332
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,790
- 这是父亲的办公室 不是你的  - 好吧
- This is Father's office, not yours.  - Okay.

333
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,210
我实在受够了 每次我一进来
And I'm sick of this every time I walk in here...

334
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,340
够了 麻烦你们离开
That's it. Thank you.

335
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,580
希望您会改变主意 肖先生
We hope you'll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.

336
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,590
我们随时等候您的消息
We're not difficult to find.

337
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,940
您不来 我们也很感谢您今天见我们
Until then, we thank you for your time.

338
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,820
小子
Hey, boy.

339
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,940
你东西掉了
You dropped something.

340
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,260
拿着 怪胎 扔进垃圾桶吧
Here you go, freak.

341
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,490
那里才是你们该呆的地方
Why don't you put that in the trash where you all belong.

342
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,290
右转
Take a right here.

343
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,700
进屋之前我得申明
Okay, before we go in...

344
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,170
理论上我不能带男士回家
I'm not supposed to have men on the premises.

345
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,710
既然如此 科瓦斯基先生和我完全可以去别处休息
In that case, Mr. Kowalski and I can easily seek other accommodation.

346
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,150
不行
Oh no, you don't!

347
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,410
当心脚下
Watch your step.

348
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,010
是你吗 蒂娜
That you, Tina?

349
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,310
- 是 埃斯波西托太太  - 一个人吗
- Yes, Mrs. Esposito!  - Are you alone?

350
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,960
一如既往一个人 埃斯波西托太太
I'm always alone, Mrs. Esposito!

351
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,700
蒂妮 你带了男人回来
Teenie, you brought men home?

352
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,340
两位 这位是我妹妹
Gentlemen, this is my sister.

353
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,560
- 加件衣服吧 奎妮  - 当然
- You want to put something on, Queenie?  - Sure.

354
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,960
- 他们是谁  - 这位是斯卡曼德先生
- So, who are they?  - That's Mr. Scamander.

355
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,970
他犯下严重罪行
He's committed a serious

356
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,500
违反了《巫师保密法》
infraction of the National Statute of Secrecy.

357
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,970
他是个罪犯吗
He's a criminal?

358
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,080
这位是科瓦斯基先生 是个麻鸡
And this is Mr. Kowalski, he's a No-Maj.

359
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,000
麻鸡
A No-Maj?

360
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,100
蒂妮 你要做什么
Teen, what are you up to?

361
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,850
他受伤了 说来话长
He's sick, it's a long story.

362
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,770
斯卡曼德先生丢了东西 我要帮他找回来
Mr. Scamander has lost something, I'm going to help him find it.

363
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,300
你得坐下亲爱的 他一整天没吃东西了
You need to sit down, honey. Hey, he hasn't eaten all day.

364
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,050
真可怜 银行没批准他开点心店的贷款
That's rough, he didn't get the money he wanted for his bakery.

365
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,420
你会做点心呀 亲爱的
You bake, honey?

366
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,810
- 我可喜欢做饭了  - 你是摄神取念者
- I love to cook.  - You're a Legilimens?

367
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:29,080
对啊 但碰上你们英国人就有些麻烦
Uh-huh, yeah. But I always have trouble with your kind. Brits.

368
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,720
因为口音的缘故
It's the accent.

369
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,890
- 你会读心术  - 别担心 亲爱的
- You know how to read minds?  - Don't worry, honey.

370
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,350
男人们第一次见到我跟你想法都一样
Most guys think what you was thinking, first time they see me.

371
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,960
先给你做吃的
Now, you need food.

372
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,630
- 又吃热狗  - 别对我使读心术
- Hot dog... again?  - Don't read my mind!

373
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,600
这午餐不怎么样哦
Not a very wholesome lunch.

374
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,880
斯卡曼德先生
Hey, Mr. Scamander,

375
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,900
喜欢苹果馅饼还是薄酥卷饼
you prefer pie or strudel?

376
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,870
我没什么讲究
I really don't have a preference.

377
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,770
你喜欢薄酥卷饼对吧 亲爱的
You prefer strudel, huh, honey?

378
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,300
那就做卷饼
Strudel it is.

379
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,060
坐下吧 斯卡曼德先生
Well, sit down, Mr. Scamander.

380
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,550
不会毒死你的
We're not going to poison you.

381
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,850
你很难过
You're upset.

382
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,080
你母亲又打你了吗
It's your mother again.

383
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,940
有人说了什么 说了什么 告诉我
Somebody's said something, what did they say? Tell me.

384
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,650
- 你觉得我是个怪胎吗  - 不
- Do you think I'm a freak?  - No,

385
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,790
我认为你是一位非常特别的年轻人
I think you're a very special young man

386
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,880
否则我也不会请你协助我 对吗
or I wouldn't have asked you to help me, would I?

387
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,530
- 有消息了吗  - 我还在找
- Have you any news?  - I'm still looking.

388
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,220
格雷夫斯先生 如果能知道性别
Mr. Graves, if I knew whether it was a girl or boy...

389
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,830
我只看到那孩子有巨大的力量
My vision showed only the child's immense power.

390
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,510
性别未知 但肯定不过十岁
He or she is no older than ten,

391
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,830
和你母亲很亲近
and I saw this child in close proximity to your mother.

392
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,150
你母亲我看的真切
She I saw so plainly.

393
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,870
- 这样的人有好几百  - 还有一件事
- That could be any one of hundreds.  - There is something else.

394
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,290
之前没告诉你
Something I haven't told you.

395
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,850
我看到你与我在纽约并肩而立
I saw you beside me in New York.

396
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,270
只有你能获取那孩子的信任
You're the one that gains this child's trust.

397
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,180
你是关键 我看到了
You are the key, I saw this.

398
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,360
你渴望加入魔法师的世界
You want to join the wizarding world.

399
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,820
我也是 克雷登斯 我渴望你能加入
I want those things too, Credence. I want them for you.

400
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,950
找到那个孩子 找到了我们就自由了
So find the child. Find the child and we'll all be free.

401
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,030
我的工作没啥稀奇
The job ain't that glamorous.

402
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,560
整天冲泡咖啡
I mean, I spend most days making coffee,

403
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,200
用用读心术 蒂娜才是职业女性
unjinxing the john. Tina's the career girl.

404
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,340
不 我们是孤儿
Nah. We're orphans.

405
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,200
父母在我们小时候得龙痘过世了
Ma and Pa died of dragon pox when we were kids.

406
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,550
你真贴心 我们俩相依为命也很好
You're sweet. But we got each other!

407
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,350
你能别一直对我用读心术吗
Could you stop reading my mind for a second?

408
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,200
别误会 我很喜欢
Don't get me wrong, I love it.

409
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,670
这顿晚餐实在美味无比 我也是厨师
This meal, it's insanely good! This is what I do, I'm a cook.

410
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:36,140
但这是我今生今世吃过最美味的东西
And this is, like, the greatest meal I have ever had in my life.

411
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:44,050
你真迷人 我还是第一次认真和麻鸡聊天呢
Oh, you slay me! I ain't never really talked to a No-Maj before.

412
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,780
真的吗
Really?

413
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,330
我没有在调情
I am not flirting!

414
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,460
我只是提醒你 别陷太深
I'm just saying, don't go getting attached,

415
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,670
最终要给他施遗忘咒的
he's going to have to be obliviated!

416
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,400
这是规矩
It's nothing personal.

417
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,790
- 你还好吗 亲爱的  - 戈德斯坦恩小姐
- Hey, you okay, honey?  - Miss Goldstein,

418
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,820
我想科瓦斯基先生应该早点休息
I think Mr. Kowalski could do with an early night.

419
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,790
而且你和我明天也得早起
And besides, you and I will need to be up early tomorrow morning

420
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,580
去找我的嗅嗅 所以
to find my Niffler, so...

421
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,480
- 嗅嗅是什么  - 别问了
- What's a Niffler?  - Don't ask.

422
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,040
你俩就在这儿加张床睡吧
Okay, you guys can bunk in here.

423
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,350
不知道你们想不想喝点热乎的
I thought you might like a hot drink?

424
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,400
斯卡曼德先生 热可可哎
Hey, Mr. Scamander... Look, cocoa!

425
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,470
- 厕所在走廊尽头右拐  - 谢谢
- The toilet's down the hall to the right.  - Thanks...

426
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,770
非常感谢
Very much.

427
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,080
来啊
Come on.

428
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,400
真是服了
For the love of...

429
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,140
好像有一个 杰斯
There seems to be one, jesus

430
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,830
- 坐下吧  - 好主意
- Will you sit down?  - Good idea.

431
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,660
肯定是莫特拉鼠咬的了
That's definitely the Murtlap.

432
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,440
你一定是易感体质
You must be particularly susceptible.

433
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,600
因为你是麻瓜 我们体质有些许不同
See, you're a Muggle. So our physiologies are subtly different.

434
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,010
别动 这药能止汗
Stay still. Now that should stop the sweating.

435
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,070
这可以缓解痉挛
And one of those should sort the twitch.

436
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,630
拿好
Take that.

437
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,830
再来点
Come on...

438
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:02,390
- 你在弄什么  - 当地人管它叫蜷翼魔
- What you got there?  - This the locals call Swooping Evil?

439
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,990
名字挺可怕 小家伙很敏捷
Not the friendliest of names. It's quite an agile fellow.

440
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,470
我正在研究它 我确信它的毒液
I've been studying him. And I am pretty sure his venom

441
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,670
合理稀释后其实很有用
could be quite useful if properly diluted.

442
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,470
能消除痛苦的记忆
Just to remove bad memories, you know.

443
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,100
不过还是别在屋里放开它了
Probably shouldn't let him loose in here, though.

444
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,630
来吧
Come on.

445
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,380
来吧 下来吧
Come on. Down you come.

446
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,410
来
Come on.

447
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,140
[帕拉塞尔苏斯  巧克力蛙卡片上出现过的人物]
[中世纪瑞士医生  炼金术师  精通毒理学]
感谢帕拉塞尔苏斯
Oh, thank Paracelsus.

448
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,840
要是你也跑出去那就天下大乱了
If you'd have got out that could have been quite catastrophic.

449
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,680
我来美国的真正原因就是为了它
You see, he's the real reason I came to America.

450
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,710
我想把弗兰克带回故乡
To bring Frank home.

451
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,900
抱歉 别靠太近 他对陌生人有些敏感
No, sorry, stay there, he's a wee bit sensitive to strangers.

452
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,570
乖 乖 它被非法贩卖了
Here you are, here you are. He was trafficked, you see.

453
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,800
我在埃及发现的它 全身绑着锁链
I found him in Egypt, he was all chained up.

454
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,490
不忍心丢下它不管 我得带它回家
Couldn't leave him there, had to bring him back.

455
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,590
带你回归属之地 对不对 弗兰克
I'm going to put you back where you belong, aren't I, Frank?

456
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,500
回到亚利桑那大荒野
To the wilds of Arizona.

457
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,980
它们来了
Here they come.

458
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,920
- 谁来了  - 角驼兽
- Here who comes?  - The Graphorns.

459
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,180
没事 没事的
You're all right. You're all right.

460
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,340
你好 你们好
Hello, hello!

461
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,370
这是现存最后一对能哺育后代的角驼兽
So they're the last breeding pair in existence.

462
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,030
如果我没救回它们
If I hadn't managed to rescue them,

463
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,550
角驼兽恐怕就从此灭绝了
that could have been the end of Graphorns, forever.

464
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,810
好啦
All right.

465
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,670
- 你专门救治这些动物吗  - 没错
- What, you rescue these creatures?  - Yes, that's right.

466
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,200
救治 养育 保护它们
Rescue, nurture, and protect them,

467
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,800
并试着慢慢给魔法师们灌输他们的知识
and I'm gently trying to educate my fellow wizards about them.

468
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,680
跟我来
Come on.

469
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,440
泰特斯 芬 波比 马洛 汤姆
Titus? Finn? Poppy, Marlow, Tom?

470
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,730
他感冒了 需要温暖的身体
He had a cold. He needed some body warmth.

471
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,790
好了 回去吧
Right, on you hop.

472
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,010
他有些粘人 去吧 皮克特
See, he has some attachment issues. Now, come on, Pickett.

473
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,030
皮克特 他们不会欺负你的 回去吧
Pickett. No, they're not going to bully you. Now, come on.

474
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,390
皮克特
Pickett!

475
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:55,010
好吧 也难怪他们说我偏心了
All right. But that is exactly why they accuse me of favoritism.

476
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,210
杜戈尔去哪儿了
I wonder where Dougal's gone.

477
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,500
我来了 我来了 妈妈来了
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming, Mum's here. Mum's here.

478
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,530
- 让我瞧瞧  - 我见过这些小家伙
- Hello, you, let me take a look at you.  - I know these guys.

479
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,900
- 你的鸟蛇  - 你说我的鸟蛇
- Your Occamy.  - You mean my Occamy?

480
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,150
是的 你想不想
Yes, do you want to...

481
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,440
好啊 当然好
Yeah, sure. Okay.

482
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,460
- 你好  - 抱歉 不要摸
- Hey.  - No, sorry, don't pet them.

483
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,840
他们一出生就学会自我保护
They learn to defend themselves early.

484
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,950
因为蛋壳是银的 非常值钱
See, their shells are made of silver so they're incredibly valuable.

485
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:42,560
- 是吗  - 他们的巢总是惨遭猎杀洗劫
- Okay.  - Their nests tend to get ransacked by hunters.

486
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,690
谢谢
Thank you.

487
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,550
- 斯卡曼德先生  - 叫我纽特吧
- Mr. Scamander?  - Call me Newt.

488
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,370
纽特 我觉得我不是在做梦
Newt, I don't think I'm dreaming.

489
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:55,870
- 怎么看出来的  - 我可没这想象力
- What gave it away?  - I ain't got the brains to make this up.

490
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,720
不介意帮个忙吧
Actually, would you mind

491
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,360
把这些喂给那边的月痴兽
throwing some of those pellets in with the Mooncalves over there?

492
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,370
- 好的  - 就在那边
- Yeah, sure.  - Just over there...

493
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:14,760
倒霉 嗅嗅跑了 就知道 捣蛋鬼
Bugger, Niffler's gone. Of course he has, little bugger.

494
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,510
不会放过任何闪亮亮的东西
Any chance to get his hands on something shiny.

495
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,500
今天干嘛了 雅各布
What did you do today, Jacob?

496
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,650
我去一个皮箱里玩了
I was inside a suitcase.

497
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:03,640
你们好 小家伙们 来吧 来吧
Hey. Hello, fellas. All right, all right.

498
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,840
慢慢吃 慢慢吃
Take it easy, take it easy.

499
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,270
真可爱 给你
Cutie. There it is.

500
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,400
- 退后  - 老天
- Step back.  - Jeez...

501
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,950
- 退后  - 这是怎么回事
- Step back.  - What's the matter with this?

502
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,300
- 我说 退后  - 知道了
- I said step away.  - Yeah.

503
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,160
- 这是什么鬼东西  - 这是默默然
- What the hell is this thing?  - It's an Obscurus.

504
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,600
我得出发了
I need to get going,

505
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,670
在跑掉的受伤前得赶紧找回来
find everyone who's escaped before they get hurt.

506
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,620
该担心的真是他们吗
Before they could get hurt?

507
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,130
没错 科瓦斯基先生 他们身处异乡
Yes, Mr. Kowalski. They're currently in alien terrain,

508
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,050
四周围绕着成千上万
surrounded by millions

509
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,150
这个星球上最险恶的生物
of the most vicious creatures on the planet.

510
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,610
人类
Humans.

511
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,450
依你看来 一个中等体型
So where would you say that a medium-sized creature

512
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,740
喜欢开阔平原
that likes broad, open plains,

513
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,500
树林和水坑的生物 她会去哪儿
trees, water holes, that kind of thing, where might she go?

514
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,730
在纽约市吗
In New York City?

515
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,520
- 对  - 喜欢平原
- Yes.  - Plains?

516
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,630
- 中央公园  - 在哪儿
- Central Park?  - And where is that exactly?

517
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,240
你不知道中央公园在哪儿
Where is Central Park?

518
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,770
我是很乐意为你带路
Well, look, I would come and show you,

519
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,020
但你不觉得有点对不起两位女士吗
but don't you think it's kind of a double cross?

520
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,070
人家收留我们 还给我们喝热可可
The girls take us in, they make us hot cocoa.

521
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,810
你知道一旦你痊愈了
You do realize that when they see you've stopped sweating,

522
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,370
她们转眼就会对你施遗忘咒对吧
they'll obliviate you in a heartbeat.

523
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:10,350
什么是遗忘咒
What does obliviate Mean?

524
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,510
就像梦醒 关于魔法的记忆消失不见
It'll be like you wake up and all memory of magic is gone.

525
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,880
- 这一切我都会忘掉吗  - 没错
- I won't remember any of this?  - No.

526
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,870
好吧 我帮你
All right, yeah, okay, I'll help you.

527
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:33,910
那走吧
Come on, then.

528
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,320
克雷登斯 你去哪儿了
Credence, where have you been?

529
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,310
我在找明天集会的场地
I was looking for a place for tomorrow's meeting.

530
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,180
三十二街上有块地方我们可以
There's a corner on Thirty-Second Street that could...

531
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,220
对不起 妈妈 我没注意到这么晚了
I'm sorry, Ma. I didn't realize it was so late.

532
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,520
- 晚饭时我在观察你  - 然后呢
- I was watching you at dinner.  - Yeah.

533
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,710
你很讨人喜欢 对吧 科瓦斯基先生
People like you, don't they, Mr. Kowalski?

534
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,440
你肯定也很讨人喜欢
Well, I'm sure people like you too.

535
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,190
不 我总是讨人嫌
No, not really. I annoy people.

536
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,740
你为什么要做点心师呢
Why did you decide to be a baker?

537
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:32,790
因为我在罐头厂呆的快要窒息了
Well, because I'm dying in that canning factory.

538
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,010
那的人都是行尸走肉
Everyone there's dying.

539
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,560
那里能活生生把你的意志榨干
It just crushes the life outta you.

540
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,690
- 你喜欢罐头食品吗  - 不喜欢
- You like canned food?  - No.

541
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,020
我也不喜欢 所以我想做手工点心
Yeah. Me neither. That's why I want to make pastries, you know.

542
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,510
吃点心让人开心 这边走
It makes people happy. We're going this way.

543
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,410
那你拿到贷款了吗
So did you get your loan?

544
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:50,700
没 我没东西作抵押
No, I ain't got no collateral.

545
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,100
或许是在部队呆太久了 谁知道呢
Stayed in the army too long, apparently, I don't know.

546
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,450
- 你打过仗吗  - 当然打过
- You fought in the war?  - Of course I fought in the war,

547
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,860
人人都打过仗 你难道没有吗
everyone fought in the war. You didn't fight in the war?

548
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,070
我主要和龙打交道 乌克兰铁腹龙
I worked mostly with dragons, Ukrainian Ironbellies,

549
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,540
东线战场
Eastern Front.

550
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,140
玻璃破碎
Finestra.

551
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,140
速速飞来
Accio!

552
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,930
这下高兴了
All right? Happy?

553
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,930
找到一个 还剩俩
One down, two to go.

554
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:17,990
- 犯人朝那跑了 警官  - 举起手来
- They went that way, Officer.  - Hands up!

555
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,130
那是什么
What the hell is that?

556
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,040
狮子
Lion...

557
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,170
纽约比我想象中好玩多了
You know, New York is considerably more interesting than I'd expected.

558
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,650
戴上
Put this on.

559
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,320
我为什么需要戴这种东西
Why would I have to wear something like this?

560
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,580
因为你的脑袋
Because your skull is

561
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,780
在巨大冲击之下很容易开花
susceptible to breakage under immense force.

562
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,490
但我们还给他们做了热可可呢
But we made them cocoa.

563
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,340
好了
Right.

564
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:40,700
- 不如把这也穿上吧  - 好的
- Okay, if you just, pop this on.  - Okay.

565
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,620
这下真的没啥可担心的了
Now, there's absolutely nothing for you to worry about.

566
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:45,180
你说不用担心时
Tell me, has anyone ever

567
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,330
真的有人相信你过吗
believed you when you told them not to worry?

568
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:50,650
我始终认为 担心就是双重遭罪
My philosophy is that worrying means you suffer twice.

569
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:59,740
季节到了 她需要交配
She's in season. She needs to mate.

570
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:07,450
毒角兽麝香 对她最有吸引力
Erumpent musk, she is mad for it.

571
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:17,350
好姑娘
Good girl...

572
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,360
来吧 到箱子里去
Come on, into the case.

573
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:32,650
讨厌
Get...

574
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,900
糟糕
Oh, no.

575
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,550
修复如初
Repar...

576
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:14,100
梅林的胡子啊
Merlin's beard!

577
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,170
这两根一模一样
They're exactly the same.

578
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,910
- 一模一样  - 纽特
- Same thing.  - Newt!

579
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,580
别 别
No, no, no, don't!

580
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,800
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

581
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,610
干得漂亮 科瓦斯基先生
Good show, Mr. Kowalski!

582
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,140
叫我雅各布吧
Call me Jacob.

583
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,790
抓了俩 还剩一个
Two down, one to go.

584
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,740
你先进吧
In you hop.

585
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,620
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

586
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:18,040
今晚的主要发言人
tonight's keynote speaker,

587
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:20,980
无需我过多介绍
needs no introduction from me.

588
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,570
[肖 美国的未来]
他被誉为未来的总统
He's been mentioned as a future president.

589
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,140
不信的话
And if you don't believe me,

590
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,230
看看他父亲的报纸就知道了
just read his daddy's newspapers.

591
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,810
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

592
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:36,340
让我隆重为你们介绍纽约的参议员
I'll give you the senator for New York,

593
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,570
亨利·肖
Henry Shaw!

594
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:44,970
谢谢您
Thank you.

595
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,530
谢谢大家
Thank you!

596
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,100
谢谢
Thank you.

597
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,650
某些方面我们的确取得了不小的进步
And it's true we have made some progress,

598
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:25,500
但游手好闲是不可能有回报的
but there is no reward for idleness.

599
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:29,870
[此时为1926年 正处于美国禁酒令时期]
当那些乌烟瘴气的酒吧被取缔之后
So just as the odious saloons have been banished...

600
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,670
出什么事了
What's going on?

601
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,580
至于那些酿酒厂
So now the pool halls,

602
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,940
和私人作坊
and these private parlors...

603
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,500
那是什么
What is that?

604
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,120
女巫
Witches!

605
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,220
[严峻未知状况]
[高度紧急]

606
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,160
[美国魔法国会]

607
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,330
我们的美国同僚
Our American friends have

608
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,100
对有人违背了《保密法》视而不见
permitted a breach of the Statute of Secrecy,

609
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,220
使整个魔法世界面临暴露的威胁
that threatens to expose us all.

610
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,220
我不想听
I will not be lectured by the man

611
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,530
眼睁睁放走了盖勒特·格林德沃的人
who let Gellert Grindelwald

612
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:15,520
来教训我
slip through his fingers.

613
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,280
会长女士 很抱歉打扰您
Madam President, I'm so sorry to interrupt,

614
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,290
但这事十万火急
but this is critical.

615
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,220
你这样鲁莽的擅自闯入
You'd better have an excellent

616
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:37,020
最好有个合理理由 戈德斯坦恩小姐
excuse for this intrusion, Miss Goldstein.

617
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,510
是的 我有
Yes, I do.

618
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:47,550
女士 昨天一个带手提箱的巫师来了纽约
Madam. Yesterday a wizard entered New York with a case.

619
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,130
箱子里全是神奇生物
This case full of magical creatures,

620
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,380
很不幸的是 有一些逃脱了
and unfortunately, some have escaped.

621
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,270
他昨天到的吗
He arrived yesterday?

622
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,950
你二十四小时前就知道
You have known for twenty-four hours

623
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,880
一个未登记的巫师在纽约放跑了魔法生物
that an unregistered wizard set magical beasts loose in New York.

624
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,040
却等到有人遇害了才告诉我们吗
and you see fit to tell us only when a man has been killed?

625
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:10,620
- 谁被杀了  - 他在哪
- Who has been killed?  - Where is this man?

626
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,830
斯卡曼德
Scamander?

627
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,250
您好 部长大人
Hello, Minister.

628
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:59,000
忒修斯·斯卡曼德 那个一战英雄
Theseus Scamander? The war hero?

629
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,510
不 这是他弟弟
No, this is his little brother.

630
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,860
你来纽约干什么
And what are you doing in New York?

631
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:06,850
- 买阿帕鲁萨蒲绒绒 先生  - 我信了
- I came to buy an Appaloosa Puffskein, sir.- Right.

632
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,130
你来这里真正的目的是什么
What are you really doing here?

633
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:13,000
戈德斯坦恩 这又是谁
Goldstein, and who is this?

634
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:15,440
他叫雅各布·科瓦斯基 会长女士
This is Jacob Kowalski, Madam President,

635
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:18,100
他是被斯卡曼德先生的动物咬了的麻鸡
he's a No-Maj who got bitten by one of Mr. Scamander's creatures.

636
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,310
- 麻鸡  - 施遗忘咒了吗
- No-Maj?  - Obliviated?

637
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,690
抹掉他的记忆
Obliviate him!

638
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,160
梅林的胡子啊
Merlin's beard.

639
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,000
您知道您的哪只动物该为此负责吗
You know which of your creatures was responsible,

640
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,280
斯卡曼德先生
Mr. Scamander?

641
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:38,150
这不是动物干的
No creature did this.

642
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,700
别装了
Don't pretend!

643
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,940
你们知道那是什么 看伤痕就知道
You must know what that was, look at the marks...

644
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,890
这是默默然干的
That was an Obscurus.

645
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,130
满口胡言 斯卡曼德先生
You go too far, Mr. Scamander.

646
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:58,620
在美国绝对没有默默然
There is no Obscurial in America.

647
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,310
扣押他的箱子 格雷夫斯
Impound that case, Graves!

648
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,990
- 等等 别 还给我  - 逮捕他们
- Wait. No. Give that back.  - Arrest them!

649
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,530
别伤害那些动物
Don't hurt those creatures.

650
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,170
求您了 您不理解
Please, you don't understand,

651
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,400
他们都不危险的 都不危险
nothing in there is dangerous, nothing!

652
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,100
我们自会判断 押他们去监狱
We'll be the judges of that! Take them to the cells!

653
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:24,120
别伤害这些动物 他们都不危险的
Don't hurt those creatures, nothing in there is dangerous!

654
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,530
求您了 别伤害我的动物们
Please, don't hurt my creatures!

655
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:28,720
他们不危险的 求您了 不危险的
They aren't dangerous! Please, they are not dangerous!

656
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,020
他们不会伤害人的
They are not dangerous!

657
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,680
关于你的动物我很抱歉 斯卡曼德先生
I am so sorry about your creatures, Mr. Scamander.

658
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,710
真的
I truly am.

659
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,550
谁能告诉我
Can someone please tell me

660
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:50,120
这个默然者还是默默然到底是什么
what this Obscurial or Obscurus thing is? Please?

661
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:54,640
几百年都没有出现过了
There hasn't been one for centuries.

662
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,450
三个月前我在苏丹遇到了一个
I met one in Sudan three months ago.

663
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,430
虽然以前更多 但现在也还有
There used to be more of them but they still exist.

664
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,460
那时巫师们还未隐遁
Before wizards went underground,

665
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:12,960
我们还在被麻瓜们追杀
when we were still being hunted by Muggles,

666
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,590
有时为了逃脱厄运
young wizards and witches

667
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:19,760
年轻的巫师们会抑制自己的魔法力量
sometimes tried to suppress their magic to avoid persecution.

668
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,900
但他们并未学会驾驭和控制他们的力量
Instead of learning to harness or to control their powers,

669
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,940
反而衍生了所谓的默默然
they developed what was called an Obscurus.

670
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,290
这是种极不稳定 难以控制的黑魔法
It's an unstable, uncontrollable Dark force

671
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,380
会脱离宿主然后攻击他人
that busts out and attacks...

672
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,170
之后便消失得无影无踪
and then vanishes.

673
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,390
默然者活不久的 对吧
Obscurials can't survive long, can they?

674
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,830
没有任何案例表明
There's no documented case

675
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:51,760
默然者能活过十岁
of any Obscurial surviving past the age of ten.

676
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,770
我在非洲遇到的小女孩当时才…
The one I met in Africa was eight when she...

677
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,970
她离世时才八岁
She was eight when she died.

678
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:07,470
所以你们的意思是
What are you telling me here,

679
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:11,010
参议员肖是被一个小孩杀死的
that Senator Shaw was killed by a kid?

680
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:19,650
我妈妈 你妈妈 骑着扫帚飞
My momma, your momma, flying on a switch.

681
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:23,440
我妈妈 你妈妈 女巫不哭呀
My momma, your momma, witches never cry.

682
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:27,310
我妈妈 你妈妈 女巫死光啦
My momma, your momma, witches gonna die!

683
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,020
第一个女巫 河水淹死她
Witch number one, drown in a river!

684
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,750
第二个女巫 绳子吊死她
Witch number two, gotta noose to give her!

685
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,550
- 该发传单了  - 第三个女巫
- Hand out your leaflets!  - Witch number three...

686
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,340
你们扔掉的话我会知道的
I'll know if you dump them.

687
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,790
看到可疑的东西记得告诉我
Tell me if you see anything suspicious.

688
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,760
能认识你很高兴 雅各布
It was good to make your acquaintance,Jacob

689
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:16,080
希望你的点心屋能够顺利开张
and I hope you get your bakery.

690
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,240
您很有意思 斯卡曼德先生
You're an interesting man, Mr. Scamander.

691
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:30,550
格雷夫斯先生
Mr. Graves...

692
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,640
当年因威胁他人生命被霍格沃茨开除
You were thrown out of Hogwarts for endangering human life...

693
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,370
- 那是个意外  - 还是动物引起的吧
- That was an accident!  - With a beast.

694
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:49,370
然而你的一位老师强烈反对开除你
Yet one of your teachers argued strongly against your expulsion.

695
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:50,510
现在走到了这步田地
And now...

696
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,880
[邓布利多曾担任变形课教授]
阿不思·邓布利多为什么这么喜欢你
What makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you?

697
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,800
我真的不知道
I really couldn't say.

698
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,000
所以在这里放出一只危险的生物
So setting a pack of dangerous creatures loose here was...

699
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,150
也是一场意外 是吗
Was just another accident, is that right?

700
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,160
我故意这么做能有什么好处
Why would I do it deliberately?

701
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:16,980
能曝光巫师世界
To expose wizardkind.

702
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:21,470
挑起魔法世界和人类世界的战争
To provoke war between the magical and non-magical worlds.

703
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,550
[格林德沃信徒的口号]
你的意思是以大屠杀来成全大局吗
Mass slaughter for the greater good, you mean?

704
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,460
是的 就这个意思
Yes. Quite.

705
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,370
我不是格林德沃的信徒 格雷夫斯先生
I'm not one of Grindelwald's fanatics, Mr. Graves.

706
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,400
关于这个你有什么话说 斯卡曼德先生
I wonder what you can tell me about this, Mr. Scamander?

707
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:01,240
这是只默默然 但不是你想的那样
It's an Obscurus. But it's not what you think so.

708
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,190
救那个苏丹女孩的时候
I managed to separate it from the Sudanese girl

709
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:04,650
我试着把它分离了出来
from the Sudanese girl as I tried to save her.

710
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,820
我只想带回家做研究
Wanted to take it home, to study it.

711
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,270
但离开标本泡它是无法存活的
But it cannot survive outside that,

712
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:10,290
它无法伤害任何人了 蒂娜
it could not hurt anyone, Tina!

713
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,110
所以离了宿主这东西就没用了
So it's useless without the host?

714
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:17,290
“没用了” “没用了”
"Useless?" "Useless?"

715
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:24,110
能致一个孩子于死地的寄生魔法力量
That is a parasitical magical force that killed a child.

716
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:26,000
你觉得它能有什么用
What on earth would you use it for?

717
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,650
你骗不了任何人 斯卡曼德先生
You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.

718
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:36,080
你把默默然带到纽约来
You brought this Obscurus into the

719
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,810
就是希望进行大规模屠杀
city of New York in the hope of causing mass disruption,

720
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,470
破坏《保密法》 曝光巫师世界
breaking the Statute of Secrecy and revealing the magical world.

721
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:43,320
你知道它不能伤人的 你明明知道
You know that can't hurt anyone, you know that!

722
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,050
你将以背叛巫师同胞的罪名
You are therefore guilty of a treasonous betrayal

723
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:47,450
被处以死刑
of your fellow wizards and are sentenced to death.

724
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,740
戈德斯坦恩小姐作为煽动你的同党
Miss Goldstein, who has aided and abetted you...

725
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,010
不 她什么都没做
No, she's done nothing of the kind.

726
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:53,090
处以同等刑法
She receives the same sentence.

727
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,970
赶紧动手吧
Just do it immediately.

728
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,670
- 我会亲自通知皮奎里会长的  - 蒂娜
- I will inform President Picquery myself.  - Tina.

729
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,620
麻烦了
Please.

730
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:19,070
别这么做 贝娜黛特 求你了
Don't do this, Bernadette, please...

731
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,600
不会疼的
It don't hurt.

732
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:03,240
- 蒂娜  - 妈妈  - 蒂娜
- Tina...  - Momma...  - Tina...

733
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:09,880
来吧小南瓜 该睡觉啦 准备好了吗
Come on, pumpkin, time for bed. Are you ready?

734
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,690
看上去是不是很美好
Don't that look good?

735
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,690
想进去吧
You wanna get in?

736
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,720
- 山姆  - 奎妮
- Hey, Sam!  - Hey, Queenie.

737
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:31,090
他们叫你去楼下
They need you downstairs.

738
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,480
- 我来施遗忘咒  - 你无权执行
- I'll obliviate this guy.  - You ain't qualified.

739
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,510
山姆
Hey, Sam.

740
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,170
西西里知道你在和露比幽会吗
Does Cecily know you been seeing Ruby?

741
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,060
- 你是怎么  - 只要让我施咒
- How'd you...  - Let me obliviate this guy

742
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,730
我保证一个字也不会往外说
and she'll never hear about it from me.

743
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,020
你干什么
What are you doing?

744
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:52,800
蒂妮有麻烦了 我正在四处倾听
Teen's in trouble, I'm trying to listen...

745
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,480
雅各布 纽特的手提箱在哪里
Jacob, where's Newt's case?

746
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,440
应该是那个格雷夫斯拿走了
I think that guy Graves took it.

747
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,520
好吧 跟我来
Okay, come on.

748
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,320
你不打算抹掉我的记忆吗
What? You're not gonna obliviate me?

749
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:04,110
当然不会了 你跟我们是一伙儿的
Of course not, you're one of us now!

750
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:33,390
没事了
It's okay.

751
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,000
阿拉霍洞开
Alohomora.

752
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:49,310
芝麻开门
Aberto...

753
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,640
他应该是用更高级的咒语锁了门
He would know a fancy spell to lock his office.

754
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:58,740
好了 现在来看看你的美好回忆吧
Okay, let's get the good stuff out of you.

755
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,490
女巫
Witch!

756
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:33,830
- 它会吃掉我的  - 别慌
- It's just gonna eat me!  - Don't panic!

757
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:35,780
我不慌还能怎么办
What do you suggest I do instead?

758
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,660
跳过来
Jump.

759
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,060
- 疯了吗你  - 跳到它背上
- Are you crazy?  - Jump on him.

760
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:54,230
蒂娜 听我说 我会接住你的
Tina, listen to me. I'll catch you.

761
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,990

我会接住你的
I'll catch you.

有我在 蒂娜 跳
I've got you, Tina. Go!

764
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,380
快走
Come on!

765
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,750
马上就来
Coming through!

766
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:27,510

快
Come on!

769
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,120
- 那是什么  - 蜷翼魔
- What is that thing?  - Swooping Evil.

770
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:44,600

Queenie!

773
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:19,260
你这是要去哪
Where you going?

774
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,660
我生病了 阿伯内西先生
I'm sick, Mr. Abernathy.

775
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,000
又病了啊
Again?

776
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:30,490
你手里提的是什么
Well, what've you got there?

777
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:32,780
女士用品
Ladies things.

778
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:35,620
你要看一下吗 我不介意的
You wanna take a look? I don't mind.

779
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,040
噢老天 不用了 我
Good gravy, no! I...

780
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,030
- 希望你早日康复  - 谢谢你
- You get well now!  - Thanks.

781
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,760
克雷登斯 你找到那个孩子了吗
Credence. Have you found the child?

782
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:03,330
我做不到
I can't.

783
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:05,410
我看看
Show me.

784
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,370
我的孩子 我们越早找到这个孩子
My boy, the sooner we find this child,

785
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:21,360
你便能越快地脱离痛苦
the sooner you can put that pain in the past where it belongs.

786
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:25,950
我想把这个送给你 克雷登斯
I want you to have this, Credence.

787
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:30,070
能让我放心托付它的人不多
I would trust very few with it.

788
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:33,550
很少
Very few.

789
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,280
可是你
But you...

790
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,730
你跟别人不一样
You're different.

791
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,780
只要找到了那个孩子
When you find the child,

792
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,370
碰一下这个标识我便知道 我会来找你
touch this symbol and I will know, and I will come to you.

793
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:55,160
事成之后  你将在巫师界
Do this and you will be honored among wizards.

794
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,260
名垂千古
Forever.

795
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:02,260
这孩子快不行了了 克雷登斯
The child is dying, Credence.

796
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,190
时间紧迫
Time is running out.

797
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:24,220
你祖父养鸽子啊 我祖父养猫头鹰
Your grandfather kept pigeons? Mine bred owls.

798
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:27,590
我以前很喜欢给他们喂食来着
I used to love feeding them.

799
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,540
格雷夫斯一直说最近的混乱是动物引起的
Graves always insisted the disturbances were caused by a beast.

800
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,040
我们得尽早把你的动物找回来
We need to catch all your creatures

801
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,230
这样他就不能拿它们当挡箭牌了
so he can't keep using them as a scapegoat.

802
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:36,920
还剩一只没找到
There's only one still missing.

803
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,840
杜戈尔 我的隐形兽
Dougal, my Demiguise.

804
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:40,550
你还给它起了名字
Dougal?

805
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,930
稍微有点棘手的是
Slight problem is that...

806
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,950
它是隐形的
He's invisible.

807
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,720
- 隐形的  - 对 大部分时间里
- Invisible?  - Yes, most of the time... He does...

808
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:57,340
- 会隐形的东西还怎么抓  - 难上加难
- How do you catch something that...?  - With immense difficulty.

809

- 纳尔拉克  - 你说什么
- Gnarlak!  - Excuse me?

810

纳尔拉克 我还是傲罗时他是我的线人
Gnarlak, he was an informant of mine when I was an Auror!

811
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,590
他曾暗地里进行魔法生物的买卖
He used to trade in magical creatures on the side.

812
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,240
他不会恰好对追踪脚印感兴趣吧
He wouldn't happen to have an interest in paw prints, would he?

813
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,000
一切能卖的东西他都感兴趣
He's interested in anything he can sell.

我看到你抱住了那个第二塞勒姆的男孩

他叫克雷登斯

What are you doin? Credence?

- 妈  - 我不是你妈
- Ma...  - I am not your Ma!

怎么回事
What is this?

889
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,610
尽管隐形兽平时性情温和
So Demiguises are fundamentally peaceful,

890
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,870
但被惹怒了也是会咬人的
but they can give a nasty nip if provoked.

891
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:37,300
你们俩 去那边
You two, head that way.

892
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:40,020
尽力隐藏自己的目的
And try very hard not to be predictable.

893
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,940
那是隐形兽吗
Was that the Demiguise?

894
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:51,020
不 但我觉得那是隐形兽来这儿的目的
No, I think it might be the reason that the Demiguise is here.

895
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:08,260
它的视线能自动分析可能性
Its sight operates on probability,

896
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:11,660
所以它能预测到很近的未来
so it can foresee the most likely immediate future.

897
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:17,730
- 那它是做什么的  - 照顾孩子
- So what's it doing?  - It's babysitting.

898
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:22,190
- 你说什么  - 这是我的错
- What did you just say?  - This is my fault.

899
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:24,830
我以为全找回来了
I thought I had them all,

900
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:27,860
可我数漏了一个
but I must have miscounted.

901
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,170
它是在照顾那玩意儿
It was babysitting that?

902
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,730
鸟蛇可以随意改变体型
Occamies are choranaptyxic.

903
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,220
可以变大到塞满所在的整个空间
So they grow to fill available space.

904

Mummy's here.

905

We need an insect,

906
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,710

any kind of insect and a teapot!

907
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,070
快找个茶壶来
Find a teapot!

They also shrink to fit the available space.

告诉我真相
Tell me the truth.

914

现在逃掉的
Was that everything that

915
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,870
- 真的都找到了吗  - 都找到了
- came out of the case?  - That's everything.

916
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:29,940
这句是真话
And that's the truth.

917
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:37,620
- 她来了  - 回家高兴吗
- Here she comes.  - Happy to be home?

918
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,950
我打赌你一定累了 伙计
Bet you're exhausted, buddy.

919
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:43,880
来吧 就在这儿
Come on. There you go, that's right.

920
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:13,050
没错 我们是得谈谈
Right. I think we need to talk.

921
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,800
我不会让真让他带走你的 皮克特
I wouldn't have let him keep you, Pickett.

922
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,930
皮克 我宁愿失去手也不会抛弃你的
Pick, I would rather chop off my hand than get rid of you.

923
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:25,120
你为了付出了那么多 相信我吧
After everything you have done for me, now come on.

924
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,770
皮克 不是说好不生闷气的吗
Pick, we've talked about sulking before, haven't we?

925
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:31,550
皮克特
Pickett...

926
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,260
求你了 给我个微笑
Come on, give me a smile.

927
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:36,890
皮克特 给我
Pickett, give me a...

928
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,200
好吧 你平时绝对没这么小气
All right. Now, that is beneath you.

929
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,260
纽特
Newt.

930
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,830
- 她是谁  - 谁也不是
- Who is she?  - That's no one.

931
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,510
丽塔·莱斯特兰奇
Leta Lestrange?

932
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:03,620
我听说过他们一家
I've heard of that family.

933
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,640
他们不都有点…你懂的
Aren't they kinda, you know?

934
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,080
请别读我的心
Please don't read my mind.

935
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:22,830
对不起 我说过别读了
Sorry, I asked you not to.

936
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,020
我知道 抱歉
I know, I'm sorry.

937
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:27,650
我就是控制不住
I can't help it.

938
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,190
每当人们伤心时
People are easiest to

939
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:32,520
- 最容易被读心  - 我不伤心
- read when they're hurting.  - I'm not hurting.

940
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,750
总之 事情已经过去很久了
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

941
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:47,490
你们在学校的友谊真的很亲密
That was a real close friendship you had at school.

942
01:31:50,530 --> 01:31:52,330
我们俩都不怎么适合学校生活
Neither of us really fitted in at school.

943
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:56,320
- 所以我俩就变成了  - 变成了挚友

944
01:31:58,890 --> 01:31:59,830
那么多年
For years.

945
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:09,330
她只会索取 你需要也能为你付出的人

946
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:14,060

- What are you two talking about?  - Nothing.

947
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:16,760
- 学校的事  - 对 学校

948
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:21,930
你们刚才说学校 这儿还有学校吗
Did you say school? Is there a school?

949
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:25,570
巫师学校 就在美国
A wizardry school here? In America?

950
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:27,870
那当然 伊法魔尼
Of course, Ilvermorny!

951
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:30,620
它可是全球最棒的魔法学校
It's only the best wizard school in the whole world!

952
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,610
我想你会发现 世界上
I think you'll find the best

953
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:34,100
最好的魔法学校是霍格沃茨
wizarding school in the world is Hogwarts!

954
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:36,720
废话多
Hogwash!

955
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:47,870
危险
Danger.

956
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,380
他能感觉到危险
He senses danger.

957
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,020
默然者来了
The Obscurial was here?

958
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:37,070
她去哪了
Where did she go?

959
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:43,050
救救我 救救我
Help me. Help me.

960
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:48,220
你不是说你还有个妹妹吗
Didn't you tell me you had another sister?

961
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,710
求你救救我

962
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:53,270
你妹妹在哪
Where's your other sister,

963
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:54,560
- 克雷登斯 -求你救救我
- Credence?  - Please, help me.

964
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,090
- 你的小妹妹 她去哪了  - 求你了
- The little one? Where did she go?  - Please...

965
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:03,700
你妹妹现在很危险
Your sister's in grave danger.

966
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:06,570
我们得找到她
We need to find her.

967
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:19,650
- 这是哪  - 妈妈在这里收养了她
- What is this place?  - Ma adopted Modesty out of here.

968
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:21,640
她家里当时有十二个人
From a family of twelve.

969
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:24,000
她很想念他的兄弟姐妹

时常提起他们

971
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,290
她现在在哪
Where is she?

972
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,760
我不知道
I don't know.

973
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,270
你是个聪明人 克雷登斯
You're a Squib, Credence.

974
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:39,810
从我第一次遇见你 我就知道
I could smell it off you the minute I met you.

975
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:41,880
什么
What?

976
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:45,710
你有魔法血统 可你无法施展
You have magical ancestry, but no power.

977
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,620
你说过你会教我
But you said you could teach me.

978
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:49,860
这只能你自己琢磨
You're unteachable.

979
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:53,500
你母亲的死 就是对你的奖赏
Your mother's dead. That's your reward.

980
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:56,190
我受够你了
I'm done with you.

981
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:06,300
莫德丝蒂
Modesty?

982
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,610
莫德丝蒂
Modesty.

983
01:35:21,310 --> 01:35:25,180
不必害怕
There's no need to be afraid.

984
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:29,400
有我和你哥哥克雷登斯在
I'm here with your brother, Credence.

985
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,820
出来吧
Out you come, now.

986
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,690
克雷登斯 我得向你道歉
Credence, I owe you an apology.

987
01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:18,180
我信任了你
I trusted you.

988
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,450
我以为你是我朋友 以为你不一样
I thought you were my friend. That you were different.

989
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:31,490
你能控制住它 克雷登斯
You can control it, Credence.

990
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:39,090
可是我并不想 格雷夫斯先生
But I don't think I want to, Mr. Graves.

991
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:07,170
天哪 是那个什么默然者吗
Jeez. Is that the Obscuriathing?

992
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,760
它比我听说过的所有默然者都强悍
That's more powerful than any Obscurial I have ever heard of.

993
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:19,440
如果我没能回来 帮我照顾好它们
If I don't come back, look after my creatures.

994
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:23,680
所有需要知道的都记录在这了
Everything that you need to know is in there.

995
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:25,530
什么
What?

996
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,250
他们杀不了他
They're not killing it.

997
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,120
纽特 你听到了 照顾好它们
Newt! You heard him, look after them!

998
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,120
- 亲爱的 拿好了  - 不不不
- Keep holda that, honey.  - No, no, no!

999
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:45,510
我不能带上你 让我走吧 雅各布
I can't take you. Please let go of me, Jacob!

1000
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:49,160
你说过我们是一伙儿的
You're the one that said I was one of youse,

1001
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,120
- 对吧  - 这太危险了
- right?  - It's too dangerous.

1002
01:38:22,850 --> 01:38:27,850
被它寄生你居然幸存到现在 克雷登斯
To survive so long, with this inside you, Credence,

1003
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:33,830
这就是奇迹 你就是个奇迹
is a miracle. You are a miracle.

1004
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:39,270
跟我走吧 想想我们俩联手能做多少
Come with me, think of what we could achieve together.

1005
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:55,110
纽特
Newt!

1006
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:56,370
是第二塞勒姆的那个男孩
It's the Second Salem boy.

1007
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:57,770
他才是默然者
He's the Obscurial.

1008
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,160
但他不是孩子了
He's not a child.

1009
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,380
肯定是他的魔力太强大
His power must be so strong,

1010
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,810
不知怎么幸存了下来
he's somehow managed to survive.

1011
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:11,480
纽特 一定要救下他
Newt! Save him.

1012
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,300
格雷夫斯先生
Mr. Graves.

1013
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:35,700
蒂娜 你总是出现在最不该出现的地方
Tina. You're always turning up where you are least wanted.

1014
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:51,420
控制住他 否则我们一旦暴露
Contain this, or we are exposed

1015
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:52,890
便会爆发战争
and it will mean war.

1016
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:04,610
克雷登斯
Credence!

1017
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:07,140
克雷登斯 我能帮你
Credence, I can help you.

1018
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:47,970
- 封锁这里  - 是 长官
- Bar the area.  - Yes, sir.

1019
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:49,450
不允许任何人进来
I don't want anyone else down there!

1020
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,250
克雷登斯
Credence...

1021
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:07,870
你叫克雷登斯 对吧
It's Credence, isn't it?

1022
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,520
我是来帮助你的 克雷登斯
I'm here to help you, Credence.

1023
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:16,290
我不是来伤害你的
I'm not here to hurt you.

1024
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:38,290
我见过和你一样的人
I've met someone just like you,

1025
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:39,150
克雷登斯
Credence.

1026
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:43,450
一个女孩
A girl.

1027
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,920
一个被囚禁的小女孩
A young girl who'd been imprisoned,

1028
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,470
她因为有魔法
she had been locked away

1029
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:53,960
被关了起来 还受到折磨
and she'd been punished for her magic.

1030
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,150
克雷登斯
Credence...

1031
01:43:16,630 --> 01:43:17,950
我能过你那儿去吗
Can I come over to you?

1032
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:22,870
我能过去吗
Can I come over?

1033
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,600
那东西杀了我儿子 我要讨个公道
That thing killed my son. I want justice!

1034
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,420
我要揭露你的真面目以及你的所作所为
I'll expose you for who you are and what you've done.

1035
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:26,910
快看 拍 拍照
Look! Take... Take photos.

1036
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:56,000
克雷登斯
Credence.

1037
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,590
克雷登斯 不要
Credence, no!

1038
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:45,810
别这样做 求你了
Don't do this. Please.

1039
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:48,910
接着说 蒂娜
Keep talking, Tina.

1040
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:54,460
继续说话 他会听你的 他在听
Keep talking to him, he'll listen to you. He's listening.

1041
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,500
我知道那个女人对你做了些什么
I know what that woman did to you.

1042
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:05,590
我知道你备受煎熬
I know that you've suffered.

1043
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:10,400
你不能再这样下去了
You need to stop this now.

1044
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:15,180
我和纽特会保护你的
Newt and I will protect you.

1045
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:22,030
这个男人 他在利用你
This man... He is using you.

1046
01:46:22,030 --> 01:46:23,640
别听她的 克雷登斯
Don't listen to her, Credence.

1047
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:26,200
我是想给你自由
I want you to be free.

1048
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:31,530
- 没事的  - 这就对了
- It's all right.  - That's it.

1049
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:44,430
- 别 你们会吓到他的  - 放下魔杖
- Don't, you'll frighten him.  - Wands down!

1050
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:47,880
敢伤他的人我要他好看 克雷登斯
Anyone harms him, they'll answer to me. Credence!

1051
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:49,210
克雷登斯
Credence...

1052
01:46:51,410 --> 01:46:53,360
- 不  - 不
- No.  - No!

1053
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:31,800
克雷登斯 你们这些傻子
Credence... You fools.

1054
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,840
知道你们做了什么吗
Do you realize what you've done?

1055
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:38,920
杀死默然者是我的命令
The Obscurial was killed on my orders,

1056
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,780
- 格雷夫斯先生  - 是啊
- Mr. Graves.  - Yes.

1057
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:44,650
这一点历史不会忘记的 会长女士
And history will surely note that, Madam President.

1058
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:47,460
今晚在这里发生的事不公道
What was done here tonight was not right!

1059
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,120
是他杀死了那个麻鸡
He was responsible for the death of a No-Maj.

1060
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:52,390
他带来了暴露我们的危险
He risked the exposure of our community.

1061
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:54,260
他违反了我们最神圣的法律
He has broken one of our most sacred laws.

1062
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:58,000
让我们像水沟里的老鼠般躲藏的法律
A law that has us scuttling like rats in the gutter!

1063
01:47:58,070 --> 01:48:00,680
迫使我们压抑本性的法律
A law that demands that we conceal our true nature!

1064
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,970
让我们活在恐惧的阴影下的法律
A law that directs those under its dominion to cower in fear

1065
01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:05,820
唯恐我们被发现
lest we risk discovery!

1066
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:10,390
我问你 会长女士
I ask you, Madam President.

1067
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:13,450
我问你们所有人
I ask all of you...

1068
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:17,450
这法律保护的是谁
Who does this law protect?

1069
01:48:19,870 --> 01:48:21,050
我们
Us?

1070
01:48:23,290 --> 01:48:24,650
还是他们
Or them?

1071
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:33,950
我拒绝继续遵守这项法律
I refuse to bow down any longer.

1072
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:35,220
傲罗们
Aurors,

1073
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:38,360
收回格雷夫斯先生的魔杖
I'd like you to relieve Mr. Graves of his wand

1074
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:40,320
并把他押解回来
and escort him back to...

1075
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:14,850
速速飞来
Accio.

1076
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:25,960
原形显现
Revelio.

1077
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:53,170
你觉得你能困住我吗
Do you think you can hold me?

1078
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:56,780
我们会尽全力的
We'll do our best,

1079
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,710
格林德沃先生
Mr. Grindelwald.

1080
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:18,730
后会有期
Will we die, just a little?

1081
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:35,840
我看这东西还需要某人照看
I figured somebody oughta keep an eye on this thing.

1082
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:42,000
谢谢你
Thank you.

1083
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:44,080
我们深表歉意 斯卡曼德先生
We owe you an apology, Mr. Scamander.

1084
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:47,760
但是魔法社区被曝光了
But the magical community is exposed!

1085
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:51,320
我们不能抹掉整个城市的记忆
We cannot obliviate an entire city.

1086
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,650
其实 我觉得可以
Actually, I think we can.

1087
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:29,640
我还打算带你一起去亚利桑那州呢
I was intending to wait until we got to Arizona,

1088
01:51:32,910 --> 01:51:34,070
但现在看来
but it seems like now

1089
01:51:34,070 --> 01:51:35,480
你是我们唯一的希望了 弗兰克
you are our only hope, Frank.

1090
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,290
我也会想你的
I'll miss you too.

1091
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:10,360
你知道该怎么办
You know what you've got to do.

1092
01:54:38,310 --> 01:54:39,800
他们会忘记所有的事情
They won't remember anything.

1093
01:54:41,010 --> 01:54:44,090
那个毒液有很强的失忆功能
That venom has incredibly powerful obliviative properties.

1094
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,960
我们欠你一个大人情 斯卡曼德先生
We owe you a great debt, Mr. Scamander.

1095
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:55,710
现在 赶紧把你的箱子弄出纽约
Now, get that case out of New York.

1096
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:57,750
遵命 会长女士
Yes, Madam President.

1097
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:06,370
那个麻鸡还在这吗
Is that No-Maj still here?

1098
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:14,620
一忘皆空 不能有特例
Obliviate him. There can be no exceptions.

1099
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:19,020
对不起 就算只有一个人知道
I'm sorry, but even one witness.

1100
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:20,480
你知道法律的
You know the law.

1101
01:55:24,530 --> 01:55:25,980
你们自己告别吧
I'll let you say good-bye.

1102
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:42,950
这是最好的结局
This is for the best.

1103
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:45,770
没错 我本来
Yeah, I was,

1104
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:49,020
本来就不该在这
I was never even supposed to be here.

1105
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:54,840
我本不该知道任何事情
I was never supposed to know any of this.

1106
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,400
大家都知道纽特把我留在他身边
Everybody knows Newt only kept me around

1107
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:02,750
只是因为
because...

1108
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:08,050
纽特 话说你为什么把我留在身边
Newt, why did you keep me around?

1109
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:10,850
因为我喜欢你
Because I like you.

1110
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:15,550
你是我的朋友
Because you're my friend

1111
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:17,950
我永远都不会忘记
and I'll never forget

1112
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:19,530
你是如何帮助我的 雅各布
how you helped me, Jacob.

1113
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,280
我会跟着你的
I'll come with you.

1114
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,100
我们去别的地方 我们浪迹天涯
We'll go somewhere, we'll go anywhere.

1115
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:34,520
我再也找不到像你一样的人了
See, I ain't never gonna find anyone like you.

1116
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:39,050
很多人都像我一样
There's loads like me.

1117
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:41,710
不 不
No. No.

1118
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,840
只有你像你一样
There's only one like you.

1119
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:52,430
我得走了
I gotta go.

1120
01:56:57,500 --> 01:57:01,070
- 雅各布  - 没事 没事的
- Jacob!  - It's okay. It's okay.

1121
01:57:04,010 --> 01:57:05,180
没事
It's okay.

1122
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:11,740
就像从梦中醒来一样 对吧
It's just like waking up, right?

1123
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:16,780
很抱歉 对不起
So sorry, sorry!

1124
01:59:34,230 --> 01:59:35,770
亲爱的科瓦斯基先生
Dear Mr. Kowalski,

1125
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:38,270
您在罐头厂实在是大材小用
you are wasted in a canning factory.

1126
01:59:41,450 --> 01:59:43,210
请把这些鸟蛇的蛋壳
Please take these Occamy eggshells

1127
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:44,650
作为点心屋的担保
as collateral for your bakery.

1128
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:46,380
一位好心人
A well-wisher.

1129
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,560
- 这几天  - 我也觉得
- It's been...  - Hasn't it?

1130
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:21,120
听着 纽特 我要感谢你
Listen, Newt, I wanted to thank you.

1131
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:23,100
为什么感谢我
What on earth for?

1132
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:26,900
你知道的 要不是你
Well, you know, if you hadn't said

1133
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,990
替我跟皮奎里女士说好话
all those nice things to Madam Picquery about me,

1134
02:00:28,990 --> 02:00:31,320
我现在也不可能重新成为傲罗
I wouldn't be back on the investigative team now.

1135
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:33,750
非要被调查的话
Well, I can't think of

1136
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:36,010
被任何人都不如被你调查好
anyone that I'd rather have investigating me.

1137
02:00:39,150 --> 02:00:42,750
- 最好还是尽量别被调查吧  - 我会的
- Try not to need investigating for a bit.  - I will.

1138
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,780
从今以后我想过安定的生活
Quiet life for me from now on.

1139
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:47,240
回去之后
Back to the Ministry.

1140
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:50,210
- 我会发表我的作品  - 我很期待
- Deliver my manuscript.  - I'll look out for it.

1141
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:53,230
《神奇动物在哪里》
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

1142
02:00:59,570 --> 02:01:01,820
丽塔·莱斯特兰奇喜欢读书吗
Does Leta Lestrange like to read?

1143
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:08,130
- 谁  - 你随身携带的照片里的姑娘
- Who?  - The girl whose picture you carry.

1144
02:01:10,710 --> 02:01:11,710
人是会变的
I don't really know

1145
02:01:11,710 --> 02:01:16,650
现在丽塔喜欢什么我也不知道
what Leta likes these days, because people change.

1146
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:19,160
- 没错  - 我反正是变了
- Yes.  - I've changed.

1147
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:24,570
我想 或许一点点吧
I think. Maybe a little.

1148
02:01:34,830 --> 02:01:37,050
可以的话 能允许我送你一本新书吗
I'll send you a copy of my book, if I may.

1149
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:39,320

I'd like that.

1150
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,200
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1151
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:02,470
如果是我亲自送来给你呢
How would you feel if I gave you your copy in person?

1152
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:06,760
那样更好
I'd like that.

1153

你的创意来自哪里啊
Where do you get your ideas from,

1155
02:03:30,670 --> 02:03:32,650
- 科瓦斯基先生  - 我也不知道
- Mr. Kowalski?  - I don't know.

1156
02:03:32,670 --> 02:03:36,220
我也不明白 突发奇想吧
I don't know. They just come.

1157
