2
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,000
爱在黎明破晓前

3
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:33,000
两夫妻吵嘴中……[德语]

4
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,940
你知道他们在争论什么吗？
Do you have any idea what they were arguing about?

5
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,570
你会说英语吗？
Do you speak English?

6
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,670
会
Yeah.

7
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,610
不过抱歉，我的德语不太好
No. I'm sorry,my German is not very good.

8
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,190
你听说过年龄会导致夫妻间失去互相倾听的能力吗？
Have you heard that as couples age they lose their ability to hear each other?

9
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,380
没有
No.

10
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,130
理论上男人会丧失听高音的能力…
Supposedly, men lose their ability to hear high-pitched sounds...

11
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,320
…而女人会丧失低音听力
...and women lose hearing in the low end.

12
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,130
这是一种相互抵制
I guess they nullify each other.

13
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,500
我想是的，自然法则是让夫妻白头偕老…
I guess. Nature's way of allowing couples to grow old together...

14
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,570
…而不是互相残杀
...without killing each other.

15
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,070
你在看什么书？
What are you reading?

16
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,440
哦
Oh, yeah.

17
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,480
你呢？
How about you?

18
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,390
我打算去休息室
I was thinking about going to the lounge car.

19
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,640
- 你愿意和我一起去吗？  - 好啊
- Would you like to come with me?  - Yeah.

20
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,840
好的
Okay.

21
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,350
你的英语怎么说得这么好？
How do you speak such good English?

22
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,220
我在洛杉矶上过一个暑期班
I went to school for a summer in Los Angeles.

23
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,990
- 坐这好吗？  - 好的
- It's fine here?  - Yeah, this is good.

24
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,170
我还在伦敦呆过一段时间
And I spent some time in London.

25
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,140
- 哇  - 那你的英语怎么说得这样好呢？
- Wow.  - How do you speak such good English?

26
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,000
我？我是美国人
Me? I'm American.

27
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,280
- 你是美国人？你肯定？  - 当然
- You're American? Are you sure?  - Yeah.

28
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,510
开个玩笑，我早知道你是美国人
No, I'm joking.I knew you were American.

29
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,340
而且你不会说任何其他语言，是吗？
And you don't speak any other language, right?

30
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,820
是的，是的，我知道你的意思
Yeah, yeah.I get it, I get it.

31
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,220
我是拙劣，弱智，粗俗的美国人…
I'm the crude, dumb,vulgar American...

32
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,160
…不会说其他语言，没有自己的文化，但我尝试过
...who doesn't speak other languages,who has no culture. But I tried.

33
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,990
我在高中学过法语，我第一次去巴黎…
I took French in high school.When I first got to Paris...

34
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,570
…在地铁站排队时
...I stood in line at the metro station.

35
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,960
一直练习…(法语)
I was practicing.

36
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,700
不管是什么
Whatever.

37
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,410
轮到我时，我看着那个售票员…
And I get up there,and I look at this woman...

38
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,550
…脑子一片空白，然后我说“我要一张票去…”
...and my mind goes blank. And I say,"I need a ticket to get to...."

39
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,220
话说回来…
So anyway....

40
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,450
你是去哪？
So where are you headed?

41
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,720
回巴黎
Well, back to Paris.

42
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,230
- 我下周就要开学了  - 你还在上学？什么学校？
- My classes start next week.  - You're still in school? Where?

43
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,520
巴黎大学，听说过吗？
La Sorbonne. You know?

44
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,790
当然
Sure.

45
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,330
你从布达佩斯来？
You're coming from Budapest?

46
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,570
- 我去看过我的祖母  - 她人好吗？
- I was visiting my grandmother.  - Oh. How is she?

47
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,300
挺好的
She's okay.

48
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,670
- 身体还好吧？  - 还不错
- She's all right?  - She's fine.

49
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,010
- 你呢？你去哪？  - 我去维也纳
- How about you? Where are you going?  - I'm going to vienna.

50
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,340
维也纳？那里怎么样？
vienna?What's there?

51
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,750
不知道，我明天就会离开
No idea.I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

52
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,510
你在渡假？
You're on holiday?

53
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,090
要知道我也不清楚这算不算渡假
I don't really know what I'm on.You know?

54
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,600
我只是四处旅行，坐了两三个星期的火车
I've just been traveling around,riding trains for two or three weeks.

55
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,700
是去拜访朋友还是纯粹的旅行？
You were visiting friends or just on your own?

56
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,430
我有个朋友在马德里，不过…
I had a friend in Madrid, but....

57
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,170
- 马德里，那儿很漂亮  - 我有张全欧火车优惠票…
- Madrid, that's nice.  - I got a Eurail pass...

58
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,470
…就是这样
...is what I did.

59
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,800
不错的理由
hat's great.

60
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,580
那这次环欧旅行对你有帮助吗？
So has this trip around Europe been good for you?

61
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,690
是的，当然，它…它很有快感
Yeah, sure. It's been....It sucked.

62
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,580
什么？
What?

63
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,680
它有它的…
It's had its....

64
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,530
这么说吧，坐上几个礼拜来看窗外的景色…
I'll tell you, sitting for weeks on end looking out the window...

65
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,990
…感觉的确很不错
...has actually been kind of great.

66
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,020
你是指什么？
What do you mean?

67
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,970
你知道的，比如说…
Well, you know, for instance...

68
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,610
…会想到一些平时想不到的想法
...you have ideas that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

69
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,830
- 什么想法？  - 想听一个吗？
- What kind of ideas?  - Want to hear one?

70
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,030
- 说说看  - 好的
- Tell me.  - All right.

71
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,180
我有这个想法是因为一个电视节目
I have this idea, okay,for a television show.

72
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,080
我有个朋友是《享受电视》栏目的制作人
Some friends of mine are cable-access producers.

73
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,880
知道它的运作方式吗？
Do you know what that is?

74
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,120
他们播放任何人制作的低成本节目
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,and they have to put it on.

75
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,490
我的想法是让一个节目二十四小时播放并持续一年
I have this idea for a show that lasts 24 hours a day for a year straight.

76
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,920
你要做的就是找到…
What you do is you get...

77
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,470
…来自世界各地不同城市的三百六十五个人…
...365 people from cities all over the world...

78
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,660
…为每个人拍一部二十四小时的生活纪录片
...to do these 24-hour documents of real time.

79
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,470
捕捉真实的生活画面
Capturing life as it's lived.

80
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,630
知道吗，可以从一个人早上起床开始…
You know, it would start with a guy waking up in the morning...

81
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,870
…舒舒服服洗个澡…
...and taking the long shower...

82
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,810
…吃点早餐，喝点咖啡…
...eating a little breakfast,making a little coffee...

83
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,150
…看看报纸…
...reading the paper....

84
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,650
等一下，全都是大家见鬼的生活中每天那些平淡无聊的琐事吗？
Wait. All those mundane,boring things everybody has to do every day of their fucking life?

85
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,950
是“诗意的日复一日的生活”
I was going to say,"The poetry of day-to-day life."

86
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,650
你有你的说法，我有我的说法
You say it your way.I'll say it my way.

87
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,860
- 可以这样想…  - 有谁会看呢？
- Think of it like this...  - Who's gonna watch?

88
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,200
可以这样想，一只狗在太阳底下睡觉…
Think about it like this. Why is it that a dog sleeping in the sun...

89
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,060
…画面很美是不是？是的，确实很美
...is so beautiful?It is. It's beautiful.

90
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,870
但一个人从提款机取钱…
But a guy taking money from a bank machine...

91
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,100
…为什么就显得无聊了呢？
...looks like a complete moron?

92
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,510
这就象国家地理杂志的节目，只不过拍的是人
So it's like a National GEographic program, but on people.

93
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,550
正是
Yeah.

94
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,580
觉得怎么样？
What do you think?

95
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,650
是的，我明白，就象“无聊二十四小时”…对不起…
Yeah, I can see it.Like, 24 boring hours... Sorry...

96
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,310
…在一段三分钟的性交场面之后主角就睡着了
...and a three-minute sex scene where he falls asleep right after.

97
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,560
对啊，那会是一段很不错的情节
Yeah, and that would be a great episode.

98
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
人们会谈论这段情节
People would talk about that episode.

99
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,240
如果愿意的话你可以和朋友在巴黎拍上一集
You and your friends could do one in Paris if you wanted.

100
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,240
我不知道，关键是地理分布问题让我头疼
I don't know. The key, the thing that haunts me is the distribution.

101
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,380
要一个城镇接一个城镇地拍摄以保证它的持续性
Getting these tapes from town to town so it would play continuously.

102
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,240
因为它必须不停地播放，否则就没有意义了
Because it would have to play all the time, or it just wouldn't work.

103
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,420
谢谢
Thank you.

104
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,050
谢谢
Thanks.

105
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,730
知道吗？没有《服务指南》
You know what?Not service oriented.

106
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,700
只是一份《欧洲观察》
Just an observation about Europe.

107
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:20,670
我父母从没真正谈论过我会恋爱结婚生孩子的可能性
My parents never really spoke of the possibility of my falling in love or getting married or having children.

108
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,010
甚至我还是小女孩时…
Even as a little girl...

109
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,670
…他们就要我考虑未来的职业，例如…
...they wanted me to think as a future career as a, you know...

110
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,080
…室内设计，律师或诸如此类
...interior designer or lawyer or something like that.

111
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,090
我对我爸爸说我想以写作为业
I'd say to my dad, "I want to be a writer."

112
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,020
他就说做记者
And he'd say, "Journalist."

113
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,760
我说想开个流浪猫收容所，他就说做兽医
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats. He'd say, "veterinarian."

114
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,600
我说想做演艺工作，他就说做电视播音员
I'd say I wanted to be an actress.He'd say, "TV newscaster."

115
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,800
这使得我的理想抱负慢慢转变成了…
It was this constant conversion of my fanciful ambition into these...

116
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,340
…现实的赚钱手段
...practical moneymaking ventures.

117
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,170
我很小时就善于洞察谎言
I had a good bullshit detector when I was a kid.

118
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,870
当别人说谎时我总是能知道
I always knew when they were lying to me.

119
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,110
到了高中，我决定…
By high school, I was dead set...

120
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,520
…听听大家认为我这辈子该做什么…
...on listening to what everybody thought I should do with my life...

121
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,520
…然后反其道而行之
...and doing the opposite.

122
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:15,660
没有谁会当真，我只是不喜欢别人将想法强加在我头上
Nobody was ever mean about it.I just could never get very excited about other people's ambitions for my life.

123
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,900
但你知道吗？如果父母从不…
But you know what?If your parents never...

124
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,070
…在任何事上完全否定你，而是友好地给予支持…
...fully contradict you about anything and are nice and supportive...

125
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,960
对
Right.

126
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,270
…那会让你很难抱怨
...it makes it even harder to officially complain.

127
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,350
哪怕他们做得并不对，这是一种被动攻击
Even when they're wrong,it's this passive-aggressive shit.

128
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,950
你明白吗？
You know what I mean?

129
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,410
我讨厌这样
I hate it.

130
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,410
非常反感
I really hate it.

131
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,420
知道吗，尽管这种种不快…
Well, you know, despite all that kind of bullshit...

132
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,290
…总是会随之而来
...that comes along with it...

133
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,660
…但我记得童年就象…
...I remember childhood as...

134
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,560
…一段魔幻时光
...this magical time.

135
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,710
真的，记得我妈妈第一次跟我说到死亡
I do. I remember when my mother first told me about death.

136
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,670
我的曾祖母去世，我们全家去弗罗里达奔丧
My great-grandmother had died, and my family had visited them in Florida.

137
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,940
当时我才三岁或三岁半
I was about 3, 3 1/2 years old.

138
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,580
我在后院玩耍时…
Anyway, I was in the back yard playing...

139
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,380
…姐姐教我怎样拿浇花的水管…
...and my sister had just taught me how to take the garden hose...

140
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,750
…就是象这样子捏着…
...and do it in such a way that...

141
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,720
…喷出的水雾会在阳光下形成一道彩虹
...it sprayed into the sun and would make a rainbow.

142
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,090
于是我那样做…
And so I was doing that...

143
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,460
…透过水雾，我看到了曾祖母
...and through the mist,I could see my grandmother.

144
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,970
她就站在那，冲着我微笑
And she was just standing there,smiling at me.

145
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,330
我愣在那很长时间
And I held it there for a long time...

146
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,340
…并且看着她
...and I looked at her.

147
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,810
最终我松开了喷嘴
And then finally, I let go of the nozzle, you know?

148
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,980
然后扔下水管…
And then I dropped the hose...

149
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,910
…她就消失了
...and she disappeared.

150
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,480
于是我跑回屋里告诉父母
And so I run back inside and tell my parents.

151
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,190
他们让我坐下，然后训斥了我一顿…
And they sit me down and give me this big rap on how...

152
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,490
…人死了之后你绝不可能再见到他们，那只是我的幻觉
...when people die, you never see them again, and how I'd imagined it.

153
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,220
但我知道我看到了什么，并且为之高兴
But I knew what I'd seen.I was glad I saw that.

154
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,390
我以后绝不会再看到类似的情景，但我不知道
I've never seen anything like that since. But I don't know.

155
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,670
那让我有点明白世事都是那么无法解释
It just kind of let me know how ambiguous everything was.

156
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,310
包括死亡
Even death.

157
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,980
你该庆幸你能这样看待死亡
You're lucky you can have this attitude toward death.

158
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,850
我想我时刻都在害怕死亡
I think I'm afraid of death 24 hours a day.

159
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,490
真的，所以我才会坐火车
I swear. I mean, that's why I'm in a train right now.

160
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,350
我可以乘飞机去巴黎，但我害怕
I could've flown to Paris,but I'm scared.

161
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,860
- 不会吧  - 我控制不了
- Oh, come on.  - I can't help it.

162
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,460
我知道统计显示“不，不，不，它很安全”
I know the statistics say,"Na, na, na, it's safer." Whatever.

163
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,790
但我乘飞机时就会看到爆炸
When I'm in a plane,I can see the explosion.

164
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,300
我看到我从云端坠落
I can see me falling through the clouds.

165
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,770
我非常害怕那几秒钟的意识…
And I'm so scared of those few seconds of consciousness...

166
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,380
…在临死之前，你知道自己快要死了的时候
...before you die.When you know you're gonna die.

167
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,580
我总忍不住会这样想
I can't stop thinking that way.

168
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,220
那让人筋疲力竭
It's exhausting.

169
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,980
是的，没错
Yeah, I bet.

170
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,990
真的筋疲力竭
Really exhausting.

171
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,360
- 我想这是维也纳了  - 是的
- I think this is vienna.  - Yeah.

172
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,400
- 你在这下，是吗？  - 是的，真扫兴
- You get off here, no?  - Yeah, what a drag.

173
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,300
早认识你就好了，我很喜欢和你聊天
I wish I'd met you earlier.I really like talking to you.

174
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,840
我也是
Yeah, me too.

175
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,770
很高兴能认识你
It was really nice of you too.

176
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,870
我有个无疑是疯狂的想法，但要是不问你的话…
I have an admittedly insane idea,but if I don't ask you this...

177
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,100
…我下半辈子都会耿耿于怀的
...it'll haunt me the rest of my life.

178
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,040
是什么？
What?

179
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,020
我想继续跟你聊天，尽管我对你一无所知…
I want to keep talking to you.I have no idea what your situation is...

180
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,960
…但我觉得我们似乎…
...but I feel like we have some kind of...

181
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,590
似曾相识，同意吗？
...connection. Right?

182
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,950
是的，我同意
Yeah. Me too.

183
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,190
那就好，是这样
Right. Great.Here's the deal.

184
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,800
跟我一起下车游览维也纳
Get off here in vienna and come check out the town.

185
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,660
- 什么？  - 来吧，肯定很有意思
- What?  - Come on. It'll be fun.

186
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,800
- 来吧  - 我们做些什么？
- Come on.  - What would we do?

187
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,600
不知道，我只知道我的飞机是上午九点半
I don't know. All I know is I catch a flight tomorrow morning at 9:30...

188
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,180
…而且我没钱住旅馆了，所以只好到处走走…
...and I can't afford a hotel,so I was going to walk around...

189
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,250
…如果你和我同行会更有意思
...and it'd be more fun if you came with me.

190
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,180
如果你觉得我不正常，你可以改乘下一班火车
And if I turn out to be a psycho,just get on the next train.

191
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,620
好吧，好吧，设想一下
All right, all right.Think of it like this.

192
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,720
十年二十年之后，懂吗？
Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?

193
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,090
你结婚之后
And you're married.

194
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,130
你的婚姻失去了曾经有过的活力
Only your marriage doesn't have that same energy it used to have.

195
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,330
你开始责备你的丈夫
You start to blame your husband.

196
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,470
你回想你一生中曾遇见过的所有男人…
You think about all those guys you've met in your life...

197
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,330
…设想嫁给他们中的一个会发生什么
...and what might've happened if you'd picked up with one of them.

198
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,530
我就是其中之一，就是我
I'm one of those guys.That's me.

199
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,610
就当这是个时空旅行…
So think of this as time travel...

200
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,750
…来到现在，看看你当时错过了什么
...from then to now to find out what you're missing out on.

201
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:04,080
那会有极大的帮助，你会发现并未错过任何东西
What this could be is a gigantic favor to you and your husband to find out you're not missing anything.

202
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,280
我只是个和他一样的失败者，缺乏目标，无所事事
I'm just as big a loser as he is.Unmotivated. Boring.

203
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,120
你做了正确的选择，为此而开心
You made the right choice.You're happy.

204
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,470
我去拿我的包
Let me get my bag.

205
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,260
我们该找个地方寄存行李
We should get a locker for all this.

206
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,500
你叫什么？
What's your name?

207
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,830
我吗？
My name?

208
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,570
杰西，实际上是詹姆斯，但大家都叫我杰西
Jesse. James, actually,but everybody calls me Jesse.

209
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,940
那就是杰西-詹姆斯，对吗？
You mean, Jesse James, no?

210
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,440
不，就是杰西
No. No, just Jesse.

211
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,670
我叫塞琳娜
I'm Celine.

212
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,820
这座桥真漂亮
This is a nice bridge.

213
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,290
是的
Yeah.

214
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,230
感觉怪怪的
This is kind of weird.

215
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,170
是吗？我觉得有点尴尬
Isn't it? I mean,I feel a little awkward.

216
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,180
- 但没关系不是吗？  - 是的，这非常棒
- But it's all right. Right?  - Yeah, this is great.

217
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,150
- 找些地方看看吧  - 好的，我们找找看
- Let's go to some places.  - Yeah, let's go to some places.

218
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,840
- 我去问问这些人  - 好的
- Let's ask these guys.  - Okay.

219
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,420
抱歉，打扰一下
Excuse me. Excuse me?

220
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,350
你们会说英语吗？
SprEchEn siE English?

221
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,020
- 当然会  - 能不能换成你说德语？
- Ja. Of course.  - Do you speak German for a change?

222
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,020
- 什么？  - 开个玩笑
- What?  - No, it was a joke.

223
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,030
我们今天刚到维也纳，想找些有意思的地方看看
We just got into vienna today, and we' re looking for something fun to do.

224
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,960
例如博物馆，展览会…
Like museums, exhibitions....

225
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,600
但最近博物馆没什么意思
But museums are not that funny anymore these days.

226
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,110
他们马上就要关门了，你们会在这逗留多久？
They are closing right now.How long are you going to be here?

227
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,500
就一个晚上
Just for tonight.

228
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,850
你们为什么来维也纳？你们想看些什么？
Why did you come to vienna?What could you be expecting?

229
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,050
我们在渡蜜月
We' re on honeymoon.

230
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,340
是的，她怀孕了，我们不得不结婚…
Yeah, she got pregnant,we had to get married....

231
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,020
得了吧，你不懂撒谎
I don't believe you.You're a bad liar.

232
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,900
我们有场演出，很乐意邀请你们观看
This is a play we're both in.We would like to invite you.

233
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,400
你们是演员？
You're actors?

234
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,800
不是专业的，只是业余爱好
Not professional.Part-time for fun.

235
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,130
是关于一头母牛和寻找它的印第安人
It's a play about a cow and Indians searching for it.

236
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,900
另外还有政客，墨西哥人…
There are also politicians, Mexicans...

237
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,050
俄罗斯人，共产主义者…
Russians, communists....

238
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,210
- 用真正的母牛表演吗？  - 不，是由一个演员扮演
- You have a real cow on stage?  - No, an actor in a cow costume.

239
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,320
- 他演母牛  - 是的，我演母牛
- He's the cow.  - Yes, I am the cow.

240
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,650
- 但这头牛有点古怪  - 它得了一种病
- And the cow's a bit weird.  - The cow has a disease.

241
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,260
它的行为有点怪异，象只狗
She's acting a bit strange.Like a dog.

242
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,090
有人扔根棍子的话，它会去叼回来
If someone throws a stick,she fetches it.

243
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,530
还能用蹄子抽烟什么的
And she can smoke with hoofs and everything.

244
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,560
- 真有意思  - 看，这个就是地址
- Great.  - As you see, there is the address.

245
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,500
在第二区
It's in the second district.

246
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,300
普拉特附近，知道是什么吗？
Near the Prater. You know it?

247
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,440
那个大摩天轮吗？我们会去的
The big Ferris wheel?We should go. We should.

248
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,170
你们可以在开演之前先去普拉特
Perhaps you can go to the Prater before the play.

249
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,210
演出是二十一点半开始
It starts at 2130.

250
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,710
- 二十一点半？  - 就是晚上九点半
- 2130?   - It's at 9:30.

251
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,940
- 晚上九点半  - 好的
- 9:30.  - Oh, right.

252
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,880
这场戏叫什么？
What's the name of this play?

253
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,180
翻译过来就是《带给我威尔明顿的母牛角》
It translates as "Bring Me the Horns of Wilmington's Cow."

254
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,480
我就是威尔明顿的牛
I'm Wilmington's cow.

255
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,460
- 好的  - 太棒了
- All right.  - Great.

256
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,750
- 你们会来吗？  - 尽量吧
- You'll be there?  - We'll try.

257
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,760
我是母牛
I'm the cow.

258
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,970
再见
Goodbye.

259
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,020
我有个主意，你准备好没有？
I got an idea. Are you ready?

260
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,890
是个问答游戏，我们已经互相有所了解
It's Q and A time.We've known each other a little while.

261
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,090
我们是同伴了，所以可以相互问几个直接的问题
We're stuck together, so we'll ask each other a few direct questions.

262
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,420
行吗？
All right?

263
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,700
- 我们互相提问？  - 但你必须老实回答
- We ask each other questions?  - And you have to answer honestly.

264
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,670
- 当然  - 好的
- Of course.  - Okay.

265
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,670
好的，第一个问题
All right, first question.

266
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,070
- 你问  - 是的，我要求你…
- You.  - Yes, I am going to ask you.

267
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,310
描述一下第一次性经验是什么感觉
Describe for me your first sexual feelings towards a person.

268
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,550
我第一次的感觉？我的天
My first sexual feelings?Oh, my God.

269
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,220
我知道，我知道
I know. I know.

270
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,450
让-马克-弗勒里
Jean-Marc Fleury.

271
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,820
让-马克-弗勒里？
Jean-Marc Fleury?

272
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,060
我们一起参加夏令营，他是个游泳运动员
We were at this summer camp together,and he was a swimmer.

273
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,670
有一头被氯漂白的头发和绿眼睛
He had bleached-out chlorine hair and green eyes...

274
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,130
为了提高成绩他刮掉了腿上和手臂上的毛
...and to improve his times,he'd shave his legs and arms.

275
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,770
- 真恶心  - 就象只光洁的海豚
- That's disgusting.  - He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

276
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,200
我的朋友艾玛对他很着迷
My friend Emma had a big crush on him.

277
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,850
有一天，我穿过营地回我的房间
So one day, I was cutting across the field back to my room...

278
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,780
他走到我身边，我告诉他
...and he came walking up beside me.I told him...

279
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,380
“你该和艾玛约会，她对你很着迷”
..."You should date Emma.She has a big crush on you."

280
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,150
但他转过身对我说
And he turned to me and said...

281
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,220
“那太糟了，因为我对你很着迷”
..."Well, that's too bad, because I have a big crush on you."

282
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,590
是的，那真让我感到意外
So, yeah, it really scared the hell out of me...

283
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,990
…因为我觉得他太优秀
...because I thought he was so fine.

284
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,170
然后他正式向我提出约会，我假装不喜欢他
Then he officially asked me on a date.I pretended I didn't like him.

285
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,710
要知道我很害怕自己可能做的事
You know, I was so afraid of what I might do, you know.

286
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,810
我去看了几次他的游泳比赛
So I went to see him swim a few times at the competition.

287
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,040
他很性感，真的，我是说非常性感
And he was so sexy. Really.I mean, really sexy.

288
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,750
那个夏季末我们写下了一些爱的宣言
We wrote these little declarations of love at the end of the summer...

289
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,360
我们保证要一直通信
...and, you know, promised we would keep writing forever...

290
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,820
还有要尽快再见面
...and meet again very soon and...

291
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,090
见了吗？
Did you?

292
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,790
当然没有
Of course not.

293
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,860
我可以告诉你我是个非常棒的游泳选手
Then this is the opportune time to tell you I'm a fantastic swimmer.

294
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,670
- 真的吗？  - 当然
- Really?   - Yeah.

295
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,910
- 我会记录下来  - 没问题
- I make note of that.  - Okay.

296
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,580
- 现在轮到我了吧？  - 是的，轮到你了
- So it's my turn. No?  - Yes, your turn.

297
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,010
问吧
Hit me.

298
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,710
你曾经恋爱过吗？
Have you ever been in love?

299
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,480
是的
Yes.

300
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,810
下一个问题
Next question.

301
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,080
- 是什么…  - 等等
- What was the...  - Wait a minute.

302
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,660
- 一个字就算是回答？  - 怎么不算？
- So I can give one-word answers?  - Why not?

303
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,730
我可是详细描述过我初次的性经验
After I went into detail about my sexual feelings?

304
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,390
因为问题不同，我可以回答性体验的事
They' re different questions. I could answer the sexual-feelings thing.

305
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,300
但你要知道，爱…如果我问你是否恋爱过你会怎么回答？
But, you know, love... I mean,what if I asked you about love?

306
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,270
我会说假话，但我至少会编造一个美妙的故事
I would have lied, but at least I would have made up a great story.

307
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,070
爱是个复杂的问题，明白吗？
Love is a complex issue, you know?

308
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,010
我想是的，我告诉过一些人我爱他们，而且我是认真的
I mean, yes, I've told somebody that I love them, and I've meant it.

309
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,450
但爱是完全无私的付出吗？
But was it totally unselfish,giving love?

310
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,550
爱是一件美好的事吗？
Was it a beautiful thing?

311
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,810
不完全是，它就象，爱…
Not really. You know, it's like, love....

312
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,220
我想我无法说清
I mean, I don't know.

313
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,790
你明白吗？
You know?

314
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,560
- 是的，我明白你的意思  - 至于性体验…
- Yeah. I know what you mean.  - But as far as sexual feelings go...

315
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,630
…是开始于一种迷恋性的关系…
...it started with an obsessive relationship...

316
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,860
…是和七八年的七月小姐，你知道《花花公子》杂志吗？
...with Miss July, 1978.Do you know Playboy magazine?

317
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,400
- 听说过  - 知道克里斯托吗？
- I've heard of it.  - You know Crystal?

318
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,330
你不知道克里斯托？哈，我认识她
You don't know Crystal?Well, I knew Crystal.

319
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,170
该轮到我了？
Is it my turn now?

320
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,070
告诉我一件你特别生气的事
Tell me something that really pisses you off.

321
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,840
- 让你气得发疯  - 让我生气
- Really drives you crazy.  - Pisses me off.

322
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,820
- 老天，什么都让我生气  - 列举一二
- God, everything pisses me off.  - List a couple.

323
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,390
哦，我知道，我讨厌被陌生男人搭讪…
Oh, I know. I hate being told by strange men...

324
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,460
…街上的陌生男人…
...strange men in the street...

325
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,460
…你知道的，笑脸让他们觉得生活不那么无聊
...you know, to smile to make them feel better about their boring life.

326
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,090
还有呢？
What else?

327
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,630
我讨厌
I hate....

328
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,330
我憎恨远在千里之外的战争
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,there's a war...

329
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,740
…人们在死亡，但没人知道该怎么做
...people are dying,and nobody knows what to do.

330
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,240
也许根本不在乎，我说不清
Or they don't give a shit.I don't know.

331
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,080
我讨厌媒体试图控制我们的思想
I hate that the media's trying to control our minds.

332
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,910
- 媒体？  - 是的，媒体
- The media?  - Yeah, the media.

333
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,650
很难形容，是一种新的法西斯主义
It's very subtle, but it's a new form of fascism, really.

334
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,680
我讨厌…
I hate....

335
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,120
我讨厌身处异国，尤其是美国
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,especially in America...

336
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:02,890
…每当我穿黑衣服或是发脾气，说不着边际的话…
...each time I wear black or lose my temper or say anything about anything...

337
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,370
…他们总是说，哦，法国味十足，真有趣…
...they always go,"Oh, it's so French. It's so cute."

338
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,940
我讨厌这些，无法忍受，真的
I hate that.I can't stand that. Really.

339
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,070
就这些？
Is that all?

340
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,840
还有很多，不过…
Well, there's a lot of things, but....

341
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,520
- 轮到我问了  - 好的
- So it's my turn.  - Okay.

342
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,050
- 你得回答  - 是的，我会回答
- You're gonna answer.  - Yes, I'll answer.

343
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,980
什么会让你困惑呢？
What's a problem for you?

344
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,020
也许就是你
You, probably.

345
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,280
什么？
What?

346
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,020
有天我有过一个想法…
I had a thought the other day that kind of...

347
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,030
…那确实让我困惑
...qualifies as a problem.

348
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,350
是什么？
What is it?

349
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,530
是我在火车上想到的
It was a thought I had on the train, so....

350
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,400
这么说吧
Okay. All right.

351
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,470
你相信轮回转世吗？
Do you believe in reincarnation?

352
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,700
是的，那很有意思
Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

353
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,140
很多人都谈论前世这一类的话题
A lot of people talk about past lives and things like that, you know?

354
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,800
哪怕在特定的场合他们并不相信这一点…
And even if they don't believe in it in some specific way...

355
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,310
…人们相信灵魂是永存的
...people have a notion of an eternal soul.

356
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,420
- 是的  - 那好
- Yeah.  - Okay.

357
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,110
我的想法是，五万年前
This is my thought:50,000 years ago...

358
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,290
…人口还不足一百万
...there's not even a million people.

359
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,320
一万年前有大约两百万人口
Ten thousand years ago,there's, like, two million people.

360
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,490
而现在世界上有五十到六十亿人口
Now there's between five and six billion people on the planet.

361
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,330
如果我们都有属于自己独有的…
If we all have our own individual, unique...

362
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,500
…灵魂…
...soul...

363
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,730
…那他们是从何而来的呢？
...where did they all come from?

364
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,530
现代人的灵魂只是原有灵魂的一部分吗？
Are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls?

365
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,740
如果是的话，就表示每个灵魂在过去五万年…
If they are, that represents a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...

366
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,680
…分裂成了五千个，对地球而言只是一瞬间
...in the last 50,000 years, which is a blip in the Earth's time.

367
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,820
我们最多只是人类史上微不足道的一部分
So at best, we're these tiny fractions of people walking

368
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,360
所以我们才这么分散？所以我们才这么独特？
Is that why we're so scattered?Is that why we're so specialized?

369
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,120
等等，我不太…
Wait a minute, I'm not sure...

370
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,790
是的，我知道，这完全是不着边际的想法
Yeah, I know, I know.It's a totally scattered thought.

371
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,930
不过这样才有点意义
Which is kind of why it makes sense.

372
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,300
我同意
I agree with you.

373
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,440
我们还是下车吧
Let's get off this damn train.

374
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,840
这里很不错
This place is pretty neat.

375
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,030
是的
Yeah.

376
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,580
还有个试听室呢
There's even a listening booth.

377
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,650
听说过这个歌手吗？
Have you heard of this singer?

378
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,720
是美国人，有个朋友跟我提起过
I think she's American.A friend told me about her.

379
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,260
想看看试听室是否还能用吗？
Do you want to go see if that listening booth still works?

380
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,660
当然想
Yeah, okay.

381
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,960
~北面吹来一阵风
There's a wind that Blows in from the north

382
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:33,010
~诉说着爱意的来临
And it says that loving Takes this course

383
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,000
~来吧
Come here

384
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,810
~来吧
Come here

385
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:47,020
~不，我并非不可亲近
No, I'm not impossible to touch

386
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,090
~我从未如此需要过你
I have never wanted you so much

387
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,230
~来吧
Come here

388
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,270
~来吧
Come here

389
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,640
~是否我从未躺在你身旁
Have I never laid down by your side

390
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,510
~宝贝，让我们抛开矜持
Baby, let's forget about this pride

391
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,680
~来吧
Come here

392
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,850
~来吧
Come here

393
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,560
看看这，太美了
Look at this. This is beautiful.

394
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,300
快，车要开了
Quick. It's leaving.

395
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,460
看，有只兔子
Look, there's a rabbit.

396
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,070
对
Yeah.

397
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,690
你好，兔子
Hey there, rabbit.

398
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,270
它真可爱
It's so cute.

399
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,280
我十多岁时来过这
I visited this as a young teenager.

400
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,950
它当时留给我的印象比博物馆更深
It left a bigger impression on me at that time than the museums.

401
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,950
是吗？它很小
Yeah? It's tiny.

402
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,250
我知道
I know.

403
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,950
和我们聊天的墓地管理员是个矮小老头
A little old man talked to us.He was the groundskeeper.

404
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,990
他解释说大部分埋在这里的人…
He explained that most of the people buried here...

405
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,720
…都是被多瑙河水冲上岸的
...had washed up on the bank of the Danube.

406
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,700
有多久的历史了？
How old are these?

407
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,970
大约始建于本世纪初，被称为无名公墓
Around the beginning of the century.It's called No Name Cemetery...

408
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,770
…因为他们大都不知道姓甚名谁
...because they often didn't know who those people were.

409
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,070
要不就是有名无姓
Maybe a first name, that's all.

410
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,310
为什么所有尸体都是冲上岸的？
Why were all the bodies washing up?

411
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,450
我猜有些是因为船只失事之类的事故
I think some were from accidents on boats and things like that.

412
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,950
但大部分是投河自尽的
But most of them were suicides that jumped in the river.

413
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,690
我喜欢这种想法…无名之人从世上消失
I always liked the idea of all those unknown people lost in the world.

414
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,950
我是小女孩时曾想过…
When I was a little girl,I thought...

415
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,690
…如果没有任何亲友知道你已经死了…
...if none of your family or friends knew you were dead...

416
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,860
…那就象没有真正死去
...then it's like not really being dead.

417
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,970
大家可以替你作最好或最坏的设想
People can invent the best and the worst for you.

418
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,530
我想她就在这
Here she is, I think.

419
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:19,170
没错，这个我记得最清楚
Yeah, this is the one I remember the most.

420
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,740
她死的时候只有十三岁
She was only 13 when she died.

421
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,550
在我来说意味深长，我第一次来这就是十三岁
That meant something to me.I was that age when I first saw this.

422
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:38,830
我现在长了十岁，可她还是十三岁
Now I'm 10 years older,and she's still 13, I guess.

423
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,120
这很有趣
That's funny.

424
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,480
那边就是多瑙河
That's the Danube over there.

425
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,650
是条河，对吧？
That's a river, right?

426
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,880
是的
Yeah.

427
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,420
真是…
This is...

428
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,070
…壮观
...gorgeous.

429
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,200
是啊，真美
Yeah, this is beautiful.

430
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,670
我是指，我们赶上了…
I mean, we got....

431
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,570
我们赶上了日落
We got a sunset here.

432
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,880
- 是的  - 我们在摩天轮上
- Yeah.  - We got the Ferris wheel.

433
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,780
这就象…
It seems like...

434
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,080
…是个…
...this would be a....

435
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,030
什么？
What?

436
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,490
你知道的…
You know....

437
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,110
你的意思是不是想吻我？
Are you trying to say you want to kiss me?

438
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,400
你知道吗？
But you know what?

439
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,550
生于哪个时代并不重要
It doesn't matter what generation you're born into.

440
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,010
看看我的父母
Look at my parents.

441
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,410
六八年五月事件，愤怒的年轻人反对一切
They were angry, young May ' 68 people revolting against everything.

442
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,390
政府，及其保守的天主教后台…
The government, their conservative Catholic backgrounds....

443
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,080
我出生之后，我父亲成为成功的建筑师
Then I was born, and my father became a successful architect.

444
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,320
他建造桥梁时我们周游世界…
We traveled around the world while he built bridges...

445
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,760
…当然，还有塔和别的什么
...and, you know, towers and stuff.

446
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,830
我是说，我真没什么可抱怨的
I mean, I really can't complain about anything.

447
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,030
他们爱我胜过一切…
They love me more than anything...

448
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,400
…我在他们努力营造的自由氛围中长大
...and I've been raised with all the freedom they fought for.

449
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,640
对我而言这是另一种形式的抗争
And yet, for me now,it's another type of fight.

450
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,180
我们总是面对相同的问题，却不知道…
We have to deal with the same shit,but we can't really know...

451
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,870
…是和谁对抗，敌人是什么
...who or, you know, what the enemy is.

452
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,920
我不知道是否真有这么个敌人
I don't know if there really is an enemy.

453
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,180
所有的父母都不会教育孩子
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

454
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,850
有钱人的孩子父母给予得太多，穷人的孩子则相反
Rich kids' parents gave them too much.Poor kids', not enough.

455
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,430
关爱太多，关爱不够
too much attention,not enough attention.

456
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,860
或是遗弃或是教些错误的东西
They either left or taught them the wrong things.

457
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,870
我父母是两个相爱并不太深的人…
My parents are just two people who didn't like each other much...

458
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,940
…他们结婚，生子
...who got married and had a kid.

459
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,470
然后尽力对我好
And they tried their best to be nice to me.

460
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,640
- 你父母离婚了？  - 是的，最终离了
- Did your parents divorce?  - Yeah, finally.

461
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,080
他们早就该离，凑合在一起…
They should have done it sooner.They stuck together...

462
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,950
…是为了我和我姐姐，真是感激不尽
...for the well-being of my sister and I. Thank you very much.

463
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,690
我记得我母亲当着父亲的面告诉我…
I remember my mother told me right in front of my father...

464
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,410
…他并不是很想要我
...that he didn't really want to have me.

465
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,920
他发现她怀孕时很恼火
That he was pissed off when he found out she was pregnant.

466
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,760
生我是个大错误，这对我的思想影响很大
That I was a big mistake.That really shaped the way I think.

467
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,230
我习惯从一个不该存在的人的视角看世界
I always saw the world as this place where I really wasn't meant to be.

468
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,430
太悲哀了
That's so sad.

469
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,800
事实上我对此颇感自豪
Well, I mean, I eventually kind of took pride in it.

470
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,500
就好象生命是我自己创造的
You know, like my life was my own doing.

471
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,840
就象我是盛宴上的不速之客
You know, like I was crashing the big party.

472
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,070
可以这样看待
That's the way to see it.

473
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,650
我父母仍在一起，我猜他们很幸福
My parents are still married and I guess they're happy.

474
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,780
不过我觉得未雨绸缪是正确的做法
But I think it's healthy to rebel against everything that came before.

475
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,490
知道吗，最近我很好奇…
You know, I've been wondering lately...

476
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,700
…你认识什么婚姻幸福的人吗？
...do you know anyone who's in a happy relationship?

477
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,360
当然，我认识一些幸福的夫妇
Yeah, sure. You know,I know happy couples.

478
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,200
可我认为他们在互相欺骗
But I think they lie to each other.

479
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,170
是啊
Yeah.

480
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,240
人们能在谎言中生活一辈子
People can live their whole life as a lie.

481
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,350
我的祖母结了婚…
My grandmother was married...

482
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,650
…我以为她有份简单的爱情生活
...and I thought she had an uncomplicated love life.

483
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,880
但她向我承认，她穷其一生…
But she just confessed to me that she spent her whole life...

484
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,150
…在梦想着她爱的另一个男人
...dreaming about another man she was in love with.

485
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,690
她屈从于命运，这太可悲了
She just accepted her fate.It's so sad.

486
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,030
但我也很高兴她有那种情感…
In the same time, I love that she had these emotions...

487
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,570
…而我从没想过她会有
...and feelings I never thought she had.

488
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,000
我敢说那样更好
I guarantee you it was better that way.

489
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,570
一旦了解了他，她最终会对他感到失望
If she'd known him, he'd have disappointed her eventually.

490
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,140
- 你怎么知道？  - 我当然知道
- How do you know?  - I know. I know.

491
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,910
人们将浪漫想象得高于一切
People put romantic projections on everything.

492
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,810
那没有任何事实依据
It's not based in any kind of reality.

493
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,720
浪漫想象？哦，摩天轮里的就是浪漫先生啦？
Romantic projections?Oh, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

494
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,220
“哦，吻我吧，日落是多么美丽啊”
"Oh, kiss me. The sunset.Oh, it's so beautiful."

495
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,920
说说你祖母吧，你刚才是怎么说的？
Tell me about your grandmother.What were you saying about her?

496
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,580
看他们的口型
Check these guys out.

497
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,280
“汉斯，我要做忏悔，我没穿内衣”
"Hans, I have a confession. I'm not wearing underwear underneath this."

498
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,150
“哦，是吗？这让你害怕了？”
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you? "

499
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,000
可以告诉你个秘密吗？
Can I tell you a secret?

500
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,390
当然
Yeah.

501
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,730
过来
Come here.

502
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,540
- 什么？  - 过来
- What?  - Come here.

503
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,580
这个看手相的看起来挺有趣
Look at this palm reader.She's interesting looking.

504
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,810
是的
Yeah.

505
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,720
- 噢  - 怎么了？
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.  - What?

506
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,680
- 她注意到了  - 她不会过来的
- I made eye contact.  - She's not coming over here.

507
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,880
- 不，她会  - 哦，见鬼
- Yes, she is.  - Oh, shit.

508
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,220
哦，不
Oh, no.

509
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,490
- 你想看手相吗？  - 不
- You want your palm read?  - No.

510
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,860
- 你肯定？  - 我肯定
- Are you sure?  - I'm sure.

511
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,560
- 好吧  - 你好
- Okay.  - Hello.

512
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,470
她来了
Oh, here she is.

513
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,650
我想要你看个手相
I want your palm read.

514
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,950
行，多少钱？
Yeah. How much is it?

515
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,880
算你五十
For you, 50.

516
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,250
行吗？
Okay?

517
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,590
行
Okay.

518
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,170
你正在旅行…
So you have been on a journey...

519
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,340
…你不是本地人
...and you're a stranger to this place.

520
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,010
你是个…
You are...

521
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,770
…冒险家
...an adventurer.

522
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,800
一个探索者
A seeker.

523
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,840
你内心中有个冒险家
An adventurer in your mind.

524
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,090
你对女性的力量很感兴趣
You are interested in the power of the woman.

525
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:25,190
还有女性潜在的力量和创造力
In the woman's deep strength and creativity.

526
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,930
你正在成为这种女人
You're becoming this woman.

527
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,570
你需要摆脱自己拙劣的生活
You need to resign yourself to the awkwardness of life.

528
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,640
只有找到内心深处的宁静…
Only if you find peace within yourself...

529
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,870
…才能找到和别人的真正关联
...will you find true connection with others.

530
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,850
你和他并不熟是吗？
That is a stranger to you?

531
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,020
我想是的
I guess so.

532
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,460
你不会有事，他正在学习
You will be all right.He's learning.

533
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,260
好了
Okay.

534
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,800
给钱
Money.

535
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,540
你们都是星宿
You're both stars.

536
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,300
别忘了
Don't forget.

537
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,840
当星星在亿万年前爆炸时…
When the stars exploded billions of years ago...

538
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,850
…它们形成了世上的一切
...they formed everything that is this world.

539
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,920
我们认识的一切都是星尘
Everything we know is stardust.

540
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,060
所以别忘了，你们也是
So don't forget, you are stardust.

541
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,530
这很不错
That's very nice and all.

542
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,070
我是指我们都是星尘
I mean, that we're all stardust...

543
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,700
…而你会成为一个伟大的女性
...and you're becoming this great woman.

544
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,800
不过我希望你不要太当真…
But I hope you don't take that any more seriously...

545
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,140
…和报纸上的占卜相比
...than some horoscope in a newspaper.

546
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,610
为什么？她知道我在渡假，还知道我们互不相识
What? She knew I was on vacation and that we didn't know each other...

547
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,720
…还有我会成为一个伟大的女人
...and that I was going to become this great woman.

548
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,290
那“我在学习”是什么鬼话？
But what was that "l am learning" bullshit?

549
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,820
那是些套话，明白吗？
That's way condescending, you know?

550
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,080
当时她并没看我的手
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

551
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:06,630
如果投机取巧者真是那样必须说真话的话
I mean, if opportunists like that ever had to tell the real truth...

552
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,890
…他们就会失业
...it would put them out of business.

553
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,700
我乐意看到一个瘦小老妇把她的所有积蓄…
Just once, I'd love to see some little old lady save up all her money...

554
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:18,570
…拿去算命，到那后算命的女人说…
...to go to the fortuneteller. She'd get there and the woman would say...

555
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,710
“明天和你的下半辈子…
..."Tomorrow and all your remaining days...

556
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,940
“…会和今天全然相同…
...will be exactly like today...

557
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,680
“…在无聊中度日
...a tedious collection of hours.

558
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,120
“你不会有新激情和新想法
And you will have no new passions and no new thoughts...

559
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,720
“…没有新历程
...and no new travels.

560
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,830
“一旦死去就会被完全遗忘
And when you die,you'll be completely forgotten.

561
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,260
“请给五十先令”
Fifty schillings, please."

562
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,190
这是我乐意看到的
That I'd like to see.

563
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,700
这太有意思了…
It's so funny how...

564
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,430
…她竟然没怎么注意你，不知是为什么
...she almost didn't notice you.It's weird. I wonder why.

565
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,800
她睿智而且热情，我很喜欢听她说的话
She was really wise and intense.I really loved what she said.

566
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,840
你是花钱来听让自己感觉良好的话
You pay your money to hear what makes you feel good about yourself.

567
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,540
维也纳也许有什么穷街陋巷能买到毒品
Maybe there's a seedy section of vienna.We can buy a hit of crack.

568
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,280
那不是更好？
Would you like that?

569
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,610
你也太…
You're so....

570
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,920
星尘，星尘
Stardust. Stardust.

571
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,130
有个展览
There's an exhibition.

572
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:24,210
我们赶不上了，要下周才开始
I guess we'll miss it.It doesn't start until next week.

573
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,610
看来是这样
Yeah, I think so.

574
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,650
其实我在博物馆见过这个
I actually saw this one in a museum.

575
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,880
我一直盯着它看
I stared and stared at it.

576
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,380
足足有四十五分钟
Must have been 45 minutes.

577
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,210
我喜欢它
I love it.

578
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,530
La Voie Ferree，真漂亮
La voie ferree.It's great.

579
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,890
我喜欢这种人物溶入背景的方式
I love the way the people are dissolving into the background.

580
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,230
看这个
Look at this.

581
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,490
似乎环境…
It's like the environments...

582
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,100
…比人物还要强烈
...are stronger than the people.

583
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,710
他的人物轮廓总是很简略
His human figures are always so transitory.

584
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,970
有意思吧，简略？
It's funny. Transitory?

585
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,950
简略
Transitory.

586
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,030
- 你觉得开门没有？  - 不知道，试试看
- You think this is open?  - I don't know. Let's try it.

587
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,200
我到过一家这样的教堂…
I was in an old church like this...

588
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,530
…几天前在布达佩斯和我祖母一起
...with my grandmother a few days ago in Budapest.

589
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,470
尽管我排斥大部分宗教的东西…
Even though I reject most of the religious thing...

590
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,770
…可还是不自觉地感受到来这的人…
...I can't help but feeling for those people that come here...

591
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,240
…迷失，痛苦，内疚…
...lost or in pain, guilt...

592
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,320
…在寻求某种答案
...looking for some kind of answers.

593
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:22,020
能同时容纳那么多代人的痛苦和快乐的地方令我着迷
It fascinates me how a single place can join pain and happiness of so many generations.

594
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,720
你和祖母很亲近？
You're close with your grandmother?

595
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,560
是的
Yeah.

596
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:33,660
大概是因为我经常有种奇特的感觉…
I think it's because I always have this strange feeling...

597
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:37,860
…我是那个躺着垂死的衰老妇人
...that I'm this very old woman laying down, about to die.

598
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,670
知道吗，我的生活就是…
You know, that my life is just...

599
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,710
…她的记忆或是什么
...her memories or something.

600
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,080
这太疯狂了
That's so wild.

601
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,720
我时常觉得自己仍然是十三岁的小孩…
I always think that I'm still this 13-year-old boy...

602
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:58,020
…不知道怎么做成年人，装模作样…
...who doesn't really know how to be an adult, pretending to...

603
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,720
…过自己的生活，逼不得已时做做笔记
...live my life, taking notes for when I'll really have to do it.

604
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,000
仿佛是穿着戏服在演一场初中话剧
Like I'm in a dress rehearsal for a junior high play.

605
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,930
真有趣
That's funny.

606
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,040
那么在摩天轮上时，就象是…
Then up there in the Ferris wheel,it was like...

607
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,310
…垂老妇人吻了一个小男孩，是吗？
...this very old woman kissing this very young boy. Right?

608
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,180
你知道贵格教徒和贵格教的宗旨吗？
Do you know anything about the Quakers, the Quaker religion?

609
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,680
不太清楚
No, not much.

610
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,220
我参加过贵格教徒的婚礼…
Well, I went to this Quaker wedding once...

611
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,290
…感觉很奇特
...and it was fantastic.

612
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,790
他们的做法是…
What they do is...

613
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,270
…新人走进去跪在所有来宾的面前…
...the couple comes in and they kneel in front of the whole congregation...

614
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,990
…然后彼此凝视
...and they stare at each other.

615
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:48,010
没人说话，除非他们觉得是上帝要他们交谈或发言
Nobody says a word unless they feel that God moves them to speak or say something.

616
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:51,610
然后，经过大约一小时…
And then, after an hour or so of just...

617
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,920
…相互凝视…
...staring at each other...

618
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:56,750
…就成了夫妻
...they're married.

619
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,750
太美了，我喜欢这样
That's beautiful. I like that.

620
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,030
有个可怕的故事
This is a horrible story.

621
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,100
是什么？
What?

622
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,050
这里不适合讲这事
It's not the appropriate place to tell it.

623
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,180
我曾和一个朋友开车兜风
Well, I was driving around with this buddy of mine.

624
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:29,290
他是个坚定的无神论者
He's a big atheist, you know.

625
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,350
他在一个流浪汉身旁停下车
And he came to a stop next to this homeless guy.

626
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,850
然后掏出一百美元…
My buddy takes out a $ 100 bill...

627
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,460
…探出车窗…
...and leans out the window...

628
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,930
…问道“你相信上帝吗？”
...and he says,"Do you believe in God? "

629
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,500
那个人看看我的朋友，看看钱
And the guy looks at my friend,he looks at the money.

630
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,670
说道…
He says...

631
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,700
…“是的，我相信”
..."Yes, I do."

632
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,840
我朋友说“回答错误”
My friend says, "Wrong answer."

633
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,530
然后开车走了
We drove away.

634
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,870
太可恶了
That's mean.

635
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,990
如果你不下火车，现在该到巴黎了吧？
Would you be in Paris by now if you hadn't gotten off the train?

636
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,120
不，还没到
No, not yet.

637
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,490
那你会做些什么？
What would you be doing?

638
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,360
也许会在机场逗留…
I'd probably be hanging around the airport...

639
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,940
…因为你不在而对着咖啡哭泣
...crying in my coffee because you didn't come with me.

640
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,810
也许我会在萨尔茨堡和别人下车
I'd probably gotten off the train in Salzburg with someone else.

641
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,980
哦，是吗？我懂了
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

642
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,080
我只是个愚蠢的美国人…
So I'm just a dumb American...

643
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,410
…只能用来当作临时点缀，是吗？
...momentarily decorating your blank canvas, huh?

644
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,780
- 我玩得很开心  - 是吗？
- I'm having a great time.  - Really?

645
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,220
我也是
Me too.

646
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,000
我很高兴没人知道我在这
I'm glad, because no one knows I'm here.

647
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,490
不认识能告诉我你做过的所有坏事的人
I don't know anyone that would tell me all those bad things you've done.

648
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,030
- 我可以告诉你  - 我相信
- I'll tell you some.  - Yeah, I'm sure.

649
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,030
听过太多坏事之后我总觉得…
You hear so much shit about people.I always feel like...

650
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,640
…赴约时象个将军
...the general of an army when I start dating.

651
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,940
制订好战略战术
Plotting my strategy and maneuverings...

652
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,670
…了解他的弱点，什么能伤害他，征服他
...knowing his weak points,what would hurt him, seduce him.

653
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,420
真是恐怖
It's horrible.

654
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,490
如果我们一直呆在一块…
If we were always around each other...

655
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,490
…那我第一件能令你发疯的事是什么？
...what would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?

656
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,200
不，我不想回答这个问题
No. I'm not going to answer this question.

657
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,490
有个和我约会过的姑娘经常问我…
I dated this girl once who used to always ask me that.

658
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,300
“我哪方面让你发疯？”
"What about me bugs you? "

659
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:31,200
最后我说“我觉得你的批评方式不太好”
Finally I said, "l don't think you handle criticism too well."

660
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:34,500
她勃然大怒和我分了手，这是真的
She flew into a rage and broke up with me. That's true.

661
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,840
其实她是要找个借口…
All she wanted was to have an excuse...

662
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:39,740
…来告诉我她不该和我交往
...to tell me what she thought was wrong with me.

663
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,180
你也想这样吗？
Is that what you want?

664
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,110
我哪些方面让你发狂？
Something about me bugs you?

665
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,520
- 我有什么会令你崩溃？  - 根本没有
- What is it about me bugs you?  - Nothing at all.

666
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,190
如果非要说的话，会是什么？
If it had to be something,what would it be?

667
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,050
如果非得有，而我非得考虑的话…
If it had to be something,if I had to think about it...

668
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,860
…我不太喜欢你对看手相的反应
...I kind of didn't really like this reaction at the palm reader.

669
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,430
就象只好斗的公鸡
You were like this rooster prick.

670
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,500
什么叫好斗的公鸡？
What the hell is a rooster prick?

671
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,200
你象个哭闹的孩子…
You were like a boy whining...

672
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,070
…因为所有注意力都不在你身上
...because all the attention wasn't focused on him.

673
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,370
好吧，听着，那女人蒙蔽了你，对吗？
All right, listen.This woman robs you blind, okay?

674
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,910
你象个路过冰淇淋店的小孩…
You were like a boy walking by an ice-cream store...

675
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,880
…因为妈妈不给他买奶昔而哭闹
...crying because his mom won't buy him a milk shake.

676
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:18,150
我不在乎那江湖骗子说过什么…
I don't care what this charlatan has to say about...

677
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,480
什么？
What?

678
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,830
我懂一点，但他不懂，抱歉
I understand a little,but he doesn't at all.

679
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,390
能问你个问题吗？
May I ask you a question?

680
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,640
我想和你们做个交易
So I would like to make a deal with you.

681
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,740
我不直接向你们要钱，而是让你们说一个词
I mean, instead of just asking you for money, I will ask you for a word.

682
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,550
你们给我一个词，然后我会写一首诗
You give me a word, I take the word,and then I will write a poem...

683
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,250
…将它包含在内
...with the word inside.

684
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,960
如果你们喜欢我的诗…
And if you like it,if you like my poem...

685
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,920
…觉得它能给你们的生活增添色彩…
...if it adds something to your life in any way...

686
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,760
…那就随意给我一些报酬
...then you can pay me whatever you feel like.

687
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,420
当然，我会用英语来写
I'll write in English, of course.

688
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,360
- 行  - 行，很不错
- Okay.  - All right. Great.

689
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,030
那么？
So?

690
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,440
选个词吧
Pick a word.

691
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,400
一个词
A word.

692
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,210
- 奶昔  - 奶昔？哦，不错
- Milk shake.  - Milk shake? Oh, good.

693
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:23,950
- 我想说“好斗公鸡”的，不过挺好，奶昔  - 奶昔？
- I was gonna say "rooster prick." But great. Milk shake.  - "Milk shake"?

694
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,290
好的，奶昔
Okay, milk shake.

695
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,950
- 好了，那么…  - 好的
- All right, so....  - Good.

696
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,240
我喜欢这个维也纳人变相的乞讨方式
I gotta say, I like this viennese variation of bum.

697
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,540
我喜欢他“给生活增添色彩”那句话
I like what he said about adding something to your life.

698
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,550
我们刚才是不是有了第一次争执？
So, were we having our first fight back there?

699
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,080
我觉得是争执过
I think so. I think we were.

700
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,880
就算有，为什么大家都觉得冲突很糟糕呢？
Even if we were, why does everyone think conflict is so bad?

701
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:01,920
争执能带来很多好的事物
There's a lot of good things coming out of conflict.

702
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:03,860
对，我也这样想
Yeah, I guess so.

703
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,490
我常想如果自己能面对现实…
I always think if I could just accept the fact...

704
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,630
…面对生活中可以预见的艰难之处…
...that my life was supposed to be difficult, that's what's expected...

705
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,670
…也许就不会那么郁闷
...then I might not get so pissed off.

706
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:16,670
遇到好事时会为之高兴
And I'd just be glad when something nice happens.

707
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,370
所以我还在上学
That's why I'm still in school.

708
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,070
这样可以提高竞争能力
It's easier to have something to fight against.

709
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,010
我们骨子里都有这种强烈的好胜心
Well, we've all had such competitiveness ingrained in us.

710
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:28,580
你也知道，我可以做一些无聊的事
You know, I can be doing the most nothing thing.

711
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,120
投飞镖或是打台球
Throwing some darts or shooting some pool.

712
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,150
然后很自然地产生这种想法
Then all of a sudden,I feel it come over me.

713
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,590
我必须赢
I have got to win.

714
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:40,250
你邀我一起下车也是出于好胜心吗？
Is that why you tried to get me off the train? Competitiveness?

715
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,800
你是指什么？
What do you mean?

716
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,900
写好了
I got a poem.

717
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:46,830
哦，是吗
Oh, all right.

718
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,200
能念给我们听吗？
Will you read it to us?

719
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,240
当然可以
Sure. Okay.

720
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,220
白日梦般的错觉
"Daydream delusion

721
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,650
豪华车竟有睫毛
Limousine eyelash

722
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,890
哦，宝贝，你的脸如此美丽
Oh, baby, with your pretty face

723
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:12,130
坠一滴泪入我的酒杯看着那双大眼睛
Drop a tear in my wine glass Look at those big eyes

724
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,520
明白到你对我的意义
See what you mean to me

725
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,730
犹如蛋糕和奶昔
Sweetcakes and milk shakes

726
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,200
我是迷人的天使
I am a delusion angel

727
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,930
我是奇幻的展台
I' m a fantasy parade

728
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,380
想让你明白我的心思不要再继续猜量
I want you to know what I think Don't want you to guess anymore

729
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,980
你不知我来自何处
You have no idea where I came from

730
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,250
我们不知该前往何方
We have no idea where we're going

731
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,310
只管融入生活
Lodged in life

732
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,080
就象河流的支脉
Like branches in the river

733
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:39,220
奔腾而下，随波逐流
Flowing downstream Caught in the current

734
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,980
我中有你
I carry you

735
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,750
你中有我
You'll carry me

736
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,190
就该是这样
That's how it could be

737
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,060
你明白我了吗？
Don't you know me?

738
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:50,860
现在你明白我没有？
Don't you know me by now? "

739
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,300
太棒了
Great.

740
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,200
- 谢谢  - 谢谢，伙计
- Thanks.  - Thanks, man.

741
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,040
给你
Here you go.

742
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,540
- 谢谢  - 不用
- Thanks.  - All right.

743
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,940
- 给，谢谢你  - 谢谢
- Here. Thank you.  - Thank you.

744
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,050
祝你好运
Good luck.

745
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:26,030
写得很棒，是吧？
It was wonderful, no?

746
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,370
- 怎么了？  - 那可能不是他写的
- What?   - He probably didn't just write that.

747
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,240
也许他只是加了一个词进去
He wrote it, but he probably plugs that word in.

748
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,710
不管是“奶昔”还是什么
You know, whatever, "milk shake."

749
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,510
你想说什么？
What do you mean?

750
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,910
没什么，我喜欢，很不错
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

751
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,190
知道什么让我发疯吗？人们谈论…
You know what drives me crazy?People talking about...

752
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,090
…科技如何伟大，如何节省时间
...how great technology is,how it saves all this time.

753
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,840
但节省了时间却变得更加忙碌，不加以利用又有何意义呢？
But what good is saved time if nobody uses it?If it just turns into more busy work.

754
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:09,580
从没听人说要用文字处理器节省的时间去寺庙游玩
I never hear anybody say, "With the time I've saved using my word processor I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery and hang out."

755
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:12,940
- 从没听说过  - 时间太抽象了
- You don't hear that.  - Time is so abstract anyway.

756
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,780
- 你在看那个女孩？  - 什么？
- Are you looking at this girl?  - What?

757
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,350
没什么
Nothing.

758
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,420
想进去吗？
You wanna go in here?

759
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,080
- 想不想进去？  - 行啊，是夜总会对吧？
- You wanna go in here?  - Yeah. It's a club, no?

760
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,180
进去？
Wanna go?

761
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,490
你好
Hello.

762
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,200
五十先令
Fifty schillings.

763
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,300
- 每个人  - 我这有一百，给
- Each.  - I got 100. Here, I got it.

764
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,300
我请你喝啤酒，谢谢
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

765
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,520
- 你请我喝啤酒？  - 对
- You gonna buy me a beer?  - Yeah.

766
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,120
这里的美国啤酒贵不贵？
You think Old Milwaukee is expensive here?

767
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:05,830
我们还没说过你是否正在和谁交往吧？
We haven't talked about this yet,but are you dating anyone?

768
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:10,400
例如有男朋友什么的正等着你回巴黎
You got a boyfriend waiting on you back in Paris or anything like that?

769
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,400
- 不，现在没有  - 但以前有
- No, not right now.  - But you did.

770
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,500
我们六个月前分手了
We broke up six months ago.

771
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:19,200
六个月前？哦，真遗憾
Six months ago? Oh, I'm sorry.

772
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,140
这话题就不那么有趣了，说说看
I mean, I'm not that sorry.Tell me about it.

773
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:26,110
不，太无聊了我不想说
No way. I can't.It's really, really boring.

774
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,280
来吧，跟我说说
Come on. Tell me about it.

775
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,320
好吧，我很失望
I was really disappointed.

776
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,550
原以为能维持一段时间，可他…
I thought this one would last for a while. He was...

777
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:39,830
…愚蠢，粗鲁，没情趣，酗酒…
...very stupid, ugly,bad in bed, alcoholic....

778
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,330
纯粹是个草包
You know. A real prize winner.

779
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:46,370
我是想给他留点面子
I was kind of giving him a favor.

780
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:49,330
但他离开了我，说什么我太爱他…
But he left me,saying I loved him too much.

781
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:54,270
妨碍了他的所谓狗屁艺术表现力
I was blocking his artistic expression or some shit like that.

782
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:57,610
不管怎样，我很受伤害，变得…
But anyway, I was traumatized and became...

783
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,450
由于他而变得很困惑
And became totally obsessed with him.

784
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:04,080
所以去看心理医生，编了个…
So I went to a shrink, and it came up that I had written...

785
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:11,090
…关于女人想杀死她男友及如何下手的愚蠢故事…
...this stupid story about this woman trying to kill her boyfriend and how she'd do it.

786
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,630
…所有怎样下手又不会被抓的细节
It's all the details of how to do it and not get caught...

787
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,820
她想杀死男朋友？
She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

788
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,070
是的，我不会真去做，只是编的罢了
Yeah, she was. It's nothing I would do,but it was just some writing.

789
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:24,540
是的，我明白
No, I understand.

790
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,570
愚蠢的医生相信了我说的一切
This stupid shrink believed everything I told her.

791
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,480
是我第一次就诊，她说必须通知警察
It was my first time seeing her.She said she had to call the police.

792
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,580
她必须通知警察？
She had to call the police?

793
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,080
她完全相信我会付诸行动
She was totally convinced I was really gonna do it.

794
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,220
即使我解释那只是我编造的
Even though I had explained it was just some writing.

795
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,360
她看着我的眼睛说“你说的这些…
She said, looking into my eyes,"The way you said it...

796
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,430
…我知道你会去做”
...I know you are going to do it."

797
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:49,190
她纯粹是疯了
She was totally out of her mind.

798
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,560
那是我唯一一次看心理医生
It was my first and last session.

799
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,530
那么后来呢？
So what happened then?

800
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,500
我彻底忘记了他
I totally got over him.

801
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,270
现在我烦恼的是…
But now, I'm obsessed...

802
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,970
…如果他死于千里之外的一场事故
...that he's gonna die from an accident or 1000 kilometers away.

803
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,510
受指控的将是我
And I'm gonna be the one accused.

804
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:14,690
为什么我们会为不那么喜欢的人感到困惑呢？
Why is it you become obsessed with people you don't really like that much?

805
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,260
不知道
I don't know.

806
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,660
那你呢？
So how about you?

807
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,860
- 什么？  - 和谁在一起？
- What?  - Are you with anyone?

808
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:29,540
我们一直回避这个话题可真滑稽
It's funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long.

809
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,500
可你现在得告诉我
But now you have to tell me.

810
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,900
我对爱的注脚是…
Well, I kind of see love...

811
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:38,340
两个不知该如何独处的人的庇荫
...as this escape for two people who don't know how to be alone.

812
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,620
真有趣，人们总是说…
It's funny.People always talk about how...

813
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,620
…爱是完全无私的付出
...Iove is this totally unselfish,giving thing.

814
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,090
但细想想却除了自私什么都没有
But if you think about it,there's nothing more selfish.

815
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,190
我明白
I know.

816
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,960
那么，你刚和谁分手？
So who just broke up with you?

817
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,060
什么？
What?

818
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,670
听起来你象是受了伤害
You sound like you just were hurt.

819
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,170
我？
Do I?

820
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,700
好吧
All right.

821
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,310
我承认
Big confession.

822
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,640
我应该早告诉你的
I should've told you this earlier or something.

823
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,120
我来欧洲不只是为了…
I didn't come to Europe just to...

824
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,510
…在巴黎散心，读海明威
...hang out and read Hemingway in Paris and shit like that.

825
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,550
整个春季我都在攒钱，想去马德里…
I saved up my money all spring to fly to Madrid...

826
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,320
…和我的女友共渡夏季…
...and spend the summer with my girlfriend...

827
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:26,260
- 你的女友？  - 前女友
- Your girlfriend?  - My ex-girlfriend...

828
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,800
…过去一年来她一直在学艺术史
...who has been on this art history program for the last year.

829
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,400
总之，我到了这，久别重逢…
Anyway, I got here.We were reunited at long last...

830
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,730
…第一晚是和她的六个朋友一起出去吃饭
...and we went out to dinner our first night with six of her friends.

831
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,570
佩德罗，安东尼奥，冈萨罗…
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo...

832
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,940
…玛丽娅，老乡苏茜
...Maria, Suzy from home.

833
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:46,510
好几天她都设法回避和我独处…
She managed to avoid being alone with me for the first few days...

834
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,350
…慢慢我意识到她并不希望我来
...and I stuck around just to let it sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

835
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,890
于是买了从维也纳起飞的最便宜的机票
So I bought the cheapest flight out,this one leaving out of vienna.

836
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:00,590
几周内没有航班，所以我又买了火车票
It didn't leave for a couple weeks,so I bought this Eurail pass.

837
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,390
知道别人和你分手最糟糕的事是什么吗？
You know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you?

838
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,100
是当你记起自己很少想到…
It's when you remember how little you thought about...

839
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:13,040
…与之分手的人，并意识到…
...the people you broke up with,and you realize...

840
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,870
…他们也很少想到你
...that that is how little they're thinking about you.

841
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,380
你以为双方都会感觉痛苦…
You'd like to think you're both in pain...

842
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,580
…实际上却是“嘿，很高兴你离开”
...but really, they're just,"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

843
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,220
相信我，我懂
Believe me, I know.

844
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,450
你该注意积极的一面
You should look at bright colors.

845
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,020
是那个心理医生告诉我的
That's what the shrink told me.

846
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,820
我付她九百法郎一小时…
I was paying her 900 francs an hour...

847
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,330
…来倾听我是个杀人狂
...to hear that l was a homicidal maniac...

848
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:40,590
…如果我注意积极的一面就能消除我的困惑
...but I could shift my obsession if I would concentrate on bright colors.

849
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,070
管用吗？
Did it work?

850
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,670
- 对玩弹球没帮助  - 对，没有
- Didn't help your pinball.  - Well, no.

851
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,080
是的，要知道最近我没杀任何人
Yeah, well, you know,I haven't killed anyone lately.

852
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,610
近来没有？
Not lately?

853
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,820
真不错，你康复了
That's good.You're cured then.

854
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:05,490
有种猴子，它们整天都在交配…
There's breeds of monkeys,and all they do is have sex...

855
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,260
…从早到晚
...all the time.

856
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:09,690
它们因此而最少攻击性…
And they turn out to be the least violent...

857
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,870
…最平和，最快乐
...the most peaceful, the most happy.

858
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,560
所以鬼混未必就是坏事
So maybe fooling around's not so bad.

859
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:18,900
- 你是在说猴子吧？  - 是啊
- Are you talking about monkeys?  - Yes, I am.

860
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:20,470
- 我想也是  - 怎么？
- I thought so.  - Why?

861
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:27,020
我从没听说过，这恐怕是雄性为他们鬼混找的完美借口
I never heard this one.But it reminds me of this perfect male argument to justify them fooling around.

862
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,650
母猴子也可以啊，大家都可以
Women monkeys are fooling around too.Everybody's fooling around.

863
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:36,050
真有趣，我有个可怕而偏激的念头…
That's cute. I have this awful,paranoid thought...

864
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,460
…女权主义是男人创造的，好让他们…
...that feminism was mostly invented by men so they could...

865
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:40,960
…更方便鬼混
...fool around more.

866
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,330
“女人，解放头脑，解放身体，和我睡觉
"Woman, free your mind,free your body. Sleep with me.

867
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:49,060
“我们都是快乐自由的，只要能满足我的色欲”
We're all happy and free, as long as I can fuck as much as I can."

868
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:50,810
好了，好了
All right.

869
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:54,310
这也许包含有生物学的因素
But maybe there's some biological things at work here.

870
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,040
如果你有个岛…
If you had an island...

871
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,880
…岛上有九十九个女人和一个男人…
...and there were 99 women on the island and only one man...

872
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,880
…一年后也许会多出九十九个孩子
...in a year, you'd have the possibility of 99 babies.

873
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:07,390
但如果岛上是九十九个男人和一个女人…
But if you have an island with 99 men and only one woman...

874
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:12,250
…一年后就只可能有一个孩子，所以…
...in a year, you have the possibility of only one baby. So....

875
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,530
你知道吗？
You know what?

876
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:17,890
我猜岛上也许只会留下四十三个男人
On this island, I think there will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

877
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:22,000
为了和那可怜的女人性交他们会互相残杀
They would've killed each other trying to fuck this poor woman.

878
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:26,440
而另一个岛上会有九十九个女人，九十九个孩子
And on the other island,there would be 99 women, 99 babies...

879
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,300
…但不再有男人
...and no more man.

880
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:31,070
因为她们会把他生吃掉
Because they would've all eaten him alive.

881
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,680
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

882
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,610
对此可以这样说
There's something to that.

883
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,980
某种程度上，女人并不介意毁掉一个男人
On some level, women don't mind the idea of destroying a man.

884
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:43,060
我曾和我的前女友一起逛街…
I was walking down the street with my ex-girlfriend...

885
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,750
…有四个长相凶恶的人站在一辆跑车附近
...and we'd just walked by these four thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

886
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,130
其中一个说“嘿，宝贝，屁股真漂亮”
And one of them says,"Hey, baby. Nice ass!"

887
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:55,000
我觉得“这没什么，没必要为此生气”
So I'm like, "No big deal.I won't get uptight about this."

888
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:56,760
对，而且他们有四个人
Plus, there were four of them.

889
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:59,940
就是，可她说“去你妈的，混蛋”
Exactly. But she says,"Fuck you, dickheads!"

890
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,340
我想“这下好了，等着瞧吧”
And I'm like, "Okay.Wait a minute, here."

891
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:06,110
他们可不会过来踢她的屁股
They're not gonna come over and kick her ass.

892
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,250
那么谁会被顶到前线上去呢？
So who just got pushed to the frontline on that one?

893
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:12,420
女人说她们讨厌被严加保护
Women say they hate it if you're all protective.

894
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:16,990
如果照她的意思去做，又说你不是男人
But if it suits them, then they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

895
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:21,320
知道吗？我不认为女人真的想毁掉男人
You know what? I don't think woman really wants to destroy man.

896
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,600
即使她们想也不会成功
Even if they want to,they don't succeed.

897
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,000
我相信恰恰是男人在毁掉女人…
I'm sure even men are destroying women...

898
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,260
…或者说相对而言更有能力毁掉女人
...or are capable of destroying women much more than women...

899
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:32,770
总之，这令人沮丧，懂我意思吗？
Anyway, it's depressing.You know what?

900
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,570
- 你想停止这个话题？  - 我讨厌这些
- You wanna stop talking about this?  - I hate it.

901
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,340
男人，女人，这…
Men, women, it's....

902
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:40,040
永无休止，就象…
There's no end to it.

903
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,070
就象张跳针的唱片
It's like a skipping record.

904
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:45,480
凡是夫妻都会永远讨论这问题
Every couple's been having this conversation forever.

905
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:47,780
但没人能得出结论
And nobody came up with anything.

906
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,880
我看过记录片说这是生育舞蹈
I saw a documentary on that.It's a birth dance.

907
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,540
生育舞蹈？
A birth dance?

908
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:38,670
我该给她钱吗？
Should I give her some money?

909
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,180
所有有意思的事都要花钱
Everything that's interesting costs a little money.

910
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,710
生育舞蹈，是吧？
So a birth dance, huh?

911
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,650
在我看来有点象交配舞蹈
Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

912
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:51,650
不，是真的，女人临盆时就跳这个
No, but really.Women used it when giving birth.

913
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,260
世上仍有一部分人这么做
In part of the world,they still do it.

914
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,960
临产的女人进到帐蓬里…
The woman in labor enters a tent...

915
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,760
…同部落的女人围着她跳舞
...and the women of her tribe surround her and dance.

916
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,260
并鼓励她一起跳
They encourage her to dance with them...

917
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:05,760
…可以减轻分娩的痛苦
...so as to make the birth less painful.

918
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:09,410
孩子降生后大家一起起舞庆贺
And when the baby is born,they all dance in celebration.

919
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,800
我猜我妈妈可不会这样做
I don't think my mom would've gone for that.

920
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:17,540
我喜欢跳舞这类所有人都能参与的活动
I like the idea of dancing as something everybody participates in.

921
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,880
我知道，我听说有个老头…
I know. I heard about this old guy...

922
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,210
…他看到年轻人在跳舞
...who was watching some young people dance.

923
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,820
说道“真美
He said, "How beautiful.

924
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,960
“他们甩掉生殖器以变成天使”
They're shaking off their genitals to become angels."

925
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,060
有意思
I like that.

926
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:30,450
不过有个问题
One question, though.

927
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,320
当女人们全身心地投入到舞蹈中时…
When the women are dancing and being all spiritual and stuff...

928
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:35,620
…男人们在哪？
...where are the men?

929
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,130
出去找食物了？没被邀请？还是女人不需要男人？
Are we out food gathering? Are we not invited? You all don't need us?

930
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,630
男人该庆幸没在交配后被咬下头颅
Men are lucky we don't bite off their heads after mating.

931
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,810
实际上象蜘蛛什么的会那样做
Certain insects do that,like spiders and stuff?

932
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,410
能活着还有什么可抱怨的呢？
We let you live.What are you complaining about?

933
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:52,240
你这是危言耸听，话里有话
See, you're officially kidding.But there's something to that.

934
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:54,580
你一直在强调某些观点
You keep bringing stuff like that up.

935
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:58,620
不，没有，等一等，说正经的
No, no. Wait a minute.Talking seriously here.

936
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:04,550
我一直觉得要做一个坚强而独立的女强人…
I mean, I always feel this pressure of being a strong and independent icon of womanhood...

937
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:10,090
…不让自己的全部生活围着某个男人转有很大的压力
...and not making it look like my whole life is revolving around some guy.

938
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:16,640
但是爱一个人和被人爱对我来说意味着很多
But loving someone and being loved means so much to me.

939
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:19,640
我常拿这类事情说笑…
I always make fun of it and stuff...

940
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,670
…可并非我们做的每件事…
...but isn't everything we do in life...

941
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,750
…都能赢得更多的爱
...a way to be loved a little more?

942
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,420
我不知道
I don't know.

943
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:33,790
有时候我梦想着…
Sometimes I dream...

944
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:37,020
…做一个好父亲好丈夫
...about being a good father  and a good husband.

945
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,690
而且有时候会觉得很接近了
And sometimes it feels really close.

946
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,260
可另外一些时候…
But then other times...

947
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,360
…这想法似乎很蠢
...it seems silly...

948
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:47,040
…仿佛它会
...like it would...

949
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,200
…毁掉我全部的生活
...ruin my whole life.

950
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:53,040
不是由于对责任感的畏惧…
And it's not just a fear of commitment...

951
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,370
…或是没有能力去关爱，因为
...or that I'm incapable of caring or loving because...

952
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:57,810
…我能胜任
...I can.

953
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,850
如果我绝对公正地对待自己…
It's just that, if I'm totally honest with myself...

954
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,780
…那我宁死也不想知道…
...I think I'd rather die knowing...

955
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:07,510
…我擅长些什么
...that I was really good at something.

956
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:16,190
比起仅仅维系一份良好的，友爱的关系来说，还有哪些方面更突出
That I had excelled in some way than that I'd just been in a nice, caring relationship.

957
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:25,810
我曾为一个老人工作，有次他告诉我…
I had worked for this older man,and once he told me...

958
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:29,670
…他把一生的心思都放在了事业上
...that he had spent all of his life thinking about his career.

959
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,180
五十二岁时他突然地发现…
He was 52,and it suddenly struck him...

960
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:36,050
…他从没为自己做过任何事
...that he had never really given anything of himself.

961
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,820
他这辈子毫无作为
His life was for no one and nothing.

962
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,460
他说这话时都要哭了
He was almost crying saying that.

963
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,930
我相信如果有神存在…
I believe if there's any kind of God...

964
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:50,120
…不会存在于任何人身上
...it wouldn't be in any of us...

965
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:52,330
…不会是你或者我
...not you or me...

966
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,230
…而是存在于这小小的空间之中
...but just this little space in between.

967
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:01,270
如果世上有什么奇迹…
If there's any kind of magic in this world...

968
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:05,880
…一定是尽力理解某个人，并与之同甘共苦
...it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something.

969
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:11,450
我知道，这几乎是不可能成功的
I know, it's almost impossible to succeed...

970
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:14,020
…可谁真正在乎呢？
...but who cares really?

971
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,560
答案一定是在尝试之中
The answer must be in the attempt.

972
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:29,790
我想文明正在衰亡，看看这服务吧
I think this is a civilization in decline. Look at the service.

973
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,440
侍者在哪？在纽约她肯定得失业
Where is the waitress?In New York, she'd be out of a job.

974
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:44,710
我来给巴黎的一个朋友打电话
I'm gonna call my friend in Paris...

975
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,010
…我想约她午休时一起吃饭
...who I'm supposed to have lunch with in eight hours.

976
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:57,450
接电话
Pick up.

977
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:59,590
- 接电话啊  - 好的
- Pick up the phone.  - All right.

978
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,540
我正学英语，你说英语行吗？当作消遣
I've been working on my English.You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

979
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,380
行，这主意不错
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

980
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,610
我今天不能陪你吃午饭了，对不起
I don't think I'll be able to make it for lunch today.

981
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:30,020
我在火车上认识了一个人，和他在维也纳下了车
I met a guy on the train,and I got off with him in vienna.

982
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,250
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

983
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,700
也许吧
Probably.

984
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,190
- 他是不是奥地利人？  - 不，不是
- He's Austrian? He's from there?  - No, No.

985
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,100
是个游客，美国人，明天一早就要回家
He's passing through. He's American.He's going back home tomorrow.

986
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:43,670
你为什么下车？
Why'd you get off?

987
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:47,310
他说服了我
Well, he convinced me.

988
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:52,010
实际上我在火车上和他聊过一阵之后…
I mean, actually, I was ready to get off the train with him...

989
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,180
…就打算和他一起下车
...after talking to him a short while.

990
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,410
他很有趣，让我情不自禁
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

991
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:00,250
在休息车厢，他谈到…
In the lounge car,he began to talk about...

992
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:03,550
…他小时候见过他曾祖母的鬼魂
...him as a boy seeing his great-grandmother's ghost.

993
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:07,160
我就是那时被他吸引住了
I think that's when I fell for him.

994
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:12,100
就因为一个小男孩和他所有的美丽梦想
Just the idea of this little boy with all those beautiful dreams.

995
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:15,200
他征服了我
He trapped me.

996
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:20,100
而且他很可爱
And he's so cute.

997
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:22,470
他有漂亮的蓝眼睛…
He has beautiful blue eyes...

998
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,670
…漂亮的粉红色嘴唇…
...nice pink lips...

999
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:27,110
…油腻的头发
...greasy hair.

1000
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:29,410
我很喜欢
I love it.

1001
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,620
他高高的个子，有点笨拙
He's kind of tall,and he's a little clumsy.

1002
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:36,720
我喜欢他偷偷看我的感觉
I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away.

1003
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:44,520
他接吻时象个青涩少年，很可爱
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.It's so cute.

1004
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:48,300
- 不是吧？  - 就是，我们接过吻，感觉非常棒
- What?  - Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable.

1005
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:52,330
随着夜色降临，我越来越喜欢他
As the night went on,I began to like him more and more.

1006
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,800
我担心他有点怕我
I'm afraid he's scared of me.

1007
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:59,970
我跟他说过一个女人想杀死前男友的故事
I told him the story about the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend.

1008
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,950
他肯定怕得要命
He must be scared to death.

1009
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:05,420
他一定以为我是个专横歹毒的女人
He must be thinking I'm this manipulative, mean woman.

1010
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:10,180
但愿他不会这样认为
I just hope he doesn't feel that way about me.

1011
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:13,360
因为，你了解我，我决不会伤害别人
Because, you know me,I'm the most harmless person.

1012
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:17,770
唯一能真正伤害的只有我自己
The only person I could really hurt is myself.

1013
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:20,570
我不认为他会怕你
I don't think he's scared of you.

1014
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:22,600
我想他对你很着迷
I think he's crazy about you.

1015
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,330
- 真的？  - 我认识你很久了
- Really?  - I've known you a long time.

1016
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:28,010
对你印象很好，你还会再见他吗？
I got a good feeling.You gonna see him again?

1017
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,210
我们还没提到这个问题
We haven't talked about that yet.

1018
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,580
好，到你了，打电话给你的朋友
Okay, it's your turn.You call your friend.

1019
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:42,690
好的，好的
All right, all right.

1020
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,620
通常只能接通他的答录机
I usually get this guy's answering machine.

1021
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:52,960
嘿，哥儿们，什么事？
Hi, dude. What's up?

1022
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,740
弗兰克，过得怎样？真高兴你在家
Hey, Frank. How you been?I'm glad you're home.

1023
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,370
挺好，是的
Cool. Yeah.

1024
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,130
马德里怎么样？
So how was Madrid?

1025
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:03,900
没劲透了
Madrid sucked.

1026
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:07,240
莉莎和我总算彻底玩完了
Lisa and I had our long overdue meltdown.

1027
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,680
太糟了，我早说过不是吗？
Too bad. I told you, no?

1028
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:13,050
对，相隔太远从不会有结果
Yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing just never works.

1029
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:15,280
我只在马德里呆了几天
I was only in Madrid for a couple days.

1030
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:18,150
我买了张最便宜的机票
I got a cheaper flight out of vienna.

1031
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,390
实际上并不太便宜，只不过…
You know, it really wasn't that much cheaper. I just....

1032
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,830
我不能马上回家，我不想见到任何熟人
I couldn't go home right away.I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

1033
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,800
只想变成完全不为人知的游魂
I just wanted to be a ghost,completely anonymous.

1034
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,810
你现在还好吧？
So are you okay now?

1035
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:37,040
对，我很好，很好，真的
Yeah. I'm great. I'm great.That's the thing.

1036
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:38,610
我很开心
I'm rapturous.

1037
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,810
告诉你是为什么
And I'll tell you why.

1038
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:43,920
在欧洲最后一晚我认识了一个人
I met somebody on my last night in Europe.

1039
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,820
- 难以置信  - 我知道，我知道
- That's incredible.  - I know, I know.

1040
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:50,390
有句老话说我们是对方的魔鬼和天使
You know how they say we're all each other's demons and angels?

1041
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:54,790
她无疑是波提且利画笔下的天使
Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel...

1042
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,620
…告诉我一切都会好起来
...telling me everything would be okay.

1043
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,800
你们怎么认识的？
How did you meet?

1044
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:04,870
是在火车上
On the train.

1045
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,500
她邻座的一对古怪夫妻在吵架
She was sitting next to a weird couple that was fighting...

1046
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:11,870
…她换座时正好坐在过道对面
...so she moved. She sat right across the aisle from me.

1047
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,020
于是我们开始聊天
So we started to talk.

1048
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,410
起初她不太喜欢我
She didn't like me much at first.

1049
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:17,780
她非常聪明…
She's super smart...

1050
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:20,680
…充满激情…
...very passionate...

1051
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:22,450
…而且很漂亮
...and beautiful.

1052
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:26,480
我却太缺乏自信
And I was so unsure of myself.

1053
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,530
我觉得我说的话都很蠢
I thought everything I said sounded so stupid.

1054
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,430
哦，伙计，这我并不担心
Oh, man. I wouldn't worry about that.

1055
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,300
她不会因此而对你有成见
No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

1056
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:40,110
再说了，她坐到了你旁边
No, and by the way,she sat next to you.

1057
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:42,040
我相信她是有意如此
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

1058
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,580
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

1059
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:51,150
我们男人太蠢了，一点也不了解女人
Us men are so stupid. We don't understand anything about women.

1060
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,910
她们行为古怪，我只知道这一点
They act strange,the little I know of them.

1061
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,820
对不对？
Don't they?

1062
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:07,770
我觉得我们象是处在梦境之中
I feel like this is some dream world we're in.

1063
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,560
对，这很奇怪
Yeah, it's so weird.

1064
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:12,170
仿佛我们在一起的时间只属于我们
It's like our time together is just ours.

1065
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:14,210
是我们自己创造的
It's our own creation.

1066
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,970
就象我在你梦里，你在我梦里
It must be like I'm in your dream and you're in mine.

1067
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,150
所以这一整夜才会如此美妙…
And what's so cool is that this whole evening...

1068
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:25,840
…客观地说我们本来是不会在一起的
...all our time together,shouldn't officially be happening.

1069
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,510
我明白，所以才会感觉象在童话世界
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why this feels so otherworldly.

1070
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:35,220
不过天亮之后我们就会变回南瓜，对不对？
But then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1071
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:37,400
我明白
I know.

1072
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:41,330
但是现在，你该拿出玻璃鞋…
But now, you're supposed to produce the glass slipper...

1073
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,130
…看看合不合适
...and see if it fits.

1074
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,640
会合适的
It'll fit.

1075
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:11,290
我有个朋友的孩子是在家里出生的，所以他在那帮忙
This friend of mine had a kkid and it was a home birth,so he was there helping out.

1076
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,300
他说生命降生之时的意义非凡
But he said at that profound moment of birth...

1077
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:19,540
…他看着他的孩子第一次体验生命
...he was watching his child experiencing life for the first time...

1078
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,680
…试着第一次呼吸
...trying to take its first breath.

1079
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:27,640
他能想到的却只是眼前这个生命总有一天将会死去
All he could think about was that he was looking at something that was gonna die someday.

1080
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,080
他无法驱散这个念头
He couldn't get it out of his head.

1081
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:34,410
我觉得很真实，一切事物都是有限的
And I think that's so true.Everything is so finite.

1082
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:37,450
你是否觉得正因为这样…
But don't you think that's what...

1083
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:40,990
…才使我们的时间和特殊时刻如此重要？
...makes our time and specific moments so important?

1084
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,060
是的，我明白
Yeah, I know.

1085
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:44,590
就象我们今晚一样
It's the same for us tonight, though.

1086
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:51,230
过了明天，我们也许永远都不会再见面
After tomorrow, we'll probably never see each other again, right?

1087
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,370
你不认为我们还能见面？
You don't think we'll ever see each other?

1088
01:15:58,050 --> 01:15:59,310
你觉得呢？
What do you think?

1089
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:09,490
老实说，我不知道，我没有其他旅游计划
Actually, I don't know.I hadn't planned another...

1090
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:13,250
我也是，我在巴黎，你在美国，我能理解
Me too. I live in Paris,you live in the U.S. I understand.

1091
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,230
我不想让你来，你讨厌飞行不是吗？
I'd hate to make you fly.You'd hate to fly, right?

1092
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,660
我并不那么害怕飞行
I'm not so scared of flying.

1093
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,560
我是说我可以
I mean, I could.

1094
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,460
是吗，如果你想…
Well, if you were gonna...

1095
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,260
…来美国…
...come to the U.S...

1096
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,910
…或者，也许我…
...or if, you know, if l....

1097
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:28,540
我是说，我可以再来这
I mean, I could come back here.

1098
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:30,770
怎么了？
What?

1099
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:34,850
我们该以成年人的理性来对待这事
No, let's just be rational adults about this.

1100
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:39,480
我们该尝试不同的方式
We should try something different.

1101
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:42,920
就算今晚是我们仅有的一晚也不错不是吗？
It's not so bad if tonight is our only night, right?

1102
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:46,130
大家交换电话，住址
People exchange numbers, addresses.

1103
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:49,160
结果只通过一两封信，一两次电话
They end up writing once,calling each other twice.

1104
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:51,130
是的，结果很糟
Right. Fizzles out.

1105
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:53,920
我不想那样，我讨厌那样
Yeah, I don't want that.I hate that.

1106
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:56,530
我也讨厌那样
I hate that too.

1107
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,440
为什么大家都认为关系应该永远保持呢？
Why does everybody think relationships should last forever?

1108
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,770
是啊，为什么？真蠢
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1109
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:07,170
你觉得今晚就是…
But you think tonight's it?

1110
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:10,940
我是指，这就是我们仅有的一晚吗？
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

1111
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,010
只能这样不是吗？
It's the only way, no?

1112
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:19,460
那好吧
Well, all right.

1113
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,260
就这样
Let's do it.

1114
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,930
不欺骗，不猜忌
No delusions, no projections.

1115
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,330
只管把今晚过好
We'll just make tonight great.

1116
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,230
好，就这么办
Let's do that.

1117
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:51,960
我们应该握握手
We should do some kind of handshake.

1118
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:53,690
把手给我
Give me your hand.

1119
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:00,100
为了我们唯一一个…
To our one and only...

1120
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:02,430
…共处的夜晚…
...night together...

1121
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:05,730
…以及余下的时间
...and the hours that remain.

1122
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:15,370
怎么了？
What?

1123
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:19,480
这真是…
It's just....

1124
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,650
令人沮丧是不是？
It's depressing, no?

1125
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:25,420
此刻我们唯一要想的就是…
Now, the only thing we're gonna think of is...

1126
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:27,560
…我们必须说再见的时刻
...when we'll have to say goodbye.

1127
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:31,360
可以现在就说，那样就不用担心了
We could say goodbye now.Then we won't worry about it.

1128
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:32,890
现在？
Now?

1129
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,860
说再见
Say goodbye.

1130
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:36,560
- 再见  - 再见
- Bye.  - Goodbye.

1131
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,110
再见
Au revoir.

1132
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:41,070
- 再见  - 再见
- Later.  - Later, yeah.

1133
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:12,470
这样好了
Here's the plan.

1134
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:15,970
你去偷杯子，我去弄酒
You're gonna grab the glasses,and I'm gonna get the wine.

1135
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,170
- 红酒  - 红酒，行
- Red wine.  - Red wine. Right.

1136
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,510
- 你觉得能弄到吗？  - 别担心
- You think you can do that?  - No problem.

1137
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,590
- 祝我好运  - 祝你好运
- Wish me luck.  - Good luck.

1138
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:31,650
你好
Hello.

1139
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,460
你会说英语吗？
Do you speak English?

1140
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:39,730
- 会一点  - 会一点是吗？
- A bit.  - Yeah? A bit?

1141
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:42,560
我有件棘手的事…
I'm having kind of an odd situation...

1142
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:44,570
…是这样…
...which is that....

1143
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:46,840
看到那边那女孩了吗？
You see that girl over there?

1144
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:53,710
这是我们在一起的唯一一晚
Well, this is our only night together...

1145
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:55,910
…而她…
...and she....

1146
01:19:57,990 --> 01:20:01,290
问题在于她想要瓶红酒…
The problem is that she wants a bottle of red wine...

1147
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:03,650
…可是我身无分文
...and I don't have any money.

1148
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,530
我想你也许能…
But I was thinking that you might want to...

1149
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:13,130
…给我这家酒吧的地址，我保证…
...give me the address of this bar,and I would promise...

1150
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:17,570
…寄钱给你，而你能成全我们这一夜
...to send you the money, and you'd be making our night complete.

1151
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:20,200
- 你会寄钱给我？  - 是的
- You would send me the money?  - Yes

1152
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:26,480
你保证？
Your hand?

1153
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:45,030
敬你一生中最美好的夜晚
For the greatest night in your life.

1154
01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:46,930
太感谢你了
Thank you very much.

1155
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:14,220
我经常和别人一起分享美好时刻…
So often I've been with people and shared beautiful moments...

1156
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:18,490
…例如旅游或彻夜不眠等着看日出
...like traveling or staying up all night and watching the sunrise.

1157
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:21,930
我知道那都是特别的时刻
And I knew those were special moments.

1158
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,770
但总有不如意的地方
But something was always wrong.

1159
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:28,140
我希望是和另外的人在一起
I wished I'd been with someone else.

1160
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:32,070
我知道那种感觉…
I knew that what I was feeling...

1161
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:36,340
…实际上对我很重要，他们不会明白
...exactly what was so important to me,they didn't understand.

1162
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,010
但我很高兴和你在一起
But I'm happy to be with you.

1163
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,230
你不会知道为什么这样一夜…
You couldn't know why a night like this...

1164
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,920
…对我的生活来说有多重要
...is so important to my life right now...

1165
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:52,530
…但确实重要
...but it is.

1166
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,610
这是个美妙的早晨
This is a great morning.

1167
01:21:58,170 --> 01:21:59,940
是个美妙的早晨
It is a great morning.

1168
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,540
你觉得我们可以更进一步吗？
Do you think we have others like this?

1169
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,640
那我们的理性和成年人的决定怎么办？
What about our rational, adult decision?

1170
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:12,510
哦，是呀
Oh, yeah.

1171
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:20,120
我明白你说的希望的人不在是指什么
I know what you mean about wishing somebody wasn't there.

1172
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,100
通常，我自己…
It's just, usually, it's myself...

1173
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,460
…会希望可以远远躲开
...that I wish I could get away from.

1174
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,000
说真的，想想看
Seriously, think about this.

1175
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,730
我从没去过任何…
I have never been anywhere...

1176
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:32,630
…我没去过的地方
...that I haven't been.

1177
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:35,510
从没有一个吻…
I've never had a kiss...

1178
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:37,740
…是我没有吻过的
...when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1179
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,810
从没有…
You know, I've never...

1180
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:43,250
…看过我不在场时看过的电影
...gone to the movies when I wasn't there in the audience.

1181
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:46,050
从没打过我没参与的保龄球
I've never been out bowling if I wasn't there...

1182
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,810
…制造一些愚蠢的笑话
...making some stupid joke.

1183
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:50,920
所以才会有那么多人讨厌自己，真的
That's why so many people hate themselves. Seriously.

1184
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:53,250
他们渴望死亡…
It's just, they are sick to death...

1185
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,730
…徘徊在自己周围
...of being around themselves.

1186
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:00,200
如果我们一直呆在一起
Let's say that you and I were together all the time.

1187
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,630
你会开始讨厌我的坏习惯
You'd start to hate a lot of my mannerisms.

1188
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,570
包括…
The way...

1189
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:08,000
…每次我们有客人来访…
...the way every time that we would have people over...

1190
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:11,840
…我变得不可靠，我喝过了头
...I'd be insecure, and I'd get a little too drunk.

1191
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:16,410
或是我反复讲些愚蠢，自作聪明的故事…
Or the way I tell the same stupid,pseudo-intellectual story...

1192
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,380
…翻来覆去地说…
...again and again.

1193
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,280
那些故事我都听过…
You see, I've heard all those stories...

1194
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,190
…所以我当然会厌恶自己
...so of course I'm sick of myself.

1195
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:30,820
但和你在一起…
But being with you...

1196
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:35,730
…让我觉得自己象是另一个人
...it's made me feel like I was somebody else.

1197
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:41,440
象这样能让人忘我的其他方法只有…
I mean, the only other way to lose yourself like that is...

1198
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,540
…你也知道，跳舞…
...you know, dancing...

1199
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:46,850
…酒精…
...or alcohol...

1200
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,350
…毒品，诸如此类
...or drugs, or stuff like that.

1201
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:54,150
做爱？
Fucking.

1202
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:58,550
作爱，对，也是方法之一
Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

1203
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:14,670
知道我想要什么吗？
Do you know what I want?

1204
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,170
什么？
What?

1205
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,110
有人吻我
To be kissed.

1206
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,050
这我能做到
Well, I could do that.

1207
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,090
等等
Wait.

1208
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,340
我得说几句傻话
I have to say something stupid.

1209
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:51,000
没问题
All right.

1210
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,110
非常傻
It's very stupid.

1211
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,410
我觉得我们不该发生关系
I don't think we should sleep together.

1212
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:06,220
我很想，但以后我们永远都不会再见面
I want to, but since we're never going to see each other again...

1213
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,330
…这让我很难受
...it'll make me feel bad.

1214
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,960
我会猜你和谁在一起，会想你
I'll wonder who else you're with.I'll miss you.

1215
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,840
我知道，这不太成熟
I know. It's not very adult.

1216
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,910
也许是女人的天性，我控制不住
Maybe it's a female thing.I can't help it.

1217
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:25,280
那我们就再见面
Let's see each other again.

1218
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:32,010
我不希望你为了和我作爱而破坏约定
No, I don't want you to break our vow just so you can get laid.

1219
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:36,490
我不只是想，而是…我是说…
I don't want to just get laid.I want to... I mean....

1220
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,120
我觉得我们应该作爱
I mean, I think we should.

1221
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:42,390
我们早上就会死去不是吗？
We die in the morning, right?

1222
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,730
- 所以应该  - 那就象男人的梦想
- I think we should.  - Then it's like some male fantasy.

1223
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:50,130
邂逅一个法国女郎，干了她然后永不再见
Meet a French girl,fuck her and never see her again.

1224
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:53,930
而且有个好故事可说了，我可不想…
And have this great story to tell.I don't want...

1225
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:56,870
…这个美好的夜晚变成那样
...this great evening to just have been for that.

1226
01:25:57,710 --> 01:26:01,240
好的，我们不用作爱，那没什么大不了
Okay, we don't have to have sex.It's not a big deal.

1227
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:14,100
你不想再见到我？
You don't want to see me again?

1228
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:16,790
不，我当然想
No, of course I do.

1229
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,590
如果现在有人让我选择…
If somebody gave me the choice right now...

1230
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,700
…永远不再见你还是娶你
...of to never see you again or to marry you...

1231
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,030
…我会娶你
...I would marry you.

1232
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,400
也许是所谓的浪漫过头
Maybe that's a lot of romantic bullshit...

1233
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:29,340
但有人结婚的理由比这更少
...but people have gotten married for a lot less.

1234
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:33,610
事实上…
Actually...

1235
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:40,350
…我们下火车时我决定要和你睡觉
...I think I decided I wanted to sleep with you when we got off the train.

1236
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:46,890
聊了这么多之后我拿不定主意了
Now that we've talked so much,I don't know anymore.

1237
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,070
我们干嘛把一切变得这么复杂？
Why do we make everything so complicated?

1238
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:01,770
我不知道
I don't know.

1239
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:07,300
回到巴黎你首先想要做什么？
What's the first thing you'll do when you get back to Paris?

1240
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,330
给父母打电话
Call my parents.

1241
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:10,940
你呢？
What about you?

1242
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:15,410
不知道，也许会去拿狗，它在我朋友那
I don't know. I'll probably go pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

1243
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:17,050
你有只狗？我喜欢狗
You have a dog?I love dogs.

1244
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,880
- 是吗？  - 是的
- You do?  - Yeah.

1245
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:21,120
- 哦，该死  - 怎么了？
- Oh, shit.  - What?

1246
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,720
说不清，我们回到现实中来了
I don't know.We're back in real time.

1247
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:26,820
是的，令我讨厌
I know. I hate that.

1248
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,460
是什么？
What is that?

1249
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:32,560
听起来象古钢琴
Sounds like a harpsichord.

1250
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:34,660
去看看
Check that out.

1251
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,830
有人在演奏
Somebody's playing.

1252
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:44,640
真酷
That's cool.

1253
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:05,500
我们能随着琴声起舞吗？
Can we dance to the harpsichord?

1254
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:07,070
当然
Of course.

1255
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,030
哦，哇
Oh, wow.

1256
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:13,130
怎么？
What?

1257
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:18,010
我要拍下你的照片
I'm gonna take your picture...

1258
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,270
…那就永远不会忘记你…
...so I never forget you...

1259
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:24,850
…和这一切
...or all this.

1260
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,250
好的，我也一样
Okay, me too.

1261
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:29,110
“岁月会象兔子一样溜走”
"The years shall run like rabbits."

1262
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:32,780
什么？
What?

1263
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,190
没什么
Nothing.

1264
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:42,520
我有张唱片是戴伦-托马斯…
I have this recording of Dylan Thomas

1265
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,790
…朗诵W・H・奥登的诗
...reading a W. H. Auden poem.

1266
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,660
他有副好嗓子
He's got a great voice.

1267
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,800
比如…
It's like....

1268
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:54,340
“城里所有时钟
"All the clocks in the city

1269
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:57,340
“开始当当响着报时
Began to whirr and chime:

1270
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:00,070
“不要让时间欺骗你
'O let not Time deceive you

1271
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,880
“你不可能征服时间
You cannot conquer Time.

1272
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:05,310
“在烦恼与忧虑之中
In headaches and in worry

1273
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:08,550
“朦胧的生活消逝无踪
vaguely life leaks away

1274
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,990
“时间占有了他的幻想
And Time will have his fancy

1275
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:13,790
“明天或是今天”
Tomorrow or today.' "

1276
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,990
就象这样
Something like that.

1277
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:18,160
不错
That's good.

1278
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:29,640
你说过在最初的几年之后…
When you talked earlier about after a few years...

1279
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,470
…一对夫妻怎样开始彼此厌恶…
...how a couple would begin to hate each other...

1280
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,650
…由于彼此太了解…
...by anticipating their reactions...

1281
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:36,870
…或是厌倦了对方的恶习
...or getting tired of their mannerisms.

1282
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,990
我觉得我恰恰相反
I think it would be the opposite for me.

1283
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:45,490
我彻底了解一个人时就会真正爱上他
I think I can really fall in love when I know everything about someone.

1284
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:48,390
他怎样梳理头发…
The way he's gonna part his hair...

1285
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,720
…哪一天穿哪件衬衣…
...which shirt he's gonna wear that day...

1286
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:55,160
…知道在什么场合他会说什么故事
...knowing the exact story he'd tell in a given situation.

1287
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:59,400
这时候我肯定就爱上他了
I'm sure that's when I know I'm really in love.

1288
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,390
- 嘿，糟糕  - 怎么了？
- Hey, guess what.  - What?

1289
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:25,730
我们没去看那场话剧
We didn't go to those guys' play.

1290
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:27,160
话剧？
Play?

1291
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:28,700
那头母牛？
The cow?

1292
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,630
是啊，我们没去
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

1293
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,070
哦，不，我们错过了
Oh, no. We missed it.

1294
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:00,760
你知道去机场的公车吗？
You know what bus to take to the airport?

1295
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:01,870
是的，别担心
No problem.

1296
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:05,470
- 我就上这趟车  - 到了，你就上去吗？
- I should get on this one.  - Right here. You wanna get on there?

1297
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,210
那就这样了，是吗？
I guess this is it, no?

1298
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,370
我真的…
I really....

1299
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:22,090
- 要知道…  - 我知道，我也是
- You know....  - Yeah, I know. Me too.

1300
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:32,220
祝你生活顺利，事事开心
Have a great life. Have fun with everything you're gonna do.

1301
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:34,800
也祝你学业和一切顺利
Good luck with school and all that.

1302
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,730
我讨厌这样
I hate this.

1303
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:40,930
我也是，火车就要开了
Me too.The train is about to leave.

1304
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:51,450
要知道那些都是废话…
You know all this bullshit we're talking about...

1305
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:54,210
…不再见面？我不愿意
...not seeing each other?I don't want that.

1306
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:55,620
我也不想
I don't either.

1307
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:57,380
- 你不想？  - 我就是等这句话
- You don't?  - I waited for you to say it.

1308
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,150
你干嘛不说出来？
Why didn't you say something?

1309
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:01,520
我担心你不想再见我
I was afraid you didn't wanna see me.

1310
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:02,990
你想怎么做？
What do you wanna do?

1311
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:07,100
也许五年后我们可以在这见面
Maybe we should meet here in five years or something.

1312
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:09,500
五年？那太久了
Five years? That's a long time.

1313
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:13,140
太恐怖了，象做社会学试验
