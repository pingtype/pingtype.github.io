谢谢各位
Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,710
也给你们自己点掌声，因为是你们付出的努力
But no, give yourselves a hand because it was your hard work

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,710
让这个机构旗下的“Yardsham Inlet”迈进最成功的一年
that gave Yardsham Inlet the best year in the history of this agency.

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,260
在我们将功劳拱手相让给我们的上司前
Before we let all that success go to our heads,

6
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,510
我们想让大家来个聚会，并再记起
we just thought we should get together and reconnect with the fundamentals

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,950
[主演：威尔·史密斯]
是什么带我们来到这一步
of what actually got us here.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,630
为此，我将会交给
For that, I'm gonna turn it over

他是位让麦迪逊大道的人闻风丧胆的领袖
He's the guru who terrifies Madison Avenue.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,550
我的拍档及知己
My partner, my better half,

13

霍华德·因莱特
Howard Inlet.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
爱你
Love you.

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,990
噢，你的“原因”是什么？
Oh. What is your "why"?

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,020
你今早为什么起床？
Why did you even get out of the bed this morning?

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,190
你为什么吃你所吃的？
Why did you eat what you ate?

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,510
你为什么穿你所穿的？
Why did you wear what you wore?

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,870
你为什么来这里？
Why did you come here?

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,520
除了因为我会找人替代你的位置
Other than the fact that I would fire you and hire someone else

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,190
如果你不上班的话，但…
if you didn't show up for work, but...

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,190
我要说的不是这个，更重大的“原因”
Not that. The big "why."

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,790
我们会来这里工作绝对不是为了卖东西而已
We're certainly not here to just sell shit.

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,150
我们来这里
We are here

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,870
是去连系
to connect.

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,510
生命的重点是人们
Life is about people.

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,470
而广告的重点是
Advertising is about

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,510
点明我们的产品和服务
illuminating how our products and services

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,950
能够提升人们生活的质素
will improve people's lives.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,830
那
Now,

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,710
我们如何办到？
how do we do that?

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,990
爱情
Love.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,030
时间
Time.

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,070
死亡
Death.

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,030
这三个抽象的概念能够连系世上所有人
Now these three abstractions connect every single human being on Earth.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,430
我们想要得到的事物
Everything that we covet,

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,270
我们害怕失去的事物
everything that we fear not having,

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,110
我们最终都会买的事物
everything that we ultimately end up buying

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,150
全都因为
is because at the end of the day

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,550
我们渴望爱情
we long for love,

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,070
我们希望有更多时间
we wish we had more time,

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,830
还有我们害怕死亡
and we fear death.

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,910
爱情
Love.

44

时间
Time.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,110
死亡
Death.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,070
我们就从那着手
Let's begin there.

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,600
[三 年 后]

48
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,150
这个砌了多久？
How long did this one take?

49
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,150
五天
Five days.

50
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,670
那其实很棒
That's pretty impressive.

51
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,160
- 可能他太早回来工作了  - 你开玩笑吗？
- Maybe he came back too soon.  - Are you kidding me?

52
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,390
这种日复一日的循例已经整整六个月了
It's been six months of this zombie routine.

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,760
我们不能再放纵他
We can't indulge this anymore.

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,230
尤其因为
Especially because

55
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,270
丹沃思金融公司快要跟我们解约了
we're getting fired by Danworth Financial.

56
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,510
什么？告诉我不是真的吧
What? You're kidding me.

57
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,810
- 不是吧，惠特  - 抱歉，什么？
- No, Whit, come on!  - I'm sorry, what?

58
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,280
我昨天才跟他们会面
But I just talked to them yesterday.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,250
我知道，所有人都尽力隐瞒事实
I know. Everybody's been doing their best to cover,

60
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,740
但那整个户口都是建基于霍华德的人际关系
but that entire account is built on Howard's relationship.

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,050
我们一半的收入才是建基于霍华德的人际关系
Half our billings are built on Howard's relationships.

62
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,250
这下可惨了，简直是大灾难
This is a disaster. This is a disaster.

63
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,500
不，还不是
No. Not yet.

64
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,190
[宏盟集团：美国一家公司]
宏盟集团向我们提出每股十七块的提议
We have an offer from Omnicom for $17 a share...

65
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,570
- 我们不能这样做吧  - 但他们想要
- Oh, come on!  - ...but they want an answer

66
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,950
- 在新年前得到答覆  - 殊
- by New Year's.  - Shh.

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,870
坦白说，我们甚至不值一股十四块
Let's be honest, we're not worth $14 a share

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,320
如果我的拍档打算继续
if my partner takes a sabbatical

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,190
在他幻想的疯狂小镇中以骨牌之王自冠
as the local domino champion of Crazy Town.

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,480
惠特，那说得有点过份了
That's a little harsh, Whit.

71
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,510
抱歉，但那是现实
I'm sorry, but it's true.

72
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,030
西蒙，我正式赋予你接受宏盟集团的提议的权力
Simon, I am empowering you. Go make the deal with Omnicom.

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,980
我也想，但霍华德手持有表决权股份
I wish I could, but Howard controls the voting shares.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,450
我会跟霍华德说，好了吗？
I'll deal with the Howard part, okay?

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,670
先准备文件草稿，西蒙
Just push the papers, Simon.

76
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,870
我依然不明白为何霍华德手持百分之六十有表决权股份
I still don't understand why Howard got 60% of the voting shares

77
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,140
而你只拥有百分之四十
and you only got 40.

78
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,590
因为我当时需要金钱去办妥我的离婚手续
Because I needed cash to settle my divorce

79
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,710
而霍华德让我卖给他一些股份，那帮了我很大的忙
and Howard did me a huge favor and let me sell him some.

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,070
即是说，如果你从没跟那刚入行的创作者有婚外情
So, if you never had an affair with some junior creative,

81
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,530
我们就不会落得如此下场？
we wouldn't be in this situation?

82
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,390
这是不准确又不公平的
Inaccurate and unfair

83
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,790
如果硬要让我一力承担
to put it squarely on my shoulders.

84
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,390
我只是在说事实
Well, I'm just pointing out the facts.

85
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,230
天啊，有人会不喜欢这香气吗？
Oh, my God. Don't you just love that smell?

86
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,790
等下
Wait. Stop.

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,350
闭下眼
Close your eyes.

88
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,990
用力吸
Breathe it in.

89
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,150
有没有让你回想起童年？
Doesn't that remind you of your childhood?

90
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,910
克莱尔，来这边
Claire, come here.

91
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,510
坐下吧，我有点事要告诉你
Come on, I got to tell you something.

92
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
什么？
What?

93
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,270
我最近一直试着改变我们现在的处境
I have been doing something about our situation

94
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,110
我觉得你有必要知道
that you need to know about.

95
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
你都做了什么？
What did you do?

96
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,750
我聘请了一个人
I hired someone.

97
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,990
你聘请了一个人？
You hired someone?

98
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,230
对，听着，以前艾萝依抓到我出轨
Yes. Look, when Eloise caught me cheating,

99
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,940
是因为她聘用了一位叫萨利·普赖斯的私家侦探
she used a private investigator named Sally Price.

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,170
她看上去像一个摩门教的老婆婆般不起眼
She's this woman who looks like a Mormon grandmother,

101
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,950
这给了她最好的隐藏身份
and it makes her very good at the whole stealth thing.

102
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,350
你聘请了那个让你离婚的女人？
You hired the woman who caused your divorce?

103
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,550
不，是我导致离婚的
No. I caused my divorce.

104
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,150
萨利·普赖斯只是将我的婚外情记录在案而已
Sally Price just documented it.

105
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,270
你还真不计前嫌
Wow. That was actually enlightened.

106
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,990
我们早已讨论过吧，我是个有深度的人
I have hidden depth. We've discussed this.

107
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,630
所以
So,

108
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,430
你为何聘用那个摩门教老婆婆？
why did you hire the Mormon grandmother?

109
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,430
因为我们需要记录霍华德现在的情况
Because we need to document what's going on with Howard.

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,390
我们需要显示他精神不够健全去作出决定
We need to show that he's not mentally fit to vote his shares.

111
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,150
不，我们不是真的要…
No. We're not really in that place where we're...

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,430
我们真的要变成这样的损友吗？
We're actually gonna be the people who would do that to a friend?

113
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,740
不是因为他一定不会卖他的股份
It's not that he won't sell,

114
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,310
而是因为他甚至不去谈论这个问题
it's that he won't even have a conversation about selling.

115
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,110
我试过接触他，跟他说话
I try to talk to him, I try to reach him,

116
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,760
而那就好像我跟他处在不同的次元一样
and it's like I'm not even in the same physical space with him.

117
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
他心不在焉
He's not there.

118
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,990
他的孩子去世了
His kid died.

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,510
那已经是两年前的事了，克莱尔
That was two years ago, Claire.

120
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,990
我们要怎样…
What are we gonna...

121
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,070
现在火烧眉毛
This is our lives at stake.

122
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
我们不再是小孩了，你当着我面跟我说
We're not kids anymore. You look me in the face

123
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,490
你愿意让过去十年你所付出过的
and tell me that you're willing to have everything you've worked for

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,630
付诸东流，我就不去做
for the last 10 years just evaporate.

125
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,510
这个私家侦探出色吗？
Is this PI good?

126
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,470
她抓到我出轨了
She caught me cheating.

127
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,120
奥斯卡也能做到
Oscar could have caught you cheating.

128
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,670
谁是奥斯卡？
Who the hell's Oscar?

129
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
我儿子
My son.

130
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,990
噢，那个奥斯卡？
Oh. That Oscar?

131
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
这个私家侦探不会找到任何
This private investigator isn't gonna find anything

132
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,030
违背道德的事
that'll pass for moral turpitude.

133
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,870
至少不会在霍华德身上找到
Not on Howard,

134
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,750
但如果她能引起他的法律资格的质疑
but if she can raise concern regarding legal capacity,

135
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,060
那我们就成事了
then we'll be in business.

136
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,670
我真的觉得我们别无选择
I do really think that we are out of other options.

137
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,670
他六个月来一直对心理辅导员爱理不理
You know, he terrorized the grief counselor for six months.

138
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,540
他完全不理我们远道从秘鲁取回来的死藤水萨满草药
He totally blew off the Ayahuasca shaman we flew in all the way from Peru.

139
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,390
而我们完全不能开解他
And our...Our intervention was a disaster.

140
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,830
我只是…
I just...

141
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,750
你的提议听起来不对
Look, uh, this doesn't feel right.

142
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,790
我明白
I know.

143
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,630
但从一个六岁的孩子患上绝症开始
But when something starts with a six-year-old dying,

144
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,470
没什么听起来是对的
nothing is gonna feel right.

145
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
他写了几封信
He writes letters.

146
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,230
信？什么信？
Letters? What kind of letters?

147
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,960
这可能是我生涯遇过最奇怪的一件事
This might be the strangest thing I have ever come across.

148
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,950
- 你有拿到那些信吗？ - 有
- You got the letters?  - Oh, yeah.

149
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,910
我们可以问下来历吗？
Can we ask you how?

150
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,500
花了我八百
Cost me $800

151
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,740
来造这把钥匙
to get this cut.

152
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
顺道说下
And just so you know,

153
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,270
从邮箱里直接偷取信件是犯法的
it's a federal offense to steal mail directly from a mailbox.

154
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,670
- 你可以收起…  - 对
- You could...  - Yeah.

155
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,110
- 共有三封信  - 写给谁的？
- So, three letters.  - Who are they to?

156
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,600
- 噢，不是“谁”  - 什么意思？
- Oh, not who.  - What do you mean?

157
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,320
霍华德不写信给人
Howard doesn't write letters to people.

158
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,790
他写信给事
He writes to things.

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,830
- 什么事？ - 时间
- What kind of things?  - Time.

160
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,030
爱情
Love.

161
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,590
死亡
Death.

162
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,590
那三个抽像的概念
The three abstractions.

163
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,910
致时间
"Time,

164
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,350
人们说你是一切伤害的良药
"they say you heal all wounds,

165
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,430
但他们不会说起你如何
"but they don't talk about how you destroy

166
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
将一切美好化为腐朽
"all that's good in the world.

167
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,550
如何将美丽的事物化作尘埃
"How you turn beauty into ash.

168
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,190
听着，你对我来说只不过是木化石
"Well, you're nothing more than petrified wood to me.

169
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,590
你是块不会分解的坏死组织
"You're a dead tissue that won't decompose.

170
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
你什么也不是
"You're nothing."

171
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,070
那不代表什么，我们不能利用这个吧？
That doesn't prove anything. We can't use that, right?

172
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,270
对，孩子们都写信给圣诞老人
No. I mean, kids write letters to Santa Claus,

173
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,640
那不代表他们疯了
it doesn't mean they're crazy.

174
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,070
不，这很治疗
No. This is therapeutic.

175
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,510
太悲伤了
It's so sad.

176
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,590
对，还有什么吗？
Yeah. Anything else?

177
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,230
他平常下班后，会到布鲁克林的一个宠物公园
Usually after work, he goes to a small dog park in Brooklyn,

178
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,430
即使他没有养狗
even though he doesn't own a dog.

179
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,110
就呆坐在那里
Just sits there for hours.

180
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,760
他会写信给狗吗？
Does he write letters to the dogs?

181
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
你开玩笑吗？
Are you serious?

182
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,570
我说，那就是我们想要的全垒打，对吧？
Well, that would be like the home run, right?

183
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,070
那是我们想要的有力证据
I mean, that's what we need.

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,110
- 他会吗？ - 我没有看到
- Does he?  - Not that I saw.

185
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,350
- 好吧，还有什么吗？ - 没有了，真的
- Okay. What else?  - That's it, really.

186
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,230
每天回到自己的寓所，非必要也不出门
Goes home to his apartment. Rarely leaves before morning.

187
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,670
没有网络，宽频，电话，什么也没有
No Wi-Fi, cable, phone. Nothing.

188
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,950
你是块不会分解的坏死组织
"You're a dead tissue that won't decompose."

189
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,830
霍华德？
Howard?

190
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,310
嗨，是克莱尔
Hey, it's Claire.

191
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,990
我经过路口的一间餐厅给你买了晚餐
I swung by that place down the street and got you some dinner.

192
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,830
有你喜欢的虾
It's that shrimp thing you like.

193
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,830
好吧，我把它放在这，以防你还没吃晚餐
Okay, I'm gonna leave it right here, in case you haven't eaten.

194
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,680
嘿，别再留下食物在那里
Hey, don't keep leaving the food there.

195
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
他不会吃的
He doesn't eat it.

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,670
噢，抱歉
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

197
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,470
还有他又迟了交房租
And he's late on his rent again.

198
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,250
他不应门，我也没有手提电话号码给他
He doesn't answer his door, and I don't have a working number for him.

199
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,550
他没有电话了
Yeah, he doesn't have a phone anymore.

200
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,510
他欠多少钱了？我写支票给你
Um, how much does he owe? I'll write you a check.

201
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,550
随便你
If that's what you want to do.

202
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,670
还有如果你不带走那晚餐
And, uh, if you're not doing anything with that shrimp...

203
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,030
我想说上周的球花甘蓝很美味
Broccoli rabe last week was delicious.

204
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,550
他来了
Here he is.

205
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,580
嘿，你的行李呢？
Hey, where's your stuff?

206
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,070
我本想发讯息给你，但妈妈要我致电给你
I wanted to text you, but Mom said I had to call.

207
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,430
说什么？
Text me about what?

208
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,470
然后巴里就我必须亲口跟你说
But then Barry said I had to tell you in person.

209
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,750
所以我们现在都要听巴里的提议吗？
Are we taking life advice from Barry now?

210
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,570
你…你想告诉我什么？
What are... What are you trying to tell me?

211
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,990
我不会过来跟你住
I'm not coming to stay with you.

212
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,770
我要跟巴里和妈妈一起去巴哈马
I'm going with Barry and Mom to the Bahamas.

213
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,310
不，等下
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

214
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,860
午安
Hi.

215
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,510
你好吗？
How you doing?

216
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,400
我可以跟我的女儿
Can I get, like, five minutes, maybe a couple feet

217
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,630
独自相处一会吗？
just to have this conversation with my daughter?

218
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,780
谢谢
Thanks.

219
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,180

我买了汉密尔顿音乐剧的票
I got us tickets to Hamilton.

224
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,510
那真糟糕
Then sucks for Hamilton.

225
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,030
埃里森，那音乐剧一票难求
That's a tough ticket, Allison.

226
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,380
我已经看过了
I've already seen it.

227

230
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,550
对
Yeah.

231

他是巴里的朋友之一
He's one of Barry's friends.

232
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,300
为什么？
Why?

233
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,290
为什么你不想跟我一起过节日？
Why don't you want to spend the holiday with me?

234
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,630

因为是个慈善家
Because you're a philanthropist.

237

- 随性所欲的人  - 什么？
- Philanderer.  - What?

239
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,010
你想说的是随性所欲的人，不是慈悲家
The word you're looking for is philanderer, not philanthropist.

240
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,600
两者有点不同
They have a slightly different meaning.

241
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,390
你当然知道分别
Well, you would know.

242
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,180
我答应他们亲口告诉你，现在我做到了
Look, I agreed to tell you in person, and now I have.

Don't even have to talk. Don't even have to look at each other.

我们快要失去丹沃思这个客户
We're gonna lose the Danworth account

257
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,800
因为那一直都是你打理的
because that's always been your relationship.

258
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,140
你也能想像得到，他们不再感受到你的用心
And they're not feeling the love, as you might imagine.

259
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
所以那就是无可避免的
So that's gonna happen.

对，我也知道
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,880
- 游轮  - 看，那才值得
- Cruise line.  - Now, see, that's good copy.

275
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,600
放下一切，寻找意义
"Shed your skin, find your life."

276
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,190
抱歉，应该是
Sorry, it's

277
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,920
当你放下一切才能找到生命意义
"Life is found when you shed your skin."

278
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,590
- 有所谓吗？ - 有，因为是我写的
- Does it really matter?  - Yes, because I wrote it.

279
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,590
原来如此，但我的较好
Oh, well, my way's better.

280
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,150
- 你真认为吗？哪里较好？ - 对
- Really? How?  - Yeah.

281
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,830
重温一下，你的是什么？
Well... Wait, what is your way?

282
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,030
当你放下一切才能找到生命意义
"Life is found when you shed your skin."

283
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,150
说中你脑里想的
Which, you know, kind of hits you here.

284
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,430
放下一切，寻找意义
"Shed your skin, find your life."

285
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,870
说到心窝里
Hits you here.

286
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,420
真的耶
That does hit me here.

287
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,190
对吧？
Right?

288
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
你可以随便拿去用
You can have it for free.

289
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,310
等下
Just, wait. Wait.

290
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,670
等下
Wait.

291
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,180
- 嗨，弗兰克尔  - 什么事？
- Hey, Frankel.  - Yeah?

292
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,070
放下一切，寻找意义
"Shed your skin, find your life."

293
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,310
放下一切，寻找意义，知道了吗？
"Shed your skin, find your life." Everybody, okay?

294
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
知道
Got it.

295
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,950
她美化了它
She made it better.

296
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,030
嘿！
Hey!

297
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,300
别走
No, no, no.

298
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,550
嘿！
Hey, hey!

299
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,150
而你用这样的语气跟我说话
"And you talk to me in such tones

300
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,950
说得好像不是我把你带到这个世上
"as if it wasn't the breath in my lungs that gave you life."

301
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,630
- 你迟到了  - 抱歉
- You're late.  - Sorry.

302
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,750
说得好像不是因为我的灵光一触
"As if it wasn't a spark in my mind

303
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,590
才给予生命意义
"that gave that life meaning."

304
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,910
噢，你的舌头在动，你的嘴在吐字
"Oh, you move your tongue, you mouth syllables,

305
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,750
你的情感在翻腾
"you echo sentiment.

306
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,140
但你没有活过
"But you do not breathe."

307
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,380
你说火花？
"You speak of spark?

308
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,980
那简直是奢求
"That is richness.

309
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,350
因为你否认我们两个之间的火花
"For you deny the spark between us all.

310
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,390
那火花比起你那冷酷无情的火焰，简直是太阳般温暖
"A spark that is more a sun than the cold fire you claim.

311
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,790
而你竟形容我为年轻的冲动
"And you have called me a temporary madness.

312
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,180
一个邪恶的灵魂
"A vicious soul.

313
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,790
那
"Well,

314
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,910
抚心自问你想不想再见我一面
"then ask if you will see me just one more time."

315
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,110
你好
Hello?

316
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,790
你好
Hi.

317
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,070
抱歉，我擅自走进这里
So sorry. I literally just wandered in,

318
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,950
我刚好看到最尾的部分
and I caught the tail end of that, and...

319
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,960
我可以表达我的赞赏吗？
Can I just say that was beautiful?

320
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,150
那是什么话剧？
What is... What is it?

321
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,210
只是些构思而已
It's just something we're trying to put together.

322
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,110
我…我很喜欢话剧，哪类型都喜欢
I just... I love theater. I see everything.

323
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,770
正式表演是什么时候？我会来的
So when's opening night? I'll be there.

324
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,230
直到我们筹得足够的钱前都不会有正式表演
There is no opening night until we get this money together.

325
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,430
- 你富有吗？ - 我离婚了
- You rich?  - Divorced.

326
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,590
你从刚才试镜就跟着我
You followed me from the casting session.

327
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,670
- 对，是的  - 是吧
- Absolutely, I did. Yes.  - Yeah.

328
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,140
我几乎看不到你，但你的红帽子帮了忙
I almost lost you, but the red hat helped.

329
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,630
我要说件有点突然的事
Hey, um, I'm gonna say something a little impulsive here,

330
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
听起来或者有点疯狂
maybe a little crazy,

331
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,560
我有件想要做的事
but, you know, I have something about to happen for me.

332
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,070
我正在跟别人商讨当中，但如果能成事
I'm in the middle of a deal that if it all comes together,

333
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,670
我就能资助你们
I'd be in a position to help.

334
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,670
那不是双赢的局面吗？
Well, now wouldn't that be lovely?

335
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,310
是，是件很好的事
It would. Be great.

336
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,150
而你，你刚才帮助了我
And you, you know, you fixed it.

337
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,590
所以，如果你想要刚才试镜的工作的话，我们可以让你来
So, we should get you back into casting if you want the gig.

338
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,240
抱歉，我甚至还没请教你的名字
Sorry, I don't even... I don't know your name.

339
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,910
- 我叫艾米  - 艾米
- Amy.  - Amy.

340
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,430
好吧
Okay. Well,

341
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,750
我会再来的，艾米
I'll be back, Amy. I'll be back.

342
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,220
我先走…
Mmm. And I'll be...

343
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,750
抱歉
Hmm. Sorry.

344
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,270
我太兴奋了
I was on the stage!

345
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,910
我会再来的
I'll be back.

346
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,230
你很有演技
You're good.

347
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,110
真有你的
Well done, you.

348
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,550
等下，现在都有《犯罪现场：克里夫兰》了吗？
Wait, they have a CSI: Cleveland now?

349
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,610
是全新一辑
It's a new show.

350
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,910
那些狼人
The werewolves,

351
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,910
他们在外面聚集
they're meeting out front

352
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,990
每晚都是
all hours of the night.

353
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,590
对，我也留意到
I heard them. Yeah.

354
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,750
我想他们…
I think they're...

355
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,550
我想他们正在投票选出组织的头目
I think they're voting on a new head of the syndicate.

356
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,860
但
But

357
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,430
我有个浣熊朋友，他是特种部队的一员
I got a raccoon friend. He's on the task force.

358
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,630
他在外面帮我放了个监听器在垃圾桶上
He put a bug out there for me by the trash cans.

359
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,590
我们将会录下他们所说的一切
We're gonna tape everything they say

360
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,110
并以诈骗、操纵和贿赂组织法控告他们
and we'll bust them on a RICO statute.

361
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,110
我不知道那是什么
I don't know anything about that.

362
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,190
嘿，我是你的儿子
Hey, I'm your son.

363
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,830
这我知道
I know that!

364
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,110
很好
Good.

365
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,270
我离开一下
I'll be right back.

366
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,470
我有个大胆的想法
Okay, I have kind of a wild idea.

367
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,770
你们听了很可能会取笑我
And I know you're gonna laugh at me,

368
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,760
但记住我们没有其他办法，所以听我说完
but remember that we're desperate and hear me out.

369
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,750
我的母亲自从中风后精神状态就不佳，对吧？
So, my mom hasn't been totally in her right mind since her stroke, right?

370
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,630
而我经常试着提醒她身边发生什么事
And I'm always trying to remind her what's actually going on

371
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,220
还有改正她的胡言乱语
and correct the, sort of, daffy things that she says.

372
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,290
而这样做令她感到不快乐，我也不知所措
And it upsets her, and it really stresses me out.

373
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,050
有段时间事情变得很麻烦
And it was pretty much just awful for a while.

374
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,640
然后，有人解开了我的心结
And then, someone said something very, very wise to me.

375
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,740
他们说：或者你不该强逼她听你的那套
They said, "Maybe you should stop trying to force your reality on her

376
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,990
而你试着跟她的思路走
"and just... Just go into her reality."

377
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,990
我以为你没钱去支付治疗费了
I thought you couldn't afford therapy anymore.

378
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,990
- 我是没有，那是我的优步司机说的  - 噢
- I can't. It was my Uber driver.  - Oh.

379
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,510
他完全正确
And he was totally right. Totally right!

380
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,670
当我开始照他说的做，所有事都轻松多了
As soon as I started doing this, everything got easier, you know?

381
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,830
我跟她的生活就变得很即兴
Our life is like this improvisational game.

382
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,430
她说些有的没的，而我就以她的方式回答她
She just... She says wackadoodle stuff, and I respond to it.

383
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,030
现在她过得很快乐，而我也颇喜欢这互动
And, uh, she's totally happy and I kind of have fun.

384
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,570
那让我想到一个人
And that made me think of something else.

385
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,350
好了
Okay.

386
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,180
[应为诊所之类]
以前我在“FBW”时
When I was at FBW,

387
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,370
我有个买兴奋药的户口
I had this account for a psychostimulant drug, right?

388
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,360
他们办了个什么筹款活动
And they went with some bullshit generic campaign,

389
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,210
我买了这套《西班牙裔美国人市场》
but I kept the Hispanic market.

390
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,350
看这个
Here, watch this. Okay.

391
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,750
那老师非常苦恼
So, the teacher is really stressing. He's saying, uh,

392
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,950
你们都在自己说话，不听我讲课
"Well, you talk all the time! You never listen!"

393
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,910
然后怪物进来
And then here comes the monster.

394
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,370
它说：不用这样的
"It doesn't have to be this way."

395
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,390
老师说：你是谁？
Teacher, "Who are you?"

396
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,990
怪物说：我就是你的愤怒啊
Monster, "I'm your anger, man."

397
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
老师回答
And the teacher says...

398
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,640
我不能再忍受你，你支配了我的生命
"I can't stand you, man. You dominate my life."

399
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,590
然后它回答：有个解决方法，朋友
And anger says, "There's a solution, my friend.

400
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,550
Docotrin，助你解决愤怒问题
"Docotrin, say goodbye to your anger."

401
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,590
你明白我想说的话？
Do you see where I'm going with this?

402
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,190
- 不太懂  - 好了，听着
- Not really.  - Okay, okay. Look, look.

403
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,550
我们不能让霍华德听我们的那套
We can't get Howard to deal with this reality that we need him to deal with.

404
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,430
他在写信给抽像的概念，完全不合逻辑
And he's writing letters to abstractions which makes no sense.

405
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,550
但他依然继续做
But... But he's doing it.

406
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,950
那么，如果我们跟他的思路
So, what if we just go into his reality

407
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,750
让那些抽像的概念回应他？
and we get those abstractions to answer him?

408
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,150
抱歉，我不明白
I'm sorry, I... I don't follow.

409
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,950
如果让爱情，时间，死亡实体化
What if Love, Time and Death show up in person

410
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,420
回应霍华德写给他们的信怎样？
and answer the letters that Howard's been writing to them?

411
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,430
在哪找爱情，时间，死亡？
How are Time, Love and Death gonna show up?

412
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,590
演员
Actors.

413
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,150
我们聘请演员扮演爱情，时间，死亡
We hire actors to be Love, Death and Time.

414
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,470
他们找到霍华德并跟他对质
They find Howard and they confront him.

415
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,640
所以你想让我们欺骗你的上司？
So, you want us to gaslight your boss?

416
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,190
- 抱歉，什么？ - 煤气灯下
- Huh? I'm sorry?  - Gas Light.

417
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,120
知道吗？是出话剧，然后拍成电影
You know? It was a play, then it was a movie.

418
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,990
那套煤气灯下？天啊
Gas Light? Oh, my God.

419
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,940
没有人会再看长过八秒钟的事了吗？
Does nobody ever watch anything longer than eight seconds anymore?

420
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,630
她的意思是，你想我们让他以为自己疯了？
What she's saying is you want us to make him think he's crazy?

421
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,390
不，目的不是这个
No, no, no. It's not about making Howard think he's crazy.

422
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,470
霍华德精神状态不佳，我们几个都知道
Howard's not in a good mental state, and we know that.

423
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,870
目的是让他人也知道
It's about underlining that fact so that other people can see it, too.

424
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,350
所以你想让我们跟他接触时演戏
Okay. So you want us to perform in this intervention,

425
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,590
而你们事后会资助我们的话剧？
and for that you're gonna finance our play?

426
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,860
- 对  - 正是
- That's it.  - Exactly.

427
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,030
对，我们会资助这个什么…
Yeah, we'll finance whatever...

428
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,890
这看起来像是货仓，但…
I mean, this looks like a storage facility, but...

429
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,350
好吧，其他演员，我们怎样？
Okay. Well, actors. What do we think?

430
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,980
- 不不不  - 噢，不是
- No. No, no, no.  - Oh, no.

431
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
听着
Listen, listen!

432
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,670
我们每人要求一万五
We take $15,000 each.

433
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,590
- 好吗？一万五  - 你疯了吗？
- Okay? $15,000.  - Are you completely out of your mind?

434
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,510
好吧，我们会帮你们
Okay, we'll do it.

435
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,030
以每人两万的报酬
$20,000, each.

436
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,510
不！我刚…你们才刚说一万五，我听到的
Uh-uh! I just...You guys just said 15. I heard you say 15.

437
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,990
- 我喜欢两万  - 我也是
- Mmm... I like 20.  - I like 20 as well.

438
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,240
两万真的太…有点过份了
Well, 20's just... I don't know, it's a little steep.

439
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,650
我打算给两千的，这些人很可能住在布鲁克林
I was thinking two. These guys probably live in Brooklyn.

440
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,330
- 他们月租六百  - 够了，停下吧
- They pay 600 bucks a month.  - Stop talking. Just stop.

441
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,530
你做得不错
You did a good job pulling them down.

442
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,240
这很可怕，这事完全不对
This is horrible. This is completely wrong.

443
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,110
不，艾米，这就是我们的工作，是演戏
No, Amy. This is the work. This is acting.

444
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,520
你没听到他们说这个人的孩子过世了吗？
Did you not hear them say that this man's lost his child?

445
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,150
有，那就是为何他选择向宇宙中寻找答案
Yes. And that's why he's reaching out to the cosmos for answers.

446
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,230
我们有幸扮演他想找的
Well, we get to be that cosmos.

447
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,510
所以你想我们运用这个男人的痛处，然后怎样？
So you want us to manipulate this guy's pain so that, what?

448
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,550
你们兑现？赚很多钱？
What, you cash out? You make a lot of money?

449
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,200
- 不！ - 当然不是！
- No!  - No, no, no, no!

450
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,690
你这样说听起来不对
That doesn't sound good when you put it that way.

451
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,020
- 这比看上去复杂得多  - 是吗？
- It's a lot more complicated than that.  - Is it?

452
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,230
我们都爱这个人
We love this man.

453
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,630
他不只是我们上司，他是朋友
And he's not just a boss, he's a friend.

454
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,470
霍华德是个有才华，创意和魅力的男人
Howard is a brilliant, creative, charismatic guy

455
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
他曾经是那样无所畏惧
who used to be fearless.

456
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,110
他曾经热爱他的生命，而现在，他恨透了生命
He used to love life, and right now, he hates it.

457
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,060
你们真的认为那样做能帮助他？
And you really think that this is gonna help him?

458
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,710
他失去了他的孩子
He lost his child.

459
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,900
而现在他不介意失去所有
And now he doesn't care if he loses everything else.

460
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,420
我们不能让这发生
We just can't let that happen.

461
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,270
我们要带他回来现实
We have to bring him back.

462
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,220
两万物有所值
$20,000's worth it.

463
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,650
- 我会付的  - 克莱尔！
- I'll pay for it.  - Claire!

464
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,910
我会自己交出钱来，我不在意
I'll pay for it. I'll pay for it myself. I don't care.

465
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,230
那规则呢？
So, what are the rules?

466
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,230
首先我们需要签合同
Well, first, we'd have to sign a confidentiality agreement.

467
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,250
确保你们不说出去，因为…
And make sure that you don't talk about it, 'cause...

468
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,570
我不是指法律条款
No, I don't mean the legal rules.

469
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,390
我指这出戏
I mean, the rules of the theatrical device.

470
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,510
例如，其他人也能看到我们吗？还是只有霍华德？
I mean, do other people see us, or only Howard?

471
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,760
- 对，其他人也能看到他们吗，惠特？ - 惠特？
- Yeah, do other people see them, Whit?  - Whit?

472
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,670
我猜…只有霍华德吧
I guess... I guess only Howard.

473
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,830
那就是我们想要的效果吧？
That's the effect we're looking for, right?

474
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,470
- 猜？ - 你猜？我…
- Guess?  - You guess? I mean...

475
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,280
抱歉，你到底有没有想清楚？
I'm sorry, have you thought this through?

476
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,790
- 当然有  - 没有
- Sure. Sure.  - No.

477
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,170
- 一定程度吧  - 不，我们没有
- I mean, to a degree.  - No, we haven't.

478
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,550
没有，惠特，停下，我们没有想清楚
No, we haven't, Whit. Shut up! Like... We haven't.

479
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,630
假设他们想要到酒吧里喝一杯呢？
For instance, what if they go into a bar and they want to order a drink?

480
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,860
他们如何能…
How can they do that if...

481
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,930
你近来有看见霍华德进酒吧吗？
Do you see Howard walking into a lot of bars these days?

482
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,180
随便吧，那不重要
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

483
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,010
- 那霍华德突然想去俱乐部呢？ - 他们是演员
- I mean, what if Howard goes clubbing?  - They're actors.

484
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,830
- 他们需要预备这种情况  - 够了够了
- They need to know hypothetically.  - Okay. Okay. Enough. Enough.

485
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,430
我们有选择被谁看见，何时看见的能力
We have the power to be seen by whomever we want, whenever we want.

486
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,310
- 那怎样？ - 不错，我喜欢
- How's that?  - I like that, I like that.

487
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,130
- 我说过他们是好演员  - 我喜欢
- I told you they were good.  - I like that, yeah.

488
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,440
我们该留给他们想
We should just leave it to them.

489
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,540
继续
Let's move on.

490
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
下一步呢？
What's next?

491
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,790
霍华德写了三封信，分别给爱情，时间和死亡
Howard wrote three letters to Love, Death and Time.

492
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,990
所以我想唯一的问题是，谁扮演哪个？
So, I guess the only question is who plays who?

493
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,070
选角，非常重要
Casting. Very important.

494
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,830
爱情
Love.

495
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,590
死亡
Death.

496
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
时间
Time.

497
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,620
很好，我们何时收到报酬？
Great. When do we get paid?

498
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,150
致死亡，你经过很多神话
"Dear Death, you travel with so much mythology,

499
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,350
给予很多伤痛，引起很多恐惧
"cause so much pain, inspire such fear.

500
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,590
但你对我来说纸老虎
"But you're a paper tiger to me.

501
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,870
你只是个可悲又没作为的中层管理人员
"You're just pathetic and powerless middle management.

502
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,640
你甚至没有权力去做一个简单的交易
"You don't even have the authority to make a simple trade."

503
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,830
你也看到，这不是位支持者写的信
As you can see, it's not exactly a fan letter.

504
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,200
对，死亡没有很多支持者
Yeah, well, Death doesn't have any fans.

505
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,670
我不明白你们为何这样做，因为这也算是解放
I don't understand why, because it's a liberation.

506
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,710
你还好吗？
Hey, you okay?

507
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,190
他上班，然后去宠物公园
He goes to work, and the dog park.

508
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,870
就这两个地方
And that's it.

509
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,550
好吧，这就是我会做的
Okay. So, here's how I'm gonna do it.

510
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,190
我会很愤怒的走上他面前
I'm gonna come to him angry.

511
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,550
非常愤怒的，像我们有问题要解决
Like, pissed off. Like, we got a problem.

512
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,020
不，别这样做
No, no, no. Don't do that.

513
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,230
他说我是木和坏死组织，他在呼唤我
He's calling me wood and dead tissue. He's calling me out.

514
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
这怎算呼唤你？
How's he calling you out?

515
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,750
是时间
Time.

516
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,830
[找寻一个更安全的捐赠者]
他在呼唤时间，而我就是时间
He's calling out Time, and I'm Time.

517
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,550
我不想你去跟霍华德对抗
Look, I don't want you antagonizing Howard.

518
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,070
你明白吗？
Do you get that?

519
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,230
但信里只写了“再见”
But the letter only consists of one word, "Goodbye."

520
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
看
Look.

521
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,070
致爱情，再见
"Dear Love, goodbye."

522
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,910
我到底要跟他说什么？
What am I even supposed to say to him?

523
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,270
那…
Um, it's...

524
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,010
这是封道别爱情的信，对吧？
It's a letter to Love saying goodbye, right?

525
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,710
- 对  - 那假如你走上前
- Yeah.  - So, what if you approach him,

526
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,390
然后说你拒绝接受？
and you refuse to accept that?

527
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,830
你说他不能那么容易就摆脱你
You say he can't get rid of you that easily.

528
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,230
告诉他
Tell him that

529
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,230
我们没有选择爱谁和被谁受的权利
we don't get to choose who we love and who loves us back.

530
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,950
告诉他你在他之中
Tell him that you're within him,

531
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,020
你在万物之中，无论他喜欢与否
you're within everything, whether he likes it or not.

532
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,270
如果他接受了
And if he accepts that,

533
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,150
那可能… 我不知道
then maybe... I don't know.

534
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,910
他可能找回他的生存意义
Maybe he gets to find his life again.

535
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,670
他们会悲伤
They grieve.

536
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,070
狗只们
Dogs.

537
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,470
他们会悲伤，而且了解死亡
They grieve, and they fully understand death.

538
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,750
你说我是纸老虎
You called me a paper tiger.

539
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,270
在你给我的信当中
In the letter you wrote me.

540
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,990
你说我可悲
You said I was pathetic.

541
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,860
嗯
Mmm.

542
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,300
你不记得了吗？
You don't remember?

543
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,710
你说了一堆中层管理人员
You went on about middle management,

544
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,990
做交易，纸老虎
making a deal, paper tiger.

545
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,150
霍华德，那才过不久
Oh, Howard, it wasn't that long ago.

546
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,470
你从哪拿到的？
Where did you get that?

547
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,310
- 你是谁？ - 你写给谁？
- Who are you?  - Who did you write the letter to?

548
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,150
我写给死亡
I wrote the letter to Death.

549
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,030
很高兴认识你，我肯定你被迷倒了
Nice to meet you. Charmed, I'm sure.

550
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,310
不
No.

551
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
我明白
I know, I know.

552
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,550
人们经常写信给宇宙
People write letters to the universe all the time.

553
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,550
大部份都没有得到答覆
Most don't get a personal response.

554
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,070
但你有，因为我只想告诉你，你错了
But you are, because I just wanted to tell you that you're wrong.

555
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,030
我不是什么没作为的中层管理人员
I'm not some powerless middle management

556
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,520
- 还有只跟从指令  - 小姐
- just following orders.  - Miss...

557
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,070
我不想做交易，是我决定的
You see, I didn't want to make the trade. It was my call.

558
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,230
我不想听你说
I don't want this. I don't want this.

559
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,040
我没有对你的工作指指点点
Now, I don't tell you how to do your job.

560
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,110
所以我也希望你别教我如何工作
So, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell me how to do mine.

561
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,630
那个男人在跟谁说话？他看起来有点怪
Who's that man talking to? He looks kind of weird.

562
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,950
别担心，有时候人们做些不能理解的事
Don't worry about that. Sometimes people are silly.

563
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,710
你看，他们看不到我存在，直到轮到他们
You see, they don't see me till it's their time.

564
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,990
没事的，霍华德，还没轮到你
Oh, it's okay, Howard. It's not your time yet.

565
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,710
我只想交还你这个
I just wanted to return this

566
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,590
并且解决我们之间的恩怨
and clear things up between us.

567
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,040
我真的是死亡，霍华德
I really am Death, Howard!

568
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
他信了
He believed me.

569
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,230
我告诉你，他信了
I'm telling you he believed me.

570
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,830
- 真棒  - 那非常精彩
- That's amazing.  - I mean, that was spectacular.

571
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,610
因为没有第二次机会
Because there was no safety net, you see.

572
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,040
[格罗托夫斯基了：导演]
那真的太格罗托夫斯基了
That... That... That was Grotowski.

573
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,630
[斯特拉·阿德勒：演员]
- 那简直是斯特拉·阿德勒  - 对
- That was pure Stella Adler!  - Ah!

574
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,800
- 谢谢你给予我这个机会  - 对
- Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity.  - Yes.

575
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,010
- 你真是个好人  - 不成问题
- You are a kind man.  - Oh, not a problem.

576
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,850
- 他信了，我告诉你  - 我不会这么肯定
- He believed me, I'm telling you.  - I wouldn't go that far.

577
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,090
他需要这个，我可以从他的眼睛里看到
But he needed it. I could tell. I could tell in his eyes.

578
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,410
那个女人和小男孩是谁？时机很棒
Who was that woman and that little boy? That was incredible.

579
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,570
那是我们的私家侦探和她的孙子
Oh, that was our private investigator and her grandson.

580
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,750
真的？她有说我的演出怎样吗？
Oh, really? And did she say anything about me?

581
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,790
她说你很好
She said you were good. She said really good.

582
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,290
好？什么意思？像…
"Good"? What do you mean? Good like...

583
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,430
像卷心菜一样好还是什么？
You mean good like cabbage is good, or what?

584
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,630
不不，她…出色
No, no. She... Great.

585
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,310
她说：她将不可能化为可能
She said, she said, "She made the impossible possible."

586
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,830
我该给你钱
I should be paying you.

587
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,470
他们当时告诉我特雷弗已收拾好他的包袱
They told me that Trevor had packed his little suitcase,

588
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,830
他说他要回家了
that he said he was going home.

589
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,150
我愤怒极了
I was furious.

590
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,820
但他在睡，所以我没有跟他说话
But he was sleeping, so I couldn't talk to him.

591
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,630
什么样的护士会答应一个正在慢慢死去的五岁小男孩
I mean, what nurse promises this dying five-year-old little boy

592
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,430
他能回家？
he could go home?

593
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,830
他几乎没剩多少白血球
He barely had any white blood cells left.

594
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,310
他很脆弱
He was so fragile.

595
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,630
谁能这么残忍呢？
And who could be so cruel?

596
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,910
谁能对他撒谎呢？
Who could do that?

597
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,910
所以当然，我失控了
So, of course I'm frantic.

598
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,470
我对职员大声责骂，只想寻根究底
I am shouting at the staff, trying to get to the bottom of it.

599
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,390
特雷弗终于醒了
Well, Trevor finally wakes up

600
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,750
我走上前
and I go to him.

601
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,020
他的蓝色包包还放在床尾
You know, his little blue suitcase was still at the edge of the bed, right.

602
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,550
我看着他并问
So, I look at him and ask,

603
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,670
谁跟你说的，宝目？
"Who said that to you, sweetie?

604
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,390
谁说你可以回到我们的房子？
"Who said that you could come back to our house?"

605
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,670
你知道他怎样回答吗？
You know what he says?

606
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,870
没有人，妈妈
"Nobody, Mommy.

607
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,950
我不是回我们的房子
"I'm not going back to our house.

608
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,230
我是回我所属之处
"I'm going home."

609
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,430
他四小时后过世了
He died four hours later.

610
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,830
你好
Hello.

611
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,310
你好
Hi.

612
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,420
你在找“小翅膀支援团队”吗？
Are you looking for Smallest Wings Support Group?

613
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,910
嗯…
Um...

614
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,830
- 对  - 你是？
- Yes.  - And you are?

615
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,070
- 嗯，霍华德  - 霍华德
- Um, Howard.  - Howard.

616
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,510
进去坐下吧
Come on in. Have a seat.

617
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,950
你失去了孩子吗，霍华德？
Did you lose a child, Howard?

618
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,950
对
Yeah.

619
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,630
- 男还是女？ - 啊…
- Boy or girl?  - Uh...

620
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,100
女儿
A girl.

621
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,470
那她的名字是？
And what was her name?

622
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,670
没关系，霍华德
No, it's okay. Howard.

623
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,630
你不必回答
You don't have to answer.

624
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,270
你甚至不需要说话
You don't even have to talk, okay?

625
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,590
可以留下吗？
You stick around?

626
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,300
拜托？
Please?

627
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,270
好了
Okay.

628
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,990
谢谢你的分享
Thank you so much for sharing.

629
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,540
我们都很感谢
We really appreciate it.

630
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
谢谢
Thank you.

631
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,980
有人想要分享什么吗？
Does anybody have anything else they'd like to say?

632
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,510
- 你今晚为何打算进来？ - 嗯？
- So, why'd you decide to come in tonight?  - Hmm?

633
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,350
我以前看过你站在外面
Yeah, I've... I've seen you outside.

634
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,350
我早晚打算邀请你进来
I was gonna come out one night and invite you in,

635
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,470
但我猜我不想暴露你的隐藏位置
but I guess I didn't want to blow up your spot.

636
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,030
暴露我的隐藏位置？
Blow up my spot?

637
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,190
- 对  - 你不想打乱我的节奏？
- Yeah.  - You didn't want to mess up my jam?

638
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,150
正是
Exactly.

639
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,860
你叫什么？
What's your name?

640
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,580
我是玛德琳
I'm Madeline.

641
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,750
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

642
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,030
我女儿叫奥利维亚
My daughter's name was Olivia.

643
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,750
她因为一种叫胶质母细胞瘤的罕有脑癌而过世
She died of a rare form of brain cancer known as Glioblastoma Multiforme,

644
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,230
或简称“GBM”
or GBM for short.

645
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,150
她当时六岁
She was six years old.

646
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,910
你的女儿叫什么，霍华德？
What was your daughter's name, Howard?

647
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,390
好吧
Okay.

648
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,550
不要紧，别回答，我不想折磨你
Fine. Don't answer. I'm not gonna torture you.

649
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,110
谢谢
Thank you.

650
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,790
- 是因为节日吗？ - 嗯？
- Was it the holidays?  - Mmm?

651
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,870
你今晚进来的原因
Why you decided to come in tonight.

652
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,830
有很多第一次来的人都是在节日期间
We get a lot of first-timers during the holidays.

653
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,380
- 不，不是因为这个  - 那为什么是今晚？
- No, that's not it.  - Then why tonight?

654
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,910
我想…
Uh, I guess...

655
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
我…
I'm, uh...

656
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,910
我在试着解开心结
I'm trying to fix my mind.

657
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,870
你失去了孩子，霍华德
You lost a child, Howard.

658
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,470
你的心结永远都会在
It'll never be fixed.

659
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,950
我希望你会再来
I hope you come back.

660
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
嗨
Hey.

661
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,910
这是签妥了的合约和保密协议
Signed contracts and confidentiality agreements.

662
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,350
- 太好了，谢谢  - 所以他有说什么吗？
- Oh, great. Thank you.  - So, did he say something?

663
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,830
谁啊？霍华德？
Who, Howard?

664
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,760
- 不幸的，没有  - 他信了
- No. Unfortunately, he didn't.  - He believed it, I'm telling you.

665
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,610
- 那真是太好了  - 或许你该再派我去了
- Oh, that's good.  - Maybe you should send me in again.

666
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,670
而不是拉菲，他太急躁了
Not Raffi. Raffi's too impetuous.

667
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,670
还有艾米，她太感情用事
And Amy, she's just so emotional.

668
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,510
除了我，还有谁？
After me, what is there?

669
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,110
他共写了三封信
Well, he did write three letters.

670
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,270
但死亡比时间重要多了
But Death is so much more vital than Time.

671
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,950
- 对  - 死亡给予时间意义
- Right.  - Death gives Time all of its value.

672
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,870
或许全都该由我扮演
Maybe... Maybe I should play all the parts.

673
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,670
你知道现时人口统计中的新任父母的数字比以往高吧？
You know the highest margin demographic is new parents now?

674
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,320
他们制造出一条算法
Target actually invented an algorithm

675
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,570
去推算他们的女性客户何时会怀孕
to predict when their female customers were gonna get pregnant.

676
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,870
你之前说过你不适
You said before that you weren't okay.

677
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,510
你患病了吗？
Are you sick?

678
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,180
对
I'm sick.

679
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,710
你可以说我的病情非常严重
You could say, uh, I'm very sick.

680
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,190
你要死了吗？
You're dying?

681
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,190
每个人都在死去
Everyone's dying.

682
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,190
对，但你时日无多
Yeah, but you're doing it now.

683
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,070
西蒙，西蒙
Simon. Simon.

684
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,870
来吧，告诉我，是什么病？有什么不对劲了？
Come on, tell me. Tell me. What is it? What's wrong?

685
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,750
有什么不对劲？
What's wrong?

686
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,230
就是我病情恶化了
What's wrong is that I came out of remission

687
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,910
在我儿子出生前的两周
two weeks before my son was born.

688
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,790
是我
What's wrong

689
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,520
每天都要装作我还很健康
is that I'm running a marathon every day pretending to be healthy.

690
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,940
那就是不对劲的地方
That's what's wrong.

691
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,310
你有跟谁说过吗？
Have you told anyone?

692
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,550
没有？
You haven't?

693
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,790
没有，就一个我几乎不认识却又不断质问我的女演员
No, just some pushy actress that I don't really know.

694
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,430
什么病？
What is it?

695
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,140
是多发性骨髓瘤
It's multiple myeloma.

696
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,710
我十六岁时发病，二十五岁又重发
I fought it when I was 16, and then again when I was 25.

697
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,190
它从没离开过
It just never went away.

698
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,950
反而组织起来变得更强
Instead it regrouped and got stronger.

699
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,190
所以没法医治？
So, the war's over?

700
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,390
对
Yeah, war's over.

701
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,870
你的身后事处理好了吗？
Are your affairs in order?

702
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,900
没有
My affairs are not in order.

703
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,470
所以我聘请了你
That's why I hired you.

704
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,640
我要离开我的家人已经够坏了
It's bad enough that I'm leaving my family.

705
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,750
我不会让他们之后身无分文
I'm not gonna leave them penniless.

706
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,790
他信了我
He believed me.

707
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,670
霍华德
Howard.

708
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,140
他信了我
He believed me.

709
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,590
抱歉，别碰
Hey. Excuse me. No, don't touch that.

710
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,310
我不明白骨牌
I don't understand dominoes.

711
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,830
没有计分牌，或者一个篮框
There's no board to play them on, or basket to throw them into.

712
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,350
对
Right. Um...

713
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,120
我想你去错地方了
I think you might be in the wrong place.

714
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,990
不，我没去错，霍华德
No, I'm in the right place, Howard.

715
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,460
对吧
Mmm. Yeah.

716
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,550
致时间，人们说你是一切伤害的良药
"Time, they say you heal all wounds,

717
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,910
但他们不会说起你如何将一切美好化为腐朽
"but they don't talk about how you destroy all that's good in the world.

718
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,590
如何将美丽的事物化作尘埃
"How you turn beauty into ash."

719
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,470
那真是一派胡言，霍华德
Now that's some bullshit, Howard.

720
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,230
如果爱情是创造而死亡是破坏
If Love is creation and Death is destruction,

721
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,310
我就只是他们两者之间
I'm just a terrain in between.

722
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,190
你不了解时间，没有人了解时间
You don't understand Time. No one understands Time.

723
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,150
爱因斯坦几乎弄清，他说我是幻想
I mean, Einstein came close when he said I was an illusion.

724
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,510
霍华德？嘿
Howard? Hey. Uh...

725
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,860
听着，我很肯定你会回答“不”
Listen, I'm sure it's a "no"

726
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,030
但奥奈达服装公司要求你在会议出现
but Oneida Apparel asked that you be in the media buy meeting.

727
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,910
很抱歉我阻碍了你
I'm sorry to just barge in.

728
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,790
问她
Ask her.

729
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,710
问她能不能看到我
Go ahead. Ask her if she can see me.

730
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,320
我不会在会议出现
I'm not gonna be in the meeting.

731
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,390
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

732
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,750
他们坚持要我问你
Well, they insisted I ask.

733
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,610
他们很可能会跟我们解约，所以…
I mean, they're probably gonna fire us, so...

734
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,670
好吧
Okay.

735
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,980
- 太好了  - 我去
- Awesome.  - Yes.

736
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,190
好吧
Okay.

737
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,550
晚点见
See you later.

738
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,230
你可以拿回这个，霍华德
You can have this back, Howard.

739
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,230
你到底为何写信给我？
Why did you write me anyway?

740
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,910
是因为你需要我
You wrote me because you need me.

741
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,390
不
No. Um...

742
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,390
我不需要你，明白吗？
I don't need anything from you, okay?

743
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,630
你们都喜欢埋怨
You all like to bitch and complain.

744
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,630
不够时间
"There isn't enough time."

745
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,670
人生苦短
"Life is short."

746
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,910
看，白发都出来了
"Oh, here, the gray hairs are coming in."

747
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,910
一天其实长得很
You know, a day is long as hell.

748
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,950
我非常充沛，我是份礼物
I'm abundant. I'm a gift.

749
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,310
即使现在你站在这里抱怨
Even while you're standing here talking shit,

750
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,910
也是份礼物，而你浪费了
I'm gifting you, and you're wasting it.

751
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
用在什么上了？
On what?

752
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,950
这是什么？
I mean, what is this? Huh?

753
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,270
嘿！
Hey, hey!

754
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,630
你知道吗
You know,

755
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,260
我才应该写信埋怨
I should be the one that's writing angry letters.

756
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,910
那是我做过最差劲的一件事
That was the worst thing I've ever done.

757
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,070
那是我做过最好的一件事
That was the best thing I've ever done.

758
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,070
你刚才说什么爱因斯坦？
What was that thing you said about Einstein in there?

759
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,630
爱因斯坦说时间是固执又坚持的幻像
Einstein called time a stubbornly persistent illusion.

760
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,230
那究竟是什么？
What's that even mean?

761
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,670
时间不是从一月走到十二月
Time doesn't go from January to December,

762
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,470
或从早到晚
or from noon to midnight.

763
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,910
那只是人类的观点
You know, we all just make it that way in our heads.

764
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,790
荒谬至极
That's absurd.

765
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,750
你试着跟一个在婚礼上迟到的人说这个
Try telling that to a person who's an hour late to a wedding

766
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,700
或是跟一个刚被判二十年监牢的人说
or was just sentenced to 20 years in jail.

767
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,360
或是一个快更年期的女人
Or someone fighting a baby clock.

768
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,980
我们其实不需要交心
We really don't need to have this conversation, ever.

769
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,310
无论如何
Anyway, just...

770
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,110
你今天做得很好
Yeah, wanted to say great job today.

771
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,150
只是个固执的幻像，克莱尔
Just a stubborn illusion, Claire.

772
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,990
你还有很多时间
You have all the time in the world.

773
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,950
你是九点
You're nine!

774
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,830
你是九点
"You're nine."

775
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
你好
Hi.

776
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,430
抱歉
I'm sorry.

777
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,750
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

778
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,950
你一定在开玩笑吧
You gotta be friggin' kidding me.

779
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,470
我在用餐
I'm eating.

780
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,870
你说了再见，而那…
You said goodbye, and that...

781
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,390
我们没有选择爱谁和被谁爱的权利
We don't get to choose who we love or who loves us back.

782
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,530
那代表你只要还在世就无法对我做什么
And that means you're powerless to me as long as you're alive

783
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,310
因为我是生命的基本
because I'm the fabric of life.

784
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,070
我在你当中，我在万物当中
I'm within you. I'm within everything.

785
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,830
霍华德
Howard,

786
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,230
如果你能接受，那可能…
if you can accept that, then maybe...

787
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,100
我不知道，但你可能可以重新过活
I don't know, but maybe you get to live again.

788
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,510
我失败了
I completely screwed it up.

789
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,470
我太悲哀和充满了歉意
I was weepy and apologetic.

790
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,480
我认为爱也可以是那样
Well, I think love can be weepy and apologetic.

791
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,880
我想我最后还算可以
I think I was better at the end.

792
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,630
嘿，我肯定你尽力了
Hey, hey. I'm sure you were great.

793
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,390
你真好
You're sweet.

794
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,600
我可以吻你吗？
Can I kiss you?

795
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,390
你不需要将它性化
You don't have to sexualize it.

796
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,020
我可以不性化地吻你
I can kiss you without sexualizing it.

797
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,470
真的，我试过没有性爱的性
Seriously, I've had sex without sexualizing it.

798
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,430
你应该停在“好”的阶段，惠特
You should take "sweet", Whit.

799
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,190
算是升职了
It's a promotion.

800
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,350
无法抗拒才算是升职
"Irresistible" would be a promotion.

801
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,320
他信了
He believes it.

802
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,830
你怎知道？
How could you tell?

803
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,750
我从他的眼中看到
I could tell by his eyes.

804
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,910
很好，但除了你没人看到
That's great, but no one else has seen it

805
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,040
而那终究是我们的目的
and that's ultimately what we need to have happen.

806
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,270
我们认为你们该再接触他
We think if you would engage with him

807
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,270
- 在公众场合  - 很好了
- one more time, um, in public.  - Great.

808
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,110
但这次试着…
But this time try to...

809
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,790
但你们需要挑衅让他有很大的举动
But you need to provoke a strong visible reaction.

810
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
为什么？
Why?

811
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,110
因为我们的私家侦探会录影
Because our private investigator's gonna capture it on video.

812
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,450
并用来做证据
And we're gonna use it as evidence.

813
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,720
那就好像拍电影
It'll be like being in a movie.

814
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,200
除了会后期加工将你们除去
Except you'll be digitally removed.

815
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,920
不要
No.

816
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
什么？
Sorry?

817
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,620
太激烈了
This is too intense.

818
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,450
抱歉，我不能继续
Um, I'm sorry. I can't be a part of this.

819
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,310
艾米，演戏里没有什么叫“激烈”
Amy, there is no "too intense" in acting.

820
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,550
你想被爱还是被记住？
Do you wanna be loved or do you wanna make an impact?

821
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,150
[诺埃尔·科沃德：演员]
这不是诺埃尔·科沃德
I mean, this isn't Noel Coward.

[契诃夫：短篇小说家]
这是…契诃夫
This is... This is Chekhov.

823
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,140
这是荒谬！
This is horrible!

824
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,430
你知道的
The... You know,

825
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,790
你曾经跟他一起创办那间机构吧，惠特？
you did start the agency with him, didn't you, Whit?

826
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,390
克莱尔，他是你的导师
And, Claire, he was your mentor.

827
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,270
西蒙，他让你成为持有人
And, Simon, he gave you part ownership in a business

828
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,070
而他完全没有必要
when he absolutely didn't have to.

829
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,970
我跟她说过了点我们的事
I may have told her a few things...

830
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,200
我们…
when we were...

831
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,680
抱歉，这不能接受
I'm sorry, this is horrible.

我不能…参与其中，谢谢
I... I can't...No, I can't be a part of this. Thank you.

833

- 抱歉，谢谢了  - 艾米，别走
- Sorry. Thanks.  - Amy, no.

834
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,190
艾米
Amy.

835
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,360
艾米，别走
Amy. No.

836
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,880
她太多心了
Oh, she's so passionate, you know.

837
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
艾米！
Amy!

838
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,110
抱歉，她会回来的
I'm so sorry. She will be back.

839
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,270
但如果她不回来
But if she isn't, um,

840
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,510
我会介入，我很熟悉爱情
I'll step in. I do know all about love.

841
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,190
艾米！
Amy!

842
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,950
我错过了什么？
What'd I miss?

843
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,550
人们都在为他们死去的孩子们哭
People crying because their kids died.

844
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,030
有种病叫丧失性幻觉
Uh, there's a thing called bereavement hallucinations.

845
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,360
对
Yes.

846
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,750
对
Right. Um. Okay.

847
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,340
所以…
So, uh...

848
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,110
我查了一下
I looked them up.

849
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,780
有点东西我明白，我不睡觉的
And here's the thing. I don't sleep.

850
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
是的
Okay.

851
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,070
不太睡觉
Like, not a lot.

852
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,710
我会睡
I mean, I sleep.

853
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,710
但可能一星期只睡六，七小时
But I get six or seven hours a week.

854
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,190
现在我回想起来，那可能就是为什么…
Now that I think about it, that's probably why...

855
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,360
什么为什么？
Why what?

856
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,070
我在谈话
I'm having conversations.

857
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,150
我指，谈话
I mean, conversations.

858
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,230
对
Okay.

859
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,830
没关系了
It's okay. Never mind. Um...

860
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,270
- 霍华德？ - 是
- Howard?  - Yeah.

861
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,950
你想跟我谈话吗？
You wanna have a conversation with me?

862
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,030
是
Uh, yes.

863
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,590
所以我可以假设你是那百分之七十九之一？
So, I assume you're a part of the 79%?

864
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,950
嗯？
Mmm?

对
Yeah.

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,790
对，我也是
Yeah, me too.

868
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,950
你还爱她吗？
Do you still love her?

869
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,100
我甚至已经不知道什么是爱
I don't even know what love is anymore.

870
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,110
你还爱他吗？
Do you still love him?

871
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,030
我们从没停止爱过对方
We never fell out of love.

872
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,150
至少，我不认为，只是…
At least, I don't think so. It's just...

873
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,420
我们可以…
We can...

874
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,630
我们办妥了离婚手续的那天，他给了我这个
The day our divorce was final, he sent me this.

875
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,910
如果我们可以重新相遇一次就好了
"If only we could be strangers again."

876
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,750
现在我们是
Now we are.

这是他做过最浪漫的举动
The most romantic gesture he ever made.

878
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,230
所以，回答你刚才的问题
So, to answer your question,

879
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,900
对
yes,

880
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,510
我还爱着他
I still love him.

881
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,750
你什么意思
What did you mean

882
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,610
当你说你在谈话？
when you said you were having conversations?

883
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
对
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

884
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,750
跟谁谈话？
Conversations with who?

885
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,950
不是谁
It's not "who."

886
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,340
那真是…
It's really... It's...

887
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,510
你会以为我疯了
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

888
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,680
说一下
Try me.

889
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,990
我可以带你去看吗？
Um, can I show you?

890
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,340
不会分解的坏死组织
"Dead tissue that won't decompose."

891
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,470
他那时就坐在这里
He was sitting right here.

892
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:11,030
就是个说话刻薄又骄傲的小流氓
Just a mean, little, arrogant thug.

893
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,670
他是第一个出现的吧？
And he was the first one that appeared, right?

894
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,030
不，死亡先出现
Uh, no. Death came first.

895
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,950
她在宠物公园找到我
She met me in the dog park.

896
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,470
所以死亡是个女人？
Oh, so Death is a "her"?

897
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:27,110
对，原来死亡是个白种婆婆
Uh, yeah. It turns out Death is an elderly white woman.

898
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,390
什么交易？
What was the trade?

899
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,750
你说死亡不跟你做交易
You said Death wouldn't make the trade.

900
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,240
什么意思？
What does that mean?

901
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,190
当我们意识到…
When we realized our...

902
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,830
我的女儿在死去，我祈祷
My daughter was dying, I prayed, uh...

903
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,030
不是向上帝或者宇宙，而是向死亡
Not to God or the universe, but to Death.

904
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,910
我提出一个交易
I offered a trade.

905
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,750
带走我
Take me,

906
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,590
留下我的女儿
leave my daughter.

907
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,070
但死亡不想交易，所以…
But she didn't wanna make the trade, so...

908
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,270
所以谁赢了那回合？
So, who won that round?

909
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,350
你还是瓷器？
You or the porcelain?

910
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,430
瓷器，它从未输过
Porcelain. Porcelain's undefeated.

911
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,750
抱歉，我以为所有人都走了
I'm sorry about that, I thought everyone left.

912
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,110
对，他们走了，但我还没
Yes, they did. But I'm here to close up.

913
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,310
很好
Good.

914
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,600
你需要我帮手带你回家吗？
You need help getting home?

915
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,470
不，我没事
No. I'm fine.

916
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,590
我很好
I'm... I'm good.

917
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,380
我搜寻了你
I Googled you.

918
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,600
- 你搜寻了？ - 对
- You did?  - Yeah.

919
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,760
天啊
Oh, God.

920
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,790
从一无所有
You came from nothing.

921
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,630
捱过杜克大学
You put yourself through Duke,

922
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,150
娶了个美丽的女人
you married a wonderful woman,

923
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,590
是个很有爱心的父亲
you're a loving father.

924
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,990
你活得不错，你活过了
So, you lived well. You lived right.

925
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,460
但朋友，你现在这样是不对的
But, my friend, you're not dying right.

926
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,630
你打算告诉我如何死吗？
Are you gonna tell me how to die?

927
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,350
你跟你的家人说过了吗？
Have you told your family yet?

928
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,670
- 没  - 你这不是在帮他们
- Mmm-mmm.  - You're not helping them.

929
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,750
你只是在否定他们得知真相的权利
You're just denying them what is rightfully theirs.

930
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,230
是吗？什么真相？
Yeah? And what's that?

931
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,910
痛苦？萎缩？疾病？
Pain? Atrophy? Disease?

932
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,510
对，正是
Yes. Yes.

933
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,150
全部都是
All of it.

934
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,980
还有告别的机会
And the chance to say goodbye.

935
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,660
还是专注演出吧
Stick to acting.

936
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,750
好了
Okay.

937
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,630
我有件我从没跟别人说过的事
I have something that I haven't told anyone.

938
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,670
不关于信或天使或者什么
It doesn't involve letters or angels or anything like that,

939
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,150
但它对我意义重大
but it means something to me.

940
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,230
他们当时在准备告别奥利维亚
They were preparing Olivia to say goodbye.

941
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,230
我的丈夫在停车场尝试让我母亲冷静下来
And my husband was trying to calm my mother in the parking lot

942
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,230
因为她完全不能接受
because she lost it.

943
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,830
所以我当时独自一人
So I was alone

944
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,670
坐在
and I was sitting there

945
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,790
布碌仑玛摩利医院的等候室
in the waiting room at Maimonides Hospital.

946
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,870
那里有个女人坐在我旁边
And there was this woman who sat next to me.

947
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,790
她问我我要失去谁了
And she asked me who I was about to lose.

948
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,750
我告诉了她
And I told her.

949
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,390
然后她看着我并说
And she looked at me and she said,

950
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,910
记着留意
"Just be sure to notice

951
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,230
附属的美丽
"the collateral beauty."

952
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,030
她…
I mean, she...

953
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,070
她说得很随口
She said it so casually.

954
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,990
一墙之隔
In the next room,

955
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,230
我的六岁女儿正在被拆下维持生命的机器
my six-year-old daughter was being taken off life support.

956
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,870
而那女人说附属的美丽
And this woman says "collateral beauty."

957
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,510
人们都不知道那种时候该说什么
People don't know what to say in those moments.

958
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,430
不，她知道
No, she did.

959
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,150
只是当时我没有意会到
I just didn't get it at the time.

960
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,990
那不是因为同情我或者气氛尴尬
See, it wasn't said out of sympathy or awkwardness.

961
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,510
那是经验之谈
It was from experience.

962
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,310
约一年后
About a year later,

963
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,940
有些事开始发生在我身上了
something started to happen to me, you know.

964
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,990
我会在街上或地下铁走着
I would be walking or on the subway, whatever,

965
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,720
然后突然大哭起来
and I would just burst into tears.

966
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,590
但那不是为奥利维亚流下的泪
But these weren't Olivia tears.

967
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,710
那是因为有东西重生了而留
These were tears born from something else,

968
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,120
因为对一切深刻的连系而留
from this kind of profound connection to everything.

969
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,510
然后我意识到了
And I realized

970
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,270
那就是附属的美丽
it was the collateral beauty.

971
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,830
那真是…
I mean, there's...

972
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,150
世上没有一种叫附属的美丽
There's no such thing as collateral beauty.

973
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,950
有的，霍华德
There is, Howard.

974
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,670
真的有
There really is.

975
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,670
虽然那不会让她活过来
It'll never bring her back.

976
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:12,670
也不会让我忘掉一切
And it will never ever make it okay.

977
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,910
但我保证你，它真的存在
But I promise you, it's there.

978
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,030
好吧
Okay.

979
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,990
你需要跟他们说话，霍华德
You need to talk to them, Howard.

980
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,350
听着
Look, um...

981
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,320
很感谢你分享的故事
Appreciate your story,

982
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,350
但我没有感觉到这附属美丽
but I'm not really feeling the "collateral beauty" thing.

983
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,830
我不在乎
I don't care!

984
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,990
对他们呼喊，跟他们说道理，挑战他们
Yell at them, reason with them, challenge them.

985
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,990
就试着接触他们
Just engage!

986
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,870
我想这一切都是错误的
I think this was a mistake.

987
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,060
- 你好  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hi.

988
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,110
你在这里做什么？
What're you doing here?

989
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,150
碧姬告诉我在这里可以找到你
Uh, Brigitte told me this is where I could find you.

990
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,540
当然吧
Of course she did.

991
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,590
我们可以走走，聊聊天？
Could we just go and talk somewhere for 15 minutes by ourselves?

992
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,880
我其实在工作，我在排练
I'm... I'm actually working. I'm rehearsing right now.

993
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,630
- 你在这里也排练？ - 对
- You're rehearsing here, too?  - Yeah.

994
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,720
你同时间在做多少工作？
How many projects are you doing at the same time?

995
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,500
现时的话三件
I'm currently doing three.

996
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,720
三件，哗
Three. Wow.

997
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,040
- 对  - 一定很忙
- Yeah.  - That's really busy.

998
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,720
那我们哪有时间去吃晚餐？
How are we gonna fit a dinner date in?

999
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,760
惠特…
Whit...

1000
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,110
听着，真的
Listen, listen, listen. Seriously...

1001
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,190
我想让你重新考虑你昨晚所说的
I have to ask you to reconsider what you said last night.

1002
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,150
我们需要你再一次的帮忙
We need you one more time.

1003
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,630
就一场戏
Just give us one more scene.

1004
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,470
我不会去的
I am out.

1005
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,640
艾米，你想要…
Amy, what do you...

1006
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,280
等下，我可以说什么？你想要…
Wait, what can I say? What do you...

1007
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,150
事成我会给你十万，不是两万
I'll give you $100,000. Not 20, 100.

1008
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,910
你没有十万
You don't have $100,000.

1009
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,520
对，我跟我母亲一起住
You're right. I live with my mother.

1010
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,360
但这会成事的，而完成后，我会有很多钱
But this is gonna work, and when it does, I'll have much, much more.

1011
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,640
我会给你一百万
And I'll give you a million.

1012
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,400
- 我不想要你的钱  - 我真的会
- I don't want your money.  - I really will.

1013
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,480
我不想要你的钱
I do not want your money.

1014
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,640
你知道吗，我从不想要你的钱
Do you know, I've actually never wanted your money.

1015
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,710
我到底要说什么才能让你回来？
What can I say to get you to do this?

1016
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,790
因为有太多紧急的事要处理，你甚至不会想到
Because there's so much more at stake here, you have no idea.

1017
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,270
噢
Oh.

1018
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,590
你有个女儿吧？
You have a daughter, right?

1019
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,980
对
Yeah.

1020
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,510
我有说过吗？
Did we talk about that?

1021
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,270
告诉我她出生的那天你的感受
Tell me what it was like the day that she was born.

1022
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,550
什么？
What?

1023
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,750
对你而言那是什么感受？
What it felt like for you.

1024
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,830
很可怕
Uh, it was scary.

1025
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,230
非常可怕，我完全不知所措
It was very scary. I was terrified.

1026
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,270
但当他们让我抱着她
But then they gave her to me

1027
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,430
我感觉到了前所未有的感觉
and I had the most amazing sensation run through me.

1028
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,710
那…我不能说…
It... I can't...

1029
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,100
什么？说完它
What? Finish it.

1030
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,190
那听起来很愚蠢
It sounds... It's goofy.

1031
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,620
不，那听起来不愚蠢
No, it doesn't sound goofy.

1032
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,690
这其实是我第一次感觉到
Do you know, actually, this is the first time that I felt

1033
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,310
我对你的事有兴趣
any attraction towards you, whatsoever.

1034
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,910
- 真的吗？ - 是
- Really?  - Yes.

1035
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,830
我看着她，然后我…
I looked at her and I...

1036
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,700
我意识到我没有感受到爱意
I realized that I wasn't feeling love.

1037
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,590
我成为了爱
I had become love.

1038
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,110
虽然她现在不再跟我说话
She doesn't talk to me now, though.

1039
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,870
她把离婚责怪于我，她还在生我气
She blames me for the divorce, and so she's angry at me.

1040
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,260
而…
And...

1041
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,460
这是我值得的下场
I deserve it.

1042
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,350
我跟你做个交易
I'm gonna make you a deal.

1043
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,670
如果你能将这些
If you can take all of this,

1044
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,630
坦白又积极的决心
frankly, aggressive determination

1045
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,740
还有非凡的开放态度
and extraordinary openness

1046
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,790
用在赢回你女儿的心上
and use it on winning your daughter back,

1047
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,880
那我就帮你们
then I'll do it.

1048
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,550
约定了
It's a deal.

1049
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,950
你没感受到吗？
See, you don't feel that?

1050
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,110
放开我
Oh, wow. Give me my hand back.

1051
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,710
你感受到的吧？
You feel that though, right? You feel it?

1052
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,130
- 那就是火花  - 再见，惠特
- That's sparks.  - Goodbye, Whit.

1053
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,160
那就是火花
That's what that is.

1054
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:23,600
[律师信]
[关于宏盟集团，尽快联络]

1055
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,870
嗨，怎样了？
Hey! What's up?

1056
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,870
- 什么？ - 你有点话要说吗？
- What?  - You got something to say?

1057
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,630
你有点想要说的话吧？
You got something you wanna say?

1058
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,850
对，我有很多事想告诉你
Oh, yeah. I got a lot of things I'd like to say to you.

1059
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,990
说出来啊！
Well, say it. Say it!

1060
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,470
你就只会浪费时间
See, you just waste time.

1061
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,630
我给予了你这份礼物，而你就白白浪费它
See, I give you a gift and you just waste it!

1062
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,120
我不在乎时间
I don't care about time.

1063
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,150
这是监禁
This is a prison sentence!

1064
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,710
我不想要你的所谓礼物
I don't want your gift!

1065
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,310
因为你拿走了她的时间
Because you took hers.

1066
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,870
噢，又来了
Oh, come on.

1067
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,550
你是来带我走的吗？
Are you here to take me?

1068
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,550
不，霍华德，我来这里跟你一起坐车
No, Howard. I'm here to ride the F train with you.

1069
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,040
好吧
Oh, okay.

1070
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,510
我说，有对龙凤胎在肚里
So, there are these two twins in a womb, a boy and a girl.

1071
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,900
你在说笑话吗？
You telling a joke?

1072
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,510
不，这是个故事
No, no. It's a story.

1073
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,190
这对双胞胎非常快乐
So, these twins are happy.

1074
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,590
有食物，又温暖，他们感到很安全
They're fed, they're warm, they feel safe.

1075
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,750
但他们越来越大，不够位置
But they're outgrowing their space

1076
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,110
他们意识到这不是办法
and they realize this can't go on forever.

1077
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,870
所以他们开始想
So they start thinking,

1078
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,430
“接下来会怎样？
"What comes next?

1079
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,230
如果变得又冷又寂寞呢？
"What if it's cold or lonely?

1080
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,590
如果我们不再在一起呢？
"What if we're not together?

1081
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,910
如果这根本什么都不是呢？”
"What if there's nothing at all?"

1082
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,540
然后那女孩看着脐带
So, then the girl looks at the cord.

1083
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,060
那条一直给他们养分的脐带
This cord that has fed them, has nourished them,

1084
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,620
那条他们根本不可能猜透的脐带
this cord that they can't possibly conceive

1085
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,100
很可能连系在任何东西上
could be attached to anything else.

1086
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,750
然后她说
And she says,

1087
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,550
“我们没有证据
"Well, we have no proof.

1088
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,070
我们只有这个”
"All we have is this."

1089
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,440
不
No.

1090
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,430
那真是深奥
Wow, that's deep.

1091
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,310
所以就是生命吧
So, it's like life after birth.

1092
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,230
充满希望
Hopeful.

1093
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,310
你到底想要什么？
All right, what do you want?

1094
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,550
你为何来这里？
Why are you here?

1095
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,630
你的陈词滥调我都听腻了
I've heard all of your platitudes.

1096
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,940
我都明白了
I got them, I know.

1097
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,470
“她去了更好的地方
"She's in a better place."

1098
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,430
冥冥中自有主宰”
And, "This is all a part of a master plan."

1099
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,740
也听过了
Heard that one, too.

1100
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,100
接下来是我最喜欢的
Here's my favorite.

1101
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,750
“上帝从天上看下来，看见了一朵最美丽的玫瑰花
"God looked down and saw the most beautiful rose,

1102
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,790
太美丽了，所以他摘下来
"so beautiful that he picked it

1103
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,670
放在天堂里陪伴他”
"to have it in Heaven all for Himself."

1104
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,110
然后就是关于科学，生物中心主义
Then there's the science, biocentrism,

1105
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,630
我们在无数宇宙中诞生和死去
and we're all living and dying in infinite universes

1106
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,470
同时间
all at the same time.

1107
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,750
还有宗教
And then the religion,

1108
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,670
基督教和救赎
the Christians and their salvation,

1109
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,310
佛教及其轮回之说，还有印度教及其圣礼
and the Buddhists and their Samsara, and the Hindus and their 41 st sacrament.

1110
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,950
特别忘不了那些诗句
And can't forget the poetry.

1111
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,510
噢，那些诗句
Oh, the poetry.

1112
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,670
“死并不像一般人所想像的
"To die is different from what anyone supposed

1113
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,030
而是更幸运”
"and luckier."

1114
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,310
[Walt Whitman - Song of Myself]
惠特曼
Whitman.

1115
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,630
“怒斥吧
And, "Rage...

1116
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,590
怒斥光的消逝
"Rage against the dying of the light.

1117
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,270
年迈的智者深知黑暗必将来临”
"Though wise men at their end know dark is right."

1118
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,310
[Dylan Thomas - Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night]
托马斯，然后…
Thomas. And then...

1119
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,020
“划呀划，划小船，缓缓顺流下
"Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream

1120
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,990
开心呀，开心呀，开心呀，开心吧
"Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1121
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,670
人生不过一场梦”
"Life is but a dream"

1122
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,980
我知道了
I got it.

1123
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,470
我全都明白了！
I got it!

1124
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,510
全都在说你是生命的必经的阶段
It all basically says that you're a natural part of life,

1125
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,550
我们不该恨你和害怕你
we shouldn't hate you, we shouldn't fear you.

1126
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,470
我猜我们该坦然接受你对吧？
I guess we should just accept you, right?

1127
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,030
就这样？
That's it?

1128
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,630
我明白了，不过我想说
I get it. Here's the thing.

1129
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,310
这全都是读书人的一派胡言而已
It's all a bunch of intellectual bullshit

1130
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,190
因为她此时此地不在
because she's not here holding my fucking hand.

1131
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,390
你好，霍华德
Hi, Howard.

1132
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,910
你又要哭了吗？
You gonna cry again?

1133
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,680
你不喜欢我伤心时的模样？
You don't like it when I'm sad?

1134
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,030
- 你不是整天都伤心的吗？ - 当然不是
- Ah, aren't you always sad?  - No.

1135
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,950
我可以有其他心情，我可以是快乐
No, I can be other things. I can be happy.

1136
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,230
我可以是意想不到和不可预测的
I can be unexpected and unpredictable...

1137
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,750
还有性感，温馨，神秘…
...and sexy and warm and mysterious and...

1138
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,750
和窝心
And home.

1139
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,150
我可以很窝心，霍华德，你记得吗？
I can be home, Howard, you remember?

1140
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,900
你记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

1141
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,920
听着，那些什么“生命的基本”，留给跟别人说吧
Listen. All the "fabric of life" bullshit, save that for somebody else.

1142
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,070
那不是胡说的
It's not bullshit.

1143
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,880
我知道你不相信我，但你要给我另一次机会
I know you don't believe me, but you have to trust me.

1144
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,270
相信你？
Trust you?

1145
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,110
- 相信你？ - 对！
- Trust you?  - Yes!

1146
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,070
我相信过你啊！
I did trust you!

1147
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,550
然而你背叛了我！
And you betrayed me!

1148
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,590
我曾经每天都在她的双眸中看到你
I saw you every day in her eyes,

1149
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,910
还有在她的笑声中
and I heard you in her voice when she laughed,

1150
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,430
还有当她叫我“爸爸”时，我感觉到你在我里面
and I felt you inside of me when she called me "Daddy."

1151
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,230
然后你背叛了我！
And you betrayed me!

1152
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,390
你伤透了我的心
You broke my heart.

1153
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,750
不
No.

1154
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,950
我在万物当中
I'm in all of it.

1155
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,360
我是黑暗同时也是曙光
I'm the darkness and the light,

1156
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,950
我是太阳般温暖同时也是风暴般难以预测
I'm the sunshine and the storm.

1157
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,120
你说对了
Yes, you're right.

1158
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,950
我存在在她的笑声中
I was there in her laugh,

1159
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,070
但我现在也在你的伤痛之中
but I'm also here now in your pain.

1160
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,190
我是万物的起因
I'm the reason for everything.

1161
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,590
我是唯一的“原因”
I am the only "why."

1162
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,630
别以为没了我可以生活，霍华德
Don't try and live without me, Howard.

1163
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,230
拜托不要
Please don't.

1164
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,990
与宏盟集团的协议快要达成了
The deal with Omnicom's almost done.

1165
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,990
那霍华德那边呢？
What about Howard?

1166
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,530
他们也注意到现在的情况
Well, they're aware of the situation

1167
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,510
但我们仍然要证明霍华德
but we still have to prove that Howard's ability to vote

1168
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,200
没有投票的能力
is, uh, compromised.

1169
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,550
我难以相信变成了这个局面
I can't believe it's come down to this.

1170
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,150
对，但还是得相信
Yeah, well, believe it.

1171
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,430
我们星期四有个跟委员会讨论霍华德能力的会议
We have a competency meeting with the board set for Thursday.

1172
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,990
我们来这里是给你一个解释的机会
We're here to give you a chance to explain this.

1173
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,230
霍华德，影片中你在做什么？
Howard, what are you doing in this video?

1174
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,590
我不在乎时间
I do not care about time.

1175
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,710
这是监禁
This is a prison sentence!

1176
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,270
我不想要你的所谓礼物！
I don't want your gift!

1177
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,000
你在做什么，霍华德？
What are you doing, Howard?

1178
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,550
因为你拿走了她的时间
Because you took hers.

1179
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,790
霍华德？
Howard?

1180
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,630
你又要哭吗？
You gonna cry again?

1181
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,550
你不是整天都伤心的吗？
Aren't you always sad?

1182
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,780
这段呢？
What about here?

1183
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,920
听着，那些什么“生命的基本”
Listen. All the "fabric of life" bullshit,

1184
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,510
留给跟别人说吧
save that for somebody else.

1185
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,590
相信你？
Trust you?

1186
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,870
相信你？
Trust you?

1187
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,150
我相信过你啊！
I did trust you!

1188
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,390
我把一切托付给你
I committed everything to you

1189
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,470
而你背叛了我！
and you betrayed me!

1190
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,590
我曾经每天都在她的双眸中看到你
I saw you every day in her eyes,

1191
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,550
还有在她的笑声中
and I heard you in her voice when she laughed.

1192
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,570
我感觉到你在我里面
And I felt you inside of me...

1193
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,600
霍华德？
Howard?

1194
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,230
当她叫我爸爸时
...when she called me "Daddy."

1195
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,400
霍华德？
Howard?

1196
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,780
你伤透了我的心
You broke my heart.

1197
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,070
霍华德，我需要你的答覆，你在跟谁说话？
Howard, I need you to answer me. Who are you shouting at here?

1198
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,530
你的陈词滥调我都听过了，我全都明白了
I've heard all of your platitudes. I got them, I know.

1199
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,120
不是“谁”
Um, it's not "who."

1200
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,850
冥冥中自有主宰
And, "This is all a part of a master plan."

1201
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,990
抱歉，什么？
I'm sorry, what?

1202
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,240
我明白了
I got it.

1203
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,740
霍华德，你说了什么？
Howard, did you say something?

1204
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,300
我不是在跟人说话
I'm not talking to people.

1205
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,100
很明显，那你在跟谁说话？
Well, that's obvious. Who are you talking to?

1206
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,680
霍华德，你在跟谁说话？
Howard, who are you talking to?

1207
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,030
够了
That's enough. It's enough.

1208
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,870
谢谢
Thank you.

1209
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,950
我想，你指出了重点
You made the point, I think.

1210
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,870
把它关闭吧
Just turn it off.

1211
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,110
你聘请人去跟踪我？
You hired people to follow me?

1212
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,510
去录影？
Make video?

1213
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,830
不，那不是我们最初的打算
No, that wasn't the initial intention.

1214
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,630
对，我们这样做了
No, we did.

1215
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,360
对
Yeah, we did.

1216
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,600
我们除了那还做了很多，霍华德
We did a lot more than that, Howard.

1217
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,190
霍华德，很抱歉
Howard, I'm so sorry.

1218
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,670
我们觉得…
We felt like...

1219
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,150
我们不知道还可以做什么
We didn't know what else to do.

1220
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,700
- 克莱尔  - 不，我不能再这样做了
- Claire.  - No. I can't do this anymore.

1221
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,310
我不能，惠特
I can't do this anymore, Whit.

1222
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,190
听着，我真的…
Listen, I really...

1223
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,190
我甚至没想过那会行得通
I didn't even think that it was gonna work.

1224

我很显现地不在状态
I'm obviously not in the right state of mind.

可能我们所有人都不在状态

你以为我没留意吗？

我怀疑我在将一个无可挽救的局面
And I suspect I'm making an already impossible situation

你同意售卖股份
Your approval of the sale.

1262
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,630
另一份呢？
Uh, the other one?

1263
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,190
你给了六通电话都要让我签署的那份呢？
The one you called me six times to have me sign.

第二份文件是什么？
What was that second piece of paper?

1270
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,030
霍华德把他的部份所有权放到他女儿名下的信托基金
Howard put some of his ownership into a trust in his daughter's name.

1271
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,390
那只是份法律证书表明她已经不在了
It's just a legal certificate saying she's no longer with us.

01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,670
所以我不会那么快就考虑跟时间投降
So, I wouldn't consider the battle with time over just yet.

我以为时间不是直线的
I thought time wasn't linear.

1322

我以为它是幻像
I thought it was an illusion.

1323
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,710
或者一切都只是废话而已，克莱尔
Maybe that was just bullshit, Claire.

1324
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,830
或者那只是演戏

Well, what if I get a restraining order?

我等了别人给我的肯定很久了
I've been waiting a long time for my moment for validation,

1361
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,540
这就是我要的
and this was it.

1362
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,260
一位在角落不起眼，也不拍掌的观众
An audience of one, in secret, with no applause.

1363
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,760
我跟我的妻子说了
I told my wife.

1364
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,710
那她怎样反应？
Oh, how did it go?

1365
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,310
她早就知道了
She knew.

1366
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,350
她在做准备了
She's getting ready for it.

1367
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,710

You know, when I was younger, I used to think,

1368
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,550
你真的想活到一百岁吗？
you really wanna live to be 100 years old?

1369
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,070
像干瘪了的葡萄干一样
You know, like a shriveled up raisin.

1370
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,550
而我现在会给的答覆是
And the answer to that now

1371
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,790
对
is yes.

1372
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,350
因为我的儿子将会是七十岁
Because my son would be 70,

1373
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,590
他的儿子会是四十岁

1374
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,550
他的儿子会是十岁
and his son would be 10.

1375
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,390
而我就能成为那个人
And I would be the man, you know.

1376
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,310

Pops.

1377
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,750

我真想去看你的话剧
I wish I could be here to see the play.

1380
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,950
不，那话剧经过是次早就没了
Oh, no, no. The play is dead after all this.

1381
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,750
但谁知道呢
But you never know,

1382
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,030
没什么是死的，如果以正确的角度去看的话
nothing's ever really dead if you look at it right.

1383
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,700

而你只独身一人
And you're alone.

1387
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,520
我自愿的
By choice.

1388
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,990
我可以破坏你独处的时间吗？
Can I ruin that?

1389
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:48,700
[最好的妈妈]

1390
