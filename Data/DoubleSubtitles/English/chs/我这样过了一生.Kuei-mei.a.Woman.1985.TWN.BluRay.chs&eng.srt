You must drink a least 3 glasses.

146
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,376
叫妈妈
Say mommy.

147
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,376
大声一点
Louden

148
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,584
妈妈
Mommy.

149
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:46,542
正兴,走
Cheng-hsing, let's go.

150
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:49,417
快吃饭了,你们去哪里啊
It's time for lunch, where are you giong?

151
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,292
去柴妈妈家
To Momma Chai's home.

152
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:55,084
这个时候去人家家干什么
Don't go at this time.

153
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,751
不要出去了,来！正兴
Stay home...Cheng-hsing!

154
00:14:58,667 --> 00:14:59,792
你凭什么管我们
Why should we listen to you?

155
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:01,417
你又不是我妈妈
You are not my mother!

156
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:07,084
正全
Cheng-chuan!

157
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,334
你是侯大嫂吧！
Are you Mrs. Hou?

158
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:57,251
老侯结婚的时候我见过你一次
I saw you at the wedding.

159
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,751
他在里面
He's inside.

160
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:01,876
谢谢
Thank you.

161
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:09,167
最里边那一间
He's in the last room.

162
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,917
没事,没事,我老婆
It's ok...it's my wife.

163
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:28,834
没事,没事
It's 0k...

164
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,667
你怎么来了
Why are you here?

165
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:33,667
下雨,给你送伞来
I brought you an umbrella, it's raining.

166
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:39,334
老侯,正好给嫂子带回去
Hou, have your wife take this home.

167
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:40,626
干干净净的
It's clean.

168
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,751
刚上桌还没动几下,就端下来了
They hardly touched it.

169
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:47,459
谢啦！
Thanks!

170
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:51,376
鲍鱼,回去正好宵夜
Abalone, great for a midnight snack.

171
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:58,584
来,拿着
Here, take it.

172
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,626
谢谢
Thank you.

173
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:53,792
回来了
You are back.

174
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,042
给你的
This is for you.

175
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:05,751
什么啊?
What is it?

176
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:07,417
打开来看看
Open and see it.

177
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,542
蜜枣啊！
Honeyed jujubes.

178
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,584
来台湾还没见过呢！
I never saw any in Taiwan!

179
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,834
台湾根本没有嘛！
You can't find jujubes in Taiwan.

180
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,292
老赵小舅子跑船
Chads brother-in-law is a sailor.

181
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:32,376
从香港带回来的
He imported the jujubes from Hong Kong

182
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,084
很贵吧?
It must be very expensive.

183
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,917
刚好赢两把
I won a little money.

184
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:43,167
你上班赌钱,不太好吧
I don't think is right to gamble at work.

185
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:46,751
反正没有人看到嘛！吃啊
Nobody is watching! Try it!

186
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,334
留着明天大家一块吃吧,
Let's eat it together tomorrow.

187
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,834
带回来的菜呢?拿出来下酒吧
I want to eat the dish you took back.

188
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,084
来
Here.

189
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,917
带回来的菜呢
Where's the dish?

190
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,459
菜,我扔了
I threw it.

191
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:51,709
扔了,好好的,干干净净的怎么扔了呢
You threw it? Why?

192
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:08,209
你高尚,嫌脏,不吃剩菜
You think it's dirty?

193
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,626
有志气,有志气就不要嫁给端盘子的
You should not married a waiter.

194
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:13,167
我们是看人脸色,吃人剩菜惯了
Waiters are always at diposal
and are used to eat leftover.

195
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:22,792
你他妈的高尚
Fuck your diginity.

196
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:22,084
睡着啦
Are you asleep?

197
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:27,126
睡着了
Yes.

198
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,792
我真的没有那个意思
I don't mean it.

199
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,209
我怎么会嫌你呢
How could I look down on you?

200
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:11,459
跟了你,这一辈子就跟了你了
I married you, and I will be with you forever.

201
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:24,251
我只是觉得我们还能吃自己的
I just think we should eat our own food.

202
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:26,959
就不要别人剩的
We don't need leftovers from others.

203
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,126
你在饭店给人家做事
You work in a restaurant as a waiter now.

204
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:04,084
我都相信只要我们有志气
But I believe if we have the will.

205
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,792
总有一天我们会有自己的店
We can have our own restaurant some day.

206
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,626
就算再小的店,也都是自己的
A small restaurant will be good, too.

207
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:36,876
你先听我说完,你先听我说
Listen to me...listen to me.

208
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,334
你说,你说
Tell me...tell me...

209
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:44,126
还有你赌钱不好,到处欠钱
You gamble too much,
and you owed too much money.

210
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:48,001
答应我,以后不再赌
Promise me you won't gamble again.

211
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:50,417
不赌,不赌,以后不赌了
I won't, I won't gamble again.

212
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:53,292
再赌我是狗
lam adog ifldo.

213
00:24:58,542 --> 00:24:59,917
关灯
Turn off the light.

214
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:29,959
爸爸
Daddy.

215
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:31,917
怎么那么早回来
Why are you back so early?

216
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:37,376
要过年了,我们也该腌几斤腊肉
We should made some cured meat
for Chinese New Year.

217
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:40,834
过年,还过个屁年啊
New Year? Who cares about New Year?

218
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:42,209
老子不干了
I quit.

219
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:46,084
妈的,受够了那王八蛋洋鬼子的气
I have had enough
from the damned foreigner.

220
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:48,001
不干了
I quit!

221
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:55,251
跟老侯说过,他这样子是不行的了
I told Hou he is heading to trouble.

222
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:56,626
不听
He didn't listen

223
00:25:56,709 --> 00:26:01,751
下午几个人又躲在小房间里面打嗦哈
They hid away and played cards again

224
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:03,458
当场给撞见
and were caught at the scene.

225
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:07,917
说开除就开除了,没有第二句话
They were fired right away.

226
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,417
那就不能找人去说一说吗?
Could somebody help?

227
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:15,667
说什么?洋鬼子是不讲人情的
How? Foreigners are strict.

228
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,042
再见
Goodbye.

229
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:38,376
桂美啊
Kuei-mei.

230
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:48,542
桂美啊,过年快到了,来,留着用嘛
Keep it for Chinese New Year.

231
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:52,251
不用了,不用
No. Thanks.

232
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:40,751
这是我从家里带出来最后一些东西
This is the last think I took from home.

233
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,959
本来是留着生孩子用的
I planed to keep it for our baby.

234
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:54,917
先拿着把赌债还了
Sell it to pay your debts.

235
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:03,126
生孩子,到时再想办法吧
We'll find other way out
when the baby is borned.

236
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:16,667
我求求你,不要再赌了
Please, don't gamble anymore.

237
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:23,126
你要再赌,这个家就给你毁了
Or you will destroy our family.

238
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,334
你们不要
Don't...

239
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:29,209
我哪一次心里想的不是要多赢一点
I want to win.

240
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,751
好多给你们置点好东西啊
I want to buy something good for you.

241
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:35,292
看到你开心,看到孩子高兴
You don't know how happy I will be,

242
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:37,709
你不知道我心里有多舒服
just 0t see you smile.

243
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:44,459
可是我,我没办法,我没想到我这每一次
But I can't. Every time...

244
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:49,084
你以为今天这个家落到这个地步
You think I don't care about our family,

245
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,001
我就不关心嘛
don't you?

246
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:01,667
我知道
I know.

247
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,459
我知道
I know.

248
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,501
让我看一看
Let me see.

249
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:46,501
这么大,怎么进去的
So big. How did baby get in?

250
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:50,042
问你啊
You tell me!

251
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,001
利息三分先扣
I need to take 3% of interests first.

252
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:25,584
我知道,要不是为了生孩子
I know, if it weren't for the baby...

253
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:28,459
说实在的,真背不起
Honestly, I really can't bear it.

254
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,292
来,在这边,你拿不到
I got it. You can't take it from me.

255
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:54,584
吃饭了
Time to eat.

256
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,542
什么东西啊
What's that?

257
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:06,709
拿来给我,给我
Give it to me, give it to me.

258
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:09,876
给我
NOW!

259
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:21,417
小时候就爱玩这种东西,长大就会赌钱
Do you want to be a gambler in future?

260
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:24,834
不学好,不学好,不学好
Shame on you...

261
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:35,709
爸爸呢
Where's daddy?

262
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,376
去陈家了
He went to the Chen's.

263
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:53,542
正全,有没有看到我皮包里的钱
Cheng-chuan.
Did you see the money in my purse?

264
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:54,876
没有啊
No.

265
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:17,126
谁啊
Who is it?

266
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,167
开门
Open the door.

267
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:20,917
谁嘛
Who is it?

268
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:24,459
我,开门,开门
It's me. Open the door!

269
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:25,709
谁
Who is it?

270
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:39,501
把钱还我
Give me my money.

271
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:41,126
你怎么来了
Why are you here?

272
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:42,501
把钱还我
Give me my money.

273
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:45,292
什么钱嘛
What money?

274
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,084
我生孩子的钱
Money for my baby.

275
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,917
跟小皮包里的钱
The money I put in my purse.

276
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:51,417
谁拿你什么钱了,你这
What are you talking about?

277
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:55,126
我跟,加二十,看牌
I See you. Raise 20. Show cards.

278
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:57,959
把钱还我
Give my money back to me!

279
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:00,251
老侯,算了,算了,回去吧
Hou, you'd better go home.

280
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:01,709
算了什么,你们这
Come on.

281
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:05,042
我正一手同花大顺,看牌了
Now I've got a flush!

282
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:11,001
还我！
你疯了
Give me my money.
- You are crazy!

283
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:12,334
不然我杀了你
Or I Will kill you!

284
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:15,876
还我
Give my money back to me!

285
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:17,876
他妈的
Shit.

286
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,834
羊水破了,快生了,快！快！快！
Her water breaks.
She's having a baby! Hury!

287
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:28,792
慢点！慢点！不动,不动,
Hold on...careful...

288
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,584
不要怕,不要怕
Don't worry...

289
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,251
英国女王要生孩子了
The Queen of Enlgand is having a baby.

290
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:38,167
皇后奶奶要生孩子了
The Queen is having a baby.

291
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:42,376
痛完就好了
It'll be OK after the pain.

292
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,001
快点啦
Hurry.

293
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:08,959
这双胞胎一男一女,还真好玩耶
A boy and a girl, how nice!

294
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:13,459
该要吃了吧
They should eat

295
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:18,126
一次生两个,什么都得准备双份够瞧的
We have to prepare everything in double

296
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,251
表姐夫呢
Where's your husband?

297
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,376
在外面呢
Outside.

298
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,334
他呀,毛病多
He's got a lot of problems.

299
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,126
说什么女人生孩子,他不方便进来
He said he better stay outside

300
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:32,917
我去陪陪他
I'll keep him company.

301
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:43,834
不赌了吧
Does he still gamble?

302
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,167
再赌,一家人都不要活了
If he does, our family will be done.

303
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,292
还没找到事
Did he find a job?

304
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:56,001
说外头不景气,事情难找
He said the economy is bad,
and it is hard to find one.

305
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,917
有时想想,真恨
Sometimes I hate it.

306
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,501
恨不得不要跟他过了
I wish I could leave him.

307
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:16,584
女人啊,就是划不来
It's our fate.

308
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:19,501
跟了什么样的男人都得认了
We have to stay with whoever we marry.

309
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:22,667
早知道,你还不如不嫁呢
It would be better not to get married!

310
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:26,167
以前对面,那个老处女吴阿姐啊
Our neighbor MissWu, the old pinster

311
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,292
她现在在公馆里做阿妈
ls working as a servent

312
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:30,209
有吃有住,还有钱赚
She gets food to eat,
room to stay and money to earn.

313
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:32,376
一个人过得舒服得很呢
She's happy-

314
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:39,042
她不用像我们,整天受他们男人的气
She doesn't have to take care
of a man like we do

315
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:02,501
爸
Dad

316
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:04,667
爸爸
Daddy.

317
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:16,667
正芳啊
Cheng-fang.

318
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:20,251
正芳一向最懂事了
You are my smartest child

319
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:24,709
爸爸这一年多年来,情况实在是不大好
Daddy hasn't done well this year

320
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:29,917
今天下午听赵伯伯提起啊
This afternoon, Uncle Chao said...

321
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:33,834
他说,可以把你介绍到一家牙科医院去
He could introduce you
to work in a dental clinic.

322
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:38,792
管吃管住,还有薪水
You can eat and live there, and get paid...

323
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:40,626
你疯了
Are you crazy?

324
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:42,126
她书念得好好的
She should study in school.

325
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:43,376
你让她去做下女
And you want her to be a maid?

326
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,251
说这个干什么
$0?

327
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,042
你当我愿意啊
You think I like the idea?

328
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:49,501
我每天出去给人家磕头作揖,低声下气的
I tried hard to find a job

329
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,542
你当我存心找不到事啊
You think I plan to be jobless?

330
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:55,209
你要再继续赌,找到再好的事情也没用
A job won't help if you keep gambling.

331
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:56,709
你又说这个
There you start again.

332
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,751
你最近什么时候看我去赌过了呢
Did you see me gamble recently?

333
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:01,417
怎么没有,昨天才去打牌
Din't you? You played cards yesterday.

334
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:03,334
好！你们都怪我
Ok. It's my fault.

335
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:04,917
都怪我好了
Just put the blame on me.

336
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:06,417
你要她去念书,是不是
You want her to stay in school?

337
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:07,959
那你赚钱给她念
Then you Pay-

338
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,167
有人在家吗?
Anybody home?

339
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:25,376
你爸爸在不在啊
Is your faterh home?

340
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:26,834
不在,爸爸没回来
No. He is not home.

341
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:30,209
不在,我来过八趟了,全不在啊
He's not? I've been here 8 times.
He's never at home.

342
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:35,126
也真巧啊,你爸爸也真能出门啊
What a coincident!
Your father always stays out.

343
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,417
操,也不过是几百块钱米钱嘛
Damn! It's only a
few hundred dollars rice bill.

344
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:41,001
不要叫大家街坊邻居不好看嘛
Don't disgrace yourself in the neighborhood.

345
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:42,876
我们也是做小本生意的
We are doing a small business.

346
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:44,792
这不赚钱没关系
I don't mind not making money.

347
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:46,917
总不能连本钱都赔进去了吧
But I can't lose my capital.

348
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,792
一回不在,二回不在
He is never at home

349
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:51,376
我送来的米
也不知道给哪个王八蛋给吃了
Then which bastard eat the rice?

350
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,209
操你妈的
Fuck you.

351
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:50,292
不要你管,做下女最好
Leave me alone. It's better to be a maid.

352
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,251
每次不绐人家钱缴补习费
He never pay for my cramm school.

353
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:53,876
不去上学最好
I don't want to go to school.

354
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,376
我看啊,大概就是这一家了
It must be this one.

355
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:45,792
公馆最近是需要用人啦
The family is hiring servants recently

356
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,334
先生要去日本
The husband is heading to Japan.

357
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:50,751
那太太说呢,要找一对夫妻跟着去帮忙
The wife wants a couple to help.

358
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:54,334
有家有眷的也比较牢靠些
People with family are more reliable.

359
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,417
是要去日本啊
Giong to Japan?

360
00:40:57,501 --> 00:41:00,376
是啊,看桂美愿不愿意了
Yes. It depends on Kuei-mei's decision.

361
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,917
多考虑考虑哦
Think about it.

362
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:08,417
去日本可不是到高雄,想回来就回来
Japan is far away.
You can't travel back and forth easily.

363
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:10,209
是要去日本耶
We are talking about Japan.

364
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:12,501
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

365
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:14,917
我不知道
I don't know

366
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:19,292
而且,还可以带两个孩子哦
Besides, you can take two children, too.

367
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:22,209
可是,吴阿姐我有五个孩子
But I have 5 kids.

368
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:24,334
人家还管你一家呢
They don't care about your whole family.

369
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:27,876
是啊！准带两个孩子已经很不错了
Right. Allowing you to bring
2 children is generous enough.

370
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:31,667
通常给人做事,哪有准带孩子的
Usually maids can't bring kids to work.

371
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:33,751
这是特别给你们方便
This is a special deal for you.

372
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:41,042
不错嘛！赚美金耶
It's great! You will earn US dollars!

373
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,626
而且到了日本啊
When you arrive Japan,

374
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,542
侯永年就没有地方去赌了
your husband will have no place to gamble.

375
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:48,126
日本
Japan?

376
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:50,459
我三叔就是让日本人
My uncle was killed by Japanese

377
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,126
进南京城的时候给杀掉的
when he was in Nanjing City.

378
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,751
到最后,连尸首都找不到
We coudn't even find his body.

379
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:56,209
你要我到日本去,想都别想
You want me to move to Japan? No way.

380
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:02,167
我也不想去啊
I don't want to go, too.

381
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:08,209
可是,我还想让这个家以后有好日子过
But I want our family to have a better life.

382
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:13,751
再说我们去日本,帮的也是中国人
And we'll be working for
Chinese not Japanese.

383
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:18,876
你不想去,也可以
If you don't want to go, it's fine.

384
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:21,084
那你就告诉我
But tell me.

385
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:24,876
你什么时候能找到事情
When will you find a job?

386
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:28,209
你什么时候让正芳继续念书
When will you put Cheng-fang
back to school?

387
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,501
什么时候能把赌债全部还清
When will you pay off your gambling debts?

388
00:42:31,876 --> 00:42:37,042
不然我们这个家就没有了
Our family is breaking apart.

389
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,084
你看人家都有钱成这个样子
Some people get all the money.

390
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:49,626
我们就是穷命啊
We were born to be poor.

391
00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:18,751
走吧
Let's go.

392
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:37,876
太太
Madam.

393
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:44,209
这就是桂美跟老侯
This is Kuei-mei and Hou.

394
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:46,251
好
Good.

395
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:48,917
都说清楚了
Did you explain the rules to them?

396
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,292
说清楚了
Yes.

397
00:43:50,376 --> 00:43:51,834
说清楚就好
Fine.

398
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:53,167
我走了
是
I am leaving
- Yes, mam.

399
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:54,334
留他们,吃饭
Keep them for dinner.

400
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:00,876
好了,就这样
OK. That's it.

401
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:02,251
她要留你们吃饭
She wants you to stay for dinner.

402
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:05,042
昨天晚上请客,还剩了一大堆菜呢
There's leftover from party last night.

403
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:18,167
你来说啊
You tell them.

404
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:24,959
我,我,我不会说啦
I...I can't.

405
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:33,167
你说嘛
You tell them.

406
00:44:50,584 --> 00:44:54,251
我跟爸爸舍不得你们任何一个
We don't want to leave any of you.

407
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,542
可是人家不能负担我们一家七口
But we cannot all move to Japan.

408
00:45:01,709 --> 00:45:05,959
所以,我跟爸爸想了很久
Your dad and I have thought it over.

409
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:08,251
我们决定
We decided...

410
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:16,209
正全没考上初中,带他到日本念书
Cheng-chuan didn't pass the test.
He can study in Japan.

411
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:27,292
双胞胎,正敏好生病,需要照顾
Cheng-min are sickly and need care.

412
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:41,292
正芳,你留在台北就是大姐了
Cheng-fang, you are the eldest kid here

413
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:46,417
要好好照顾两个弟弟
Take good care of your two brothers.

414
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:54,209
在表姨家要听表姨的话
Listen to Auntie

415
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,292
七筒啊
7 dots.

416
00:48:18,292 --> 00:48:22,126
桂美,先生下午打雷话回来没有?
Kuei-mei,
did my husband call this afternoon?

417
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:23,126
没有
No.

418
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:25,751
七条
7 bamboos.

419
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:32,501
我说芸芝,你们老夫老妻的还像蜜糖似的
Yun-zi, although you married for year,
you are like newly wed.

420
00:48:32,584 --> 00:48:34,584
一下午问三趟电话
You checked if he call three
times this afternoon.

421
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:38,042
我是问准他到底回不回来吃晚饭
Just wonder if he will come back for dinner.

422
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,876
这男人哪,还是看紧点好
You've got to keep an eye on men.

423
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:43,917
还是我们魏太太有办法
Mrs. Wei's is good at this.

424
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:47,417
把个魏先生管得是服服贴贴的哦
She keeps a tight rein on Mr. Wei.

425
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:48,209
没的事
Not at all.

426
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:53,959
你们魏先生忙,听说日本人指定要他
I heard the Japanese keep Mr. Wei busy.

427
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,334
要不是为了公司的事
Were it not for business.

428
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:00,917
谁会到这种半生不熟的地方来
Who'd like to move here?

429
00:49:02,334 --> 00:49:05,584
要点长久打算,还是美国好
For the long term, US is better.

430
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:58,001
那么个女的摆在办公室
With that woman in your office...

431
00:49:58,626 --> 00:50:02,334
你不怕别人说闲话,我还怕呢
People QOSSiP-

432
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:03,876
你最好
You should...

433
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:10,751
谁要你端进来的
Who told you to come in?

434
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:19,167
出去
Get out!

435
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:22,667
是
Yes.

436
00:50:51,959 --> 00:50:53,876
又吵架了,是不是
They're fighting again

437
00:50:58,001 --> 00:51:00,917
从来没看过这样做夫妻的
I never saw any couple like them

438
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:02,959
人前亲亲热热
Pretending happy in front of people

439
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:05,459
背后三天两头吵架
but fighting in the back.

440
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:11,001
所以说啊,门当户对还是有道理的耶
So a proper match is important.

441
00:51:11,626 --> 00:51:14,626
像这个男的,一路上来全靠这女的家里
The husband depends own the wife's family

442
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:16,834
他怎么会有好日子过呢
How can it be easy for him?

443
00:51:18,251 --> 00:51:20,084
老丈人听说是当官的
I heard his fater in-law is a high official.

444
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:24,209
当初,他就是看上这个女婿学问好
His father in-law likes him because
he is well educated

445
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:29,459
你没听说吧,男的最近想离婚耶
Have you heard? The man wants to divorce.

446
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:33,167
他大概受不了了,只是女的不肯
He can't take it anymore
but the wife doesn't agree.

447
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:39,459
其实夫妻做成这样,还有什么意思
Marriage is meangless to them.

448
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:43,126
那干脆一了百了,离婚算了嘛
They should divorce.

449
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:46,001
女的要面子死也不会肯的
The woman won't agree because
she doesn't want to lose face.

450
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:49,459
怎么,台北来的信啊
What is it? Letter from Taipei?

451
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,084
信上怎么说
What does it say?

452
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,417
说,都很好
It says everything is fine.

453
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:56,001
好什么呀
Fine?

454
00:51:56,792 --> 00:51:59,959
一对双胞胎,跟着我们这个是白白胖胖
The twin who live with us is fat and healthy.

455
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:02,334
台北那个,瘦得跟干一样
The other in Taipei is thin and weak.

456
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,959
你表姐光顾着打牌嘛
You cousin is not taking good care of them.

457
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:09,917
说起那个女的
Speaking of the girl

458
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,876
到底有没有找他,你是他司机
Does the husband really has a mistress?

459
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:12,917
你说
You tell me...

460
00:52:13,626 --> 00:52:15,667
不错,我是他司机啊
I'm his driver.

461
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:18,126
总不能他到哪我跟到哪吧
But I don't always stick with him

462
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:20,251
我想,这么大年纪
He's quite old

463
00:52:20,334 --> 00:52:21,917
外面还会有女人
Having a mistress at this age

464
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:24,334
过干瘾,老来俏嘛
Must be a lot of fun

465
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:38,751
妈妈,哥哥打架架
Mommy, Brother fights.

466
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:45,042
乖,你先进去
Good girl, go in first.

467
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:22,792
哥哥打架架,哥哥坏坏
Brother fights, brother is bad.

468
00:53:23,876 --> 00:53:25,584
怎么那么早回来
Why are you back so early?

469
00:53:30,084 --> 00:53:31,126
你又打架了
You fight again?

470
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,501
学校里的日本人骂我清国奴
Japanese says I am Chinese slave.

471
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:37,584
什么
What?

472
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:39,751
骂我清国奴
They say I am a Chinese slave.

473
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:42,126
你不是说,如果他们再骂我清国奴的话
Din't you told me if they said that again,

474
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:43,667
我就可以揍他们吗
I can beat them?

475
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:50,126
那也不能不上课啊
But you can't leave school.

476
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:53,209
我不要念书了
I don't want to go to school.

477
00:53:53,376 --> 00:53:56,001
念来念去都不会,没意思
I don't want to study any more. It's boring.

478
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:58,667
大师傅不是要介绍我去横滨学厨子吗
Didn't the Chef introduce me
to learn cooking?

479
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:00,709
我还不如去学厨子算了
I should better be a cook.

480
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:03,084
我不要念书了
I don't want to go to school.

481
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:17,001
去洗一洗脸吧
Go clean up.

482
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:19,876
待会我给你上药
I'll fix your wounds.

483
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:36,376
请
Please.

484
00:54:40,126 --> 00:54:41,376
再见
Goodbye.

485
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:45,042
留级也没有关系
To repeat a year in school is fine.

486
00:54:45,126 --> 00:54:47,584
要多听爸爸,妈妈的话
You should listen to your parents.

487
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:52,334
学学别的也好,要多多努力
You can learn something else,
but always work hard.

488
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:55,459
那么就再见了
Well then, bye.

489
00:54:56,709 --> 00:55:03,126
好了,不要再送了,再见
Bye. I'm fine. Good bye.

490
00:55:12,126 --> 00:55:13,584
你他妈的
Damn.

491
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:30,751
老师还说了些什么
What else did the teacher say?

492
00:55:30,834 --> 00:55:33,209
日本话我也不太会听
I don't understand Japanese too well.

493
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:37,334
反正意思是啊,小孩不爱读书,要留级了
What she meant was, the kid flunked.

494
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,959
我都跟你说过了他不爱读书
I told you he doesn't like to study.

495
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:43,292
就到横滨去学厨子
He should learn cooking in Yokohama.

496
00:55:43,709 --> 00:55:46,376
像我这样,有什么不好啊
Just like me, it's not that bad.

497
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:48,542
总比在这里学坏要好
It's better than to stay here and go astray.

498
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:07,167
学厨子,是你自己愿意的
You want to be a cook.

499
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:09,667
不过我们不管学哪一行
Waterever you choose,

500
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:11,417
都要学出个名堂来
You have to work had.

501
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:14,292
不要做一半就不做了,知道吗
You can't quit. Do you understand?

502
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:17,376
男孩子这样子一辈子会没出息的
If you quit easily,
you'll be a loser in your whole life.

503
00:56:46,084 --> 00:56:50,542
在这里,你要听大师傅的话,知道吗
You must stand to the Master Chef.

504
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:57,667
自己要照顾自己
Take care of yourself.

505
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,959
麻烦您,多多照顾
Please take care of him.

506
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:03,376
哪里,应该的
Of course I will.

507
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:05,167
您请回吧
Bye.

508
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:06,834
要听大师傅的话
Be good.

509
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:09,167
进去
Go.

510
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:54,542
好香啊
Smells great!

511
00:57:58,459 --> 00:57:59,876
好吃
It's delicious.

512
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:07,917
桂美,你作的牛肉饭,越做越道地了哦
You cook better and better.

513
00:58:08,001 --> 00:58:10,917
你也不看看,是什么师傅教的
Don't you know who taught her?

514
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:13,417
桂美要是回台北开餐馆
If Kuei-mei opens a restaurant in Taipei,

515
00:58:13,501 --> 00:58:15,167
准是独一无二的
she will succeed.

516
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:20,917
回去干么啊
Why do you want to go back?

517
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:25,334
时局那么坏,美援都停了
America stops supporting Taiwan.
It's not a good time.

518
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:27,959
美军也保不住,也要撒了
The US military will retreat soon.

519
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:30,167
能混啊,还不多混个两年
It's better to stay here for some more years.

520
00:58:30,251 --> 00:58:33,917
混,像你这样三天两头就请假的
Stay here for some more years?
You take leave everv two or three davs

521
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:35,709
早晚会被老板辞掉
Sooner or later will be the boss quit

522
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:38,084
没有签证,你就得回台北哦
Without a visa, you have to go back to Taipei

523
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:41,667
笑话,只要日本警察我躲着点
Nonsense.
If I stay away from the japanese cops,

524
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:44,042
在东京我哪里都能混
I can stay anywhere in Tokyo.

525
00:58:44,126 --> 00:58:45,459
没问题啦
No problem.

526
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:48,126
又吵架了
They are fighting again.

527
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:54,376
要不要吃一点
Do want something to eat?

528
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:55,709
不要,谢谢
No, thanks.

529
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,251
桂美
Kuei-mei!

530
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,001
留着你的好意
Save it.

531
00:59:07,084 --> 00:59:08,042
魏振东
Wei Chen-tung.

532
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:11,084
离婚的事,下辈子再说
Divorce? Not in your life!

533
00:59:12,167 --> 00:59:13,084
给我叫车
Call a car.

534
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:14,292
是
Yes.

535
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:03,917
你一天到晚看我们这样过日子
You see us fighting all the time

536
01:00:05,334 --> 01:00:07,251
奇怪不奇怪
What do you think?

537
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:12,751
我们也常常吵
We fight all the time, too.

538
01:00:46,501 --> 01:00:49,834
昨天,我走了以后
After I left yesterday,

539
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:52,417
先生跟你,都说了些什么

540
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:56,917
没有
Nothing.

541
01:00:57,876 --> 01:00:59,126
没有
Nothing?

542
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:03,584
怎么会没有
Are you sure?

543
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:07,084
听说,都说了老半天了
I heard that you talked for a long time.

544
01:01:16,876 --> 01:01:18,834
我是可怜你们没地方去
I know you have no place to go.

545
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:20,709
不然早请走路了

546
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:38,001
这里,我不想做了
I don't want to work here anymore.

547
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:49,292
怎么?那个女的又给你气受了啊
What happened?
The woman gave you a hard time again?

548
01:02:03,792 --> 01:02:08,251
司机说,他可以介绍我们到外面餐馆打工
The driver can introduce us to
work in a restaurant.

549
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:11,792
是苦一点,可是赚钱比这里多
The work is harder but the pay is better.

550
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:15,334
再存点钱,我们就可以回去
We can save more money and go home.

551
01:02:15,834 --> 01:02:18,667
自己开馆子,给自己做
We can open a restarant by ourselves.

552
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:28,209
出去,人生地不熟
Leaving...to an unfamiliar place...

553
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:33,084
反正也是中国人嘛
They are Chinese, too.

554
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:01,251
这日本人管麻将叫麻雀
The Japanese call mahjongg "sparrow".

555
01:03:01,334 --> 01:03:03,001
开馆子了呢
It's a business here.

556
01:03:04,209 --> 01:03:05,584
你看我干什么
Why are you starring at me?

557
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,626
到日本来什么时候赌过了
Have you ever seen me gamble here?

558
01:03:39,126 --> 01:03:42,751
您好,我们是小王介绍来的

我们没有在这里打工的签证

01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:04,959
我知道,警察来的时候躲一躲

我不要听

你碰我干什么,不要拉我
Why do you touch me? Don't pull me.

676
01:17:07,834 --> 01:17:09,959
不必,要说跟你妈去说
No! Tell your mom.

677
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,001
你不敢,对不对

01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:40,792
淹水了,真糟糕
What a mess!

711
01:21:49,626 --> 01:21:51,792
昨天晚上本来要回来的
I planed to come back last night,

712
01:21:51,876 --> 01:21:53,834
后来风实在是太大了
but the wind was too strong.

713
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:55,792
马路上车子一辆也叫不...
There wasn't a single taxi...

714
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:02,126
来,我来帮忙
Come, let me help...

715
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,667
你这是干什么嘛
What are you doing?

716
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:08,417
不是你让我到仁爱路去问房子价钱
Didn't you ask me to check the house price?

717
01:22:12,459 --> 01:22:13,667
刚来台湾的时候
When we come to Taiwan,

718
01:22:13,751 --> 01:22:15,251
那儿一坪二百块钱卖我
the price was $200 for 3.3 square meter.

719
01:22:15,334 --> 01:22:16,334
我还不要
I didn't want it.

720
01:22:16,417 --> 01:22:19,001
现在涨的跟金子一样了
Now it's more expensive.

721
01:22:20,917 --> 01:22:24,292
老常说,房子反正带不走
Chang says,
you can't take a house with you.

722
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:27,376
他说让你干脆置点金子靠得住
You better buy gold.

723
01:23:12,501 --> 01:23:14,251
对不起,打烊了
I'm sorry. We are closed.

724
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:16,709
请问侯永年是不是住在这里
Excuse me, does Hou live here?

725
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:18,709
你找他有什么事
How can I help you?

726
01:23:24,001 --> 01:23:25,084
里边坐
Come in.

727
01:23:29,126 --> 01:23:29,751
坐
Have a seat.

728
01:23:29,834 --> 01:23:30,667
谢谢
Thank you.

729
01:23:42,334 --> 01:23:44,334
有什么事不能跟我说吗
Is there anything that you can't tell me?

730
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:52,084
我是来问问他,他说要对我们母女好的
I'm here to ask him.
He said he will be good to us.

731
01:23:55,792 --> 01:23:59,584
怎么一下子,好久也不露一下面
But I have not seen him for a long time.

732
01:24:10,876 --> 01:24:13,001
难道就这样子算了吗
Is that it?

733
01:24:32,626 --> 01:24:34,042
我又不是那种
I'm not that kind of...

734
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,001
随随便便的女人啊
loose woman.

735
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,084
正兴,正兴
Cheng-hsing...Cheng-hsing...

736
01:24:51,167 --> 01:24:53,042
正兴到哪儿去了
Where are you?

737
01:24:53,126 --> 01:24:53,834
正...
Cheng...

738
01:25:19,084 --> 01:25:20,584
那个女的
The woman...

739
01:25:28,292 --> 01:25:30,167
她丈夫坐牢去了
Her husband is in jail.

740
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:35,626
老常认识她,总是到她们家去打牌
I played mahjongg at her house.

741
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:40,876
就是台风那天晚上
In the typhoon night...

742
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:44,042
我本来是要回来的
I planned to come back.

743
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:46,417
可是实在走不了
But I couldn't leave.

744
01:25:48,292 --> 01:25:49,292
我跟她
So we...

745
01:25:55,876 --> 01:25:57,751
以后不会再有了
It won't happen again.

746
01:25:58,501 --> 01:26:02,126
真的,我跟她说清楚,以后不会有了
I'll make it clear to her. Never again.

747
01:26:06,001 --> 01:26:08,251
你这是在干什么嘛
What are you doing?

748
01:26:10,959 --> 01:26:15,167
我不要再跟你过下去了,我要离婚
I'm leaving you. I want a divorce.

749
01:26:15,251 --> 01:26:19,001
离婚,离什么婚啊你
Divorce? What do you mean by divorce?

750
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:23,001
你跟那个日本的魏太太学
You learned from Mrs. Wei in Japan?

751
01:26:23,084 --> 01:26:24,834
你学什么学嘛
Why do you learn that?

752
01:26:25,876 --> 01:26:27,209
我不用学别人
I don't need to learn from others.

753
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:30,709
我什么苦都能跟你吃
I can suffer a hard life with you.

754
01:26:31,584 --> 01:26:34,501
女人的事,我绝不原谅你
But I will not forgive you to have an affair.

755
01:26:42,001 --> 01:26:45,084
现在外头工厂多的是,饿不死的
There are plenty of jobs, I can survive.

756
01:26:47,709 --> 01:26:49,001
等我安顿好
When I settle down,

757
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:51,709
五个孩子都是我的
I'll take all the kids.

758
01:26:56,084 --> 01:26:57,792
我会来接的
I'll come back to pick them up.

759
01:27:56,667 --> 01:27:57,834
妈
Mom.

760
01:27:58,959 --> 01:27:59,917
来
Come here.

761
01:28:28,584 --> 01:28:30,626
正芳离家出走了
Cheng-fang left.

762
01:28:37,584 --> 01:28:39,792
她同学家都找过了
We checked with her classmate

763
01:28:41,542 --> 01:28:44,042
说有个男孩子
They said she has a boyfriend.

764
01:28:47,417 --> 01:28:49,251
图书馆里认识的
They met in a library.

765
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:52,876
不知道他住哪里
I don't where he lives.

766
01:28:55,917 --> 01:28:59,001
自从你里开家家里乱七八糟的
Since you left, everything is a mess.

767
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,334
正兴也被大锅烫伤了
Cheng-hsing burned himself on a pot.

768
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:09,709
哥哥伤的重不重
Is your brother hurt badly?

769
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:12,001
现在已经没事了
He's okay now.

770
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:18,001
爸爸,你就当没有生过我
Daddy, pretend I'm not your daughter.

771
01:29:18,084 --> 01:29:19,042
我走了
I'm leaving.

772
01:29:19,459 --> 01:29:22,042
也许我的事会使你觉得丢脸
Maybe what I do will make you lose face.

773
01:29:22,126 --> 01:29:23,667
可是我绝不后悔
But I will never regret.

774
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:26,626
你们从来不了解我
You never understand me.

775
01:29:26,709 --> 01:29:28,792
以后也不会了解的
And you never will.

776
01:29:28,876 --> 01:29:31,501
所以,请不要来找我
So please don't find me.

777
01:29:52,417 --> 01:29:55,917
以后厨房里不准去,多危险啊
Stay away from the kitchen. It's dangerous.

778
01:29:56,001 --> 01:29:58,334
是爸爸叫我去帮忙的
Dad told me to go and help out.

779
01:30:09,917 --> 01:30:10,792
喂
Hello?

780
01:30:12,084 --> 01:30:12,667
是
This is she.

781
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:18,376
我知道,我马上来
I see... I'll be right there.

782
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:26,001
一大早,她就说要来跟我们阿盛结婚
She came and wanted to
marry our son Ah-sheng.

783
01:30:26,084 --> 01:30:28,667
原来,我以为她是开玩笑
At first I thought she was joking.

784
01:30:28,751 --> 01:30:30,917
谁知道她就站在那里
But she stood there.

785
01:30:31,001 --> 01:30:32,709
说什么都不走耶
And wouldn't leave.

786
01:30:33,459 --> 01:30:36,042
连我们阿盛都吓得要命
We were scared.

787
01:30:38,959 --> 01:30:41,459
是啦,如果真的有了小孩
Right...lf she's really pregnant,

788
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:43,709
我们也是要负责的
we would take the responsibility.

789
01:30:43,792 --> 01:30:46,626
可是,侯太太
But Mrs. Hou...

790
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:49,834
你看要是要他们两个现在结婚
Look at her.

791
01:30:49,917 --> 01:30:51,667
那是不可能的
It's impossible that they get married now.

792
01:30:51,751 --> 01:30:56,084
因为啊,两个都还是小孩都还要读书
They are kids. They need to study.

793
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:59,792
再说啊,我们阿盛也不敢哪
Besides,
Ah-sheng wouldn't dare to marry her.

794
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:06,959
对啦,是我们阿盛不好
Right, it's Ah-sheng's fault.

795
01:31:07,626 --> 01:31:09,417
这肚子里的小孩
The baby...

796
01:31:09,917 --> 01:31:12,542
我们林家也是舍不得
We don't want to give up the baby.

797
01:31:12,626 --> 01:31:15,167
可是,这是没有办法的耶
But we can't help.

798
01:31:15,251 --> 01:31:16,376
没办法
Can't help?

799
01:31:19,167 --> 01:31:21,126
坐下,没你的事情
Sit, chill out.

800
01:31:23,459 --> 01:31:26,167
我看啊,大家都不要生气啦
I think we should calm down.

801
01:31:26,251 --> 01:31:29,876
好好商量,想个办法
Let's find a way to solve the problem.

802
01:31:29,959 --> 01:31:32,459
这个钱啊我们是不会吝啬的
We can pay for it.

803
01:31:41,876 --> 01:31:45,834
林太太,正芳年纪还小
Mrs. Lin,Cheng-fang is young.

804
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,834
什么都不懂
She doesn't know anything.

805
01:31:49,084 --> 01:31:52,209
怀孕的事,不一定是真的
She might not be pregnant.

806
01:31:53,501 --> 01:31:56,501
这件事情只能怪她自己心太死
She's too ignorant

807
01:31:57,917 --> 01:31:59,501
容易相信人家
and she believes people easily

808
01:32:00,626 --> 01:32:02,209
今天你们的态度
If she knows what you said

809
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:05,834
她也应该死心,不会再傻了
she should give up and stops being silly.

810
01:32:06,792 --> 01:32:09,542
我们会带她回去好好跟她说
We will talk to her.

811
01:32:11,376 --> 01:32:12,751
今天的事情
Today...

812
01:32:13,376 --> 01:32:15,251
我们就当它没发生过
We'll peretend nothing happened.

813
01:32:47,292 --> 01:32:49,084
我就打死你
I'll beat you to death.

814
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,751
侯永年,你干什么
What are youd doing?

815
01:32:51,834 --> 01:32:52,667
侯永年
Hou Yung-nien!

816
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:56,917
你打死我,你打死我好了
Come on! Beat me to death!

817
01:32:57,001 --> 01:32:59,542
我不在乎,打死我好了
I don't care! Let me die!

818
01:33:00,501 --> 01:33:01,876
侯永年
Hou Yung-nien!

819
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:07,667
侯永年,你给我起来
Hou Yung-nien! Stop!

820
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,417
怎么样
You want to kill her, don't you?

821
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:14,709
你想打死她,是不是
What is it?

822
01:34:03,792 --> 01:34:06,251
怎么样,什么地方不舒服啊
Feeling unwell?

823
01:34:07,501 --> 01:34:10,459
林大夫,我以前来过
Dr. Lin, I've been here before.

824
01:34:10,542 --> 01:34:12,251
在这儿生过孩子
I had my babies here

825
01:34:17,501 --> 01:34:20,852
侯太太啊,双胞胎的
Mrs. Hou, twins.

826
01:34:20,959 --> 01:34:22,209
孩子已经很大了吧
They must be big now.

827
01:34:22,292 --> 01:34:23,258
对
Yes.

828
01:34:23,417 --> 01:34:24,792
快要上小学了
Going to primary school.

829
01:34:27,459 --> 01:34:28,501
那
So...

830
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:34,917
我今天来
I'm here today

831
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:38,376
是有事情想麻烦您
to ask for your help.

832
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:42,917
是我女儿
It's my daughter.

833
01:34:43,792 --> 01:34:45,501
她才十五岁
She's only 15.

834
01:34:48,959 --> 01:34:53,042
可能,可能有了
And she...she's probably pregnant.

835
01:34:59,667 --> 01:35:01,209
发生这种事情
Letting it happen,

836
01:35:02,126 --> 01:35:05,667
我们做大人的也有责任
We are also responsble

837
01:35:12,584 --> 01:35:16,834
不能,不能就这样毁了她一辈子
We can't destroy her life...

838
01:37:28,334 --> 01:37:30,251
正芳所受的打击
No one can suffer on behalf of Cheng-fang.

839
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:32,959
没有人能代替她
No one.

840
01:37:34,209 --> 01:37:36,501
但是她总是要长大的
She had to grow up.

841
01:37:38,001 --> 01:37:39,876
正芳念大学那年
When Cheng-fang went to college,

842
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:42,292
我们向跟行贷款
we got a loan from the bank.

843
01:37:43,334 --> 01:37:46,334
买了自己的房子,开西餐厅
Bought a house and run the restaurant.

844
01:37:47,334 --> 01:37:48,792
生意还不错
The business was good.

845
01:37:52,417 --> 01:37:53,959
丈夫有女人
A husband having an affair

846
01:37:54,751 --> 01:37:56,834
比赌钱更叫人寒心
is worse than gambling.

847
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:59,751
可是你也只有两种选择
But you have two choices,

848
01:38:00,709 --> 01:38:03,167
离开他,或者原谅他
to leave or to forgive.

849
01:38:04,459 --> 01:38:06,459
我觉得两个都不好
Nether are easy.

850
01:38:07,667 --> 01:38:09,584
可是总是要选一样啊
But you have to choose one.

851
01:38:14,126 --> 01:38:17,584
这是正全,他娶了个日本小姐
This is Cheng-chuan,
he married a Japanese lady.

852
01:38:21,167 --> 01:38:23,751
正兴念的是国际贸易
Cheng-hsing studied International Business.

853
01:38:23,834 --> 01:38:27,126
这是他的公司跟他的太太
This is hisoffice and his wife.

854
01:38:31,126 --> 01:38:33,584
这是双胞胎大学的时候
When the twins graduated from college,

855
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:35,126
全家的合照
we took this photo.

856
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:38,917
只可惜少了正全一家
But Cheng-chuan's family were not there.

857
01:39:14,251 --> 01:39:17,042
人原来是会老的
Everybody grows old.

858
01:39:18,667 --> 01:39:20,209
年轻的时候
When we were young,

859
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:22,876
就从来没有想到过
we never think about it.

860
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:44,292
而且还会生病
We not only grow old, but being ill.

861
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:45,626
女人的事
Women...

862
01:39:46,959 --> 01:39:49,376
他倒是真的没有再犯过
He never cheated on me since then.

863
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:54,834
不过,偶尔还是赌的
But still, he gambles sometimes.

864
01:39:58,917 --> 01:40:03,417
只是从知道我子宫是癌以后
Yet since he knew I have uterus cancer,

865
01:40:04,959 --> 01:40:07,209
倒是没见他再赌过
he quit gambling.

866
01:40:43,751 --> 01:40:45,667
孩子们大了
Kids have grown up.

867
01:40:46,834 --> 01:40:49,376
各人有各人的事
They have their own business.

868
01:40:50,251 --> 01:40:52,167
我住院以后
After I was in the hospital,

869
01:40:52,959 --> 01:40:55,126
霞飞之家的生意
The restaurant

870
01:40:55,209 --> 01:40:57,709
就只有正芳帮着照顾

871
01:40:59,376 --> 01:41:00,876
大家都说
Everyone says that

872
01:41:01,667 --> 01:41:03,876
她愈来愈像我了
she becomes more and more like me.

873
01:41:58,292 --> 01:41:59,751
你应该去接
You should pick them up

874
01:42:00,709 --> 01:42:04,084
你应该去机场接一接的
from the airport

875
01:42:04,084 --> 01:42:08,416
哪有老子接儿子的
No fathers will pick up their sons.

876
01:42:08,417 --> 01:42:09,667
死脑经
Stubborn man.

877
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:11,417
奶奶
Grandma!

878
01:42:14,626 --> 01:42:16,417

895
01:42:42,792 --> 01:42:44,001
有哦

898
01:42:46,417 --> 01:42:47,626
奶奶
Grandma.

899
01:42:47,709 --> 01:42:50,292
在日本跟她妈都说日本话
She speaks Japanese
with her mom in Japan.

900
01:42:50,376 --> 01:42:51,292
没办法
There is no way.

901
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:55,042
给爷爷看看
Let grandpa see you

902
01:42:57,501 --> 01:42:58,084
爸爸

903
01:42:58,167 --> 01:43:00,709
怎么生了个日本娃娃呢

904
01:43:02,959 --> 01:43:04,167
叫爷爷
Call "grandpa".

905
01:43:04,251 --> 01:43:05,959
不会叫,不会叫
Can you say it?

906
01:43:06,042 --> 01:43:06,667
拿东西给你吃
Take it.

907
01:43:06,751 --> 01:43:08,501
不要乱跑哦,乖
Behave yourself.

908
01:43:08,584 --> 01:43:10,042
贝贝想吃什么
What do you want to eat, Bei-bie?

909
01:43:10,459 --> 01:43:11,417
正全,你胖了

910

八十五了

911
01:43:12,834 --> 01:43:14,709
宝宝,宝宝
Bow-bow...

912
01:43:15,126 --> 01:43:16,292
吃药了没有
Did you take the pills?

913
01:43:17,292 --> 01:43:18,501
吃过了
Yes.

914
01:43:18,917 --> 01:43:20,792
来,我们去找奶奶
Come, let's find grandma.

915
01:43:20,876 --> 01:43:22,751
拿苹果果给他们吃嘛
Give them some apples.

916
01:43:23,459 --> 01:43:24,626
叫奶奶哦
Grandma.

917
01:43:25,042 --> 01:43:26,167
越来越不听话
You're naughty.

918
01:43:26,251 --> 01:43:27,876
随他们去吧
Let them go.

919
01:43:31,667 --> 01:43:32,709
你离婚的事
About your divorce...

920
01:43:32,792 --> 01:43:34,667
爸还好不高兴了一阵子
Dad is upset about it for a while.

921
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:37,501
这种事,有什么办法呢
What can I do?

922
01:43:37,584 --> 01:43:39,376
你真的不打算留在台北吗
You don't want to stay in Taipei?

923
01:43:40,334 --> 01:43:42,126
在外头也没有那么好混
It's not easy to make money outside.

924
01:43:42,751 --> 01:43:44,542
你日本话说得再好
Even if you speak Japanese well,

925
01:43:44,626 --> 01:43:46,542
他们还是当你外国人
they still see you as a foreigner.

926
01:43:46,959 --> 01:43:52,292
只是,那么多年待久了惯了
But I'm used to living in Japan.

927
01:43:52,376 --> 01:43:53,876
反而台北不熟
Taipei is strange place to me.

928
01:43:54,626 --> 01:43:58,001
都还指望你留下来,把店接过去做
I wish you could stay and
take over the restaurant.

929
01:44:02,834 --> 01:44:04,209
不太可能
It's impossible.

930
01:44:05,334 --> 01:44:06,834
店里生意怎么样
How's the business?

931
01:44:06,917 --> 01:44:08,084
现在竞争多
Lots of competition.

932
01:44:08,167 --> 01:44:09,751
生意愈来愈难做了
It's hard to make money.

933
01:44:10,501 --> 01:44:11,709
房子倒是愈来愈值钱了
But the house worth a lot.

934
01:44:14,959 --> 01:44:19,376
我看经营方式是有问题
I think, the problem is the way
of running the restaurant.

935
01:44:19,376 --> 01:44:21,251
那样的菜单不行了
The menu is old fashion.

936
01:44:21,542 --> 01:44:23,376
装潢也太旧了
The decoration is old.

937
01:44:24,334 --> 01:44:27,209
店里一直是她跟爸爸在管
Mom and dad take care of the restaurant.

938
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:29,001
我也很少过来
I seldom come here.

939
01:44:29,084 --> 01:44:30,209
她病了
After she became sick,

940
01:44:30,292 --> 01:44:33,459
我才辞了学校的工作过来帮忙
I quit my job at school and came.

941
01:44:35,626 --> 01:44:39,209
本来,我一直打算再出去念两年书的
I planned to study abroad
for one or two years.

942
01:44:40,876 --> 01:44:42,709
多大了,还念书
Study abroad? At your age?

943
01:44:43,292 --> 01:44:44,126
嫁人算了
You should get married.

944
01:44:44,209 --> 01:44:45,834
我不是跟你开玩笑的
I'm not joking.

945
01:44:45,917 --> 01:44:48,167
除了你我还没有告诉别人
I haven't told anyone else.

946
01:44:50,292 --> 01:44:51,167
正兴呢
How about Cheng-hsing?

947
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:53,792
正兴嫌累,根本做不来
He think it's too hard.

948
01:44:53,876 --> 01:44:56,292
正群又想移民到美回
Chang-shun wants to move to the States.

949
01:44:57,626 --> 01:44:59,834
快餐两份,柳丁汁一份
Two quick meals with orange juice.

950
01:44:59,917 --> 01:45:01,542
洗手间的水箱漏成那个样子
The toilet is leaking.

951
01:45:01,626 --> 01:45:03,042
怎么也不叫人修理呢
Why don't you have somebody fix it?

952
01:45:03,126 --> 01:45:04,417
对不起,我不知道
I'm sorry. I don't know that.

953
01:45:04,501 --> 01:45:06,167
我从来不用女厕所的
I don't use lady's room.

954
01:45:07,542 --> 01:45:09,459
这是谁,谁换的唱片,关掉,关掉
Who change the music? Turn it off.

955
01:45:09,542 --> 01:45:10,792
老板娘不是规定过吗
Didn't Mrs. Hou set the rules?

956
01:45:10,876 --> 01:45:12,542
不准放唱歌的音乐
Music with singing is not permitted.

957
01:45:12,626 --> 01:45:14,626
你们怎么搞的,你们这
What...What's wrong with you?

958
01:45:19,209 --> 01:45:21,501
小妹,你来,你来看看,你来
Here...Come over here. Look.

959
01:45:21,584 --> 01:45:22,917
这还像个什么店
What kind of place is this?

960
01:45:23,001 --> 01:45:23,667
老板娘一不在
As soon as Mrs. Hou leaves,

961
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:25,584
你们就把这当当成狗窝了
you mess up the place.

962
01:45:25,792 --> 01:45:27,001
不要这样做事嘛
Don't you have self-respect?

963
01:45:27,084 --> 01:45:28,751
你进去吧,正全在里面
Go in. Cheng-chuan's there.

964
01:45:28,834 --> 01:45:30,042
不要总在这里骂人
Don't scold here.

965
01:45:30,126 --> 01:45:31,542
现在小妹不好请
It's hard to find one these days.

966
01:45:31,626 --> 01:45:33,959
不好请怎么样,不好请我们自己做嘛
So what? We can do the work ourselves!

967
01:45:34,042 --> 01:45:35,209
好了,好了
Fine, fine.

968
01:45:35,292 --> 01:45:37,459
乱七八糟的,什么东西
What a mess...

969
01:45:44,709 --> 01:45:45,792
正兴呢
Where's Cheng-hsing?

970
01:45:45,876 --> 01:45:49,376
他啊,忙得很,每天进进出出
He's busy in and out.

971
01:45:49,459 --> 01:45:51,709
就是没看见多赚点钱回来
But he earn little.

972
01:45:51,792 --> 01:45:53,626
大姐,我找你商量一点事
Sis, there's something
I want to discuss with you.

973
01:45:53,709 --> 01:45:54,959
什么事啊
What is it?

974
01:45:55,042 --> 01:45:57,001
我看上忠孝东路一个店
I found a place at Zhongxiao Eset Rd.

975
01:45:57,084 --> 01:45:58,626
想搞个委托行
I want to open a consignment store.

976
01:45:58,709 --> 01:46:01,417
如果,霞飞之家收掉
If we close the Chavannes,

977
01:46:01,501 --> 01:46:03,126
咱们两个合伙
we can work together...

978
01:46:03,209 --> 01:46:04,751
谁说霞飞之家要收掉
Who said we will close the restaurant?

979
01:46:04,834 --> 01:46:06,167
不收掉谁做啊
Who will take care of the place then?

980
01:46:06,251 --> 01:46:08,417
正全不是也要回日本去吗
Isn't Cheng-chuan returning to Japan?

981
01:46:08,501 --> 01:46:11,334
再说,最近生意又不怎么样
Business is not well recently.

982
01:46:11,417 --> 01:46:13,917
正兴说,还是收掉的好
Cheng-hsing says it should be closed.

983
01:46:15,084 --> 01:46:17,251
霞飞之家要不要收掉,爸爸会决定
Only dad can make such decision.

984
01:46:17,334 --> 01:46:18,709
用不着我们操心
It's not our business.

985
01:46:19,334 --> 01:46:21,667
委托行的事,我也不懂这些
I know nothing about consignment.

986
01:46:21,751 --> 01:46:22,834
为什么不找正敏呢
Why don't you ask Cheng-min?

987
01:46:22,917 --> 01:46:25,751
正敏,我才懒得招惹她呢
Cheng-min? I don't want to bother her.

988
01:46:25,834 --> 01:46:27,709
到底不一样啊
It isn't the same, you know.

989
01:46:27,792 --> 01:46:28,626
有什么不一样
What the differences?

990
01:46:28,709 --> 01:46:30,167
当然不一样
Of course it's different.

991
01:46:30,251 --> 01:46:33,084
你妈对你们,跟对双胞胎就是不一样
Mom treats you and the twins diffrerently.

992
01:46:33,792 --> 01:46:35,167
我不觉得有什么不一样
I don't think there are any differences.

993
01:46:38,084 --> 01:46:39,334
你们吃吧
Go on and eat.

994
01:46:42,042 --> 01:46:43,584
快吃啊你
Stop playing-

995
01:46:50,209 --> 01:46:52,417
昨天不是说想吃柳丁吗
Didn't you say you wanted oranges?

996
01:46:52,501 --> 01:46:55,417
夏天都是冷冻的,不太好
In summer, there are only frozen organes.

997
01:46:55,501 --> 01:46:56,209
贵不贵
Is it expensive?

998
01:46:56,292 --> 01:46:58,292
放心,没有水蜜桃贵
Less expensive than peaches .

999
01:46:58,376 --> 01:47:00,042
你啊,就是小气
You're stingy.

1000
01:47:01,501 --> 01:47:03,334
我是没有你们大方
I'm not as generous as you are.

1001
01:47:04,459 --> 01:47:06,834
一套衣服八千块
Spending 8000NTD for a dress.

1002
01:47:06,917 --> 01:47:09,001
日本进口的耶,当然贵啦
It's imported from Japan.
It's expensive of course.

1003
01:47:10,001 --> 01:47:11,917
我就不晓得好在哪里
I don't know why it is good.

1004
01:47:14,042 --> 01:47:16,709
妈,他来了,我要走了
Mom. He's here. I'm leaving.

1005
01:47:19,834 --> 01:47:21,417
还有晚上要帮我留六个位子哦
Save six seats for me tonight.

1006
01:47:21,501 --> 01:47:23,626
我要请朋友吃饭,拜拜
Where's dad?

1007
01:47:25,292 --> 01:47:26,167
爸呢
I'm treating my friends. See you.

1008
01:47:26,251 --> 01:47:28,417
说去买什么补药
Said he was giong to buy some tonic.

1009
01:47:28,501 --> 01:47:29,917
随他了
Whatever.

1010
01:47:35,751 --> 01:47:37,709
放着,等一下
Leaveit

1011
01:47:50,709 --> 01:47:56,209
正全要回日本跟你说了吧
Did Cheng-chuan tell you he was leaving?

1012
01:48:04,209 --> 01:48:09,751
正兴,正群,也都有自己的打算
Cheng-hsing and Cheng-chun
have their own plans.

1013
01:48:17,834 --> 01:48:24,542
正芳,如果你也不愿意
Cheng-fang, if you don't want the restaurant,

1014
01:48:28,126 --> 01:48:31,834
我会慢慢地劝劝你们爸爸
I'll try to persuade your father...

1015
01:48:35,251 --> 01:48:36,709
让他把店卖了
To sell the place...

1016
01:48:44,292 --> 01:48:46,084
他一定不肯的
I know he won't agree.

1017
01:48:54,417 --> 01:48:56,251
只有好好跟他说了
I'll tell him nicely.

1018
01:48:59,542 --> 01:49:01,209
我来说
I'll do it.

1019
01:49:13,917 --> 01:49:16,084
真想出去走一走
I'd like to go out for a walk.

1020
01:49:18,959 --> 01:49:20,459
哪天问问大夫
When the doctor says you can go,

1021
01:49:20,542 --> 01:49:23,792
我借正兴的车,一起出去走走
I'll borrow Cheng-hsing's car for us.

1022
01:49:42,751 --> 01:49:45,792
你们妈妈留了点首饰
Your mom left some jewelry.

1023
01:49:46,376 --> 01:49:50,042
说正全过两天就得要走了
She said Cheng-chuan is about to leave.

1024
01:49:52,167 --> 01:49:54,542
让我先拿出来给你们
So she wanted me to give it to you.

1025
01:49:58,459 --> 01:50:02,209
她说啊,只是纪念品
She said it's just souvernirs.

1026
01:50:03,834 --> 01:50:06,792
她也搞不清楚公平不公平了
She doensn't know if it's fair or not.

1027
01:50:09,792 --> 01:50:15,751
她这一辈子惦记着的就是要对你们公平
She wanted to be fair to you all her life.

1028
01:50:18,876 --> 01:50:21,334
辛苦了一辈子
She had a hard time.

1029
01:50:21,417 --> 01:50:25,042
想要对她好一点,来不及了
It's too late to be good to her now.

1030
01:50:27,001 --> 01:50:29,084
好了,就这样了
OK. That's it!

1031
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,876
正敏马上就是人家的人了
Cheng-min will soon get married.

1032
01:50:38,709 --> 01:50:41,292
店里头有正芳
Cheng-fang is handling the restaurant.

1033
01:50:41,376 --> 01:50:42,167
好
OK.

1034
01:50:44,334 --> 01:50:48,292
那以后你们有空回来看看嘛
Come back to visit when you have time.

1035
01:50:49,792 --> 01:50:51,209
行了,好了
OK. That's all.

1036
01:50:51,292 --> 01:50:53,959
爸,大姐总是要嫁人的啊
Dad, Cheng-fang will get
married sooner or later.

1037
01:50:57,459 --> 01:50:59,251
爸一个人顾店太累了
Dad can't handle the
restaurant all by himself.

1038
01:51:00,042 --> 01:51:02,251
霞飞之家该考虑卖了
You should sell the restaurant.

1039
01:51:03,834 --> 01:51:06,542
卖了,为什么要卖了
Sell it? Why?

1040
01:51:07,626 --> 01:51:10,542
爸,店卖掉了你也可以轻松一下
Dad, you can relax if it's sold.

1041
01:51:11,584 --> 01:51:15,667
我很好,我不要轻松,你们,你这
I'm fine. I don't want to relax.

1042
01:51:15,751 --> 01:51:20,126
霞飞之家是我跟你妈辛辛苦苦一辈子
Your mom and I worked hard for the place.

1043
01:51:20,209 --> 01:51:22,501
我不要卖,一辈子不卖
I won't sell it, never!

1044
01:51:25,001 --> 01:51:26,167
只要我还在
As long as I am alive,

1045
01:51:26,251 --> 01:51:28,626
你们谁也不准再跟我提起这个事情
don't you ever mention this again.

1046
01:51:35,042 --> 01:51:37,376
正群,正敏在这里生的吗?
Were Cheng-chun
and Cheng-min born here?

1047
01:51:39,042 --> 01:51:40,084
恩
Yes.

1048
01:51:42,251 --> 01:51:45,501
这几年,我一直在想
I've been thinking these years.

1049
01:51:47,251 --> 01:51:49,792
当初也许不该去日本的
Maybe we shouldn't have gone to Japan.

1050
01:51:51,292 --> 01:51:53,167
放下你们没人管
And left you alone.

1051
01:51:54,834 --> 01:52:00,292
害你,一定一直心里不舒服吧?
You must felt awful.

1052
01:52:01,042 --> 01:52:04,292
那么多年了也没什么不舒坦的
I feel okay now.

1053
01:52:04,376 --> 01:52:08,584
倒是,你那时候真的不怪爸爸了吗
But did you really forgive dad that time?

1054
01:52:11,834 --> 01:52:13,167
女人的事啊
About the affair?

1055
01:52:16,001 --> 01:52:21,584
反正,夫妻嘛,总有一个要忍啊
We're couple. One of us has to be tolerant.

1056
01:52:21,667 --> 01:52:23,876
为什么忍的总是女人呢
Why are always women being tolerant?

1057
01:52:27,042 --> 01:52:30,209
所以,你一直不想结婚
Is that why you don't want to get married?

1058
01:52:33,167 --> 01:52:38,084
我总觉得你不该那么容忍爸爸的
I think you shouldn't have forgiven dad.

1059
01:52:42,167 --> 01:52:43,459
也许你对
Maybe you're right.

1060
01:52:45,042 --> 01:52:48,042
不过,你总不会叫我现在离婚吧
But you wouldn't want us to divorce now.

1061
01:53:05,334 --> 01:53:08,709
就是你那个开餐厅的有钱的表妹啊?
It that the rich cousin
who open the restaurant?

1062
01:53:11,084 --> 01:53:13,459
不是得了癌症吗,怎么还能来
I thought she has a cancer,
how can she come?

1063
01:53:14,084 --> 01:53:15,251
小声点,好不好
Lower your voice

1064
01:53:15,334 --> 01:53:17,792
走了,走了,晚上吃过晚饭
Let's go. After dinner.

1065
01:53:17,876 --> 01:53:19,376
过来接着打西风啊,别忘了
Come and continue the game. Don't forget.

1066
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:20,917
知道了,知道了
OK.

1067
01:53:22,001 --> 01:53:26,209
小凤,小凤啊,绐你表姨,表妹倒茶
Hsiao-feng, make some tea
for your auntie and cousin.

1068
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:28,084
表姨
Auntie.

1069
01:53:28,292 --> 01:53:29,126
正芳
Cheng-fang.

1070
01:53:29,209 --> 01:53:30,501
坐,坐嘛
Have a seat.

1071
01:53:30,584 --> 01:53:31,376
来
Here.

1072
01:53:36,834 --> 01:53:38,001
谢谢表嫂
Thank you.

1073
01:53:38,751 --> 01:53:41,959
正芳,还记得柴妈妈吗
Cheng-fang,
do you remember Momma Chai?

1074
01:53:42,042 --> 01:53:43,167
柴妈妈
Momma Chai.

1075
01:53:43,251 --> 01:53:46,834
从前总去柴妈妈家,喝教堂牛奶的
You always went to Chai's house,
and drank milk at church.

1076
01:53:47,459 --> 01:53:51,167
在路上看见了都已经不认识了
I wouldn't recognize her now.

1077
01:53:52,376 --> 01:53:55,667
柴太太上个月搬到对门来了
Mrs. Chai moved to next door last month.

1078
01:53:55,751 --> 01:53:57,126
你说巧不巧啊
Isn't it a coincidence?

1079
01:53:57,876 --> 01:54:00,459
桂美啊,你胖多了
Kuei-mei, you've put on a lot of weight.

1080
01:54:00,542 --> 01:54:04,126
你看你表姐啊愈来愈瘦了
Your cousin is getting thinner and thinner.

1081
01:54:04,209 --> 01:54:05,334
她身体不好
Her health is not good

1082
01:54:05,417 --> 01:54:07,084
还一天到晚打牌嘛
but she still plays mahjongg.

1083
01:54:09,084 --> 01:54:10,751
不打牌干什么呢
Or what else should I do?

1084
01:54:11,251 --> 01:54:14,626
整天闷在这个鬼国民住宅里头
I'm cooped in this damn house.

1085
01:54:14,709 --> 01:54:16,626
像鸽子笼一样啊
Like a bird in the cage.

1086
01:54:17,584 --> 01:54:21,334
我不像你还有个生意弄弄
Unlike you, you have a business to do.

1087
01:54:24,167 --> 01:54:26,417
尤其是你表姐夫过世之后
After my husband passed away...

1088
01:54:26,501 --> 01:54:31,501
我更是连个吵架的人都没有呢
I don't even have anybody to fight with.

1089
01:54:32,209 --> 01:54:34,542
听起来,你很爱吵啊
It sounds like you love to fight.

1090
01:54:35,376 --> 01:54:38,126
那就让你每天跟我老柴去吵
Then you can argue with my husband everyday.

1091
01:54:38,209 --> 01:54:40,376
看你受不受得了
Let's see if you can handle it.

1092
01:54:42,417 --> 01:54:43,542
你不知道啊
Know what?

1093
01:54:45,251 --> 01:54:49,626
老柴大陆上的太太从香港出来了
Chai's Chinese wife came from Hong Kong.

1094
01:54:50,376 --> 01:54:52,876
柴太太吃了这么多年的苦
After so many hard years,

1095
01:54:52,959 --> 01:54:54,292
她心里当然不高兴了
of couse she is not happy.

1096
01:54:55,459 --> 01:54:58,542
我不是不高兴,我就是生气
I'm not unhappy, I'm furious.

1097
01:54:59,292 --> 01:55:02,584
当初他骗我,他还没结婚
He told me he wasn't married.

1098
01:55:03,042 --> 01:55:05,084
后来多一个太太
But now there's another wife.

1099
01:55:05,459 --> 01:55:08,334
每个月还要寄钱给她
He sent her money every month.

1100
01:55:08,417 --> 01:55:13,042
还寄电视,录音机,没完没了
He also sent her TV, radio, and other stuff.

1101
01:55:15,417 --> 01:55:17,042
那怎么办呢
What could you do about it?

1102
01:55:18,959 --> 01:55:20,792
我还能怎么办
What could I do?

1103
01:55:23,542 --> 01:55:27,584
苦也苦过了,孩子也把他带大了
I suffered. The kids have grown up.

1104
01:55:28,626 --> 01:55:31,501
高兴的时候,我就算了
When I feel good, I forgive him.

1105
01:55:31,584 --> 01:55:34,417
不高兴的时候,我就跟他吵架
When I feel bad, I fight with him.

1106
01:55:34,959 --> 01:55:37,667
到底是三十年的夫妻了,对不对
You've married for 30 years, right?

1107
01:55:38,459 --> 01:55:41,334
老都老了嘛,还能怎么样
You're old now. What can you do?

1108
01:55:43,126 --> 01:55:45,834
桂美,我忘了告诉你一件事
Kuei-mei,
there's something I forget to tell you.

1109
01:55:49,334 --> 01:55:52,751
我托老柴啊,在香港的太太
I asked Chai to have his Hong Kong wife

1110
01:55:52,834 --> 01:55:55,834
帮我们回去,打听老家的事情
check the situation of our hometown.

1111
01:55:55,917 --> 01:56:00,542
你啊,再也想不到,谁转来了一件东西呢
You'll never guess who sent us a package.

1112
01:56:13,126 --> 01:56:14,292
你看
Look.

1113
01:56:20,167 --> 01:56:24,084
费振邦,你以前的未婚夫耶
Fei Chen-pang. Your former fiance!

1114
01:56:24,167 --> 01:56:25,626
是不是他
Is it him?

1115
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:34,126
没有信,有些话不方便
There's no letter. It's inconvenient to tell everything.

1116
01:56:34,709 --> 01:56:38,209
说,知道你很好,他很高兴
He said he's happy to know you are well here.

1117
01:56:39,834 --> 01:56:44,376
他有两个女儿,希望能绐弄出来
He has 2 daughters and
hope to send them out.

1118
01:57:30,209 --> 01:57:32,251
想跟你商量一件事
I want to discuss with you.

1119
01:57:34,834 --> 01:57:38,667
霞飞之家我想整修一下
I'd like to renovate the Chavannes.

1120
01:57:40,334 --> 01:57:45,792
换个经营方式,再重新做做看
And change the manage way.

1121
01:57:56,459 --> 01:58:02,126
这样很好,我可以放心了
That's good. I can count on you.

1122
01:58:22,209 --> 01:58:26,501
费家的事,托给你了
I'll leave the matter of the Fei's to you.

1123
01:58:38,876 --> 01:58:40,959
多照顾你爸爸
Take care of your dad.

1124
01:58:43,667 --> 01:58:48,626
没事的时候,劝他打打牌
Ask him to play cards
when he has nothing to do.

1125
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:57,584
年纪大了,没有别的嗜好
He's old and has no other habbit.

1126
01:58:59,542 --> 01:59:08,042
偶尔打打牌,也许日子会好过一点
Playing cards can make him feel better.

1127
01:59:11,292 --> 01:59:13,876
你累了,睡一下吧
You're tired. Go get some sleep.
