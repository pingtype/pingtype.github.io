00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,910
- 嗯！ - 嘿
- Mmm!  - Hey.

3
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,540
嘿，为什么我们以前从没在一起？
Hey, how come we never got together before?

4
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,990
因为我一直有男朋友
Well, because I always had a boyfriend.

5
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,390
现在还有吗？
You still got one?

6
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,890
如果我在舞会上甩了你，你还会是我男朋友吗？
Would you still be my boyfriend if I ditched you at the prom?

7
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,550
不可能的事
Never happen.

8
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,720
- 当心点，公主殿下  - 让我来开
- Watch it, your highness.  - Let me drive.

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,200
- 我来开  - 不，这可不…
- I wanna drive.  - No, I don't think...

10
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,630
让我开，我给你的手找了个更好的地方
Let me drive. I got a better place for your hand.

11
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,230
噢！耶！
Oh, yeah.

12
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,500
♪ You might think I'm crazy ♪

用鼻子吸气
Inhale through your nose.

14
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,570
用嘴呼气
Exhale through your mouth.

15
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,440
向右转动方向盘
Turn the wheel to the right.

16
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,810
用鼻子吸气
Inhale through your nose.

17
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,480
呼气，向左转动方向盘

用鼻子吸气

向右转动方向盘
Turn the wheel to the right.

20
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,600
非常好，好的，准备好了吗？
Oh, very good. Okay, ready?

21
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,070
哦，艾玛的头球
Oh, Irma hit it with her head!

22
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,340
来击下掌，干得漂亮
Gimme five on that. Right here. Good job.

23
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,020
今天想系什么颜色的缎带？蓝色还是桃色？
what color ribbon would you like today: Blue or peach?

24
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,690
- 你明白了？ - 好的
- You got it?  - All right.

25
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,700
这很容易
Easy does it.

26
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,330
我想洗澡
I wanna have my bath now.

27
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,040
你已经洗过了，狄娅娜
You already had your bath, Diane.

28
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,840
- 中风吗？ - 他们是这么说的
- Stroke, huh?  - That's what they told me.

29
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,010
- 谢谢  - 不客气
- Thanks.  - You're welcome.

30
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,320
我想现在可以松开他了
I think we can remove his restraints now.

31
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,330
他是该象其他犯人一样对待
I know he deserves the same care as anyone else,

32
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,590
但我们确实无法适应政府的做法
but we're really not set up to accommodate the state's overflow.

33
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,260
嘿，我已经松开了
Hey, I just move 'em.

34
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,270
卡萝
Carol!

35
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,770
签个字吧
Just, uh, sign here.

36
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,600
你能送曼宁先生去一一四号房吗？
Would you please take Mr. Manning to 114?

37
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,950
能跟上手势吗？
Can you follow this?

38
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,530
能捏紧吗？
How about a little squeeze?

39
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,040
他们干嘛那样铐着你？
Man, why'd they have you chained up like that?

40
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,540
- 他是个重罪犯  - 嘘！
- He's a felon.  - Shh!

41
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,710
女士们，你们该了解些更好的事，去吧
Ladies, you should know better than that. Go on.

42
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,880
以后有的是时间来拜访
There's plenty of time to visit later.

43
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,010
去吧
Go.

44
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,550
在这没有太多私人空间
Not a lot of privacy around here,

45
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,560
但考虑到你的来路
but considering where you've been,

46
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,390
多一点女性关注也许是好事
a little female attention might be nice.

47
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,130
好吧，来点音乐怎么样？
Right. How 'bout a little music?

48
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,370
有摇滚，也有爵士
We got rock 'n' roll. We got jazz.

49
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,370
还有乡村音乐，我们有很多乡村音乐
We got country. We got lots of country here.

50
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,500
工作怎么样？
How was work?

51
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,010
还行
Okay.

52
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,020
来了个新病人
Got a new guy in.

53
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,850
- 猜猜是什么人？ - 什么人？
- Guess what he was?  - What?

54
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,510
银行大盗
A bank robber.

55
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,520
而且是高手，他们花了三十年才抓到他
Pretty good one too. Took them 30 years to catch him.

56
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,750
- 要归功于一次停电  - 他为什么失去知觉？
- The only reason they did was a blackout.  - Why'd he black out?

57
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,490
不是他失去知觉
He didn't black out.

58
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,490
[停电和失去知觉为同一词]
是丹佛全城停电
Denver did. The whole city.

59
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,500
应急发电机坏了
The emergency generator kicked in.

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,400
金库关闭，第二天他们打开金库时…
The vault shuts, and the next day when they open the vault...

61
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,520
钥匙在车上吗？
Are the keys in the car?

62
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,530
- 是的  - 好的，明天见
- Yeah.  - Okay. See you in the morning.

63
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,210
他们在金库里发现了他
They found him in the vault.

64
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,050
天亮了
Rise and shine.

65
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,550
太平洋西北地区的又一个好日子
It's another beautiful day in the Pacific Northwest,

66
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,490
我们俄州地区预计该是晴天
and our Oregon forecast promises sunshine.

67
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,660
亲爱的？
Honey?

68
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,860
谢谢
Thank you.

69
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,870
卡萝
Carol.

70
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,100
怎么样？你和我？
How 'bout it? You and me?

71
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,140
要是我丈夫还活着的话，哈
If my husband were alive, hah!

72
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,290
看起来很不错
This looks pretty good.

73
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,280
你是在回忆往事
Are you in there remembering it all,

74
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,230
还是一切都无从记起了？
or did everything just get erased?

75
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,530
他有什么问题？
What's his problem?

76
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,900
中风，你的理由呢？
He had a stroke. What's your excuse?

77
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,960
噢！
Uh-oh.

78
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,440
你在生我气？
Are you mad at me?

79
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,470
你真的对我生气了？
You're really gonna be mad at me?

80
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,530
你说好要开车送我的
You said you were gonna drive me to work.

81
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,440
见鬼，看看你
Damn. Look at you.

82
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,600
你那么美，知道你有多美吗？
You are so beautiful. You know how beautiful you are?

83
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,980
我生气时你总这么说
You always say that to me when I'm mad at you.

84
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,980
一针见血
Beats fightin'.

85
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,780
那么，你去哪了？
So? Where were you?

86
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,320
是工作上的事
Um... It was a work thing.

87
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,620
- 是吗？ - 是的
- Really?  - Yeah.

88
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,530
同老板喝酒，这差使不容易
Drinking with the boss, that's hard work.

89
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,760
不过…
But...

90
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,770
你面前是个主管了
You're lookin' at a supervisor.

91
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,430
- 真的？ - 嗯
- Really?  - Mm-hmm.

92
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,800
- 日班？ - 我哪知道你会有这要求？
- Day shift?  - How did I know you were gonna ask that?

93
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,190
但加了八十块，全额退休金…
But it is 80 bucks raise...

94
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,040
福利，合计有九百
and a full pension, benefits, the whole nine yards.

95
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,940
- 退休金  - 这样等你老了就不用吃猫粮
- Pension.  - So you don't have to eat cat food when you get old.

96
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,950
或者象这家伙一样可怜
Or wind up like this poor slob.

97
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,880
可悲的是，他也许有地方可以拿钱
The sad thing is, he probably has loads of money somewhere.

98
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,580
他就是我说的那个银行大盗
He's the guy I told you about, the bank robber.

99
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,310
我会尽快争取上日班，好吗？
Hey, I'll get on the day shift soon, okay?

100
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,150
能让我见到你当然好了
That would be nice. I could see you once in a while.

101
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,120
恭喜你，很高兴你能升职

她不能对我们这么乱来

120
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,540
惹急了我会去协会告她
And I'll go to the union if I have to. She knows I will.

121
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,280
帮我扶她起来
Help me lift her up.

122
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,480
好了，站起来
Okay, up you go.

123
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,390
哦！
Ohh!

124
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,490
- 没人能假装中风  - 他能
- No way can you fake a stroke.  - He could.

125
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,490
知道他干过什么吗？
Do you know what he did?

126
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,960
他出售安全系统给银行
He started a company that sold security systems to banks.

127
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,390
- 然后呢？ - 然后盗窃银行
- Yeah, so?  - And then he robbed the banks.

128
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,330
我见过他，但这些油菜卷心菜比他做过什么更要紧
I saw him. You know, this cole slaw's got more going on than he does.

129
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,460
也许你该培养点业余爱好
Maybe you need a hobby or something.

130
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,100
草莓，香蕉和苹果会浮上来
Well, your strawberries, bananas and apples float,

131
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,230
李子和桃子会沉下去
and your prunes and peaches sink.

132
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,070
你只要区分是浮是沉
You just have to tell the floaters from the sinkers.

133
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,770
有点象男人
Kinda like men.

134
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,210
我懂了，懂了
I got it, I got it. Okay.

135
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,840
我相信狱医对你做过彻底检查
I'll bet those prison doctors gave you a real going-over.

136
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,950
用针扎你
Sticking you with pins.

137
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,680
用锤子敲你
Whacking you with hammers.

138
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,120
有没有弄疼你？
Did they hurt you?

139
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,650
显然他们采用了错误的方案
Obviously, they took the wrong approach.

140
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,520
这就是医生和护士之间的差别
That's the difference between doctors and nurses.

141
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,440
医生在检查程序上可能有很多约束
Doctors can be so tied to medical procedures.

142
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,170
但有时候…
But sometimes...

143
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,440
一点点朴实的疗法会有效得多
a little down-home therapy is so much more effective.

144
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,880
♪ When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky ♪

145
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,040
♪ Ooh, she'll make you flip ♪

146
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,140
♪ Here she comes again ♪

147
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,680
♪ When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky ♪

148
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,780
♪ I kinda like the way she dips ♪

149
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,290
你嘴唇很干吗？
Are your lips dry?
♪ She's my best friend's girl ♪

150
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,290
所以才不能和我说话？
Is that why you can't speak to me?

151
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,350
♪ She's my best friend's girl ♪

152
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,730
♪ But she used to be mine ♪

153
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,700
放松的感觉是不是很好？
Wouldn't it feel good to just let go, hmm?

154
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,600
嗯？
Hmm?

155
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,030
我知道你在那
I know you're in there.

156
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,770
出来，出来，不管你在哪
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

157
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,750
♪ But when you bite your lip ♪

158
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,250
♪ It's a reaction to love ♪

159
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,780
- ♪ Here she comes again ♪  - ♪ When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky ♪

160
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,020
你抗拒的话治疗可能会大不一样
Therapy can be very difficult if you resist.

161
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,390
也许你需要到外边散散心
Maybe you need a less-structured environment.

162
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,520
♪ When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky ♪

163
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,000
你太好了，卡萝，尤其你是在休假
This is very thoughtful of you, Carol, especially on your day off,

164
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,400
但曼宁先生恐怕没能力对野餐表示感激
but I really don't think Mr. Manning will be able to appreciate a picnic.

165
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,730
我觉得他在内心深处会感激的
You know, Mrs. Foster, deep down inside, I think he will.

166
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,830
别担心，宝贝，我们会很开心的
Don't worry, baby. We're gonna have a great time.

167
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,210
当然，我们有啤酒，还有…
Well, sure. We got beer. We got, uh...

168
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,210
成人尿布
We got diapers.

169
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,720
要啤酒吗，亨利？
Want a beer, Henry?

170
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,790
我还以为他是指派的司机
I thought he was the designated driver.

171
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,230
- 鸡肉呢？ - 别戏弄这可怜的混蛋了
- How about a little chicken?  - Don't torture the poor bastard.

172
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,930
我没戏弄他，只是他太难对付了
I'm not torturing him. He's just being stubborn.

173
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,670
要是没女人献殷勤男人就不可能中风
Guy can't even have a stroke without some chick taking it personally, huh?

174
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,540
韦恩，你不是要去钓鱼吗？
Wayne, don't you have some fishing to do?

175
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,310
好了，亨利，这儿只有你和我了
Okay, Henry. It's just you and me.

176
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,490
我知道你能听见
I know you hear me.

177
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,550
这是你最后的机会
This is your last chance.

178
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,600
记住，这是你的选择
Just remember, this was your choice.

179
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,010
你就继续装好了
Didn't have to come to this.

180
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,690
我的天
Oh, my God.

181
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,670
啊！
Ah!

182
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,780
卡萝
Carol!

183
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,560
好吧，你很聪明
Okay, so you're smart.

184
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,860
非常聪明，你想怎样？
Really smart. What do you want?

185
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,120
一分钟前你还喋喋不休
A minute ago, you couldn't shut up.

186
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,500
现在却哑巴了？你想怎么样？
Now you can't talk, huh? What is it?

187
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,200
勒索我？你想分一杯羮是不是？
You lookin' to blackmail me? You're gonna put the bite on me, is that it?

188
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,710
- 卡萝，你敢碰她一个指头…  - 怎么，用水泼我吗？
- Carol! You lay a finger on her, and I'll...  - What, splash me?

189
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,710
说，你想怎么样？
Come on! Now, what do you want?

190
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,710
说啊
Come on!

191
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,490
- 我不知道  - 你不知道
- I don't know.  - You don't know.

192
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,750
我只是…不喜欢被愚弄
I just... I don't like being made a fool of.

193
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,950
我两年半前就开始这个花招了是吧？
Two and a half years I've been working on this hype, and that's it?

194
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,660
- 是的  - 真不敢相信
- That's it.  - I don't believe this.

195
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,660
你想怎样？
So, what are you gonna do?

196
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,760
我想怎样？你到底想怎样？还有他？
What am I gonna do? What the hell are you gonna do? And what about him, huh?

197
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,830
- 嘿！ - 你想怎样？
- Hey!  - And what about you?

198
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,840
什么我想怎样？
What about me what?

199
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,030
你想做英雄？把我送回监狱关几年？
You wanna be a hero, huh? You wanna stick me back in the slammer for a couple years?

200
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,670
你…你是说我会告密？
Are you... Is he... Are you calling me a rat?

201
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,880
哦，伙计
Oh, boy.

202
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,710
我要喝一杯
I need a drink.

203
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,440
说来有点可笑…
You know, it's funny the kind of stuff...

204
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,740
在监狱图书馆你能大有收获
that you can get shipped into a prison library.

205
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:30,840
佛教密宗，意念控制，自我催眠
Tantric Buddhism, mind control, autohypnosis.

206
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,750
必须…把所有这些融会贯通
Gotta... gather up all that stuff.

207
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,280
找出你需要的并为你所用，我那样做了
Find out what you need and make it work for you. I did that.

208
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:48,310
整日，整夜，每日，每夜
All day, all night. Every day, every night.

209
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,320
如同投入训练
Like I was in training.

210
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,830
对，我参加过体育训练
Yeah. I played sports.

211
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,620
假装中风并不完全象是…唔
Yeah, well, faking a stroke is not exactly like, uh,

212
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,930
一场竞技，但我得说…
an Olympic event, but I gotta tell ya,

213
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,410
如果你知道他们会替你输液
if you know they're gonna be stickin' pins in ya,

214
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,380
也知道有人一天二十四小时看守…
and you know that there are gonna be guards 24 hours a day...

215
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,970
等着你露出马脚
just waitin' for you to screw up on the hustle,

216
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,170
你就知道装死还装得不够好
then you know it ain't good enough to be just... playin' possum.

217
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,410
你必须来一次假死，绝对的假死
You gotta be a possum. Dead possum.

218
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,320
才能有用
So you work,

219
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,520
你要学着集中精神，抛开杂念
and you learn just to funnel... everything down,

220
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,420
最终你所知道的…
so finally all you know,

221
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,580
就是你只有心跳
all you are is a heartbeat.

222
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,390
我得告诉你，你可以到这样的状态
I gotta tell you, you get to a place like that,

223
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,590
到达一种类似死去的境界
it is some kick in the ass.

224
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,200
在体会一段时间后
Then you take that, and after a while,

225
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,790
你就能伪装并维持这状态直到…
you can shape it and mold it and squeeze it till...

226
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,430
我能让每次心跳听起来如同天籁之音
Hey, I can make every heartbeat sound like Frank Sinatra.

227
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,940
老天
Man.Yeah, man.

228
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,450
告诉你们…
I'll tell ya...

229
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,460
有一天，蟑螂…
One day, this cockroach...

230
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,960
爬上了我的领口
just climbed off my collar,

231
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,290
决定在我脸上漫游
decided to take a hike around my face,

232
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,330
之后停在了…
and he parked...

233
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,330
我的上嘴唇和鼻子之间
half on my upper lip and half inside my nose.

234
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,330
它在那儿挨挨擦擦
He just scratched around in there,

235
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,330
想找点刺激
lookin' for a little action.

236
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,330
那时你会祈盼有警卫巡视…
That's when you hope and pray there's a guard watching...

237
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,430
所以那一刻不会成为湮灭的往事
so that the moment won't be entirely lost to history.

238
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,170
不过，一段时间之后…
But, hey, after a while,

239
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,230
有几小时，那并不重要
a couple hours, doesn't matter.

240
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,330
只是一场竞赛而已…
Just a contest...

241
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,850
在天籁之音，你自己以及蟑螂之间
between Frank Sinatra, you and the cockroach.

242
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,020
那么谁赢了？
So who won?

243
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,660
而你还以为能凭一小段膝上舞唤醒我
And you thought that you could get a rise out of me with a little lap dance.

244
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,040
膝…膝上舞？
Lap... Lap dance?

245
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,040
那是…
It's, um...

246
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,440
治疗，类似于…臀部的东西
Therapy. Kind of... hippy stuff.

247
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,850
想跳舞吗？
You wanna dance?

248
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,080
来吧，你不反对吧？
Come on. It's okay with you?

249
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,020
当然，这有什么
Yeah, sure. What the hell.

250
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,090
这有什么
What the hell.

251
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,090
♪ Lie to me ♪

252
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,520
♪ And tell me that you'll stay here tonight ♪

253
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,470
♪ Tell me that you'll never leave ♪

254
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,740
象这样子你不担心吗？
Aren't you worried being seen like this?

255
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,780
你才应该担心
You're the one that ought to be worried.

256
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,820
人人都好奇你干嘛…
Everybody wondering what the hell you're doing...

257
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,080
和你的曾曾曾祖父跳舞
dancing with your great-great-great-great grandfather.

258
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,170
我从没和他跳过舞
I never danced with him.

259
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,550
常来这种地方吗？
So, come here often?

260
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,250
小姐，过去五年我每天都会来这
Lady, I've been coming here every day for the last five years.

261
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,190
你呢？
You?

262
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,190
算是常客
Often enough.

263
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,860
为什么不去别处？
Why don't you go someplace else?

264
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,060
这是镇里唯一的别处
It's the only someplace else in town.

265
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,070
换个镇试试
Try a new town.

266
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,880
你们在一起多久了？
How long you guys been goin' together?

267
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,010
不知道，从高中起吧
I don't know. Since high school.

268
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,020
我们是舞会的国王王后
We were king and queen of the prom.

269
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,180
有几点意思，国王，王后
Kind of made sense, you know. King, queen.

270
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,190
几时变得没有意思的？
When did it stop making sense?

271
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,600
♪ Oh, anyone can see ♪

272
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,800

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,950
不赖，看起来你在监狱里经常跳舞
Not bad. Looks like you did a lot of dancing in the joint.

278
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,090
那都是男人，不一样
Those were guys. This is different.

279
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,660
放松点
Ow. Take it easy.

280
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,840
你还好吧？
Are you gonna be all right?

281
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,300
- 嗯？ - 我很好
- Huh?  - I'm okay.

282
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,710
你们都聊些什么？
What were you talking about?

283
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,870
怎么了？你在嫉妒
What? You're jealous.

284
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,880
我干嘛要嫉妒？
Why would I be jealous?

285
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,970
- 你就是在嫉妒  - 不可能
- You are. You're jealous.  - No way.

286
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,480
我是说，看他那副摇摇欲坠的样子
I mean, look at the guy. He's about to keel over.

287
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,480
他去哪了？卡萝
Where'd he go? Carol.

288
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,510
去洗手间看看
Check the men's room.

289
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,960
见鬼
Oh, goddamn it!

290
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,870
他跑了
He's gone.

291
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,870
拿走了车
He took the car.

292
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,630
不，我去叫警察
Oh, no. No, that's it. I'm calling the cops.

293
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,870
- 告诉他们什么？ - 一切
- And tell them what?  - Anything.

294
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,870
一不留神他就坐着轮椅不见了
We turned our backs, he was in the wheelchair, he was gone. I don't know.

295
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,400
是在我和他跳舞之前还是之后呢？
Oh, was that before or after I was seen dancing with him?

296
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,650
你不能叫警察
You can't call the cops.

297
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,420
你怎么能这样？
How could you do this?

298
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,280
是你的主意却得由我来收场
You come up with these ideas and I end up having to go along.

299
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,480
每次有麻烦了收场的是谁？是我
And every time, the shit hits the fan, who's gotta clean it up? Me!

300
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:45,290
现在我们怎么办？怎么办？
What are we gonna do here? What do we do?

301
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,920
我们怎么办？
What do we do, huh?

302
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,930
不知道
I don't know.

303
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,610
我们干嘛不修好“野马”
Why don't we fix the Mustang...

304
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,800
- 然后离开这鬼地方？ - 是的
- and just get the hell out of here?  - Yeah.

305
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,470
- 然后呢？ - 嗯
- And then what?  - Well,

306
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,910
到哪算哪直到找到喜欢的地方
just keep going till we find someplace we like.

307
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,380
知道吗？我就喜欢这里
You know what? I like it here just fine.

308
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,580
我没法早些打来
I couldn't call earlier.

309
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,180
我回头再解释，只管带着钱来找我
I'll explain later. Hey, just come and get me and bring the money.

310
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,150
有个火车站，离六号公路的疗养院大概一英里
There's a train station. It's about a mile from the home on Route 6.

311
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,980
这样好些吗？这样行不行？
Is this better? How's this?

312
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,990
你知道我喜欢那辆车
You know I love that car.

313
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,360
你最好希望他不会丢弃它
You better hope he doesn't trash it.

314
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,330
我不明白你干嘛不上周修好它
I don't see why you couldn't have done this weeks ago.

315
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,330
好吧！好吧
Yeah, yeah.

316
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,860
- 顺利吗？ - 签上去了
- Hey, did it go good?  - Yeah. I signed him in.

317
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,160
- 有人看到你吗？ - 没有
- Anyone see you?  - No.

318
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,920
现在是他们的事了
It's their problem now.

319
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,160
你来了，我正到处找你呢
Oh, there you are. I've been looking all over for you.

320
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,670
我们有个严重的问题
We have a serious problem.

321
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,930
卡萝，你在听吗？
Carol, are you listening?

322
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,670
特洛太太昨晚弄坏了监控器
Mrs. Tetlow vandalized her ankle monitor last night.

323
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,040
我想要你多留意她
I want you to pay special attention to her.

324
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,200
我担心她会伤到自己
I'm concerned. She might be a danger to herself.

325
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,210
好的，好极了
Okay, great.

326
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,980
- 好极了？ - 嗯
- Great?  - Um...

327
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,710
我会留意的，别担心
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

328
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,840
你干嘛回来？
Why did you come back?

329
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,840
与你无关
Nobody's business.

330
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,240
你料到我不会叫警察
You knew I wouldn't call the cops on you,

331
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,900
但不表示我肯定会签你返院
but that doesn't mean I won't sign you up for bingo.

332
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,100
所以…
So...

333
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,410
你干嘛要回来？
Why did you come back?

334
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,240
好吧，我替你说
All right. I'll do it for you.

335
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:46,210
你在摆脱我之后
After making a complete ass of me,

336
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,980
想和什么人联系，但没联系上
you went and called someone, but you couldn't reach them.

337
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,450
不，也许你联系上了，他们会来接你
No. Maybe you did reach them, and they're gonna pick you up here.

338
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,450
你在这比在外面要安全得多…
I mean, you're a lot safer here than you are on the outside...

339
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,180
而且不会惊动警察，是吧？
with the cops looking for you, right?

340
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,120
也有可能…
Or maybe...

341
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,990
你回来是因为不想连累我
you came back because you didn't want to get me in trouble.

342
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,510
“N”四三
"N"43.

343
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,040
啊！
Ah.

344
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,640
你来了，曼宁先生
There you are, Mr. Manning.

345
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,110
- 他是说“B”一三吗？ - 不，亲爱的，是“G”
- Did they say "B" 13?  - No, dear, it was "G."

346
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,640
- 我觉得不是  - 我很确定，亲爱的，是“G”
- I don't think so.  - Oh, I'm quite sure of it, dear. It was "G."

347
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,910
- 我听到是“D”  - 我不想再争下去
- I heard "D."  - I don't want to argue about it anymore.

348
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,580
“G”，为了乔治
"G"for George.

349
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,390
- 你是说“B”一三？ - 要知道我真的不想再争论了
- Did you say "B" 13?  - I really don't want to argue about this, you know.

350
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,890
就是“G”
It was "G."

351
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,360
哦，看啊
Oh, look.

352
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,590
曼宁先生赢了
Mr. Manning has a bingo.

353
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,860
运气真好
Lucky man.

354
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,630
我找不到结婚戒指了
I can't find my weddin' ring.

355
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,370
别担心，亲爱的，会找到的
Oh, don't worry, dear. It'll turn up.

356
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,310
我一直把它藏在同一个地方的
I don't know. And I always hide it in the same place.

357
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,780
- 我肯定会找到的，亲爱的  - 我不知道
- Well, I'm sure it'll turn up, dear.  - I don't know.

358
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,290
- 你不用担心  - 我这些天很健忘
- You mustn't worry.  - I'm so forgetful these days.

359
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,320
- 不  - 我在哪都找不到它
- No.  - I couldn't find it anywhere.

360
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,520
我丢了很多这类东西
I've lost a lot of things like that,

361
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,820
而且我想不出到底是怎么回事
and I just can't figure out what happens to them.

362
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,400
- 哦，老天  - 我来帮你，坚持住
- Oh, my... Oh!  - Let me help you. Hold on a minute.

363
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,490
他的头撞到了地上
He's landed on his head.

364
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,730
- 他没死吧？ - 没，我想只是跌了一下
- Did he croak?  - No. I think he just got a little bit lazy.

365
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,170
他很快就会好的
He'll be all right now.

366
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,570
我只能说你非常幸运
Well, you lucked out. That's all I can say.

367
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,870
“我”非常幸运？不是“我们”吗？
I lucked out? How about we lucked out?

368
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,880
嗯！
Hmm.

369
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,480
你现在不再想离开这了吧？
So now you're just gonna lay off, right?

370
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,710
是不是？
Right?

371
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,730
卡萝，一切又回复了原样
Carol, everything's back where it was.

372
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,230
用不着再没事找事对吧？
Don't screw it up again, okay?

373
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,230
是的
Okay.

374
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,940
嘿！
Hey!

375
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,940
钱带来了吗？
Okay, got the money?

376
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,540
什么意思，你没带？
What do you mean, you didn't bring it?

377
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:24,070
狗娘养的，那你来这干什么？
You son of a bitch! What the hell are you doin' here?

378
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,080
嘿！
Hey!

379
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,190
啊！
Ahh!

380
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,710
嘘！
Shh.

381
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,380
我能帮什么忙吗？
Is there anything I can do?

382
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,540
有，攒够一百万，然后劫持一架飞机
Yeah. Scrape up a million bucks, then hijack a plane.

383
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,810
怎么回事？你的拍档带着你的钱跑了吗？
So what happened? Did your partner run out with your money?

384
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,970
我的拍档早死了
My partner's dead.

385
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,080
我在监狱时他设法和我取得过联系…
Before he went, I was in the slammer, and he got in touch...

386
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,050
他问我想怎么处理我的钱
and asked me what I wanted to do with my money.

387
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,580
我跟他说“让你儿子替我保管”
So I told him, "Let your kid hold it for me."

388
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,220
聪明的小子，我教会他怎么在牌戏中作弊
Cute kid. Taught him how to hustle gin rummy.

389
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,290
知道那小子刚才对我怎么说吗？
You know what that cute kid just told me?

390
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,030
如果我回来或者想干点什么，他会打发我一点
If I come around or try anything, he's gonna drop a dime.

391
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,000
我累坏了
Man, am I beat.

392
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,850
早上尽量别弄出声音
Try not to make noise in the morning.

393
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,350
你今天休息不是吗？
It's your day off, right?

394
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,580
是啊，可基蒂在搬家，我说过要帮她
Yeah, but Kitty's moving. I told her I'd help her.

395
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,990
那个吸血鬼
Well, that sucks.

396
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,850
我知道，可我欠她人情
I know, but I owe her a favor.

397
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,860
不能置之不理
I can't get out of it now.

398
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,820
你要戒烟？
Are you quitting?

399
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,230
想试试
Gonna try.

400
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,770
我看不懂这些说明
I can't understand these instructions.

401
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,690
亲爱的，我正在看这个
Honey, I'm trying to read this.

402
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,830
嘿，卡萝
Hey, Carol.

403
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,830
待会我要回来
I thought I'd come back later,

404
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,460
- 可以用我的大摩托载你一程  - 谢谢，卡尔
- give you a ride on my hog.  - That's good, Karl.

405
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,340
不过你的车我觉得称之为小摩托更恰当
But if you're gonna compare your crank to a bike, you should get a scooter.

406
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,180
我看不下去了
I can't look.

407
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,880
哦，亲爱的
Oh, dear.

408
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,180
我的天
Oh, my God.

409
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,880
没事，他爬起来了
It's okay. He's getting up.

410
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,320
坚持住
Hold on a minute.

411
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,330
不，他倒下了
No, he's out.

412
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,230
他会需要一个好牙医
He's gonna need a good dentist.

413
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,870
太过关心不是好事
It's a matter of getting too attached.

414
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,670
我知道，可他不象别人有亲人
I know, but it's just that he doesn't have family like the others.

415
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,870
我明白，但会很麻烦…
I understand, but it'll be that much harder...

416
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,240
当他们把他转回监狱医院时
when they transfer him back to a prison hospital.

417
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,510
什么时候？
When?

418
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,550
他们答应尽快安排床位
They promised me there'll be a bed opening up soon.

419
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,850
看你的样子我们是在去什么地方
You look like we're going someplace.

420
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,760
是个惊喜
It's a surprise.

421
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,390
- 那是戒烟贴吗？ - 嗯
- Is that a nicotine patch?  - Mm-hmm.

422
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,800
我可不想你再拿自己当烟灰缸
I didn't want you using yourself as an ashtray again.

423
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,740
谢谢
Thanks.

424
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,350
到了
Here you go.

425
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:18,940
到了
Here you go.

426
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,550
- 短暂的逃脱  - 我不需要旅行散心
- Nice little getaway for you.  - I don't need a round trip.

427
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,590
有家银行
A bank.

428
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,970
谢谢
Thanks.

429
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,800
觉得怎么样？
So what do you think?

430
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,400
- 我该点薄烤饼的  - 我是指银行
- I should've ordered pancakes.  - I mean about the bank.

431
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,770
他们赠送免费烤面包机
What, they're giving away free toaster ovens.

432
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,720
你能想象哪种傻瓜…
Can you imagine what kind of moron it takes...

433
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,810
会为了免费烤面包机而去银行开户？
to open a bank account in order to get a free toaster oven?

434
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,790
- 你觉得我们能得手吗？ - 你说什么？
- Think we could knock that place off?  - Beg your pardon?

435
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,290
你觉得我们能得手吗？
Do you think we could knock that place off?

436
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,130
- 谁？ - 你和我
- Who?  - You and me.

437
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,500
亲爱的，我扮的是脑死亡而不是脑损伤
Honey, I am playing brain-dead, not brain-damaged.

438
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:17,590
说说看，你怎么能要求你照顾的死人…
Tell me, how can you go from just taking care of dead people...

439
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,600
听到这些话？
to what I'm listening to now?

440
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,870
- 是你说我该换个环境  - 什么时候？
- You're the one who said I needed a new town.  - When?

441
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,910
跳舞的时候…
When we were dancing...

442
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:29,000
你还说我和韦恩之间已经没有意义了
and you said me and Wayne didn't make sense anymore.

443
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,530
你想通过抢银行来挽救婚姻？干嘛不去找牧师？
You wanna save your marriage by robbing a bank. Why don't you go see a priest?

444
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,340
- 我不是这意思  - 那是什么意思？
- That's not what I'm saying.  - What are you saying?

445
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,510
我是说…
I'm saying...

446
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,620
我总会有老到动不了的一天
I'm gonna wake up one morning wearing diapers,

447
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,630
生活无法自理
sucking lime Jell-O through a straw,

448
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,630
我想知道我人生的去向
and I'm gonna wonder where my life went.

449
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,290
在这方面我才是个死人
I'm the one who's dead here.

450
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,140
我得…做点什么
I gotta... do something.

451
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,070
坚持跳膝上舞
Stick to lap dancing.

452
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,580
这儿没什么事吧？
Is everything okay here?

453
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,590
这儿没什么事
Yeah, everything's okay here.

454
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,020
外面就难说了
I'm not so sure about out there.

455
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,590
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hi.  - Hi.

456
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,590
我想要台烤面包机
Um, I want a toaster oven.

457
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,430
好极了，我们来办一个开户申请
Great. Let's just get you a new-account application.

458
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,870
不，我不想开新帐户
Oh, no, no. I don't want to open a new account.

459
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,870
我只想要烤面包机
I just want a toaster oven.

460
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,880
是这样的
Oh, well, that's the thing, see.

461
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,430
你得先开个新帐户，最低限度五百美元
First, you have to open up a new account, $500 minimum,

462
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,880
然后才能拿到烤面包机
and then you get a toaster oven.

463
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,610
“华维尔”
"Farwell."

464
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,620
- 能叫你华维尔吗？ - 当然
- Can I call you Farwell?  - Please.

465
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,620
你知道吗？
You know something?

466
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,880
- 我曾经是舞会皇后  - 是吗？
- I used to be the prom queen.  - Really?

467
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,780
- 我一点不奇怪  - 但可悲的是…
- I'm not surprised.  - But the sad fact is,

468
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,220
“舞会皇后”并不是终身保障
prom queen, it doesn't really prepare you for much in life.

469
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,220
从那之后就每况愈下
It's been kind of downhill ever since.

470
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,090
我不是在诉苦，我是说我已经风光不再
I'm not saying I'm bitter. I'm just saying that I don't have much time.

471
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,260
现在只有一样东西能恢复我对自己的良好感觉
And there's only one thing that's gonna make me feel good about myself again.

472
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,260
烤面包机
Toast.

473
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,060
我感觉有点糊涂了
Uh, I'm afraid I don't understand.

474
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,570
- 那就给我一台烤面包机  - 抱歉，我…
- Then give me a toaster oven.  - Sorry, ma'am, l...

475
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,860
我不想给你找不痛快，华维尔
I don't wanna have to get ugly on you, Farwell.

476
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,190
快走
Hurry.

477
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,420
老天，我需要来支烟
God, I need a cigarette.

478
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,430
想知道说明书的内容吗？
Wonder if they have this in black?

479
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,890
“马铃薯，四百五十度烘烤四十五分钟”
"Baked potatoes, 450 degrees for 45 minutes."

480
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,260
你就是这样打银行主意的？
That's your idea of a bank job, huh?

481
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,600
“中等罐装糕饼…”
"Cakes in medium tins..."

482
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,470
你晃晃胸脯就弄到了一台烤面包机
Hey, you flashed your knockers, you got a toaster.

483
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,440
“三百五十度烘烤三十分钟”
"350 degrees for 30 minutes."

484
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,270
要是脱掉裤子也许能弄台铸铁炉
If you'd have dropped your panties, you might have got a cast-iron stove.

485
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,930
“解冻后的糕饼…”
"And defrosted pastries..."

486
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,340
没准是一整套厨具，我的天
Who knows? A whole kitchen, for Christ's sake.

487
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,600
“三百二十五度，十五分钟”
"15 minutes at 325."

488
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,120
怎么了
Excuse me.

489
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,690
你兴奋过头了
You're up.

490
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,630
这大概就是你那见鬼的银行抢劫
Here's what I think of your goddamn bank robbery.

491
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,460
这上面说它不能用水浸泡
It says you're not supposed to immerse it in water.

492
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,140
你没认真听我说
Hey, you ain't listenin'.

493
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:49,880
我说的是，不管看起来多容易，总会有工作要做
What I'm sayin' is, however easy it looks, you got a job to do.

494
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,520
什么意思？
Meaning?

495
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,520
要做好功课
Do your homework.

496
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,490
啊！
Ah.

497
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,920
嘿！
Hey.

498
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,120
搬家的事怎么样？
Hey. How was the move?

499
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,130
累得要死
It was a pain in the ass.

500
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,090
小心把衣服弄脏
Hey, you know what? You're gonna get grease on your clothes.

501
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,940
- 出了什么事吗？ - 没有
- Something wrong?  - No.

502
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,490
你应该看看，他们就象采集花粉的蜜蜂
You should've seen it. They looked like bees coming to gather up pollen,

503
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,560
我跟着他们找到了蜂房
so I followed them back to the hive.

504
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,570
一个存放处，银行的银行的所在地
A depository, Henry, where the banks bank.

505
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,040
方圆一百英里只此一家
The only one around for a hundred miles.

506
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,670
有很多的蜂蜜，亲爱的
That's a lot of honey, honey.

507
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,730
功课做得还行吗？
How's that for homework?

508
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,120
钱的数目和难度是成正比的
Good on the money, not so good on the choice.

509
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:45,880
五年前两个人也许行，现在则需要一支军队
Five years ago, maybe, but today you'd need an army.

510
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,620
可以在送达之前袭击押款车
We hit the armored car, get the money before it gets in.

511
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,680
我肯定快疯了
I must be goin' nuts.

512
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,660
- 就两个人而言还是会很困难  - 嗯
- It'd be tough with two.  - Hmm.

513
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,190
亲爱的，是我，我还在基蒂这儿
Hi,honey, it's me. I'm still with Kitty.

514
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,830
我会晚点回家，好吗？
Um, I'll be home a little later, okay?

515
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,270
哇哦！
Whoa! Whoa!

516
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,270
韦恩，你这是要去哪？
Hey, Wayne, where do you think you're going?

517
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,180
- 你没事吧，伙计？ - 没事
- You all right there, buddy?  - Yep.

518
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,180
只是问问
Just checking.

519
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,480
顺便提醒那边有个停车标志
By the way, that was a stop sign back there.

520
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,600
是吗？
Oh, yeah?

521
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:37,360
- 代我向卡萝问好  - 好的
- Okay. Say hi to Carol.  - Yep.

522
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,280
- 嗨！ - 嗨，基蒂
- Hi.  - Hi, Kitty.

523
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,560
你好
Lady.

524
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,200
我已经受够了
I've had enough of this.

525
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,900
艾玛，替我照看一下狄娅娜
Irma, take Diane for me for a minute.

526
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,910
- 不  - 我会还你个人情
- No!  - Please? I'll owe you one.

527
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,910
- 真的？ - 去吧
- One?  - Just do it.

528
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,580
见鬼
Come on.

529
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,350
韦恩，我们要干什么？
Wayne, what are we doin'?

530
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,580
我倒想知道你想对我老婆干什么
I'd like to know what you think you're doing with my wife.

531
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,990
离她远点，不然我要你好看
You stay away from her. I'll clean your clock.

532
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,550
从现在起，你要是知趣的话，她给你的只有药
From now on, if you know what's good for you, she gives you your medicine,

533
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,390
从你这拿走的只有体温计，就这些
she takes your temperature and that's it.

534
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,990
韦恩，你想干嘛？你不能在这乱来
Wayne, what are you doing? What are you doing? You can't do this here!

535
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,030
我想怎样就能怎样
Why not? I can do whatever the hell I want!

536
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,500
- 你会把一切都搞砸  - 我会把一切搞砸？
- Shh! You're gonna blow everything.  - I'm gonna blow everything?

537
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,970
你们那天在车上是怎么回事？
What about you, the other day in your damn car?

538
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,700
- 别想撒谎，我看到你们了  - 嘘！
- Don't bother lying. I saw you.  - Shh!

539
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,700
我们得谈谈
We have to talk.

540
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,540
事情不是你想的那样
It's not what you think, if that's what you're thinking.

541
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,740
- 你倒说说看  - 好吧
- Tell me about it.  - Okay.

542
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:19,250
- 我们在一起办事  - 你说什么？
- We're working together.  - What are you talking about?

543
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,310
我们在一起干一件事
We're doing a job together.

544
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,380
- 什么事？ - 一件银行的事
- What job?  - A bank job.

545
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,760
你指望我能相信这话？
You expect me to believe that?

546
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,920
- 当然  - 你是说你并不想勾搭这老家伙
- Yes.  - Okay, so you don't want to screw the old guy.

547
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,930
只是想和他去抢银行
You just want to rob a bank with him.

548
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,400
不，是抢押款车
No. It's just an armored car.

549
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,430
哦，只是辆装有钢板…
Oh. Just one of those steel-plated trucks,

550
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,520
防弹玻璃，里边有人拿着枪的车子？
bulletproof glass, a couple guys inside with shotguns, Carol?

551
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,230
事实上我们就是因此才想要你加入
That's exactly why we were gonna ask you to do it with us,

552
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,570
- 但你没给过我们机会  - “我们”？你什么意思？“我们”？
- but you didn't give us a chance.  - Us? What do you mean, us?

553
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,370
- 我和亨利  - 卡萝，我们才是我们，他是他
- Me and Henry.  - Carol, we're us. He's just him.

554
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,040
- 亲爱的…  - 我要告诉那杂种…
- Honey...  - I'm gonna tell that son of a bitch...

555
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,300
不，这是我的主意
No! It was my idea.

556
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,180
是吗？在他来之前你可从没想过要抢银行
Yeah? Well, you never wanted to rob a bank until he came along.

557
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,730
- 亨利，你来这干嘛？ - 看好病人…
- Henry, what are you doing here?  - How am I gonna run the sprinklers...

558
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,420
- 你这样让我怎么工作？ - 我不知道，妈的
- when you leave your people all over the place?  - I don't know. Shoot!

559
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,430
谢谢，伙计
Thanks, man.

560
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:26,160
我就猜到你会来这
Figured you'd be here.

561
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,070
- 为什么你不能只是个购物狂呢？ - 回家吧
- How come you couldn't just be a compulsive shopper?  - Let's go home.

562
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,040
- 那我还能应付  - 回家吧
- I can deal with that.  - Let's go home.

563
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,180
看着点
Watch it.

564
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,720
知道我得出的结论吗？
You know the conclusion I've come to?

565
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,550
我的想法无足轻重
It doesn't matter what I think.

566
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,080
而你想到了什么你就非做不可
You get something in your head, you're gonna do it.

567
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,090
没错吧？
Right?

568
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,660
我该怎么做？把你捆在树上…
What am I gonna do, tie you to a tree or...

569
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:57,900
还是等你想明白了自己放弃？
have you put away till you get your head straightened out?

570
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,870
告诉你我会怎么做
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

571
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,030
我要加入你们
I'm gonna do it with you.

572
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:07,840
真的？
You are?

573
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,180
一点不错，真的
You're damn right, I am.

574
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:13,310
- 太好了，正好…  - 不，等等
- That's great. That's exactly...  - No, no. Hold on.

575
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,320
不是因为你要求我才加入
I'm not doing it 'cause you want me to.

576
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,820
而是因为我想干，懂吗？
I'm doing it 'cause I want to, okay?

577
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,910
还有，如果我加入，你要听我的而不是他的
And another thing. If I'm in, you listen to me, not him.

578
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:23,390
还有…
And...

579
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,050
事情过后
After this,

580
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,180
我们就要恢复原样，行吗？
we can go back to normal, right?

581
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,520
不能有下一回
No... No more robberies.

582
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,530
你同意吗？
You got it?

583
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,560
同意
Got it.

584
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:37,060
你说过可以加一个人
You said we could use a third.

585
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:41,230
没有，我是说两个人干会很困难
No, I didn't. I said it would be tough with two.

586
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,240
你没见过他打橄榄球
You should've seen him on the football field.

587
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,540
他很有控制能力
He was so clutch.

588
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,550
也很理智
He always kept his head.

589
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,840
他昨天就失去理智了
He didn't keep his head yesterday.

590
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,080
有什么奇怪？他看到我们一起在车上
What did you expect? He saw us in the car together.

591
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,050
我骗了他，他当然会光火
I lied to him. Of course he went nuts.

592
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,050
如果反过来呢？
I mean, what if it were reversed?

593
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,350
如果换了你是他的话？
What if it were you and me?

594
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,450
你会把他在轮椅上撂倒…
You would've flattened him right in his wheelchair...

595
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,190
在电视室当着所有小老太太的面
in the TV room, in front of all the little old ladies.

596
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,320
你该相信他的自控能力
You should give Wayne some credit for self-control.

597
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:10,230
- 嘿，别再说了  - 那好
- Hey, don't push it.  - Okay.

598
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,200
这样吧，要么他加入要么我退出
Try this. Either he's in or I'm out.

599
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:16,630
真是外行当家
Ohh! Amateur hour.

600
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:21,430
要是有人跟我说，一对半吊子夫妻作主…
If anybody had ever told me a husband and wife amateur hour...

601
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,840
先说好了，如果有任何闪失，我会掉头就走
But one thing clear. If anything goes sour, I'm gone.

602
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:28,840
我会瞅准机会抢些零钱
I will take my chances, rifle the soda machine,

603
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,250
跳上该死的计程车，明白吗？
take a goddamn cab, you got that?

604
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,250
明白
Got it.

605
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,040
加油站
Gas station.

606
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,470
R.B超市
Oh, Rite Buy supermarket.

607
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,770
十五条结帐通道，二十四小时营业
Fifteen checkout lanes, open twenty-four hours a day.

608
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,370
你算算看
You do the math.

609
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,710
加油站
Gas station.

610
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,780
下一家归我
Oh, this next one's mine.

611
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,440
是那家体育酒吧，他们有所有的体育频道
That's that sports bar where they got all the sports channels.

612
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,210
没错，可没人会在那花一分钱
Yeah, but nobody spends any money in there.

613
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,290
至少它不是加油站
Hey, well, at least it's not a gas station.

614
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,200
加油要付现金，亲爱的，这主意不赖
People pay cash for gas, honey. It's a good idea.

615
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:29,600
拍得不错，两位，但你们弄错了
Hey, it's a nice show, guys, but you got it backwards.

616
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:34,000
要抢的不是押运线路，而是抢押运队
You don't rob the route. You rob the crew.

617
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,060
一旦看到押送员…
When you see a pair of Boy Scouts...

618
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,370
巡视时手不离枪套，就离远点
marching around with their hands in their holsters, just stay away.

619
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,570
你们要找的是真正的笨蛋
What you're looking for is a couple of real oafs.

620
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,610
嘿，宝贝，你好吗？
Hey, baby, how you doin'?

621
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,150
嗨！
Hi.

622
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,510
看到没？她冲我笑呢
You see that? She smiled at me.

623
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,310
告诉你，女人都离不了我
I'm tellin'ya, women never leave me alone.

624
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,320
你是说他们都离开了押款车？
You mean they were both out of the truck?

625
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:01,120
发财了
Bingo.

626
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:03,410
- 在移交结束时下手
So we hit these guys at the end of their shift,

627
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,360
- 是最佳时机对吧？ - 不
- we're golden, right?  - No.

628
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,090
但这计划很完美，那是些白痴
But it's perfect. These guys are idiots.

629
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,150
他们运送的钱越多，拔枪的速度就越快
The more money they're carrying, the quicker their fingers will be on the trigger.

630
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,170
在接运开始前动手
We take it with the beginning of the shift,

631
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,770
- 他们的警惕性会较低  - 可车上也是空的
- when they're really not paying attention.  - Truck's gonna be empty.

632
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,310
然后我们能取而代之不是吗？
We have our work cut out for us then, don't we?

633
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,700
我想我们应该…
I think we should...

634
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,810
为女士们安排一次野餐
have a little picnic for the ladies.

635
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,720
这样我们接你出去时就顺理成章
So the times we took you out won't seem so suspicious.

636
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:36,120
- 全中  - 我也全程参与，行吗？
- Bingo too.  - Uh, I'm gonna sit this one out, okay?

637
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,620
哇哦！
Whoo!

638
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,330
九点九分
9.9!

639
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,730
- 九分  - 五分
- Nine.  - Five.

640
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,230
- 嗯？ - 你没有保持双腿并拢
- Huh?  - You didn't keep your feet together!

641
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,730
- 我有  - 你肯定没有
- I did too!  - You certainly did not!

642
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,000
不，我有
Yes, I did!

643
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,470
化妆道具，胶带，都写在单子上了
Makeup stuff, duct tape. It's all on the list.

644
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,140
你去找一个叫刘易斯的
I want you to get in touch with a guy by the name of Lewis.

645
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,310
是我的朋友
He's a friend of mine.

646
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:13,980
- 好的  - 由他去弄枪，电话在上边
- Okay.  - He'll get the gun guys. Number is right there. That's it.

647
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,520
嘿，韦恩
Hey, Wayne.

648
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:23,520
和他们打交道要镇定
Be cool with these guys, huh?

649
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,860
我明白
I got it.

650
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,960
要看着他们的眼睛
Look 'em in the eye,

651
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:30,230
但不象是为了记住他们的相貌
but not like you're gonna remember their faces.

652
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,230
你觉得能做到吗？
You think you can do that?

653
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,770
没问题
No problem.

654
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,770
你肯定就是在这？
Are you sure this is the place?

655
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,790
他是这么说的
Yeah. That's what he told me.

656
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,530
你准备好了？
Are you up for this?

657
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,190
当然，我能应付
Hmm? Oh, yeah. I can handle it.

658
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,200
这样行吗？
How's this?

659
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,290
眼不要眯那么厉害
Don't squint so much.

660
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,300
好的
Right, okay.

661
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,490
钥匙留在点火器上，关好门
Leave the key in the ignition. Lock the door.

662
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,540
嘿！
Hey.

663
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,760
- 小心点  - 我会的
- Be careful.  - I will.

664
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,840
要来支烟吗？
Got a cigarette?

665
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,510
我戒了
Uh, I quit.

666
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:35,420
钱带来了吗？
You got the money?

667
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:37,780
哦，是的，嗯…
Oh, yeah. Um...

668
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,300
- 走吧  - 去哪？
- Well, let's go.  - Where to?

669
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:50,400
你到底想不想交易？
You don't really wanna do this now, do ya?

670
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,440
不…我是说，是的
No... I mean, yeah.

671
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,440
- 那走吧  - 走吧
- Let's just do it.  - All right, come on. Let's go.

672
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,350
哦，上帝
Oh, my God.

673
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,480
老天
Jesus!

674
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,790
交易完了，走吧
It's a done deal. Let's go.

675
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,290
要我说韦恩干得很不错
I'm supposed to tell you Wayne did fine.

676
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,640
我听说了，他差点没弄脏裤子
The way I heard it, he just barely didn't soil his shorts.

677
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,340
- 对，可他毕竟控制住了  - 哦
- Yeah, well, he's still clutch.  - Ah.

678
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,010
- 周一晚查过房后见  - 就这样？
- See you Monday night after bed check.  - That's it?

679
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,550
对，就这样
Yeah, that's it.

680
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,810
我猜也就这样了
I guess that's it.

681
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,420
- 嘿  - 嘿！
- Hey.  - Hey.

682
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,480
偷来的车
Grand theft auto.

683
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,190
现在我们真正走上邪道了
We are now officially on the wrong path.

684
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,330
- 我们得做准备了  - 就一会
- We have to get ready.  - Just a second.

685
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,200
啊！
Ah!

686
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,410
大家感觉怎么样？
So, how is everybody?

687
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,500
很好，很好
Pretty good. Uh, pretty good.

688
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,440
你干什么？
What are you doing?

689
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,150
你不想看看她怎么样吗？
You gonna see if she's okay?

690
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,980
噢
Oh.

691
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,990
也许我…
Oh, yeah. Maybe I, uh...

692
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,820
亲爱的？
Honey?

693
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,400
见鬼的戒烟贴
Goddamn nicotine patches.

694
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:03,340
继续上路
Let's get going.

695
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,340
我得在五小时内回到床上
In five hours, I gotta be back in my little bed.

696
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:11,340
- 只要放上花生黄油就行  - 它们会上钩？
- You put a little peanut butter on the trap, that's all.  - And they go for it?

697
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,010
- 它们知道奶酪…  - 别乱动
- Cheese they know about 'cause...  - Drop everything.

698
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,010
手放到车上
Hands on the truck.

699
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,810
照他说的做，去车上把门打开
You heard the man. Get in the van. Get that door open.

700
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,330
走吧
Let's go.

701
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,360
上去
Go on. Get up.

702
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,280
- 进展顺利  - 很好，我们得保持进度
- Right on schedule.  - Good. We gotta stay that way.

703
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,450
一旦延后就大事不妙了
We get behind, the alarms start popping.

704
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,350
早，我们是钱伯斯递运服务公司
Good morning. This is Chambers Courier Service.

705
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:12,220
通常为你们服务的押款车出了机械故障
We're experiencing some mechanical problems with your usual truck.

706
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,560
我们会按预定时间另外派人来接收
We're gonna reroute another crew to make your scheduled pickup.

707
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,890
我们会在马克市场作好准备
We're all set at the Max Mart.

708
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,900
我们将在九分钟内赶到
We've gotta be there in nine minutes.

709
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,600
掉个头，我很快就回来
Turn her around. I won't be long.

710
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,720
有辆该死的警车
There's a damn cop car out here.

711
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:46,180
我们怎么办？
What do we do?

712
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:50,490
- 他们肯定在里面  - 只管到前面等着
- They must be inside.  - Just go in front and wait, I guess.

713
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,760
你以前是警察？
You an ex-cop?

714
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,860
我管过食品安全
I used to be in food security.

715
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:00,560
象细菌，蛋白质保护功能之类的
You know, bacterial stuff, protein protection.

716
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,930
我小弟弟在马里兰当过警察
My kid brother used to be a trooper in Maryland.

717
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,840
- 那是个好地方  - 对，那儿不错
- Nice state, Maryland.  - Yeah, it's a nice state.

718
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:09,170
回见，伙计们，我还得忙
I'll see you guys. Boy, I got a long night.

719
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:14,910
嘿，你认识一个叫费萨诺的司机吗？
Hey! You know a guy named Fassano, drives for Trusty?

720
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,510
费萨诺
Fassano.

721
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,410
- 我认识的叫帕萨诺  - 不是他
- Passano. I know a Passano.  - Not him.

722
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:30,250
他是个好人，是我的同事
No, no. He is a good guy. He's a member of my flock.

723
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:33,630
要知道白天我得去教堂
You see, my day job, I got this church.

724
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,640
问你们点事
Let me ask you guys something.

725
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,810
你们有没有蒙受神恩？
Are you guys in a state of grace?

726
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,740
- 神恩？ - 对
- Grace?  - Yeah.

727
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:51,180
你们是在与主同行，还是觉得有可能…
Are you running parallel with the Lord right now, or do you think maybe,

728
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:54,540
有可能你们已经误入歧途？
just maybe you're runnin' down a wrong-way street?

729
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,880
是在叫我们吗？
Is that our radio?

730
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,110
- 对，应该是  - 我们得走了
- Yeah, I think so.  - Gotta go.

731
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:03,380
祝你愉快，小心点
Have a good night. Take care.

732
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,390
彼此
Peace.

733
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,840
我们晚了三分钟
We're three minutes behind.

734
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,110
我是钱伯斯递运的狄娜
Hi, this is Deena at Chambers Courier.

735
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:33,170
通常前往你处接运的人员出了些状况
The guys who normally pick you up,

736
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,690
我们已经另外派人过来
We're sending a couple of new guys over.

737
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:40,690
他们在体育场等我们，大概要到音乐会结束之后
Hey, guys, they're ready for us at the stadium. Guess the concert's over.

738
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,230
我还行吗？
Am I good?

739
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,930
还行
You're good.

740
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,440
- 你好  - 坐好了吗？ - 走吧
- Hiya. Good.  - How's it going? Good.

741
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:30,030
- 谢谢各位  - 不客气
- Thank you, guys.  - You're welcome.

742
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,070
好了，我们走
Okay, sweetie, let's hit the road.

743
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,590
一万两千个座位，每座三十块，一共三十六万
Okay, 12,000 seats, 30 bucks a seat, 360 grand.

744
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,900
外加其他消费六万
Plus your beer or whatnot. Add another 60.

745
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,170
总计四十二万
420 thou, exactly.

746
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,640
没错，花四十二万来看什么？
That's right. 420,000. And for what?

747
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:50,440
两个人拿着麦克风乱蹦乱跳，念念有词
The two of them bouncing around with a microphone, talking. Talking!

748
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,840
- 那也叫音乐？ - 不，不
- Is that music? Huh?  - No. No!

749
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,180
我英语不行，但写的东西也比那要好
I flunked English, but I can write better stuff than that.

750
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,240
懂我意思吗？另一个傻瓜则在刮唱片
You know what I'm sayin'? Then they got this other bozo up there scratching records.

751
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:03,350
一晚四十二万就为了看这些
That's it. 420 thou for one night.

752
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:07,730
你要挣四十二万得花多长时间？算算看
How long would it take you to make 420 grand, huh? Figure it out.

753
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,860
不知道，五乘五，是二…
I don't know. Five times five, carry your two...

754
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:14,890
是二十年，如果你资历够深的话
Twenty years, that's how long, if you've got seniority.

755
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,910
想知道更让人沮丧的是什么吗？
But you wanna know what makes it worse?

756
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,910
想知道吗？
You wanna know?

757
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,500
他们每晚都能挣那么多
They make that much every night out.

758
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:24,510
没错
Yep.

759
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,810
看看那
Look at that.

760
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,610
- 没人会说人生就是一碗樱桃  - 是啊
- Well, nobody said life was a bowl of cherries.  - Yeah.

761
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,120
哇！
Wow.

762
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:37,410
- 晚安  - 晚安
- Yeah. Good night.  - Nightie-night.

763
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:40,720
我是“钱伯斯递运”的狄娜

764
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,920
我们今天晚了一点
We're running a little bit late today.

765
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:47,360
我们在这条线路上安排是新面孔
Yeah, we've got some new guys on the route.

766
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:50,090
原因我们已经说过
Yeah, you know how it is.

767
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,740
哟!
Yo!

768
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:05,610
- 新来的？ - 对，你是肯尼？
- You're new?  - That's me. You Kenny?

769
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,650
对，肯尼二世
Mm-hmm. Kenny Jr.

770
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,280
哦，是家族生意对吧？
Oh. It's a family business, huh?

771
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,450
对，我们是他妹妹
Yeah, we're his sisters.

772
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,850
不要提我妹妹
Don't be talking about my sister.

773
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,950
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

774
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,220
你们糟了，他去跟妈妈告状了
You in a lot of trouble. He gonna tell his mommy.

775
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:29,160
待会想跟我去转转吗？
Y'all gonna be around when I get off?

776
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:33,170
带着几口袋的钱，要我们去哪都行
Um, bring a couple bags of money, we'll be wherever you want us to be.

777
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:36,760
一言为定，一个钟头后见
You got yourself a deal. About an hour.

778
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:41,910
我是钱伯斯递运的狄娜，早上好
Hi, this is Deena at Chambers Courier. Good morning.

779
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:45,680
对，是钱伯斯递运公司，我们今天晚了一点
Yes, this is Chambers Courier Service. We're running a little bit late today.

780
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:49,410
通常来你处接运的车辆出了点状况
The guys who normally pick you up, well, they threw a rod over at the AM-PM.

781
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:51,510
我们要另外派人来接运
We're gonna reroute another crew to make your scheduled pickup.

782
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:55,280
我们已经另派了一组人过来，谢谢
We're sending a couple of new guys over. That's right. Great. Thanks. Thank you.

783
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,860
最后一站
Last stop coming up.

784
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:04,920
- 时间  - 差不多刚刚好
- Time.  - We're just about caught up.

785
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:30,180
跟我三天前来时不一样，当时大门没关
This isn't how it was three days ago when I was here. The gate wasn't closed.

786
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:33,490
- 也许我们该放弃这一家  - 掉头离去吗？
- Maybe we should forget about this one.  - Make a U-turn?

787
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,320
警卫会马上报警，开进去
The guard'll be on the phone to the dispatcher right away. Go on in.

788
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,930
- 你好吗？ - 还不赖
- How're you doin'?  - Not bad.

789
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,570
可真不少
Big haul.

790
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,240
是啊
Yeah.

791
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,150
- 请你在这上边签个字  - 好的，先生
- Why don't you just put your John Hancock on this.  - All right, sir.

792
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,410
那箱子通不过传送槽，它太大了
That box won't fit in the chute. It's too big.

793
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,420
老天
Oh, man.

794
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:18,750
你得打开门搬上去
You load it up in the back of the truck.

795
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:23,760
- 那不合规定  - 我们得想点办法
- That's against regulation.  - We have to do something.

796
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,300
- 是啊，但现在都这样干  - 嗯
- Yeah, but that's the way we do it now.  - Uh-huh.

797
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:32,260
我是新来的，他们什么都没告诉我
Well, I'm new on this run, and they don't tell me nothin'.

798
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:35,310
- 你可以打个电话证实一下  - 不用
- Why don't you give a buzz and clear it up?  - No!

799
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:38,140
好吧，我…
That's okay. L...

800
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:41,180
- 来…  - 不，我来吧
- Here...  - No, I got it.

801
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:44,440
- 老天  - 我知道会派新面孔来
- Oh, man.  - Told me they were sending in a new guy,

802
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,680
可你看起来干过这行
but you look like you've been doin' this a while.

803
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:50,050
- 见鬼  - 我已经退休了
- Oh, man.  - I'm ready for retirement.

804
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,880
- 不能让他看到你  - 我知道
- You can't let him see you.  - I know.

805
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,920
没人会雇用超过五十岁的人
But nobody's gonna hire you over 50.

806
01:04:55,990 --> 01:05:00,520
问题是，大家没意识到五十岁出头…
The thing is, what people don't realize is after 50...

807
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:03,620
是雇员的最佳年龄
is the best time to hire a man.

808
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:08,430
有养老保障，升职加薪都毋须考虑他们
His oats are sown, all the hell-raising is out of his system.

809
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:24,480
Hey. What is that? Is that a phone?
什么声音？是电话响吗？

810
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,710
你最好去接一下
You better get that.

811
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,810
- 我敢说是你的老婆子  - 你看…
- I bet you that's your old lady.  - Yeah, look...

812
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,910
你能应付这个吗？
You gonna be all right with this?

813
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,890
- 没问题  - 我很快就来
- Oh, you bet.  - I'll be right back.

814
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,130
嗨，我是钱伯斯递运的狄娜
Hi, this is Deena from Chambers Courier again.

815
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,170
电话里说是你的老婆子
Hey, the dispatcher says it's your old lady.

816
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,870
她要你带点牛奶回去
She wants you to pick up some milk.

817
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,940
我在哪她都能找到
She can find me anyplace.

818
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,010
没错，祝你愉快
Yeah, look, have a nice day.

819
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,420
太酷了，真他妈的酷
That was so cool. Damn, was that cool.

820
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:18,990
我是说，真他妈的酷
I mean, that was so damn cool. Damn.

821
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:23,160
- 一点不错  - 没错，正是如此
- You nailed it.  - That's right. All the way.

822
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:50,950
我有个朋友住在弗罗里达，是养赛狗的
I had this buddy down in Florida, bred greyhounds.

823
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:52,960
他有条小狗
He had this one pup.

824
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,930
这种狗肯定要跑得越快越好
Dog just finally went faster and faster and faster.

825
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,560
有天晚上在直道上
And one night on the backstretch,

826
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,970
那条狗逮到一只机器兔子
that dog caught up with a mechanical rabbit.

827
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:08,170
咬了一嘴金属，二百二十伏的电压，一下就被击倒
Took a mouthful of metal, 220 volts and dropped like a stone.

828
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:14,980
它得到了想要的，但结果却让它大失所望
Well, I guess he got what he wanted, but it sure wasn't what he expected.

829
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:17,040
它逮到了兔子是吧？
He caught the rabbit, didn't he?

830
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:21,140
- 对，它逮到了兔子  - 真是令人沮丧
- Oh, yeah, he got the rabbit.  - What a bummer.

831
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,910
想象一下，那一刻…等等
Just imagine. The moment... Wait a minute.

832
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,590
活见鬼
What the hell.

833
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:37,430
不，不，是怎么回事？
Oh, no. No! How did this happen?

834
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:41,090
他们都被我捆住了，捆得很紧
I tied 'em up. That's all I know. I tied 'em up good.

835
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:43,740
- 不，我的天  - 韦恩
- Oh, no. Man.  - Wayne!

836
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,500
- 你去哪？ - 我得去找他们
- Where are you going?  - Well, I gotta look for them.

837
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:50,530
得了，浪费时间，他们可能在任何地方
Aw, come on. Waste of time. They could be anywhere.

838
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:52,670
最近的公路有多远？
How far is the nearest road?

839
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,840
八九英里，你该知道
I don't know. Eight or nine miles. You rode in with me. You tell me.

840
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,580
幸运的话，我们还有一个钟头，把东西卸下来
If we're lucky, we got an hour before they get to a phone. Let's get this thing unloaded.

841
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,420
我明明把他们捆得很紧
I tied 'em up. I tied 'em up good.

842
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,890
这是你的吗？
Is this yours?

843
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,270
我们先离开这
Let's get out of these outfits.

844
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,060
找东西装好袋子转到“野马”车上
Grab the bags with the big stuff. Transfer them in the Mustang.

845
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,610
把我送到疗养院然后把钱藏好，韦恩
Drop me off at the home and then stash the dough at your place. Wayne.

846
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:49,820
这辆车扔到机场附近，让他们以为我们上飞机了
Ditch the van near the airport. Make 'em think maybe we're taking a plane.

847
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:55,990
- 韦恩？ - 好的，好的
- Wayne?  - Yeah, yeah.

848
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:58,230
打电话那招很漂亮
That was nice work on the phone back there.

849
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:01,400
谢谢
Thanks.

850
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,930
- 一路顺风  - 保重
- Nice going.  - Be careful.

851
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:23,500
早上好，亨利
Good morning, Henry.

852
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:26,540
睡得还好吗？
Did we have a good sleep?

853
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:40,550
知道吗…？
You know what?

854
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,780
妈的
Damn it.

855
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,220
肯定是从我口袋里滑落的
It had to fall out of my pocket.

856
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:49,860
别担心，我们不会有事
Don't worry about it. We're gonna be okay.

857
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:52,520
- 我就是放在口袋里的  - 我知道
- Yeah, 'cause that's where I put it.  - I know.

858
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,990
- 我放在口袋里了  - 我知道
- That's where I goddamn put it.  - I know.

859
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,110
左，收脚，一，二，三
And left, kick in. One, two, three.

860
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:08,410
右，收脚，做得好，狄娅娜
And right, in. Good, Diane.

861
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,880
左，收脚，一，二，三
And left, in. One, two, three.

862
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:15,780
右，收脚，一，二，三
And right, in. One, two, three.

863
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:45,340
- 啊！ - 对不起
- Ah!  - Sorry.

864
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:51,370
有消息来源估计被劫金额达两百万美元
But sources estimate the amount of money stolen at two million dollars.

865
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:55,410
警方声称已掌握有关劫匪身份的线索
Police say they have a number of leads as to the identities of the robbers.

866
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:57,480
- 亨利  - 基蒂
- Henry.  - Kitty!

867
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,530
- 怎么？ - 威勒太太…
- Yeah?  - Mrs. Weiler.

868
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:01,530
- 找我  - 正是
- Wants me.  - You got it.

869
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:03,790
扶住他，坐好，亨利
You gotta hold him. Sit up, Henry.

870
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,270
刚在新闻上看到他们在机场找到了那辆车
I just heard it on the news. They found the van at the airport.

871
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:14,890
他们在寻找两个今早飞往迈阿密的家伙
They're looking for two guys who flew to Miami this morning.

872
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:24,930
喂？
Hello?

873
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:29,030
对，我知道，我知道，我听过广播
Yeah. I know, I know. I heard.

874
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:32,310
是啊，我们脱身了，再见
Yeah. We're home free. Bye.

875
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,730
出什么事了？
What's going on?

876
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,730
明天见
See you tomorrow.

877
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:56,140
我们来接他，谢谢你们对他的照顾
We'll take it from here. Thank you for taking care of him.

878
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:12,580
- 可怜的家伙  - 我们得想想办法
- Poor guy.  - We have to do something.

879
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:14,840
可我们能做什么呢？
Look, I'm sorry, but what can we do?

880
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,610
我们不能让他回那，得想点办法
We can't let him go back there. We have to do something.

881
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:21,620
我们除了表示遗憾也帮不上什么忙
No, wait. Now, listen. There's nothing else we can do.

882
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:26,460
- 我们得想办法  - 不，卡萝，先回家再说
- We have to do something.  - No, Carol. Just come home.

883
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,270
我的天
Aw, jeez.

884
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,540
嘿，小姐
Hey, lady.

885
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:58,300
小姐，你没事吧？
Lady, you all right?

886
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:02,210
- 我在找个朋友  - 啊哈，是我的女孩
- I'm looking for a friend of mine.  - Boy, that's my girl.

887
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:07,450
开门，快
Open it up. Do it!

888
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:14,650
- 还好吗，亨利？ - 怎么拖了这么久？
- How're you doin', Henry?  - What took you so long?

889
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:22,990
- 哦，老天  - 他昏迷时表现要好得多是吧？
- Aw, man.  - He's much nicer when he's in a coma, isn't he?

890
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,970
你干嘛这样做？你倒是说说看？你…
Why would you do this? Can't you just tell me why? You have no idea...

891
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,970
我说过要你回家的
I told you to come home!

892
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,100
把钱装好，我们在路上
Just get the money together. We're on our way.

893
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:37,540
你到底知不知道自己刚刚做过什么？
Do you have any idea what you just did? Do you?

894
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:40,310
你到底有没有脑子？
Carol, when are you ever gonna start using your head?

895
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:44,740
啊！
Ah!

896
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,870
你打算去哪？
Where you gonna go?

897
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:51,380
也许去北部呆一阵子
North, probably, for a while.

898
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,480
比较近
It's close.

899
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:56,080
然后去个暖和点的地方
Then, I don't know. Somewhere where it's warm.

900
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:01,700
你呢？
What about you?

901
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,010
不知道
I don't know.

902
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,810
我从没去过别的地方
I've never been anywhere else.

903
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:40,090
对不起，你做得对
I'm sorry. It's okay. You did the right thing.

904
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,790
很抱歉，我不该斥责你
I'm sorry I, uh, came down on you.

905
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:46,300
我收拾了一大堆衣物，不知道是否…
T-shirts. I got a bunch of stuff packed. Oh, and socks. I don't know if I...

906
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:53,310
我把钱分成了两份，这里和露营背包里…
I got the money split two ways... here and the duffel bag in there.

907
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,840
我能在这帮点小忙，我知道
I could use a little help here, Carol. I got it.

908
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,510
路上可以用，我们必须抓紧时间，所以…
This is just for the road. Lfigured we're really gonna have to make time, so...

909
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,380
我们得带上这些，没必要浪费
We're gonna have to take this stuff with us, otherwise, it's gonna go to waste.

910
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:07,320
我们什么都不能买，可以带上这些，不是吗？
Anything we can't buy, we can take with us, right?

911
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:10,580
- 什么？ - 我们现在有钱了，不在乎这些
- What?  - Well, we can afford it now. We got the money.

912
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:14,720
你想要杯咖啡吗？
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

913
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:17,490
哦，芥末，好的
Oh. Mustard, right, right.

914
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,220
你可以说该分成三份，但我不这么想
Okay. You could argue it's a three-way split, but I figure what the hell.

915
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:25,030
我和卡萝只拿一份，钱不过是身外之物
Me and Carol make one. After all, it's just money,

916
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,730
不如留点好处给你，不是吗？
Might as well throw you a little bone, right?

917
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,730
你是为你和卡萝达成的交易…
Did you make a deal for Carol too,

918
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:36,930
还是纯粹为了自己？
or just for yourself?

919
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,720
警察就在外面
Cops out there.

920
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,540
我是为我们才这样做
I did it for us.

921
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:11,040
是为了我们，罗…
I did it for us. L...

922
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:14,230
罗伊德说他们关心的不是我们，而是他
Lloyd-Lloyd said they didn't care about you and me. Just him.

923
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:19,400
总得有人背黑锅不是吗？
Somebody's gotta pay, right?

924
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:25,340
我能怎么样？我说过要你离他远点
What am I supposed to do? I told you to stay away from this guy.

925
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,910
你必须撇开他，我已经谈好条件…
You gotta stay away from him. I had this worked out...

926
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,930
我们可以从轻处罚
where we're just gonna get a slap on the wrist.

927
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,950
鉴于她劫了囚车，她的处罚会重一点
Only they're gonna slap her a little bit harder, seeing as she sprung me.

928
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:36,260
这就是所谓的“控制能力”？
That's the guy you call "clutch," huh?

929
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:38,930
好吧，废话说够了
All right, that's enough of this crap.

930
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,130
我们出去吧
We're going outside.

931
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:44,300
我哪都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

932
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:50,070
怎么了？
What?

933
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:52,910
- 我不会走  - 我警告你，卡萝
- I'm not going.  - I'm warning you, Carol.

934
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,840
你最好想明白
You'd better think about this.

935
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:57,880
我想好了
I have.

936
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:02,110
好吧，看来你是想要我帮你脱身
Okay. So you want me to make you go.

937
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:11,450
告诉你，这次我不干
Tell you what. This time I'm not gonna.

938
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:38,140
你怎么看？我们陷入绝境了吗？
So, what do you say? We go down in a blaze of glory?

939
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:42,220
我不知道什么“绝境”
I don't know about "glory,"

940
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:44,650
但我们肯定要面临险境了
but we're gonna go down in a blaze of something.

941
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:00,930
- 我…  - 好了，韦恩，把手背过去
- Uh, I...  - Okay, Wayne. Put your hands behind your back.

942
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,560
- 什么？ - 把手背过去
- What?  - Put your hands behind your back.

943
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,530
- 你干什么？ - 逮捕你
- What are you doing, Lloyd?  - I'm arresting you.

944
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,470
老天，别这样
Lloyd, Jesus. Come on.

945
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:13,410
把手放在头上慢慢走出来
Come out slowly with your hands above your heads.

946
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:15,950
你不曾有过生活…
You haven't lived...

947
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:19,080
在你听到那句话之前
till you've heard someone say that to you.

948
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:26,590
没事，我们控制了局面
Okay, all right. We've got a situation here.

949
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,930
该死的
Goddamn it! Oh, man.

950
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,090
去河边
The river!

951
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:36,260
- 别碰我  - 快到该死的车上去
- Get your hands off of me!  - Get in the goddamn car!

952
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:07,000
- 你不向我宣读我的权利？ - 不，夫人，你不是嫌犯
- Aren't you supposed to read me my rights?  - No, ma'am, you're not a suspect.

953
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,410
你不用向我宣读权利？
Yeah, but... aren't you supposed to read me my rights?

954
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,850
去年她有次违章驾驶被我们抓到…
Yeah, we got a moving violation on her last year...

955
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,440
在限速区超速…
fifty in a thirty-five zone...

956
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:19,280
没有接受处罚并有多次违章停车纪录
failure to complete traffic school and multiple outstanding parking violations.

957
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:21,980
他很有教养
He has good breeding.

958
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:25,020
从他的举止看得出来
How do I know? His bearing.

959
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:28,150
一个人的举止能说明很多事情
You can tell a lot about people by their bearing.

960
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:32,060
有点难以接受，但我猜是他拿了我的表
I kinda hate to admit it, but I think he got my watch.

961
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:36,660
女士们，拜托了，这是犯罪现场
Ladies, please. This is a crime scene.

962
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:41,430
- 你在开玩笑  - 他们毁掉了一个年轻护士的前途
- You're kidding me.  - They've ruined the career of a promising young nurse.

963
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:43,500
卡萝本来大有前途的
Carol Ann McKay had a future.

964
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:45,510
不是开玩笑？
You're not kidding?

965
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,790
需要效劳吗？
May I help?

966
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:58,820
我以前从没把它取下来过
It's just that I've never taken it off before.

967
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:07,560
哦，啧，啧，啧，确实太紧了
Oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk. It's completely stuck.

968
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:11,150
我知道，所以我才来这，你能帮忙吗？
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here. Can you help me?

969
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,170
我的助手要一小时后回来
My assistant is due back in an hour.

970
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:18,360
你到时候再来我们可以去后边弄断它
Why don't you return then and we'll go in the back and cut it off?

971
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,930
不能现在就想办法吗？
Oh, well, couldn't we just do it now?

972
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:23,270
你自己也行对吧？
I mean, you could do it yourself, right?

973
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,360
我离开就没人看店了
I can't leave the front unattended.

974
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,740
安全系统今早出了毛病
The security system's on the blink since this morning.

975
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:31,410
- 还没找出原因  - 明白了
- They can't figure out what happened.  - I see.

976
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:33,420
是我运气不好
Just my luck.

977
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:37,290
不过我下了很大决心才这样做而且…
It's just that I finally got the courage to do this and...

978
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,090
那是我人生的一段重要经历
I mean, it was a huge chunk of my life.

979
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,560
- 大学时的爱人？ - 高中
- College sweetheart?  - High school.

980
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:48,730
我从没结识过其他男人，你想想看
I've never even been with another man. Imagine that.

981
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:54,330
求你帮帮忙
Oh, please, just take it off.

982
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:58,400
来吧，跟我去后边
Come on. Come with me in the back.

983
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:01,270
会办妥的，我先把门关上
We'll be fine. I'll just lock the door.

984
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:04,040
你真是个好人
You're such a sweet man.

985
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:09,380
他…他不会有事吧？
Is, uh... Is he gonna be all right?

986
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:11,740
我爸爸不会有事
Daddy'll be fine.

987
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:15,680
我真希望能在他中风之前就…这样做
I just wish I could've done this before the... stroke.

988
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:20,860
但不管怎样，我相信在他内心深处会知道
But somehow, deep down, I think he'll know.
