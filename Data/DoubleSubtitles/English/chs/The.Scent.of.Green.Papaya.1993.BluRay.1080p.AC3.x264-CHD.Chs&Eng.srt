2
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,830
谁？
Who's there?

3
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,830
- 是我，梅  - 呀，梅！我来开门
- It's Mui.  - I'll let you in.

4
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,960
进来吧
Come in.

5
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,110
跟我来
Follow me.

6
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,200
青木瓜之味
THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA

7
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,700
一九五一年，越南西贡

8
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,420
是小梅，我们新来的丫头
It's Mui, our new servant.

9
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,430
走了一整天的路，把她累坏了
Poor thing, she walked all day to get here.

10
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,900
桃如果还没死，也应该有她那般大
If Tho were still alive, she'd be about Mui's age.

11
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,730
我们不要说这个了
Don't talk about her.

12
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,450
也许她现在很好呢！
She may be better off where she is now...

13
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,120
快要宵禁了，忠还没回来
It's almost curfew and Trung isn't home yet.

14
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,080
妈要睡了
Mother is getting ready for bed.

15
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,840
我上去帮她
I'll go see if she needs anything.

16
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,740
- 呀，忠…  - 爸，你还没睡？
- Ah, Trung!  - Still up, Dad?

17
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,350
再睡会，少奶说的
The mistress says you can sleep in.

18
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,890
我会叫醒你生火
I'll wake you up to make the fire.

19
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,150
记住，油一定要烧热
Remember, for this dish, the fat needs to be very hot.

20
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,440
菜要这样炒
When you sauté the vegetables,

21
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,070
这样炒才入味
brown them a little for added flavor.

22
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,910
不能炒太久，否则就不爽口
Don't overcook them, they'll go mushy.

23
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,280
菜先放一旁
Then put them to one side.

24
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,620
肉也用同样方法炒
The same goes for the meat, let the fat burn. Here.

25
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,080
把水倒进去
Put it in the water.

26
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,510
猪油可让菜发亮
You need a bit of fat to make the vegetables shiny.

27
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,930
显得好看一些
The dishes must look beautiful.

28
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,810
不管好不好看，我们都会吃下去
For us peasants, beautiful or not, it ends up in our bellies.

29
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,430
但主人们可不一样
But our masters aren't like us. When the meat is done,

30
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,520
煮好后…
add the vegetables.

31
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,330
把菜分成两碟
Then put half on each plate.

32
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,580
一份送到楼下，一份给姥姥
One for downstairs, and one for the grandmother.

33
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,460
别忘记给我们自己留一份
Don't forget to keep some for us.

34
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,420
听，姥姥念完经了
She's finished praying.

35
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,590
做菜时，把蔬菜…
Time to serve. Put the vegetables...

36
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,930
放进滚水里
in the boiling water.

37
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,720
她是谁的母亲？
Is she the mistress's mother?

38
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,020
少奶的，洗洗手
The master's. Wash your hands.

39
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,020
少奶才生下来，她丈夫就死掉了
She lost her husband just after the master was born.

40
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,110
她现在整天都在楼上念经
Now she stays upstairs and spends all her time praying.

41
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,740
快用碗盛饭
Hurry up, put the rice in a big bowl.

42
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,850
- 都好了吗？  - 都好了
- Is everything ready?  - Yes...

43
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,070
梅，你来端姥姥那盘
Mui, take the grandmother's tray.

44
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,900
行，我来端这个吧
It's all right, I'll do it.

45
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,530
你端这个吧
Take this one, then.

46
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,070
爸，我跟浩仁在外面吃
Dad... Khuyen and I will eat outside.

47
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,820
你先小睡一会吧
After the meal, take your nap as usual.

48
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,830
我们会赶回来吃下午茶
We'll be back for tea. Is that all right?

49
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,700
好的
Yes, fine.

50
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,700
我呢？我可以去吗？
Can I have tea with you too?

51
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,460
不，你太小了
No, you're not old enough.

52
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,710
梅，来点汤
Mui, go fetch a bit more soup in the kitchen.

53
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,680
妈不想一个人吃
Mother doesn't want to eat alone,

54
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,890
想要你陪她吃饭
she wants you to keep her company.

55
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,390
- 好吧  - 我也要上去
- All right.  - I'll come too.

56
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,700
把这拿上楼
Take that upstairs.

57
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,900
快吃，又要迟到了
Eat quickly. You mustn't be late for school.

58
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,490
奶奶，现在放暑假，不用上课
I don't have school, Grandmother. It's the summer holidays.

59
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,490
噢，是的！
Ah, yes, so it is.

60
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,440
妈，我们走啦
Khuyen and I are going out.

61
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,480
我与浩仁会回来吃下午茶
We'll be back for tea. I already told Dad.

62
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,820
好的，我会买些蛋糕
Okay. I'll send Mui to buy cakes.

63
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,240
- 再见，伯母  - 再见
- Good-bye.  - Good-bye, Khuyen.

64
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
梅，你可以吃饭了
Mui, you can go and eat.

65
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,170
- 小蓝，快吃  - 妈，好吃
- Lam, eat, my child.  - Bon appétit, Mommy.

66
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,260
这个给你，吃吧
Your bowl is there. Take some meat.

67
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,810
没汤了！真是的！
There's no more soup, it's really annoying.

68
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,230
我们都分出去了，给了楼上楼下
When everyone eats in a different place,

69
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,150
盘子都光了，没剩下
the dishes get scattered and we get nothing.

70
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,730
然后，把盘子洗干净
When you've finished, do the washing-up.

71
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,950
跟忠先生一起的男人是谁？
Who was that with Mr. Trung?

72
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,950
那是浩仁少爷，忠先生的朋友
Mr. Khuyen, Mr. Trung's friend.

73
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
快吃
Eat.

74
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,630
天！
Tin!

75
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,690
谢谢！再见！
Thank you, good-bye.

76
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,610
再见！
Good-bye, thank you very much.

77
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,910
梅，把手洗干净，去买十块饼
Wash your hands, then go buy some cakes.

78
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,330
是！少奶
Yes, madam.

79
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,970
如果你喜欢，三个月后
If you like, after the holidays,

80
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,520
你可以回家探望你娘
you can go to visit your mother.

81
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,810
谢谢少奶
Thank you, madam.

82
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,100
梅，快！该生火了
Mui! Hurry up, it's time to light the fire.

83
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,040
小女孩
Little one! Please...

84
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,420
你叫什么？
What's your name?

85
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,640
我叫梅
Mui.

86
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,810
啊！你就是梅…我叫唐
So your name's Mui, is it? I'm Thuan.

87
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,310
是时候念经了
It's time for the grandmother's prayers.

88
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,810
姥姥好吗？
Is she all right?

89
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,320
她很好
Yes, she's fine.

90
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,990
这样就好了
That's excellent.

91
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,610
很好
Excellent.

92
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,360
谢谢你，小梅
Thank you, little Mui.

93
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,120
- 再见  - 再见，唐先生
- Good-bye.  - Good-bye, Mr. Thuan.

94
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,180
- 你去哪儿？  - 呼吸点新鲜空气
- Where are you going?  - Out for a walk.

95
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,480
是的，天这么热，很难入睡
Good idea. It isn't easy sleeping in this heat.

96
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,020
小心宵禁
Be careful, it's almost curfew.

97
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,380
真热死人！
It's so hot!

98
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,920
天！真热死人！
My God, it's so hot!

99
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,050
你可以明天再收拾东西
Leave your things for tonight, put them away tomorrow.

100
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,060
你今天够累的了
You've worked enough for today.

101
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,100
休息吧
Rest.

102
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,530
你的父母呢？
Tell me about your family.

103
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,110
你有兄弟姊妹吗？
Do you have brothers or sisters?

104
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,870
我爸三年前死了
My father died three years ago.

105
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,910
妈妈跟姐姐在乡下
My mother stayed in the village with my little sister.

106
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,080
你什么时候回去看她们？
When will you see your mother?

107
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,790
少奶说三个月后
The mistress said after the holidays

108
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,250
我可以回家探望妈
I could go back.

109
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,920
这就好，少奶是个好人
Ah, that's good. The mistress is kind.

110
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,600
我之前谁在这里睡？
Who used to sleep here?

111
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,770
另一个丫头
A servant, like you and me.

112
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,190
她回家嫁人去了
She went home to get married.

113
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,940
神位那幅照片的人是姥姥的丈夫？
Is the man in the photo the grandmother's husband?

114
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,200
是的
Yes.

115
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,030
他死时还很年青
He died at a very young age.

116
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,370
那小女孩是谁？
And who's the little girl?

117
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,540
说起来很凄凉
It's a sad story.

118
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,130
她是少爷和少奶的女儿
She was the master's daughter.

119
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,340
她叫桃
Her name was Tho.

120
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,390
七年前死了
She died seven years ago.

121
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,060
如果她还活着，应该跟你一样大
If she were still alive, she'd be about your age.

122
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,150
她是怎样死的？
How did she die?

123
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,450
病死的，但少爷总觉得是他的错
From an illness, but the master blames himself.

124
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,780
为什么？
How come?

125
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,620
七年前…
About seven years ago,

126
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,120
少爷拿着所有钱离开了家
the master left home with all the family's savings.

127
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,920
这已经是他第三次这样做
It was the third time I'd seen him abandon his home and family.

128
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,840
这之前，他花光了钱
Once he'd spent all the money on women,

129
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,800
便会回家
he would come home.

130
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,810
但这次，他走了很长一段时间
But this time he went away for longer than usual.

131
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,400
这之前他每次回家…
When he came home the other times,

132
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,690
少奶什么都没说？
didn't the mistress say anything?

133
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,030
对，一句话也没说
Nothing, not even a word.

134
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,740
她很开心，喜极而泣
She was so happy she cried.

135
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,250
桃呢？她怎样了？
And what happened to Tho?

136
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
又宵禁了…
There's the curfew.

137
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,290
那边有些动静
Just when it was getting cool.

138
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,960
应该是少爷回来了
The master must be home by now.

139
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,140
他离家三星期后…
Three weeks after the master left,

140
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,890
桃生病了
Tho fell ill.

141
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,520
在他回家前一天
The day before her father returned,

142
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,610
她便死了
she died.

143
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,650
他一定是觉得她的死…
The master must have thought she died

144
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,150
是为了要惩罚他犯的罪
in order to pay for his sins.

145
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,320
所以他之后再也没有离家过
That's why he never goes out now.

146
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,500
好了，睡觉吧
Right, let's get some sleep.

147
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,330
明天还要早起呢！
We have to get up early tomorrow.

148
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
妈妈！
Mom!

149
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,000
妈妈！
Mom!

150
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,000
妈妈！
Mom!

151
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,550
起来！是时候了
Mui, it's time to get up.

152
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,900
你很幸运
You're lucky.

153
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,860
你这个年纪还可以做些好梦
At your age, you still have good dreams.

154
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,790
- 你梦见什么？  - 我不知道
- What did you dream about?  - I don't know.

155
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,170
老天爷，我真想做梦
Have you forgotten?

156
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,420
我不知有多久没做梦了
I'd love to dream, but I haven't dreamt for years.

157
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,630
来吧，洗脸去！
Come on, let's go and wash.

158
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,370
有一些日子…我醒来时
Some mornings I wake up

159
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,620
脑海里总是记得一名老妇
with the image of an old woman in my head.

160
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,460
也许那是我夜里作的梦
I don't know if it's a dream.

161
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,290
我不知道那老妇是我的母亲…
I don't know if the old woman is my mother

162
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,550
抑或是我自己
or if it's me.

163
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,810
天，谁这么早就在厨房？
Who's up at such an early hour?

164
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,490
少奶，这么早就起来？
Mistress, you're up early!

165
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,180
- 还有米吗？  - 只够四至五天
- Do we have any rice?  - Only enough for five days.

166
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,270
这些给你拿到市场去变卖，要确保以后几天有足够吃的
Here's the market money. Do the best you can.

167
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,890
梅，看看这些耳环
Mui, see these earrings?

168
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,560
少爷又带着所有钱出走了！我的天！
This means the master's left with the family money again.

169
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,830
让我们把牙齿刷干净
We brush our teeth, teeth, teeth

170
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,670
把脸、手、脚都洗干净
Wash our hands and feet, feet, feet

171
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,500
把头发梳好
Then we comb our hair, hair, hair

172
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,590
还有别忘了上厕所
And remember to poo, poo, poo

173
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,940
不，这匹也不要
No, I don't like that either.

174
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,270
对不起…
I'm so sorry.

175
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,070
- 不要紧，再见  - 再见
- Never mind, thank you.  - Good-bye.

176
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,040
你怎么了？
What happened to you?

177
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,160
打架了
I had a fight.

178
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,370
跟谁？
With whom?

179
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,000
那些小孩
The other children.

180
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,460
他们有打伤你吗？
Did they hurt you?

181
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,340
爸在家吗？
Is Daddy back?

182
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,010
不，不在家
No, not yet.

183
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,140
去梅那里换些干净衣服
Ask Mui to give you some clean clothes.

184
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,950
如果菜不够的话…
When there isn't much food, make it salty.

185
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,030
多加些盐，这样
That way they'll eat more rice with the dishes.

186
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,120
他们便会多吃些饭
Give me the bowl.

187
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,870
这些放煮好的米
It's for the boiled vegetables.

188
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,470
把这个拿上楼
Take this upstairs.

189
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
妈说先吃
Mommy told us to start.

190
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,130
太咸了！
Yuck! It's too salty.

191
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,500
看！
Look.

192
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,690
快吃
Eat!

193
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,370
好吃吗？
Is it good?

194
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,850
小梅…来，我想问你一些事情
Mui, come here. I've something to ask you.

195
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,410
谢谢你，唐先生
Thank you, Mr. Thuan.

196
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,670
姥姥好吗？
Is Grandmother well?

197
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,500
我们快没有米了
There's hardly any rice left.

198
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,210
我们一匹布也没卖出去
We didn't sell any cloth today.

199
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,220
只卖了两捆棉花…
Just a few shirt buttons.

200
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,300
那点钱可以买些什么呢？
What can we buy with the money from a few buttons?

201
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,100
老天爷！
God!

202
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:00,640
都是你的错
It's your fault.

203
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:05,020
要是你懂得怎样爱他，他便不会找别的女人
If you'd shown him love, he wouldn't have taken mistresses.

204
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,700
我一开始就知道
I knew right from the start.

205
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,540
我的儿子跟你不会开心
I knew my son would be unhappy with you.

206
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,630
你有一个丈夫…但你根本不知道怎样讨他开心
You don't know how to make your husband happy.

207
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,480
好了，够了
Okay, that's enough.

208
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,860
剩下来的木瓜怎么办？
What do I do with the rest of the papaya?

209
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,530
把它扔掉
Throw it away.

210
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,070
够了
Stop that!

211
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,370
把这个拿上去
Take this.

212
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,510
好了，你可以去吃饭了
That's fine. You can go eat.

213
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,280
慢慢吃，妈
Bon appétit, Mommy.

214
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,320
爸什么时候回来？
Mommy, when will Daddy be home?

215
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,490
我不知道，快吃
I don't know. Now eat.

216
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,330
你为什么哭？
Why are you crying like that?

217
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,920
为什么爸不回来？
Where's Daddy? Why doesn't he come home?

218
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,590
闭嘴！
Shut up!

219
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,360
- 谢谢  - 哪里，再见！
- Thank you.  - Good-bye.

220
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,110
再见！谢谢
Good-bye, thank you.

221
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,890
有买米的钱了
Now we've got money for rice.

222
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:45,310
去买二十五公斤的米回来
Go buy 25 kilos of rice.

223
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,460
快！我们要切肉了
Mui, quick, the meat needs cutting.

224
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:10,500
那儿…放那儿
There, put it there.

225
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,300
这米很好！
It's very good rice.

226
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,390
- 我们今晚有客人  - 谁？
- We have a guest tonight.  - Who?

227
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,140
浩仁先生
Mr. Khuyen.

228
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,600
浩仁先生是谁？
Who's Mr. Khuyen?

229
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,810
忠先生的朋友呀！
Why, Mr. Trung's friend!

230
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,490
我可以试试自己炒菜吗？
Can I do the sautéed vegetables by myself?

231
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,830
好吧，你试试
Yes, if you like.

232
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,310
她丈夫死后三年…
Even three years after her husband died,

233
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,820
她仍然不接受我
she still didn't want me.

234
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,740
她依然深爱着他
I realized that she still loved him

235
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,780
怎么也不肯与我结婚
and didn't want to become my wife.

236
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:38,200
自那天开始
Since then, whenever I've been able,

237
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,540
我便一直在远处看着她
I've watched her from afar.

238
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,540
她搬过好几次，我一直跟着她走
She's moved house several times. I've always followed her.

239
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,420
所以我与你才得以认识
That's how you and I were able to meet.

240
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,480
自桃死后
Since Tho, her granddaughter, died,

241
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,770
姥姥便一直未下过楼
Grandmother hasn't been downstairs.

242
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,480
我已有七年没看见过她
I haven't seen her for seven years.

243
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,700
告诉我，小梅
Tell me, may

244
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,290
你可以让她下来院子走走…
Couldn't you get her to come down into the courtyard,

245
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,290
让我看见她一面吗？
so I can see her?

246
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,540
你为什么不上去见她
Why don't you go up to see her?

247
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,210
你躲起来，她当然见不到你
You could hide and see her, without her seeing you.

248
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,130
不，不可能的
No, it's impossible.

249
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,550
如果她看见了我，事情可糟了
It'd be terrible if she saw me.

250
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,350
不，不可能的
It's impossible.

251
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,290
走！上去！
Go on, go up.

252
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,250
不要紧
It doesn't matter.

253
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,580
老天！
Oh, my God!

254
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,840
少奶最喜欢这些花瓶
You don't know how fond the mistress is of her vases.

255
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,760
他们是老古董
They're very old.

256
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:29,260
我一生赚的钱也不够买一个
Even with all my savings, I couldn't afford them.

257
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:32,140
你真幸运
You're lucky.

258
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,140
少奶，快起来
Quick, madam, come quickly!

259
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:08,560
这东西一对才值钱，没有另一个一毛钱也不值
It's a very valuable piece, but only with its twin.

260
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:11,320
你拿主意
It's up to you.

261
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,480
好的，就卖吧
All right, I accept.

262
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,290
忠，快！
Trung, quick!

263
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,860
十年后
10 YEARS LATER

264
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:19,880
梅
Mui!

265
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,170
快，我妈想见你
Hurry up, my mother wants a word.

266
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,050
生意不好已经有一阵子
Business has been bad for a while.

267
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,510
这样下去会出问题的
If things don't change, we'll have real problems.

268
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:54,560
天井没什么用
We don't use the inner courtyard.

269
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,480
可用来再养一些鹦鹉
I was wondering about rearing animals in it to supplement our income.

270
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,570
嗯，再说吧…
Yes. We'll see.

271
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:03,660
那样的话，我再四处问问
I n that case, I'll get some advice tomorrow.

272
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,950
妈正跟梅在说这事
Mother's going to speak to Mui.

273
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:10,910
梅要是跟了你的朋友浩仁，日子会好过许多
I'm sure she won't be unhappy at your friend Khuyen's.

274
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,370
他一个人住，只爱写曲
He lives alone and composes music.

275
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:17,290
他几乎不回这边的家
He's hardly ever home.

276
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:24,010
他父母很有钱，梅在他那儿会好过点
His parents are rich, she'll be better paid there.

277
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,960
如果桃仍在世，我会把这些给她
These are things I would have given to Tho if she had lived.

278
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:19,240
谢谢你，十年来，我仿佛有一个女儿在身旁
For ten years, thanks to you, I've felt that I have a daughter.

279
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,570
我从没意识到，但有你在我感到很安慰
Without knowing it, you've really comforted me.

280
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:30,960
小蓝走了，他需要一个写作的地方
Lam has gone.

281
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,750
现在你也要离开了
He needs a quiet place to write his books.

282
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,380
很长一段时间里…
And now you're leaving.

283
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:53,230
我希望小蓝会娶你
For years I hoped Lam would take you for his wife.

284
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,210
我的女儿…我的小女儿
Mui, my little girl!

285
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:37,920
不要吃！带我上餐馆
Don't eat, take me out to dinner.

286
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:48,600
你写了多少？
Have you made any progress?

287
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,770
把你写的曲奏给我听
Play me what you've composed.

288
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,200
闻着好香
That smells good.

289
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:11,040
好吗？
Well?

290
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:14,170
- 你新来的女仆怎么样？  - 不错
- Your new servant?  - All right.

291
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:16,710
什么叫“不错”？
What does "all right" mean?

292
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:19,300
她很勤快
That she works hard.

293
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:22,390
我不是问你这个！算了
That wasn't what I was asking, but it doesn't matter.

294
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,890
- 我给你的花瓶呢？  - 破了
- Where's the vase I gave you?  - It's broken.

295
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:31,230
破了？你是说，她把它打破了？
Broken? She broke it, you mean.

296
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,110
若我说她故意这样做，你会怎么说？
If I said it was deliberate, what would you reply?

297
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:14,260
我怀疑越南会有多少女人…
I wonder how many women in Vietnam

298
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:16,640
摸过她们未婚夫的头

299
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:22,230
我母亲告诉过我，她们都会教导女儿
My mother told me little girls used to be taught

300
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,230
一个受过良好教育的女人不会这样做
that a well-bred woman shouldn't.

301
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,910
她也说你已经有两个多星期
She also said it's nearly two weeks

302
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:33,660
没去看他们了
since you last visited us.

303
01:27:34,410 --> 01:27:36,330
你父亲也有点惊讶
Your father is surprised too.

304
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:08,510
“在我的园子里…
"I n my garden

有一棵木瓜树

306
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:19,850
那些木瓜一串串地吊在树上
"The papayas grow in bunches.

307
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:24,360
熟透了的木瓜有一种淡黄的色泽
"Ripe papayas are a pale yellow.

308
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,240

还有一双大耳朵”
"and big ears."

316
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:34,480
我开始了，好吗？
I'll start, all right?

317
01:39:37,690 --> 01:39:40,820
“泉水从石头缝里汩汩地流出来
"The spring water, filling a hole in the rock,

318
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:44,450
被拨弄时闪闪发光

地层的颤动使海水产生波涛
"The vibration of the ground gave rise to powerful waves

"If there's a verb meaning to stir harmoniously,

323
01:40:04,010 --> 01:40:06,350
用在这里再合适不过了

樱桃树树影婆娑
"Plunged into darkness, the cherry trees

325
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:16,280
灿烂的盛放…
