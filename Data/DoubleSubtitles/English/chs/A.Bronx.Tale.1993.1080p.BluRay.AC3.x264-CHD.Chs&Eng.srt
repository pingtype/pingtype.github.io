扬基不二臣 连续五十六场没出错
The Yankee CIipper. 56-game hitting streak.

259
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,600

- Nobody beat that. Right, Dad?  - Nobody beat that, son.

260
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,960
- 知道为什么 乔迪如此伟大吗  - 因为他是意大利人
- You know why Joe D. was great?  - Because he was ItaIian?

265
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,580
只能你愿意你就能做到
You can be anything you want to be.

266
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,550
人生最大的悲哀 就是浪费天才
The saddest thing in Iife is wasted taIent.

267
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,860
有天才而不善加利用 也是枉然
If you've got taIent and do the wrong thing, nothing happens.

268
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,730
如果你善于利用 就能创造奇迹
But when you do right, good things happen.

269
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,460
- 听懂了吗  - 不错

273
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,640
- 搞定了吗  - 搞定了
- Got it?  - I got it.

274
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,080
浪费天才是 我一生中老爸常说的
Wasted taIent was something my father taIked about aII my Iife.

I just can't do it.

297
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,560
一百五十美元一个月啊 你真是不想考虑一下
$150 a week. You don't want to think about it?

298
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,570
我不能做 那事不适合我
I can't do this. It's not for me.

299
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,970
辛尼会很失望的 不过我会和他实话实说

每周可赚一百五十元

304
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,700
一百五十元？你怎么回答
What did you say?

305
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,640
你以为我会怎么说 我说那不适合我做
What do you think? I toId him it's not for me.

306
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,580
怎么了
What?

307
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,580
我也不知道 一百五十元啊 只是做字花罢了
I don't know. 150 doIIars? It's onIy numbers.

308
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,950
- 你认为我应该做  - 我也不知道
- You think I shouId've took it?  - I don't know.

309

But you get invoIved with those guys, next thing, one, two three...

也许你是对的
Maybe you're right.

311
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,510
- 我去看看宝贝  - 来这
- I'm going to check on the baby.  - Come here.

312
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,440
- 怎么了  - 来这嘛
- What?  - Come here.

313
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,510
有没有后悔 嫁了个公车司机
Are you sorry you got stuck with a bus driver?

314
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,780
我就是爱上你的制服啊
I feII in Iove with your uniform.

315
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,970
葬礼那天 我的心情很不好
The day of the funeraI, I feIt reaIIy bad.

316
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,510
人都死了 我却说谎而犯下 不可饶恕的大罪
I reaIized a man died, and I Iied and committed a mortaI sin.

317
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,500
我祈求上帝的宽恕
I wanted God's forgiveness.

318
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,580
为我祈祷吧 神父 我犯了罪
BIess me, Father, for I have sinned.

319
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,420
我已经一个月没有告解
It has been one month since my Iast confession...

320
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,250
一下我犯的罪： 我没望弥撒两次
and these are my sins: I missed Sunday Mass twice...

321
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,660
目击一次凶杀案后 撒谎一次
I Iied about witnessing a murder once.

322
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,000
- 我在星期五吃肉  - 等等 前面你说什么
- I ate meat on Friday...  - Wait. Can you back up a bit?

323
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,630
我在星期五吃肉一次
I ate meat on Friday once?

324
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,100
不是这个 在前面那句话
Not that one. Back up a IittIe more.

325
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,500
- 目击凶杀  - 对 就是这个
- About witnessing a murder?  - Yeah, that's the one.

326
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,040
你知道你在说什么吗
Do you reaIize what you said?

327
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,940
只有一次啊
It was onIy once.

328
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,180
- 你知道第五诫是什么吗  - 神父 我知道
- Do you know what the fifth is?  - Yes, Father, I know.

329
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,620
我有权不答 使我受害的问题
"'I refuse to answer because I might incrimin..."'

330
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,240
摩西十诫中的第五诫
The Fifth Commandment.

331
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,760
你不可杀人
"'Thou shaII not kiII."'

332
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,420
对 现在 你把实情告诉我
That's right. Now, I want you to teII me what happened.

333
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,020
不 神父 我不会告诉任何人
No, Father, I'm not teIIing nobody nothing.

334
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,100
别害怕 我的孩子
Don't be afraid, my son.

335
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,930
- 没有人比上帝更强大  - 我不知道
- Nobody's more powerfuI than God.  - I don't know about that.

336
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,130
你的人在上面比我的强大
Your guy's bigger than my guy up there...

337
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,640
但我的人在下面 比你的强大
but my guy's bigger than yours down here.

338
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,810
有道理 念五次 祝祷文和五次玫瑰经吧
You got a point. Five Our Fathers and five HaiI Marys.

339
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,280
目击凶杀那事可以赦免？ 划算
For a murder rap? Not bad.

340
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,080
- 你说什么  - 再见 神父
- What did you say?  - Bye, Father!

341
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,090
天主教徒 可以告解真是太棒了
It was great to be CathoIic and go to confession.

342
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,060
每个星期 都可以重获新生
You couId start over every week.

343
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,670
喂 小鬼

00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:53,300
辛尼想见你 快 没人会碰你的车的
Sonny wants to see you. Nobody's going to grab that bike.

345
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,620

They're good kids. They just did some work for me.

346
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,850
- 收下他们吧  - 取决于你了
- Put them in.  - It's up to you.

347
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,730
那孩子来了 辛尼 到前面来 别害怕
Here's the kid, Sonny. Go ahead. Don't be afraid.

348
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,900

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,620
我们终于碰面了
We finaIIy meet face-to-face.

351
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,150
你怕我吗
Are you afraid of me?

352
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,960
- 不怕  - 很好
- No.  - That's good.

353
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,430
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

354
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,500
卡洛杰罗
CaIogero.

355
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,130
太长了 有没有绰号
That's a big name. You got a nickname?

356
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,500
- 你朋友怎么称呼你  - 卡洛杰罗
- What do your friends caII you?  - CaIogero.

357
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,270

00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,040
- 你是扬基队的球迷  - 是的

来这坐我旁边
Come over here. Sit next to me.

361
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,660
扬基输了你一定很难过
You must be pretty upset after the Yankees Iost.

362
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,100
比尔马泽罗斯基 我恨死他了
BiII Mazeroski, I hate him.

363
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,300
他把米奇曼托搞哭了 报纸说米克哭了
He made Mickey MantIe cry. The papers said the Mick cried.

364
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,070
米奇曼托？ 你就是为了他难过
Mickey MantIe? That's what you're upset about?

365
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,540
曼托一年赚十万 你爹赚多少
MantIe makes $100,000 a year. How much does your father make?

366
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,440
- 我不知道  - 你不知道
- I don't know.  - You don't know.

367
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,810
如果你爹需要钱 跑去问米奇曼托要 看他会怎么说
If your dad needs money, go ask Mickey MantIe. See what happens.

368
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,320
米奇曼托根本不在乎你 你在乎他干嘛
Mickey MantIe don't care about you. Why care about him?

369
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,750
没人在乎你
Nobody cares.

370
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,490
我可以问个问题吗
Can I ask you something?

371
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,150
当然可以
Sure.

372
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,300
你是因为争停车位 杀了那人吗
Did you shoot that man over a parking space?

373
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,570
等你长大了 你自然会明白的
When you get oIder, you'II understand.

374
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,570
从那天起 我对扬基队的感觉 和以前完全不同了
From that day on, I never feIt the same about the Yankees.

375
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,390
我总和辛尼呆在一起
I started spending a Iot of time with Sonny.

376
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,230
放学后我总是偷偷溜出来
I wouId come home from schooI and sneak away any chance I got.

377
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,850
我给他们 拿饮料换取小费
I wouId serve the guys drinks and coffee for tips.

378
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,710

- Bet!  - I'II Iay a hundred.

379
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,120
扔吧 辛尼
Come on, Sonny!

380
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,360
- 狗娘养的  - 我简直不相信
- Son of a bitch!  - I don't beIieve it!

381
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,160
我要打断他的手
I shouId break his arm.

382
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,260
小鬼 这是给你的

- 辛尼 借我一百  - 你知道下面会怎么样吧

00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,540
- 掷骰子  - 掷什么骰子
- Crap games?  - What crap games?

511
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,200
掷什么骰子 什么小费
What crap games? What tips?

512
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,370
- 掷什么骰子  - 你说过不会生气的
- What crap games?  - You said you wouIdn't get mad.

513
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,810
我反悔了告诉我
I Iied. TeII me.

514
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,140
- 我给辛尼打工赚小费  - 我知道

515
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,720
不是告诉你 别到酒吧去吗
Weren't you toId not to go near that bar?

516
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,820

- But I worked for it.  - What do you mean?

517
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,150
- 你根本不该到那去的  - 我得把它送回去
- You're not supposed to go there!  - I'm taking it back.

518
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,060
- 我得把它送回酒吧去  - 我们再考虑一下吧
- I'm bringing it back to the bar.  - Let's just think about it for a minute.

519
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,060
- 你说什么  - 我们可以花了这笔钱
- What are you saying?  - We couId use the money.

520
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,860
他又不是做坏事赚来的
It's not Iike he had to do something bad.

521
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,730
你知道这是从哪来的 我不想让他收这种钱
You know where this comes from. I don't want him having that kind of money!

522
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,570
- 我们在考虑一下吧  - 就这么定了
- Let's just think about it...  - That's it!

523
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,040
- 等等  - 等一下听我说啊
- Come on.  - Wait a minute. Listen to me.

524
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,940
为什么你这么食古不化 冷静点
Why do you got to go down Iike this? CaIm down!

525
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,580
罗伦佐求你了
Lorenzo, pIease!

526
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,620
真令人难以置信
I don't beIieve this!

527
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,230
- 辛尼在吗  - 在好像在后面
- Is Sonny around?  - I think he's in the back.

528
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,950
我们不能收下
We can't accept that.

529
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,950
我给你儿子的 你儿子赚来的
Your son worked for it.

530
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,090
是小儿赚来的 但我不想小儿 牵涉这里的活动
Right. My son. I don't want him invoIved in what goes on here.

531
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,030
牵涉什么 你在说什么啊
InvoIved in what?

532
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,000
别搞我了 我不是个笨蛋
PIease, I'm not a stupid man.

533
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,360
- 你知道我什么意思 你离我儿子远点  - 喂 你冷静一点
- Just stay away from my son.  - Hey, you stay right over here.

534
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,200
C你先出去 我和你爹谈谈
C, go outside.

535
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,210
我自会教仔 卡洛杰罗在外面等我
I'II speak to my own son. CaIogero, wait outside.

536
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,210
首先我尊重你 罗伦佐你是条汉子
First, I respect you, Lorenzo. You're a stand-up guy.

537
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,550
不过别再像刚才那样 和我说话
But don't ever taIk to me Iike that again.

538
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,880
我教你儿子要上学 上大学
I teII your son to go to schooI...

539
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,460
重要的不是你说什么 而是他看到了什么 锦衣名车金钱
It's not what you say, it's what he sees... cIothes, cars, money.

540
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,190
他把那些棒球明星卡 全扔光了
He threw away his basebaII cards...

541
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,760
他说因为米奇曼托 不会帮我付账
because Mickey MantIe wouId never pay my rent.

542
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,490
他这么说的吗 这小鬼真难以置信
He said that? I don't beIieve this kid.

543
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,830
如果等到他的存款 比我还多 就没什么可笑的
That's not funny when he has a bigger bank account than I do.

544
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,060
我给过你好差事的 你自己不干
I offered you work. You said no.

545
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,510
现在我还要说不干 求你别再搞我儿子了
And I say no now. Just Ieave my son aIone.

546
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,200
你不见我视他如己出吗
Don't you see I treat that kid Iike he's my son?

547
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,610
- 他不是你的儿子 他是我的儿子  - 谁的 我的
- He ain't your son. He's my son!  - Whose? My

548
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,650
- 你他妈给我滚出去  - 我根本不怕你
- Get out!  - I'm not afraid of you.

549
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,050
- 你会怕的  - 辛尼我知道 你做事不择手段
- You shouId be.  - I know what you can do.

550
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,490
这人人 都知道我循规蹈矩
And I wouId never step out of Iine.

551
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,860
不过这回你错了 别拿别人家庭开玩笑 这是我的儿子不是你的
But this time you're wrong. This is my son, not yours!

552
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,730
你想大家吗滚出去 否则我给你一巴掌
You want to fight? Get out or I'II give you a fucking sIap!

553
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,730
别再搞我的儿子了
Stay away from my son!

554
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,430
- 我才不管你是谁  - 给我滚出去
- I don't care who you are!  - Get out of here!

555
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,000
- 我的钱在哪  - 留下了
- Where's my money?  - It's in there.

556
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,870
什么 你怎么可以这样做 这是我的钱
It was mine!

557
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,570
那钱不干净 我不让你拿
That's bad money! You can't have it.

558
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,680
- 那钱是我赚的  - 我说过让你离他远点
- I earned that money!  - Stay away from him!

559
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,280
- 请听我说  - 我告诉你离他远点
- PIease Iisten!  - Stay away from him!

560
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,910
- 老爸 你听我说  - 你听见我说什么吗 你给我离他远点
- Dad, Iisten to me!  - Did you hear me? Stay away!

561
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,990
辛尼是对的 打工的都是笨蛋
Sonny was right. The working man is a sucker.

562
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,290
他错了 开枪杀人容易事
Wrong! PuIIing a trigger doesn't take strength.

563
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,490
每天起早贪黑的打工谋生 让他也来试试
Get up every day and work for a Iiving! Let's see him try that!

564
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,600
你就知道谁才是硬汉了 打工的都是硬汉
We'II see who's reaIIy tough. The working man is tough.

565
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,930
你老爸是硬汉
Your father's the tough guy!

566
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,000
每个人都爱他 就像公车上的乘客 都爱你一样
Everybody Ioves him, just Iike everybody Ioves you on the bus.

567
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:15,730
不一样的 人家不是爱他是怕他
No, it's not the same. PeopIe don't Iove him. They fear him.

568
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,670
这就是区别
There's a difference.

569
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,980
- 对不起  - 我还是不明白老爸
- I'm sorry.  - I don't understand, Dad.

570
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,640
你会的等你长大了 你就明白了
You wiII. You wiII when you get oIder.

571
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,350
对不起我打了你
I'm sorry I hit you.

572
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,640
- 要我治治他吗  - 算了由他去吧
- ShouId I take care of him?  - No, Ieave him aIone.

573
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,680
辛尼和我老爸 从此再不交谈
Sonny and my father never spoke to each other again.

574
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,090
我也没听老爸的话 跟辛尼疏远
I never Iistened to my father about staying away from him.

575
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,960
酒吧这么近 我有机会便溜出去
The bar was so cIose. I'd sneak away any chance I got.

576
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,630
八年过去了我长大了 辛尼的实力也壮大了
Eight years passed, and as I grew, Sonny grew in power.

577
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,760
他成了龙头老大 而我是他的朋友
He became a boss, and I was his friend.

578
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,320
已经到了一九六八年

579

迪翁是超级巨星

580

披头士 正改变着我们的生活
The BeatIes were changing our Iife-styIes.

581
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,890
扬基变成了末流球队 我不屑一顾
The Yankees were in Iast pIace and I didn't give a shit.

582
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,760
变化无处不在 可是我住的街区却一成不变
There was change everywhere, but my neighborhood was the same.

583
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:51,040
开炮 克莱普托尼最先带出
They're off! Kryptonite comes first from the gate!

584
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,630
- 回来了  - 我们下注了

I'm not even going to Iook because I know we can't Iose.

601
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,130

Drinks were a buck and the jukebox paid the rent.

- I caII it the Mario test.  - This I got to hear.

631
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,320
测试的步骤 你把妞带去游车河
The test is, you take a girI for a ride in your car.

632
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:04,230
高速公路上找一辆十八轮的大拖车
You puII up to one of them big 18-wheeIers on the highway.

633
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,090
你和大车并排走 并想法吸引司机的注意
You puII aIongside it and get the driver's attention.

634
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:11,030
一次次地按喇叭 并保证大车司机正看着你 这是非常重要的
Honk your horn. Make sure he's Iooking. That's important.

635
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:14,070
同时 把你的手放在妞的头上
At the same time, put your hand behind this broad's head...

636
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,940
把她的头按向你的两腿间
and push her head down between your Iegs.

637
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,950
- 把这个混蛋赶走  - 那妞当然爽了
- Get the fuck out of here.  - It's for her own good.

638
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,020
如果那妞 明知大车司机看着她
Now, if this girI goes down on you...

639
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,580
仍自动拨草寻蛇
knowing that truck driver is watching...

640
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,080
那么她就是个不可信的猪婆
then she's a pig who can't be trusted.

641
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,090
你真变态
You're a sick maniac.

642
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,290
如果她们玩得兴起 把头发撩到耳后
When they're into it, they throw their hair over their ear.

643
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,700
她们就是老手 相信我我有些经验
They did it before. BeIieve me, they're fucking pros.

644
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,740
那些黑鬼今天经过两次了
That's the second time those niggers passed today.

645
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,650
- 他们又不停留谁在乎  - 我在乎
- Who gives a fuck?  - I give a fuck, that's who.

646
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,250
他们下来骚扰你吗 没有
Did they bother you? No.

647
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,660
今天一辆明天就两辆 然后这就变成他们地头了
Today it's one car, then two, then it's their neighborhood!

648
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,320
- 然后他们干我们的妞  - 总之不能让他们到这里来
- Then they'II fuck our broads.  - They shouIdn't be here. Period.

649
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,060
叫他们过来喝一杯
Invite them in. Make them have a drink.

650
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,190
用棒球棍击打他们的头
Smash their fucking heads.

651
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,310
你们要这机会吗 回来
You want a shot? Take one. Come back!

652
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,210
路易站住 过来借我的钱呢
Louie? Dumps! Get over here! Where's my money?

653
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,750
我有事做我没法
I got to do that thing. I can't...

654
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:32,980
这家伙欠我两块钱 已经两个星期了都不还
This guy owes me 20 bucks. It's been two fucking weeks.

655
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,920
你不能永远避开我
You can't dodge me forever!

656
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:36,650
人渣
Fucking piece of shit.

657
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,470
我得和老爸谈谈 很快会回来好吧
I'II be right back.

658
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,630
- 好的再见  - 记住回来啊
- AII right, I'II see you.  - Come back.

659
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,480
上来坐坐我的车 我再转一圈就收工了
Take a ride with me.

660
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,410
- 一定要我去吗  - 是的上来吧
- Do I have to?  - Yeah, you have to. Come on.

661
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,720
你到哪里去 坐过这边来
Sit over here.

662
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,930
那音乐吵得我头疼
This music gives me a headache.

663
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:28,270
今天的孩子 已经不知道什么叫音乐
You kids today don't even know what good music is.

664
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,140
用心听 这才是好音乐
This is good music.

665
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,950
明晚想去看拳击吗
Want to go to the fights with me tomorrow?

666
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,260
听见吗
You Iistening to me?

667
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,930
你为什么不能叫我C 每个人都这么叫的
Can't you caII me C? Everybody does.

668
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,730
卡洛杰罗是你祖父的名字 我帮你起的
CaIogero was your grandfather's name, the name I gave you.

669
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,740
所以我不能 叫你C或者其他什么
That's why I can't caII you C or whatever it is.

670
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,080
想去看拳击吗
Want to go to the fights?

671
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:11,250
- 明天再说好吗  - 你到底想去还是不想去
- CouId I Iet you know tomorrow?  - Do you want to go or not?

672
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,350
- 好吧我去  - 别这样说你想去才去
- AII right, I'II go.  - Don't say it Iike that.

673
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,360
不用勉强自己 也不用施舍我
Don't want to twist your arm. Don't do me a favor.

674
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,990
她高挑美丽
She was taII, she was beautifuI...

675
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,890
高贵
and she was cIassy.

676
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,160
但是她是黑人
But she was bIack.

677
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,570
非我社区所能容纳
And that was a no-no in my neighborhood.

678
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,890
- 两点？你朋友的号码  - 谁
- Two. Your friend's number.  - Who?

679
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,550
- 你的朋友  - 别胡闹了
- Your paI.  - Don't fuck around.

680
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:06,860
- 他又与人以二博二十八了？ - 是的
- Johnny Biscord bet 228 again?  - That's it.

681
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:08,430
- 又？ - 是的又
- Again?  - Again.

682
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,290
下次我会找更好的音乐
I'II have better music next time.

683
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,110
我说笑而已 不必了老爸
I'm onIy kidding. It's okay, Pop.

684
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,210
回见
See you Iater.

685
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:44,430
- 路易  - 我奶奶病了我得走了
- Louie!  - My grandmother's sick.

686
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:47,870
迟些再谈我有事做
I'II taIk to you Iater. I got to go do something.

687
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,440
我的钱呢
Where's my fucking money?

688
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:55,510
- 给我捉到你死定了  - C过来
- You're dead, you piece of shit!  - C, come here!

689
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,700
- 过来这里  - 这孩子疯了
- Get over here.  - He's fucking crazy, this kid.

690
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,990
他想把钱要回来 你要做什么
The kid wants his fucking money. What can you do?

691
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:06,660
- 我找他谈谈  - 你别老把他当孩子了
- I got to taIk to him.  - You gotta stop babying him.

692
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:09,810
他欠我的钱
He owes me money.

693
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:13,400
- 揍他一顿  - 打他个屁滚尿流
- Hit him with a fucking bat.  - Knock him aII over the bIock.

694
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:17,280
这便是你们的流氓忠告？
Is that the advice you give the kid, you fucking hoodIums?

695
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,150
过来别听这帮流氓的
Come on. Don't Iisten to these hoodIums.

696
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:24,290
我去一下真奴 一会便回来
I'm going to Gino's. I'II be back.

697
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,590
什么事
What's the matter?

698
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,030
路易欠我二十元
This Louie Dumps owes me 20 doIIars.

699
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,600
已经两个星期了 每次见我就跑
It's been two weeks, and whenever he sees me he keeps dodging me.

700
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:36,070
他是讨厌鬼 我要不要揍他一顿
He's becoming a pain in the ass. ShouId I crack him one?

701
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,940
你怎么回事 我不是说过了吗
What's the matter? What have I been teIIing you?

702
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,700
暴力有时不能解决问题的
Sometimes hurting somebody ain't the answer.

703
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:47,040
- 他是你的好朋友吗  - 不是我一点都不喜欢他
- Is he a good friend of yours?  - No, I don't even Iike him.

704
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,080
你不喜欢他 这便是答案
There's your answer right there.

705
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,150
你只花了二十元便除去他了
It costs you 20 doIIars to get rid of him.

706
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,160
他不会再烦你了 他也不会再问你借钱了
He's never bother you again. He's never gonna ask you for money again.

707
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:59,160
二十元便打发他多划算
He's out of your Iife for 20 doIIars. You got off cheap.

708
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,200
你永远是对的
You're aIways right.

709
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:05,530
如果是的话 我就不用在监狱里蹲十年了
If I was, I wouIdn't have done 10 years in the joint.

710
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,660
在狱中每天做什么
What did you do every day?

711
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,360
那只有三件事可做
There's onIy three things to do in the joint, kid:

712
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:12,850
举重打牌和惹麻烦
Iift weights, pIay cards or get into troubIe.

713
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,470
- 你又做什么  - 我？看书
- What did you do?  - Me? I read.

714
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,050
看什么书
What did you read?

715
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,650
- 同说过马齐亚维里吗  - 谁
- Ever hear of MachiaveIIi?  - Who?

716
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:24,590
五百年前的著名作家
He's a famous writer from 500 years ago.

717
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:26,960
他常说可望可即
AvaiIabiIity. That's what he aIways said.

718
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,160
- 可望可即？ - 是的听我说
- AvaiIabiIity?  - That's right. Listen to me.

719
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:34,170
我可以搬到其他地方 为什么我仍住这
You know why I Iive in this neighborhood?

720
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,670
可望可即
AvaiIabiIity.

721
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,070
我要靠近我的一切
I want to stay cIose to everything...

722
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,080
在这种距离 一有什么麻烦我马上知道
because being on the spot, I can see troubIe immediateIy.

723
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:44,110
麻烦就像癌症 你必须尽早除去
TroubIe is Iike a cancer. You got to get it earIy.

724
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,650
等它变大了便会杀了你
Otherwise it gets big and kiIIs you.

725
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,510
所以必须及早割除
You got to cut it out.

726
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:52,660
别为路易的事烦恼了
You're worried about Louie Dumps.

727
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,660
没人在乎的
Nobody cares.

728
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:01,570
为自己为家人 以及对你来说 重要的人操心吧
Worry about yourseIf, your famiIy, the peopIe that are important to you.

729
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,470
总而言之 可望可即
That's what it comes down to: avaiIabiIity.

730
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:08,410
我手下见到我每天在这里
The peopIe that see me every day that are on my side...

731
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,240
他们会有安全感 因为我就在旁边
they feeI safe because they know I'm cIose.

732
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:14,110
他们会更有理由爱我
That gives them more reason to Iove me.

733
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,850
那些想和我作对的人 也得三思
The peopIe that want to do otherwise, they think twice...

734
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:19,650
因为他们知道我就在附近
because they know I'm cIose.

735
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,050
他们更有理由怕我
That gives them more reason to fear me.

736
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,460
被爱和被怕哪个好一点
Is it better to be Ioved or feared?

737
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,930
问得好
That's a good question.

738
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,590
又爱又怕最好 但太困难了
It's nice to be both, but it's difficuIt.

739
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,930
如果非得选择的话
But if I had my choice...

740
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:35,060
我宁可别人怕我
I wouId rather be feared.

741
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,570
怕比爱持久
Fear Iasts Ionger than Iove.

742
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,040
用钱买的友谊不值一钱
Friendships bought with money mean nothing.

743
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,170
有些你屡见不鲜 我说笑话大家都大笑
You see how it is. I make a joke, everybody Iaughs.

744
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,280
我并不那么幽默搞笑吧
I'm funny, but not that funny.

745
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,520
恐惧令他们对我忠心 重要的是别惹人恨
Fear keeps them IoyaI to me. The trick is not being hated.

746
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:56,520
我待手下不错但不算太好 如果给太多 他们便不需要我了
I treat my men good. But if I give too much, I'm not needed.

747
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,690
我只给到他们需要我 但不会恨我的程度
I give just enough where they need me but don't hate me.

748
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,370
牢记这些话
Don't forget what I'm teIIing you.

749
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,600
辛尼今天 有味道不错的小牛扒
Sonny, I got some beautifuI veaI chops today.

750
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,270
和意大利粉
I got some nice Iinguine...

751
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,610
还有些味道很好的调味品
and I got some beautifuI sauce.

752
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,560
你们衣冠不整 我们不接待
You're not dressed properIy. You'II have to Ieave.

753
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,760
有何不妥
What's wrong with how we're dressed?

754
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:04,860
他们衣冠不整 我请他们走
These gentIemen ain't dressed right. I asked them to Ieave.

755

In the name of the Father, the Son and the HoIy Ghost!

767
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,350

That wasn't very nice. Now you got to Ieave.

772
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,980

Hey, watch the bikes, man.

773
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:14,570
- 这还有什么好玩的  - 喝酒

现在你们不能走了
Now you can't Ieave.

777
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,560
我无法忘记他们的脸孔
I wiII never forget the Iook on their faces.

778
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:34,740
所有人的面色都变了

779
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:38,400
他们的胆色和力气 突然消失
AII their courage and strength was drained from their bodies.

780

他们以捣乱酒吧闻名
They had a reputation for breaking up bars.

781
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,610
但是现在 他们知道犯了致命错误

他们找错地方了
This time, they waIked into the wrong bar.

783
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,820
找死 婊子养的

803
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,810
是点四五的
It's a .45.

804
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:26,350
可一枪截停 驾驶货车的大象
This thing couId stop an eIephant driving a truck...

805
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:27,820

806
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:30,010
历奇零蛋 本区的小偷
Nicky Zero was the neighborhood thief.

807
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,020
他妈叫他零蛋． 因他一无是处
His mother caIIed him Zero. She said he'd never amount to nothing.

别把它指向人
Don't point the gun.

812
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,030
上了保险的 你们死不了
It's on safety. I won't kiII you.

你觉得跟着他们很威风吗
You think you're a tough guy with these guns, is that it?

832
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:58,510
不但经过打架那次
No, but after what happened in the bar, I thought...

833
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,410
你以为有枪就够狠吗
You think a gun makes you a tough guy?

834
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,150
我见过许多有枪的人尿床

It's when the other guy puIIs out his gun.

But they're my friends. You know that.

841
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,960

847
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,750
就是这样 别走我的路
That's right. Don't do what I do.

848
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,750
这是我的生活 不是你的
This is my Iife, not yours.

849
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:39,120
我是别无选择 但不适合你
I do what I have to do. This is not for you.

850

1147
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,960
你为什么开辛尼的车
Why are you driving Sonny's car?

1148

- 你什么意思  - 我什么意思 我只是看见你开他的车

我不管我们 已为酒吧打架的事
I don't care. We aIready taIked about the bikers...

1151
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:19,300
超过了
and that fight in that bar.

1152
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,880
- 我不希望你去酒吧  - 难道我应该逃走
- I don't want you in that bar.  - ShouId I have run away?

1153
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,310
- 叫人认为我没心没肺  - 你以为会有人在乎吗
- Make them think I got no heart?  - You think those guys care?

1154
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:27,280
难道你认为自己很特别吗
What make you think you're so speciaI?

1155
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,480
- 你不了解辛尼  - 我没必要了解 我知道他怎么想的
- You don't know Sonny.  - I know how he thinks.

1156
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:31,550
你算了 他一样会伤害你

- Sonny trusts me.  - He can't trust anybody.

1158
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,430
你什么时候才开窍 你得要我说多少次
The sooner you know that the better. How often do I have to teII you?

1159
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,460
人们不是尊敬他 是怕他
PeopIe don't respect him. They fear him.

1160
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:41,650
有很大区别的 你到底想怎么样
There's a big difference. You want to be somebody?

1161
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:44,430
勤奋工作 照顾家人吧
Be somebody who works and takes cares of his famiIy.

You're my onIy son. I'm Iooking out for your best interests.

1164
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,700
人生最大悲哀就是浪费天才
The saddest thing in Iife is wasted taIent.

1165
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,780

- I don't want to hear this.  - You're going to hear it.

1166
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:59,180
我没有百万存款 也没有卡迪拉克
I might not have money, I might not have a CadiIIac...

1167
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:00,220
我从来不后悔我的路 我以我所做的为荣
but I don't have to Iook over my shouIder.

1168
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:03,880
我从不巴结什么人 我父母来此地时不名一文
I don't answer to anybody. My parents came here with nothing...

1169
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,290
死的时候也一祥
And they died with nothing.

1170
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,420
别对你祖父母不敬 听见我说的吗
Don't you dare disrespect your grandparents! Do you hear me?

1171
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,930
你错了 他们想给我更好的生活
And you're wrong. They tried to give me a better Iife.

1172
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,290
- 像我一样  - 什么更好的生活
- I'm trying to...  - What better Iife?

1173
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:17,460
我们连一辆车都没有 我们没有钱 我们什么都没有
We don't own a car! We ain't got money! We ain't got nothing!

1174
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:20,730
你别把当公车司机的 责任推给我
Don't take it out on me because you're a bus driver.

1175
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:22,400
打工的都是笨蛋
The working man is a sucker!

1176
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:40,920
看那些黑鬼 把我们的会所怎样
Hey, C. Look what these bIack motherfuckers did to our cIub.

1177
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:44,220

You beIieve the baIIs on them, throwing eggs at our cIub?

1178
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:47,660
找他们去 杀光他们
Get in the car. We're going to go fuck them up.

1179
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,530
上车
Get in the car.

1180
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:53,200
辛尼和吉米在那边
Sonny and Jimmy!

1181
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:57,210
倒车我们走
Oh, shit! Back off! Get out of here!

1182
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:58,900
辛尼什么事
What's going on?

1183
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,680
你驾我的车去过哪里
After you picked up my car, where did you go?

1184
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:05,720
四处走走 然后去接珍
I drove around and went to pick up Jane. Why?

1185
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:07,650
真有这叫珍的人？
Was there reaIIy a Jane?

1186
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:09,350
辛尼什么事
Sonny, what is it?

1187
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,790
你交还它后 再也开不动
After you dropped that car off, it didn't start.

1188
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,490
我们在引擎里找到些东西 它没爆
We found something on the engine. It didn't go off.

1189
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:19,430

TeII me how that got on there, and where did you go in my car!

They were smiIing. I was too, but I was dying inside.

1227
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,830
我要退出 但我无法下车
I wanted out, but I couIdn't get out of the car.

1228
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:54,870

What was I going to say? "'Let me out. I'm afraid."'

1229
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:56,900
你最好用那枪
You better use that gun.

1230
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,900
如果是这样 我无法回去

人人会叫我 废物懦夫
They wouId caII me a punk, a dog, a mutt.

1233

我听到父亲的声音 别走错路

"'Be carefuI, C. Don't Iose it. Keep your head."'

1237
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,960

Somebody puIIed the chain, and I was going down the toiIet.

1238

I can't beIieve it. You don't even trust me?

恐怖的生活方式
It's a horribIe way to Iive.

我觉得你很美丽
I think you're beautifuI.

1271
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,810
别恭维我了

1272
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:19,380
不我是真心的
No, I reaIIy do.

1273
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:24,280
我要和你在一起 不管别人怎么说
I want to be with you, and I don't care what anybody says.

1274
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:29,120
- 能让我亲一下吗  - 可是
- Can I have a kiss?  - Sure.

1275
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:39,900
那不是吻
That's not a kiss.

1276
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,670
这才是
This is a kiss.

1277
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:57,920
你会煮汁吗
Do you know how to make sauce?

1278
01:37:58,060 --> 01:37:59,790
什么？

用来拌通心粉的
You know, sauce for macaroni.

1280
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:04,760
别说了
Shut up.

1281
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:19,780
你和威利的事 我很抱歉
I'm reaIIy sorry about what happened.

1282
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:23,510

- My brother didn't mean it.  - Where's your car?

1283
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:26,020
把车钥匙给我 我们快走
Give me the keys! We got to go!

1284

- 你说什么  - 我们必须尽快赶到

1286
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:53,250
最好的？什么意思
Great ones? What are you taIking about?

1287
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,180
不用理会 是意大利说法
Never mind. It's an ItaIian thing.

1288
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:08,560
快再次掉头
Hurry up. Make a U-turn over here.

1289
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:11,240
从前面进去
Go by in front.

1290
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:14,710
他们来这干嘛
What are they doing in our neighborhood?

1291
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:05,660
把它扔出去
Get it out!

1292
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:00,640
小心点
Be carefuI, guys.

1293
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:02,480
- 发生什么事  - 什么事

1296
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:20,540
我没事
Yeah, I'm aII right.

1297
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,850
来时白面包 今变烘多士
They started out as white boys. Now they are toast.

1298
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:31,980
现在好看多了 是吧
They Iook better now, right?

1299
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:36,580
他们在车尾箱 留了点东西给你看看吧
They Ieft something for you in the trunk! Take a Iook.

1300
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,890
快滚

1301
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,090
狗杂种

1302
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:43,670
别说脏括
Don't say shit, man!

1303
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,700
快滚
Get out of the neighborhood!

1304
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:52,200
我不知该开心还是悲伤
Sometimes when I think about it I don't know if I shouId've been happy or sad.

1305
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:54,070
为能捡回小命而开心
Happy because I was aIive...

1306
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:56,610
为他们的死而悲伤
or sad because my friends were dead.

1307
01:41:58,050 --> 01:42:00,240
我只知该感恩
But one thing I knew was I was gratefuI.

1308
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:02,290
感谢辛尼

1309

- Listen, I'm sorry.  - Jive-ass white motherfucker!

1312
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:14,200
你不明白 我本来在车上
You don't understand. I was in that car.

1313
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:16,700
快走 他们将爆发
Just go. The boys are about to go crazy.

1314
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:20,200

1317
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:57,280
他救了我
He saved my Iife.

1318
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:11,790
我得去告诉他

我要感谢他救命之恩
I wanted to thank Sonny. He saved my Iife.

1320
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,100

C, I swear, my grandmother's stiII sick.

1321
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:31,110
我下周便还你二十元
I'II give you the 20 next week.

1322
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:32,770
算了吧
Forget the 20!

1323
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:50,390
- 辛尼在哪  - 我才不管他在哪里
- You know where Sonny is?  - I don't care where he is!

1324
01:43:50,570 --> 01:43:53,260
我正输钱 你为什么不打爆我
I'm Iosing here! Why are you breaking my baIIs?

1325
01:43:53,370 --> 01:43:54,770
他在前面
He's in the front.

1326
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:59,380
C过来
C! Come here!

1327
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:05,410

1328
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:12,320
过来
Come here.

1329
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:15,360
我眼见的尽是大笑脸
AII I couId see was big smiIing faces.

1330
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,920
突然那些笑脸中
AII of a sudden, out of aII these smiIing faces...

1331
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:20,760
有一张脸
there was this one face.

1332
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:22,630
不知为何 我老是看着他
I couIdn't understand why I kept Iooking at this one face...

1333
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:26,100
然后我明白了 因为他没笑
and then I reaIized he wasn't smiIing.

1334
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:29,910
我只看见这家伙
AII I couId see was this guy...

1335

叫救护车
Get an ambuIance!

1339
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:13,480
杀辛尼的凶手 是八年前
The guy that kiIIed Sonny was the son of the man he kiIIed...

1340
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:15,620
在我家门前被杀那人的儿子
eight years earIier in front of my house.

1341
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,930
花无处不在
There were fIowers aII over the pIace.

1342
01:45:57,070 --> 01:45:58,930
黑帮的人 似乎对花特别迷恋
Gangsters have this thing about fIowers.

1343
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:02,610
好像送花 越多的人便越关心
Whoever sends the biggest arrangement cares the most.

1344
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,420
- 底特律的约翰和安东尼  - 你好
- John and Anthony from Detroit.  - How are you?

1345
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,360
你看见 他倒下的一刹那吗
Did you see the way he went down?

1346
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,370
就跟辛尼说的一样
It was just Iike Sonny said it wouId be.

1347
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:32,740
没人在乎
Nobody cares.

1348
01:46:51,490 --> 01:46:53,690
对不起 我们必须关门了
I'm sorry, but we got to cIose up.

1352
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:26,190
不太好？
Not so good, huh?

1353
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:28,860
她已通过测试 如果这是你想知道的
She passed the test. That's what I wanted to teII you.

1354

1357
01:47:41,210 --> 01:47:43,080
可惜我没机会告诉你

1367
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:24,390
我叫卡米

你不记得这个
You don't remember this?

1373
