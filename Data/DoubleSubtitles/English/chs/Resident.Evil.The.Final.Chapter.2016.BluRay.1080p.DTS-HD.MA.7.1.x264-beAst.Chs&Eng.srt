得了早衰症

一种无法治愈 不断恶化的致命疾病

早衰症导致她过早地衰老

到她二十五岁时

但机会渺茫

马库斯发现了T病毒
Marcus discovered the T-Virus.

24
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,650
一经注射
Once injected, it would

25
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,460
它就会发现并修复体内的受损细胞

那就是个奇迹

一夜之间 世界似乎进入了新纪元

事故很快被掩盖

与他的商业伙伴激烈争辩

亚历山大·艾萨克斯博士

我不在乎代价有多大
I don't care how much it costs.

42
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,960
我们必须停止这个项目

艾萨克斯博士监护起他死去的合伙人的孩子
Dr. Isaacs became the guardian of his dead partner's child.

50
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,620
于是属于她的半个公司也落入他手
And her half of the company.

51
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,700

完全为贪婪与权力所引诱

但它没能阻止空气传播感染

但你拖慢了我们的进度
but you slowed us down.

142
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,530
所以 我不得不亲自指挥
So much so, that I was obliged to take command myself.

143
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,250
你可以结束这一切
You could end all of this.

144
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,910
为何不呢
Why don't you?

145
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,270
有意思
Interesting.

146
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,710
有人跟你说了什么 不是吗
Someone told you something, didn't they?

147
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,040
你很快就会求着告诉我的
Oh, well, you'll be begging to tell me soon enough.

148
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,690
她是无神者
She's an unbeliever.

149
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,220
我们怎么处理无神者
What do we do with unbelievers?

150
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,400
驱逐她
Cast her out!

151
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,830
驱逐她 驱逐她
Cast her out! Cast her out!

152
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,240
- 来吧  - 驱逐她

153

驱逐她
Cast her out!

157
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,330

驱逐她
Cast her out!

160
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:05,020
上帝创造了一场洪水来净化地球
God created a flood to cleanse the Earth.

161
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,480
四十个日夜的大雨
40 days and 40 nights of rain.

162
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,040
我们的方法花的时间稍微长点
Our method is taking a little longer,

163
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,190
但结果会是一样的
but the result will be the same.

164
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,420
留下一个干净纯粹的世界
A world ready for the righteous and the pure to inherit.

165
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,930
我们将在十二小时后抵达浣熊市
We reach Raccoon City in just over 12 hours.

166
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,510
我怀疑即便是你也跑不了那么久
I doubt even you can run for that long.

167
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,300
我要知道你知道些什么
I want to know what you know.

168
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,080
她愿意开口时告诉我
Tell me when she's ready to talk.

169
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,370
- 威斯克  - 艾萨克斯博士
- Wesker.  - Dr. Isaacs.

170
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,010
看我在路边找到了什么
Look what I found on the roadside.

171
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,220
看来你的华盛顿任务
It would appear your mission to

172
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,790
没有你说的那么成功
Washington was less successful than you made out.

173
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,730
不可能
Impossible.

174
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,380
希望你没有再留下别的祸根了
I hope you didn't leave any other loose ends.

175
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,670
除此之外
There's something else.

176
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,740
我想她知道了空气传播病毒抗体的事
I think she knows about the airborne antivirus.

177
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,040
- 怎么可能  - 我还不知道 暂时
- How can that be?  - I don't know. Yet.

178
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,980
但我们是在去浣熊市的路上抓到的她
But we caught her on the road to Raccoon City.

179
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,000
她去那还能有什么原因
Why else would she be headed there?

180
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,920
把蜂巢的安保级别升至最高
Raise the security level at the Hive to maximum.

181
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,440
任何人不得进出 她开口了我会告诉你
No one in or out. I'll let you know when she talks.

182
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,310
上帝与你同在
God go with you.

183
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,000
你听见他说的了 安保级别升至最高
You heard him. Security level to maximum.

184
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,380
如你所愿
As you wish.

185

上去看看
Get up there and check it out.

186
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,810
给我解开
Release me!

187
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,180
- 把它们解开  - 好
- Open them.  - Alright.

188
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,200
好
Alright.

189
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,560
你骑不了它 你逃不了
You can't use it. You can't escape!

190
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,980
向她开火
Fire at her!

191
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,920
天哪
Jesus!

192
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,970
长官
Sir.

193
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,950
她逃跑了
She's gone.

194

[目标爱丽丝 安保卫星A43]

目标还有一百一十六公里 正在逼近

进入蜂巢
Make it to the Hive.

快放下否则我们开枪了
Put it down or we'll shoot!

205
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,940
我早说了的 医生
I told you, Doc!

206

我们早该在有机会的时候杀了她
We should've killed her when we had the chance!

210
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,790
放下 拜托 在他还没射杀我俩之前
Put it down, please. Before he tries to shoot the both of us.

211
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,370
这里面是什么
What's in this?

212
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,370
- 纯肾上腺素 我需要叫醒你  - 为什么

213
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,550

在你进来的方向 大家伙

放了他 快放下
Let him go! Put it down, now!

216

爱丽丝
Alice.

217
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,400
保护伞公司在阿卡迪亚抓住了我

00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,350
我们被押往一处叫蜂巢的地方

仍然冲着我们这过来

224
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,800
你知道那是什么吗

225
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,240
保护伞公司 艾萨克斯博士

我也以为

他有支僵尸军队 几小时内就会到这
He has an army of undead with him. He'll be here within hours.

229
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,320
- 我们怎么办  - 我们为什么要问她
- What do we do?  - Why the hell are we asking her?

230
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,730
她是个陌生人 我们不能信任她
She's a stranger. We shouldn't have trust her...

231
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,110
听着 我才不管…
Listen, I don't care...

232
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,650
别碰我 医生
Don't you touch me, Doc!

233
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,070
- 把枪放下 克里斯汀  - 你把枪放下
- Put it down! Christian!  - You put it down!

看着我 就因为
Look at me. Just cause you

你觉得自己应该当老大 并不代表你就是
think you should be in charge, doesn't make it so.

237
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,880
你给我听好了 医生
You listen to me, Doc.

238
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,550
你会后悔的 你们都会

我必须得去蜂巢

241
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,730
你得带他们离开这里
You have to get these people out of here.

242
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,900
我们这有孩子 伤员还有老人
We have children. Injured. The elderly.

243
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,680
跑出去他们哪还有生还的可能
Now what chance do they have on the open road?

244
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,720
概率总比待在这里的大
Better than they have here.

245
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,920
- 这栋楼很安全  - 或许是不怕僵尸
- This building is secure.  - Maybe from the undead.

246
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
但艾萨克斯有装甲车
But Isaacs has armored vehicles.

247

火箭发射器 还有重机枪
Rocket launchers, heavy ordinance.

248
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,870
他们会把这里夷为平地的
They're gonna tear this place wide open.

医生
Doc!

250
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,420
她怎么了
So what happened to her?

251
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,630
她中了我们在防线上设置的一处陷阱
She's set off one of the traps we had on perimeter.

252
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,390
不是给僵尸准备的
Not intended for the undead.

253
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,700
- 这是什么  - 当日特饮
- What is this?  - Specialty of the house.

254
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,180
能让你立马振作起来
Have you in your feet in no time.

255
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,680
我为什么要相信你
Why should I trust you?

256
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,230
给
Here.

257
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,650
医生 麻烦你出来一下
Doc, you need to get out there.

258
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,150
大家都很害怕 克里斯汀完全在帮倒忙
People are scared and Christian's not helping.

259
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,400
我们得让大家清楚状况
We need to let people know what's happening.

260
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,240
好
Okay.

261
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,230
我得走了
I've got to go.

262
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,970
你朋友不会有事的
Hey. Your friend's gonna be okay.

263
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:41,970

265
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,790
蜂巢里有什么
So what's in the Hive?

266
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,460
保护伞公司研究出了解药
Umbrella developed a cure.

267
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,020
一种空气传播的抗体病毒
An airborne antivirus.

268
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,860
一经接触就能摧毁T病毒感染过的一切
It'll destroy anything infected with the T-Virus on contact.

269
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,870
- 谁告诉你的 你竟然相信她  - 红后
- Who told you this? And you believed her?  - The Red Queen.

270
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,140
如果我们能结束这一切呢
What if we could end all this?

271
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,800
那你呢 他们也给你注射了T病毒
What about you? They infected you with the T-Virus.

272
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,750
你要释放的这种病毒抗体也会杀死你
You release this antivirus, it's going to kill you.

273
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,260
- 我不在乎  - 爱丽丝 我不…
- Whatever it takes.  - Alice, I'm not...

274
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,940
你知道我是对的
You know I'm right.

275
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,280
好吧
All right.

276
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,430
我们先打败艾萨克斯 救下这些人
We stop Isaacs here. We save these people,

277
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,520
然后我们一起去蜂巢
and then we go together.

278
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,740
我们时间不多了
We don't have long.

279
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,560
开始行动吧
Let's get to it.

280

423
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,350
我只剩枪膛里的子弹
I only got one round left.

424
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,600
我还有一个备用弹夹
One spare mag and then I'm out.

425
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,370
没枪没弹药 我们下来干吗
No guns, no ammo, what the hell are we gonna do down here?

426
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,610
爱丽丝 灯怎么灭了
Alice. What's with the lights?

427
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,540
蜂巢有一部分受损
There's a part of the Hive that's damaged.

428
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,870
- 电力不稳定  - 拿上这个
- Power's erratic.  - Here. Take this.

429
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:47,860
你们看
Hey. Look.

430
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,590
你之前问我为什么背叛保护伞公司
You asked why I'd turn against Umbrella.

431
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:02,480
我承诺过会告诉你原因
And I promised you an answer.

432
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,890
在T病毒泄露后不久
Soon after the T-Virus was released,

433
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,970
一份机密文件上传到了我的数据流
a secret file was uploaded to my data stream.

434
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:11,400
那是一份病毒爆发前十七个月召开的
It was a recording of a meeting of the Umbrella High Command.

435
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:15,530
保护伞公司高层会议的记录
Dated 17 months before the viral outbreak occurred.

436
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,830
我们今天在这儿
We're here today,

437
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,840
不仅要讨论公司的未来
not just to talk about the future of this company.

438
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:23,490
我们也要讨论它的使命
We're here to talk about its destiny.

439
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,280
以及世界的终结
We're here to talk about the end of the world.

440
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,470
我们就站在末日边缘
We stand on the brink of Armageddon.

441
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,640
我们承受着无法治愈的疾病
Diseases for which we have no cure.

442
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,250
原教旨主义自求毁灭
Fundamentalist states who call for our destruction.

443
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,870
面对核武器我们束手无策
Nuclear powers over which we have no control.

444
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,290
即使我们渡过这一切的难关
And even if we navigate these dangerous waters,

445
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,100
还是会面临其他更不可避免的威胁
we face other even more inevitable threats.

446
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:49,590
全球变暖将在八十年内融化两极的冰盖
Global warming will melt the polar ice caps within 80 years,

447
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,930
淹没地球上百分之九十的可居住地
flooding 90 % of all habitable areas on Earth.

448
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,420
要不了五十年 食物产量就会无法供应
Unchecked population growth will overtake

449
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,320
疯狂增长的人口将导致饥荒和战争
food production in less than 50 years leading to famine and war.

450
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,410
这不是猜测 而是事实
This is not conjecture. This is a fact.

451
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,880
无论怎样 我们的世界正在走向终结
One way or another, our world is coming to an end.

452
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,200
问题在于 我们要随之一起灭绝吗
The question is, will we end with it?

453
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:14,990
你有什么提议
What do you propose?

454
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,620
我提议由我们来终结世界…
I propose that we end the world...

455
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,290
以我们的方式
But on our terms.

456
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:25,470
进行一场精心策划的世界末日
An orchestrated apocalypse.

457
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,470
清除地球上的人口
One that would cleanse the world of its' population

458
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,780
但完整保留其基础设施和资源
but leave its infrastructure and resources intact.

459
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,460
这一想法曾经成功实施过
It's been done once before. With great success.

[《圣经》]

461
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,140
被选中的少数人将会度过这场灾难
The chosen few will ride out the storm,

462
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,670
不是在创世纪中的诺亚方舟上
not in an ark as in the book of Genesis, but in safety.

463
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,840
而是在安全的地下 当末日结束后
Underground. And when it's over,

464
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,930
我们会回到一个净化过的地球
We will emerge onto a cleansed Earth.

465
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:54,090
重建我们想象中的辉煌
One we can then reboot. In our image.

466
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:57,650
你打算怎么实现
And just how do you intend to achieve this?

467
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,170
救世之法已然就绪
The means of our salvation are already at hand.

468
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:06,000
请看 T病毒
I give to you, the T-virus.

469
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,190
他们是故意泄露的
They released it deliberately.

470
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,780
这份记录传到我数据流的时候
When this recording was uploaded to my data stream,

471
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,560
对我的程序造成了冲突
it created a conflict in my programming.

472
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,660
我被创造出来为保护伞公司服务
I was created to serve the Umbrella Corporation,

473
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,030
但也被设定为是珍视人类生命的
but I was also programmed to value human life.

474
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:25,750
艾萨克斯博士准许病毒泄露
Dr. Isaacs allowed the virus to escape.

475
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,640
他杀害了七十亿人
He murdered over 7 billion people.

476
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,130
我的程序不允许我
My programming will not allow me

477
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:34,000
伤害保护伞公司的员工
to harm an employee of the Umbrella Corporation.

478
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,090
我无法阻止艾萨克斯博士 但你可以
I am powerless to stop Dr. Isaacs, but you are not.

479
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:42,280
三十七分钟后 最后一个人类据点也将被摧毁
In 37 minutes, the last of the human settlements will fall.

480
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,280
无人能够生还
There will be no survivors.

481
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,740
你必须在这
It is imperative

482
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,350
发生之前释放病毒抗体
that you release the antivirus before this occurs,

483
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,340
否则保护伞公司就赢了
or Umbrella will have won.

484
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,170
最后还有一件事
There is one last thing.

485

There is an earpiece in front of you. Put it in.

I cannot, in my actions,

487

去伤害保护伞公司的员工
harm an employee of the Umbrella Corporation.

488
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:06,030
但我可以告诉你
But I can tell you

489
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,040
保护伞公司在浣熊市有个线人
that Umbrella had an informant in Raccoon City.

I'm glad to see you, Dr. Isaacs.

00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,280

- Then resume course for Raccoon City.  - She's not there.

- What?  - She went to the pit. We have to follow.

01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:07,760
我知道怎么回事
I know exactly what's happening.

563
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,340
出了个叛徒
We've been betrayed.

564
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:24,090
没错
That's right!

565
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,940
来我这
Over here!

566
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:31,140
来 都过来
Come on. That's it!

567
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:32,810
跟着我
Follow me!

568
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,020
走
Let's go.

569
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:54,140
坏孩子回来了
The bad seed returns.

570
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,990
还是说浪子回头了
Or is it the prodigal daughter?

571
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:59,240
别傻站在那儿了 过来吧
Well, don't just stand there. Come in.

572
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:03,300
毕竟你只剩九分钟拯救世界了
After all, you have only 9 minutes to save the world.

573
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:06,240
你是本体吗
You're really him?

574
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,110
事情一件一件办
First things first,

575
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:09,620
你先把武器放到地上
I'm gonna need you to place your weapons on the floor.

576
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,340
我凭什么听你的
Why would I wanna do that?

577
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,480
你就是想要这个 对吧
This is what you're after, yes?

578
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:17,750
抗病毒剂 终结这一切的解药
The Antivirus. The cure to all this.

579
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,410
然而只有这么一管
Well, there's only one vial.

580
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:24,570
我们在地下八百米的密封设施里
We're half a mile underground in a sealed facility.

581
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:27,420
我一摔 抗病毒剂没了
I drop it here, the antivirus goes nowhere,

582
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:32,080
你的妄想只会更快灰飞烟灭
and your hopeless dreams will die sooner rather than later.

583
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,580
这才乖嘛
Good girl.

584
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:52,030
- 你还没放下枪  - 没错
- You're still armed.  - Yes, I am.

585
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:54,340
克莱尔得多么失望
Claire would be so disappointed.

586
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,390
再过几分钟 克莱尔就死了
In a few minutes, Claire will be dead.

587
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,060
和其他你认识的人一样
Along with everybody else you know.

588
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,660
真动听
That's sweet.

589
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,730
抱歉 亲爱的
Sorry. My love.

590
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:09,520
把武器和起爆器都放下 离远点
Move away from the weapon. And the detonator. Come on.

591
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,630
她在储藏高管的冷冻室安了炸药
She placed explosives in the High Command cryo tubes.

592
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:16,590
我去拆了
I'll disarm them.

593
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:19,790
谢谢 你做得很好 医生
Thank you. You've done well, Doc.

594
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,510
省省吧 你拿不到的
Don't bother. You don't make it.

595
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:58,340
碎冰锥 酒瓶 还有钢笔
To the ice pick, the decanter or the fountain pen.

596
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:02,550
[格斗预测软件]

597

601
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,090
然后 你的问题的答案是 是的
And, in answer to your question, yes...

602
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:31,500
除去做过的几处技术性升级
apart from a few technological upgrades,

603
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,330
我就是亚历山大·罗兰德·艾萨克斯博士
I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

604
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:36,230
本体
The original.

605
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:38,800
我在外面遇到的那位 他也是这么认为的
The one I met out there, he thought exactly the same thing.

606
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,340
那当然 他们的设定就是这样
Of course he did. That's how they're designed.

607
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,650
只要让他们自认为自己是本体
They always try harder and fight longer even to death

608
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:47,470
他们就会拼了命厮杀至死
as long as they think they're the real thing.

609
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:49,030
毕竟谁会想知道自己只是
After all, who wants to know they're

610
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:52,120
可怜的仿造品 无用的复制品呢
just a poor imitation, or a worthless copy?

611
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,120
和你一样
Which brings us to you.

612
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,830
- 不  - 得了吧
- No.  - Oh come now.

613
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:01,460
你觉得你自己是本体
You thought you were the original.

614
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:05,550
太可爱了
How delicious.

615
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,760
不 恐怕这位才能冠此殊荣
No, I'm afraid she holds that dubious honor.

616
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,360
爱丽西亚·马库斯
Alicia Marcus,

617
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,400
我的老搭档詹姆斯的女儿
daughter of my old partner, James.

618
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,640
保护伞公司的共有人
Co-owner of the Umbrella Corporation

619
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,960
也是我的眼中钉
and a painful thorn in my side.

620
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,900
我想除掉的绊脚石
What I now intend to remove.

621
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:24,370
快没时间了 爱丽丝
Time, is running out, Alice.

622
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:26,720
你必须马上杀了他
You must kill him soon.

623
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,540
我也很高兴见到你 爱丽西亚
It's good to see you too, Alicia.

624
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:32,830
马库斯为了救她研发出了T病毒
Marcus created the T-Virus to save her

625
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,430
可惜效果并不持久
but the effects didn't last.

626
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:37,950
我一直在等着她死
I've been waiting years for her to die.

627
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,780
我不是…
I'm not...

628
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,720
- 我不是克隆人  - 是吗
- I'm not a clone.  - Really?

629
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:46,490
你肯定会奇怪为什么你想不起童年的事吧
You must've wondered why you remember nothing of your childhood.

630
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,450
你的父亲 你的母亲
Your father. Your mother.

631
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:52,260
我失忆了
Memory loss.

632
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:56,520
不 你没有记忆是因为你没有经历过
No. You have no memory because you had no life.

633
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:00,510
我们十年前创造出你的之前全都是空白
Nothing before the mansion, when we created you, 10 years ago.

634
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:03,400
- 我知道我是谁  - 我可不这么觉得
- I know who I am.  - I don't think so.

635
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:07,230
你只不过是一只断了线的木偶
You're nothing more than a puppet whose strings were cut.

636
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:09,420
到处晃悠了一阵
And then you wandered around for a little while

637
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,670
就自以为是真人了
thinking you were a real girl.

638
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:14,000
可你并不是 你只是个聪明的克隆体
But you're not. You're just a clever imitation.

639
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:15,820
复制品
A facsimile.

640
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:18,140
让人头疼的复制品罢了
A rather troublesome one at that.

641
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,590
你骗我
You're lying to me.

642
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,830
他说的是真的
I'm afraid he's not.

643
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:25,970
你是以她的模样创造的 我也是
You were created in her image, as was I.

644
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:28,080
我的模样和声音都提取自
My likeness and voice were based on

645
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:32,500
爱丽西亚·马库斯父亲所拍摄的童年录像
childhood recordings of Alicia Marcus, made by her father.

646
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:36,530
你的基因结构提取自她的DNA
Your genetic structure is based on her DNA,

647
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:40,770
调整以避免患上折磨她的早衰症
tweaked to avoid the progeria aging disease that afflicted her.

648
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:43,220
我是她小时候的模样
I'm the child she was.

649
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,470
你是她本该长成的女性模样
You are the woman she would've been.

650
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:46,840
不
No.

651
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:51,470
你比我要强大得多
You are so much better than I ever could be.

652
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,580
是我导致的这一切
I let this happen.

653
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,600
我太软弱了
I was weak.

654
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,450
你不能变成我这样
You cannot afford to be.

655
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:00,770
没时间了 爱丽丝
Time is running out, Alice.

656
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,220
太感人了
Ah, how touching.

657
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:07,070
三贱客 被仇恨团结在一起
The trinity of bitches, united in their hatred.

658
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:09,140
然而并没有什么用
Not that it'll do you any good.

659
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:11,220
我总能先你一步
I've been ahead of you every step of the way.

660
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:14,010
你什么也改变不了 你谁也拯救不了
You've changed nothing. You've saved no one.

661
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:15,690
这个世界仍将被清除
The world will still be cleansed

662
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,180
保护伞公司仍将是最后的赢家
and the Umbrella Corporation will triumph.

663
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,490
唯一不同的是
The only difference is,

664
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,160
我再也不必听你那自以为是的牢骚了
I'll no longer have to listen to your self-righteous whining.

665
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,840
当你把那份文档上传至红后的数据流时
When you uploaded that file to the Red Queen's data stream,

666
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,790
你就已经背叛了公司
you turned against the Corporation.

667
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:29,180
等其他董事会成员被唤醒后
When the rest of the board awake,

668
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:30,650
你将会被撤职
you'll be replaced.

669
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:33,520
而我将掌控全局
And I will assume complete control.

670
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,300
我还拥有百分之五十的公司股权
I still own 50 % of this company.

671
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:39,720
你准备拿它做什么呢
And what do you intend to do with that?

672
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:43,540
你是公司的共有者
You are co-owner of this corporation.

673
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:47,700
威斯克呢 他仍是个雇员
But Wesker? Wesker is still an employee.

674
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:50,970
我不必听你指令 我只忠诚于他
I don't have to take your orders. My loyalties are with him.

675
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:51,910
我知道
I know.

676
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:57,420
阿尔伯特·威斯克 你被解雇了
Albert Wesker, you're fired.

677

[保护伞公司员工 不许伤害]

678

[普通人 不受保护]

679
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:21,890
你怎么知道是我
How did you know it was me?

680
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:23,850
因为你还活着
You're still alive.

681
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,010
不要 我当时别无选择
Please. It wasn't like I had a choice.

682
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:32,200
- 是他们逼我的  - 别担心
- They made me do it.  - Don't worry.

683
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,550
我不杀你
I'm not gonna kill you.

684
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:41,730
- 克莱尔 是我啊  - 抱歉
- Claire, it's me.  - Sorry.

685
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:44,640
- 不要  - 亲爱的
- Please.  - My love.

686
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:46,630
不要啊
No, no, no!

687
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,200
只要你一直按着这个起爆器
If you keep this trigger depressed,

688
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:53,340
你的保护伞美梦就不会破灭
you keep Umbrella's dreams alive.

689
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,490
早知当初我在华盛顿就该杀了你
I should have killed you in Washington.

690
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,900
没错
Yeah.

691
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:03,570
他只需再躲着你几分钟
He only has to evade you for another few minutes.

692
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:07,820
最后一处幸存者聚集地就将沦陷
And the last remaining human outposts will fall.

693
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,780
我们得截住他 然后以最快方式到达地面
We need an intercept path. And the fastest way to the surface.

694
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:14,560
已完成
Already done.

695
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:18,400
如果你释放了抗病毒剂
If you release the Antivirus,

696
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:23,760
它就会杀死所有感染T病毒的生物体
it will kill all organisms infected with the T-Virus.

697
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:28,910
你知道这意味着什么吧 对你来说
You know what that means, don't you, for you?

698
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:31,710
- 我知道  - 爱丽丝 不行
- I know.  - Alice. You can't!

699
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:34,840
