00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,460
不会占用您太多时间

16
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,030

20
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,460
能不能就谈我的心脏问题

请您直接回答问题 好吗

我手指也没毛病啊
There's nowt wrong with me fingers either.

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,190
怎么离我的心脏越来越远了
I mean, we're getting farther and farther away from me heart.

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,110
请您回答问题 谢谢配合
If we could just keep to these questions, thank you.

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,400
您在向陌生人传达简单信息时
Do you have any significant difficulty

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,060
是否有较大的困难？

31
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,070
有 我反复跟你说我的心脏问题 可你就是不听啊
Yes. Yes, it's me fucking heart. I 'm trying to tell you but you'll not listen.

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,870
布莱克先生 如果您再使用这种语气
Mr Blake, if you continue to speak to us like that

33
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,780
会直接影响您的评估结果
that's not gonna be very helpful for your assessment.

34
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,410
请您直接回答问题
If you could just answer the question, please.

No. But I cannot guarantee

38
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,170
我就真要失禁了

42

67
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,500
我在等一个很重要的包裹

75
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,670
现在肯定不行
Ah, not yet, that's for certain.

76
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,300
但你正在恢复
You're making progress.

77
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,840
要保持相同的药量
I think if we just continue you on the same dosage.

78
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,260
继续做复健练习
And, yeah, rehab exercise.

79
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,260
看能不能提高心脏的供血能力

如果没有 就要装一个心脏除颤器
But if not, we might need to look at fitting you with a defibrillator.

82
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,070
坚持锻炼和走动 会恢复得更快
Keep up with the exercise, keep moving. That's gonna build you up.

83
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,900
同时也需要多休息

Depends on the work, I suppose.

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,440
你也知道 最近不太景气
I mean, you know what it's like. It's up and down.

133
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,520
要拉回你自己家拉去
Take it to your own place and let it shit round there.

134
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,700
- 去找个袋子捡起来  - 哦
- Go and get a bag and clean that up.  - Aye, I'm gonna get a bag

135
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,860
少废话
I tell you what, ye talk shite!

136
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,410
快点找个袋子
Here, look, you just get a bag!

137
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,780
- 把狗屎清了再走  - 闭嘴吧
- Come back here and bloody clean that up.  - Oh, shut up, man, will you!

138
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,530
我去你家花园拉个屎行不行
Hey! I'll come and shite in your garden, shall I?

139
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,000
闭嘴吧
Shut up.

140
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,550
喂
Hello?

141
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,010
感谢您的耐心等待
Thank you for waiting.

142
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,470
请不要挂机 我们会尽快接听您的电话
Please continue to hold and we will answer your call as soon as possible.

143
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,990
你好 这是马科斯·米利安的包裹
Morning, mate. Got a package for Mr Max Million.

144
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,750
- 马科斯·米利安？ - 对 就是他
- "Mr Max Million"?  - Yeah. Mr Max Million.

145
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,080
送到我家的？
My address?

146
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,840
地址没错
Yeah, definitely this address.

147
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,630
- 从哪寄来的  - 中国
- Where's it from?  - China.

148
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,670
拿进来吧
Oh. Give it here.

149
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,590
你知道我等了多久吗
D'you know how long I've been on this phone?

150
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,170
一小时四十八分钟
One hour, forty-eight minutes.

151
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,420
老天 比一场足球赛还长 电话费要上天了
Jesus Christ, that's longer than a football match. It'll cost a fortune.

152
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,090
很抱歉 先生 我们今天很忙
I'm sorry, sir, but it's been very busy.

153
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,590
肯定是哪里搞错了吧
There must be some mistake.

154
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,510
我有很严重的心脏病
I've got a serious heart condition.

155
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,220
我正在休养 医生不让我回去工作
I'm in rehab and the doctor's told us I cannae go back to work.

156
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,690
本来还能领福利 现在又搞什么评估
Now, I was getting the benefits fine until that bloody assessment.

157
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,070
您的评估只获得了十二分
I see you've only scored twelve points, er,

158
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,900
您需要十五分才能继续领取福利
and you need 15 to obtain benefits.

159
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,110
什么分数 你们花样够多的
Oh, points, that's your game?

160
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,950
抱歉先生 据医保…
I'm sorry, sir, but according to our health, er,

161
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,620
医保专业人员的记录
health care professional,

162
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,080
您目前尚有工作能力
you've been deemed fit for work.

163
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,050
这么说她比我的外科顾问医生
So she knows better than my doctor,

164
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,840
和专业理疗团队还厉害？
a consultant surgeon and a physio team?

165
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,630
我要申诉
Well, I wanna appeal.

166
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,000
可以
Well, that's fine,

167
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,250
但您要先申请“强制再评估”
but you'll have to first request a mandatory reconsideration.

168
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,930
这他妈又是什么意思
What the bloody hell does that mean?

169
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,630
意思是 决策者会重新考虑您的申请
It means the decision maker will reconsider it

170
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,680
如果依然驳回 您才能开始申诉
and if he comes to the same decision, you can then appeal.

171
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,900
行 那我就再评估吧
Right, well put us down for that, then.

172
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,900
可以 但您要先等
Okay, sir, but you must wait

173
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,640
决策者给您打电话
to get a call from the decision maker.

174
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,310
为什么
Why?

175
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,020
告诉您他们再次考虑的结果
To tell you what the decision is.

176
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,520
不是已经出结果了吗
But that's already been decided.

177
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,940
是 但在收到信函之前
It is, but you're supposed to get the call,

178
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,540
他们会先打电话给您
before the letter.

179
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,330
他们还会改变主意不成
Well, is he gonna change his mind?

180
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,910
不 电话内容就是讨论评估结果
No, the call's just to discuss the decision.

181
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,790
结果我知道啊 信函就放在我面前呢
Well, I know what the decision is, I've got the letter here in front of us.

182
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,670
不然我读给你听听
D'you want us to read it to you?

183
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,800
收信前应该接到电话才对啊
But he should have called you first.

184
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,210
可他没打啊
But he didn't.

185
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,170
但他应该打啊
But he should have.

186
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,590
除非穿越回去 否则咱是扯不清了
Well unless we've got a time machine, we're pretty much knackered,

187
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,060
对吧
divvent you agree?

188
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,630
您必须先接到决策者的电话 先生
Er, he has to call you first, sir.

189
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,340
听着
Listen,

190
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,680
让他现在接电话吧 别再浪费时间了
can you not just put him on now, so I don't have to waste any more time?

191
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,680
这不行 先生
I can't do that, sir.

192
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,480
他人在哪
Where is he?

193
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,400
他一有时间就会
He'll give you a call back when he, er,

194
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,700
- 给您电话的  - 什么时候
- he gets the chance.  - When?

195
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,980
我也不知道 先生
 I don't know, sir.

196
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,120
真是邪了门了
This is ridiculous, man.

197
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,480
一方面 失业津贴只发放
On the one hand, Jobseeker's Allowance,

198
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,480
给有工作能力的人
only for those able and ready to work.

199
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,070
如果您有疾病 就只能申请就业支持津贴
But if you're ill, you have to apply for Employment and Support,

200
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,940
并通过相关评估
get an assessment carried out.

201
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,450
我评估过了 但被驳回了
Well, I've done that but they've knocked us back.

202
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,480
如果您被判定具备工作能力
Right, well if you've been deemed fit for work,

203
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,740
您就只能申请失业津贴
your only option is Jobseeker's Allowance.

204
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,830
或进行就业支持津贴的申诉
Or proceed with the appeal on Employment and Support.

205
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,240
你能给我张…
Well, can you give me a form for...

206
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,790
失业津贴 和
You know, erm, Jobseeker's Allowance

207
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,330
就业支持津贴的申诉表格吗
and then an appeal form Employment and Support?

208
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,820
表格需要在网上填写
You have to apply online, sir.

209
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,030
我不会上网啊
I cannot do that.

210
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,500
没办法先生 您也可以拨打求助热线
Well that's how it is, sir. Or you can phone the helpline.

211
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,750
要是给我张图纸
Listen, you know, you give me a plot of land,

212
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,080
我分分钟就能盖房子
I can build you a house.

213
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,750
可我这辈子都没碰过电脑
But I've never been anywhere near a computer.

214
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
我们是默认数字化系统
D'you know what, we're digital by default.

215
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,060
又来了
Oh, here we gan.

216
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,760
“默认数字化” 电话上都听烦了
I hear this all the time on the phone, "I'm digital by default."

217
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,590
我还“默认铅笔化”呢
Well I'm pencil by default.

218
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,470
那些不会上网的人怎么办
Look, I mean, what happens if you just cannae do it?

219
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,940
如果您有阅读障碍 我们有专属热线
There's a special number if you've been diagnosed as dyslexic.

220
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,650
行啊 反正我在电脑上就是个文盲
Right, well can you give us that? Cos with computers I'm dyslexic.

221
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,770
该选项可以在网页上找到 如果您没有预约
You'll find it online, sir. I must ask you to leave now,

222
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,480
我得请您离开了
if you've got no appointment.

223
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,240
你有事吗
Right, can I help you?

224
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,500
我来是想换掉现在的工作指导
Yeah, I'm here to see about changing my work coach.

225
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,950
托马斯·阿姆斯特朗
Thomas Armstrong, please.

226
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,800
请等一下 托马斯
Hang on a minute, Thomas, hang on.

227
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,300
您需要坐一下吗
Erm, would you like to take a seat?

228
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,880
我缓一缓就好 突然有点头晕
Oh, I just need a minute. I just felt... I'm just feeling dizzy, you know.

229
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,800
- 来坐会吧  - 谢谢
- Come and sit down.  - Oh, cheers, thanks.

230
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,300
能挪一下吗
Could you move up, please, love?

231
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,060
多谢了
Thanks, pet, thank you.

232
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,610
- 好了 我给您拿杯水吧  - 谢谢
- All right. I'll just get you a glass of water.  - Thank you.

233
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,700
谢谢
Oh, thank you, pet. Thank you.

234
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,610
没事吧 看您脸色不太好
Are you all right? You look a bit pale.

235
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,830
这些术语 都把我搞晕了
It's just so bloody confusing, all the jargon.

236
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,420
肯定是哪搞错了 我一直在兜圈子
I mean, there must be some mistake. I'm just ganning round and round in circles.

237
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,210
我今天真的需要把事情办好
I've, I've really gotta get this sorted out.

238
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,760
这我明白 但你确实来晚了
Oh I can understand that, but you were late.

239
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,510
托马斯 您喝点水休息一下吧
Thomas. You sit here and drink your water, pet.

240
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,840
谢谢
Thank you.

241
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,230
现在你要处罚我了…
So now you're gonna sanction me so, er...

242
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,850
- 我不是要处罚你  - 我可能会一个月拿不到钱啊
- No, I'm not gonna sanction you.  - I may not get any money for a month.

243
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,310
我会把你的情况上报给决策者 他们会做最终裁决
I'm gonna refer you to the decision maker and they'll make the decision

244
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,310
- 看是否进行处罚  - 不可理喻…
- on whether they're gonna sanction you.  - That's ridiculous...

245
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
我无权决定 他们才有
I'm not actually making the decision, they're gonna do that.

246
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,640
如果决定处罚
And then if they do decide to sanction you,

247
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,850
福利会削减百分之四十
then you will take a 40% cut in your benefits.

248
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,910
我知道 你不用再科普了
I know what it is, I don't need you to explain it to me.

249
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,740
- 我清楚得很…  - 今天就这样
- I'm more than aware...  - Well there isn't anything else

250
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
也只能先到这为止了
anybody can do today.

251
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,360
那我现在只能…
So what I'm gonna have to do is, look, I think I'm...

252
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,160
我只能… 你真的要把我提交处罚？
I've decided to... Are you gonna put me in for a sanction?

253
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,320
没办法 要遵守规定
I have to, I have to follow the rules.

254
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,910
如果您态度再这么恶劣
And the thing is if you're gonna, be aggressive with me

255
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,590
- 我就必须要求…  - 我态度恶劣根本不是重点
- then I'm gonna have to ask you...  - It's not about me being aggressive.

256
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,460
- 我就必须要求您离开了  - 我只是在说明情况
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.  - I'm trying to explain to you a situation

257
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,620
你却毫不关心
and you don't care.

258
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,580
- 保安 保安呢  - 你根本不配做这份工作
- Er, security. Security?  - I don't know why people like you do this job.

259
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,870
我会上报给决策者的
I'm referring you to the decision maker.

260
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,800
还不是一样的结果 你这样说话我不想听
It's all the same thing. I don't wanna hear your language

261
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,670
- 你说什么  - 不好意思
- I, I beg your pardon.  - Listen, I, I'm sorry, love,

262
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,420
- 请您离开  - 行啊 反正很显然
- but you're gonna have to leave.  - Yeah, all right, frankly,

263
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,010
你别碰我 我要找你们经理
take your hands off me. I'm gonna speak to the manager,

264
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,690
- 不想跟你再谈了  - 我只是在解释情况…
- I don't wanna speak to you.  - The fact is I'm just trying to explain...

265
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,900
- 什么？ - 我只是在解释…
- Sorry?  - I'm just explaining...

266
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,020
没你事儿了…
Well it's not you I wanna speak to...

267
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,890
- 你回去吧  - 跟我说吧
- You can go back up there.  - Right, come and talk to me then

268
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,530
- 如果你确实需要解释  - 对不起
- if you've got something to say.  - Okay. Sorry.

269
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,890
好 是这样的
All right.

270
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,450
我刚才跟她解释说 我从没来过纽卡斯尔
I've tried to explain to the woman, I've never been to Newcastle before.

271
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,900
我们刚从伦敦搬来
We've just moved up here from London.

272
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,940
才几天时间 人生地不熟的
I've been here a few days, I don't know where I'm going. Okay?

273
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,900
刚才搭公车 开错了路
I was on the bus, it's gone the wrong way.

274
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,500
我们赶紧下车一路跑过来 不想再迟更多
We've run, got off the bus, run so that I wasn't any more late.

275
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,210
但她根本不关心
She just don't wanna know

276
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,210
还要上报上级处罚我们
and now she's telling me she's gonna refer me for a sanction.

277
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,170
请您听我说 好吗
What I want you to do is listen to me. Okay?

278
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,830
那位女士没有错
The lady's told you what's right.

279
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,380
我们必须遵守相关规定
There's rules here, rules that we have to stick to. Okay?

280
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,920
- 这不是针对您本人 但您有义务准时到达  - 老兄 听着
- It isn't against you, but you have a duty.  - Oh, mate, listen,

281
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,850
- 我没说你们针对我  - 您有义务准时到达
- I'm not saying it's against me.  - You have a duty to be here on time.

282
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
我有给你们解释
And I'm explaining to you

283
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,390
迟到的原因啊
why I wasn't here on time.

284
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,880
- 这我明白…  - 我迷路了
- D'you know what? I understand, right...  - I got lost.

285
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,180
但现在的情况是…
But what I gather now is the decision maker...

286
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,810
决策者会邮寄给您一封信函
The decision maker's gonna be sending you a letter through the post.

287
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,930
请您耐心等待
So you're gonna have to wait for that.

288
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,940
- 这样就不会有人…  - 可是我的孩子们
- And then nobody...  - Yeah, I've got... My kids

289
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,640
明天就开学了 我口袋里只剩十二英镑
have gotta start school tomorrow. I've got about 12 quid in my purse.

290
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,850
- 是这样  - 都是因为你们不好好冷静点
- D'you know what?  - All because you can't just calm down

291
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
- 听人们解释  - 好吧
- and listen to people when they talk.  - Right.

292
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,980
- 现在必须这样  - 好吧 这样
- You have to do this.  - Right, d'you know what,

293
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,190
- 我听了您的解释 可您在无理取闹  - 就知道搬规定
- I've listened to you. You've created a scene.  - With your rules.

294
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,400
- 我觉得…  - 我无理取闹？
- I think you need to...  - I've created a scene?

295
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,610
- 请您离开  - 我要真无理取闹
- You need to leave the building.  - If I was gonna create a scene,

296
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,740
你可招架不住
you'd know about it, trust me.

297
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,950
对不起 请你们离开
I'm sorry, love, but you are gonna have to go.

298
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,950
太可笑了
This is ridiculous.

299
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,420
- 还有天理吗  - 我该怎么办
- Jesus Christ!  - What am I supposed to do?

300
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,960
- 谁是下一个  - 我
- Who's first in this queue?  - I am.

301
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,660
能让这位小姐插个队吗
D'you mind if this young lass signs on first?

302
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,750
- 没问题 你们先  - 得嘞
- No, no, you carry on.  - There you go.

303
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,510
你回去 让她登记
Now you can go back to your desk and let her sign on

304
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,880
别再浪费纳税人的钱了
and do the job that the taxpayer pays you for.

305
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,470
- 简直是丢人现眼  - 您瞧
- This is a bloody disgrace.  - Listen, all right,

306
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,960
这不关您的事吧
this doesn't have to involve you.

307
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,230
大家各司其职 您却更加无理取闹
Everybody's trying to do their job here and you're creating more of a scene again.

308
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,560
你根本不听她解释
But, look, you're not listening to her.

309
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,220
她初来乍到的 就迟到了几分钟…
She's out of the area. She's just been a few minutes...

310
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,890
你这就不让她登记？她还带着俩孩子呢
Can you not let her sign on? She's got two kids with her, man.

311
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,860
- 你们这群人到底怎么回事  - 这不关您的事
- What's wrong with you people?  - Right, listen, this isn't your concern.

312
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,350
请您也立即离开
I want you to get out as well. All right?

313
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,770
请您离开 我们有工作要做
I need you to leave. We need to do this right. Yeah.

314
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,360
- 行吧  - 听我说…
- All right.  - Listen, listen, listen...

315
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,990
- 他们可会直接报警了  - 报警
- They're just gonna call the police.  - Phone the police.

316
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,650
能不能讲点道理 还有没有王法
Can we get some perspective in here?

317
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,530
请你们立即离开 否则我们报警了
You need to go or we're gonna phone the police. All right?

318
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,860
我谢谢您啊
Come on. Thanks very much...

319
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,530
讲点道理吧
Can we have a bit of perspective, please, here, man?

320
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,030
- 别再继续犯傻了  - 你根本不配做这工作
- Away, don't be silly.  - Shouldn't even have this job.

321
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,370
- 快走吧  - 你根本不配做这工作
- Come on. Please.  - Shouldn't even have this job.

322
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,130
- 快走  - 她只是需要帮助
- Come on, get out.  - All she needs is help, man.

323
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,790
- 快走 好吗  - 让她登个记怎么了
- Let's get going.  - Just let her sign on.

324
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,260
快走吧
Let's get going, all right.

325
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,680
拜托
Please.

326
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,880
你们这些人怎么回事我真是不明白了
I don't know what's wrong with you lot, I really don't.

327
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,890
往外走 不要停
I need you to keep going for me, okay?

328
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,020
- 我来拎一个吧  - 没事 不要紧
- You want me to take one of them bags?  - No, it's all right, I'm fine, pet. I'm fine.

329
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,020
- 迪伦呢  - 我不知道
- Where's Dylan?  - I don't know.

330
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,610
迪伦 快跟上
Dylan! Come on!

331
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,690
- 人呢  - 他可真是个小捣蛋
- Honestly. Honestly.  - He's a handful, isn't he?

332
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,200
这孩子连五分钟都不让人安生
I can't sit down for five minutes without him getting in trouble, can I?

333
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,440
是啊
Right.

334
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,700
- 选得好  - 她喜欢吃意面
- Good, good choice.  - She loves spaghetti.

335
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,290
意面配面包怎么做都好吃
Hey, you cannae go wrong with spaghetti on toast.

336
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,580
单吃或者配面包都好吃
Spaghetti, spaghetti on toast, isn't it?

337
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,960
你弟弟又跑哪了
Where's your brother gone?

338
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,790
- 迪伦  - 迪伦
- Dylan!  - Dylan!

339
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,510
快跟上
Come on.

340
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,590
他总是一溜烟就不见了
This, this is what he does. He runs, he runs off.

341
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,040
- 真是个捣蛋鬼  - 快跟上
- He's a handful, in't he?  - Come on!

342
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,720
你是去探险了吗
Where ye been, on an adventure?

343
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,980
迪伦 别蹭篱笆
Dylan, not on the fences.

344
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,770
- 就这里  - 妈妈 看 狗狗回来了
- It's just here.  - Mum, look, she's back, she's back.

345
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,220
她回来了
She's back.

346
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,070
如果只剩一件事可做 我会把这房子收拾得像个家
Tell you what, if it's the last thing I do, I'm gonna make this place a home.

347
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,070
你会修水箱吗
You don't know how to fix a cistern, do you?

348
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,750
快把我逼疯了
It's driving me insane.

349
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,320
- 我帮你看看吧  - 真的？
- Yeah, I'll have a look at that.  - Yeah?

350
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,080
我什么都会修
I can fix owt, me, pet,

351
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,090
除了电脑
apart from computers.

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,670
- 就在楼上 你带他…  - 我带他去吧
- Straight up. You show him...  - I'll show him.

353
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,140
迪伦 别闹了好不好 进屋
Dylan, can you stop it? Get in.

354
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,810
妈妈 你好吗

358
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,070
楼下有张很舒服的地毯
And, erm, yeah, it looks like they've put... There's a nice bit of fresh carpet down.

359
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,830
墙面刷得也很好
The, the walls are all nicely painted and that.

360
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,700

No, I know, Mum. Well, look, once... Once you're feeling better and we're settled,

then you'll have to come up. You can come up with Auntie May and stay, can't you?

362
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,130

363
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,300

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,430
你想跟黛西说说话吗

377
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,470
你们为什么从伦敦搬过来 凯蒂
So what are you doing up here, Katie?

378
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,550
起先是因为我们被房东赶出来了
It started when we got kicked out of the flat.

379
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,980
因为一点小事
We got in a bit of trouble.

380
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,190
简直太冤枉了
It was ridiculous.

381
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,850
迪伦房间的墙壁漏水
In Dylan's room there was a leak coming through the wall,

382
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,650
从天花板渗到墙里的
coming through the top of the ceiling down the wall.

383
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,730
他就生病了 记得吗
And it was making him really sick. Weren't it, Dais?

384
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,180
- 记得迪伦那时候生病吗  - 记得
- Remember when Dylan weren't well?  - Yeah.

385
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,570
大老远跑去医院
We had to run all the way to the hospital.

386
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,190
去了好几次医院
Yeah, he was in and out the hospital.

387
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,120
我就去找房东
I was talking to the landlord about it, spoke to him.

388
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,190
抱怨了两句 就被赶出来了
And cos I complained, kicked us out.

389
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,440
什么 他们居然能这样
What, they can just do that?

390
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,110
- 随便赶人  - 是啊
- Just throw you out?  - Yeah, yeah.

391
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,000
所以我们就搬了出去
So we got out of there.

392
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,870
之后我们在临时救济房住了两年 等着政府的福利房
We was in a homeless hostel for about two years, waiting on a flat.

393
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,870
那离学校很近 他们很喜欢那所学校…
Yeah. But it was close to their school which they loved, so...

394
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,890
我们就只能忍着了 但只有一个房间
We just had to stick it out. But we was in one room,

395
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,210
三个人一起住一间房
the three of us were in one room.

396
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,270
吃饭睡觉都挤在一个房间里 迪伦都开始爬墙了
Like eating, sleeping, all the rest of it and Dylan was just climbing the walls.

397
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,100
真的像是闷在盒子里
Honestly, like boxed in like that, so, yeah.

398
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,760
最后 终于等到了新的福利房 好消息是 终于真的算是房子了
They eventually offered me a flat, so the good news was it was a flat.

399
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,520
坏消息是 地点在纽卡斯尔
Bad news was it was up here.

400
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,860
他们不能分给离你家人近一点的房子吗
And they couldn't give you anywhere near your family?

401
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,230
伦敦没有
No, not in London.

402
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,230
穷人在伦敦没法生活 成本太高了
They're, they're moving out the likes of me. It's just too expensive for 'em.

403
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,240
孩子们能适应吗
So how's the kids taking it?

404
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,250
转学可让他们伤心死了
They're brokenhearted about leaving school.

405
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,820
特别是黛西 她可怨我了
Especially Daisy. She's furious with me.

406
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,340
与朋友和外婆分别
Having to leave her friends and her nan.

407
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,920
可我有什么办法呢 总不能让迪伦憋在盒子里
I mean there was nothing I could do about it. I couldn't have Dylan boxed in like that.

408
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,960
- 交新朋友很快的  - 我也是这么说的
- Ah, she'll make friends soon enough.  - That's what I've told her.

409
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,640
我都规划好了
And I've got a plan.

410
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,600
外面有个小花园 每个人都有自己的房间
We got a little garden now and they've each got a room of their own.

411
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,440
我会找个兼职 然后继续念书
I'm gonna get a part-time job and then I'm gonna go back to me books.

412
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,300
- 你还是大学生？ - 是开放大学
- Oh, you at college?  - Open University.

413
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,270
我以前成绩不好 就当重新来过吧
Yeah, I mucked up a little bit at school so it's like a second chance.

414
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,810
住进临时救济房后 学业就中断了
But that all fell apart a little bit when we was at the hostel,

415
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,100
但我不能放弃
but I'm not gonna give up.

416
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,900
对吧
Can't, can I?

417
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,520
好样的 姑娘
Good on you, lass.

418
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,200
这屋里好冷啊
It's bloody freezing in here.

419
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,950
肯定是跳闸了
Oh, it must be a short.

420
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,880
你家的电闸在哪
Right, where's your fuse box?

421
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,590
电表里没钱了
There's nothing on the metre.

422
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,750
要开学了 我想给他们买点新衣服
The kids are starting school and I wanted to get 'em some nice new clothes.

423
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,750
以为明天就能领到救济
And I thought I was gonna get me money tomorrow.

424
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,500
好
Right.

425
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,470
我去拿工具箱 今天就帮你安顿好
I'll bring me tools round and I'll sort this place out for you.

426
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,880
- 真的吗  - 当然啦
- Will ya?  - Yeah, course I will.

427
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,770
很快就能修好
Shouldn't take long.

428
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,310
好 谢谢你
Right, thank you.

429
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,630
“马科斯·米利安”？ 还敢寄到我家
"Max Million", to my fucking address?

430
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,250
- 老中 这里面是什么  - 丹 不是你想的那样
- China, what's in this box?  - Dan, it's not what you think it is.

431
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,750
别瞎猜
Don't jump to conclusions.

432
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,380
把垃圾挪走 再把屁股挪开
Shift that bloody rubbish and shift your arse.

433
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,230
我倒要看看这里有什么
I wanna see what's in this box.

434
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,030
我天 哇哦
Oh my God. Wow.

435
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,580
- 你觉得怎么样  - 运动鞋？
- What d'you think of these?  - Bloody trainers?

436
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,320
- 运动鞋  - 运动鞋
- Trainers.  - Trainers.

437
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,410
- 这可都是尖货 丹  - 顶尖的
- These are only the best, Dan.  - Very best.

438
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,080
是不是啊 派普
Aren't they, Piper?

439
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,370
是不是
Aren't they?

440
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,780
别打了 我骨头软
Stop it, man, I've got brittle bones.

441
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,830
丹 给你做个小测试
Anyways, I've got a test for you, Dan.

442
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,590
- 打开吧  - 打开
- Go on, open it.  - Open that.

443
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,180
有区别吗
What's the difference?

444
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,140
这两只鞋有什么区别
Yeah. What's the difference between them two?

445
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,590
看着一样啊
They look the same.

446
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,600
- 就等你这句话  - 没错
- Bang on, brother.  - Exactly.

447
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,610
区别是 这双在名品街要一百五十镑…
The difference is, they'd have cost me 150 quid on the high street...

448
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,650
而我只卖八十镑
And I'm gonna sell those for 80 quid.

449
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,440
卖山寨货 还他妈寄到我家
Cheap counterfeits to my fucking address?

450
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,540
中国黑手党和海关会找上门来的
I could have the Chinese Mafia or the bloody Customs at me door.

451
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,610
你俩真是不要脸到家了
The brass neck of the bloody pair of you.

452
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,620
丹 这些不是山寨货
Dan, these are not counterfeits.

453
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,040
这两双是同一家工厂生产的
They're from the same factory as these.

454
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,460
质量和耐跑度分毫不差
Exactly the same quality. Continuation of the same run.

455
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,430
- 你不信我们吗  - 真他娘的商业奇才
- D'you not believe us?  - It's fucking genius.

456
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,540
你是从哪弄到货的
How d'you manage this?

457
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,380
我一哥们儿 在广州鞋厂工作
Well I know a guy from Guangzhou, don't I, who works in the factory.

458
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,060
人家在工厂工作呢
Yeah, works in the factory.

459
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,380
狂热球迷
He's football mad.

460
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,140
球队球员如数家珍
He knows everything about the teams, the players, everything.

461
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,050
我们用邮件做生意 我用Paypal给他打钱
So we do the deals by e-mails. I send him the money by PayPal,

462
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,350
他再把货寄给我
then he sends me the package by post.

463
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,520
是寄给我吧
Me, you mean.

464
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,150
丹 我原先是想提前打个招呼的 货分批寄给不同的人
Honestly, Dan, I did mean to say, like I get them sent to different mates.

465
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,480
小批量不显眼
You know, small packages like not to attract too much attention.

466
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,120
一般都能顺利过关
They usually get through.

467
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,490
等你俩进了监狱
I'll be able to tell all me mates I knew both of you

468
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,210
我是不会想你们的
before you were arrested.

469
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,790
丹 我的未来
See these trainers, Dan,

470
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,340
就靠这些鞋了
these are the future.

471
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,920
对苦逼的工作说不
No more crap jobs.

472
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,300
对仓库的烂事说不
No more shit from that warehouse.

473
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,130
你知道那帮混蛋今早干了什么
D'you know what the bastards did this morning?

474
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,510
天不亮 五点半 喊我们过去
Got us in at 5:30.

475
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,220
就卸了一卡车货 知道用了多久吗
Unloaded one truck. Guess how long that took?

476
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,100
四十五分钟 知道我报酬多少
Forty-five minutes. And you know how much I got paid?

477
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,510
三镑七毛九分钱啊
Three pound and seventy-nine pence.

478
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,720
他娘的浪费我时间 工资比中国还低
Waste of my fucking time. It's worse than China.

479
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,530
我一定要出人头地 我是认真的
I'm gonna make it big one day, Dan. I'm serious.

480
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,900
您好 需要帮忙吗 您看上去有点迷惑
Hi there, can I help you? You look a bit lost.

481
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,020
我想申请失业津贴…
Aye. I have to apply for Jobseeker's Allowance...

482
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,560
- 这样  - 想用那东西
- Right, yeah. Mmm-hmm.  - And I wanna use one of them

483
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,020

484
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,490
没问题 今天可以办好
Right, you could do that today.

485
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,570
现在暂时没有空闲的电脑
We're a bit busy at the moment.

486
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,620
您一会儿再来好吗
If you can come back a bit later, would that be okay?

487
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,700
- 点“联络求职中心”  - 嗯
- And then contact Job Centre Plus.  - Mmm-hmm.

488
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,870
就会出现“申请失业津贴”
And, here we are. "Claim Jobseeker's".

489
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,710
- 双击这里  - 好

496
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,640

- What you need to do is get your cursor...  - "Your cursor"?

497
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,220
名字起得倒不错
It's a fucking apt name for it.

498
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,240
拖动鼠标的时候

509
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,640
我该怎么办 我是不是要…
What do I do? Do I get on to that and...

Do you just... I mean, how do you get this down?

511
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,020
移动鼠标 点击这个竖栏

Er, we only have one Wagon Wheel left, so I cut it into four.

593
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,330

Dan, don't know why you're applying for that after your heart attack.

626
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,700
现在 我就来打印你的就业支持津贴申诉表
Right, now I'm printing your appeal form for Employment and Support Allowance.

627
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,460

But you can't appeal till they carry out a mandatory reconsideration.

628
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,510
这就在打印了吗

629
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,640
所以 他们其实当场就能给我
You mean, they could have given it to me just like that?

630
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,340
丹 他们会耍得你团团转 给你提个醒
Dan, they'll fuck you around, I'm warning you.

631
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,550
你会生不如死

我知道很多人直接放弃了
I know dozens who have just given up.

634
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,560
如果他们觉得我会放弃 那就大错特错了
Well they've picked the wrong one if they think I'm gonna give up.

635
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,110
逮住骨头的狗是不会撒口的
I'm like a dog with a bone, me, son.

636
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
先生 我这里记录显示

637
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,170
您正在等待决策者的电话

我难道是在时间隧道吗
Am I in a time warp?

640
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,040
您只有在接到
You can't proceed to the appeal

641
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,010
决策者的电话后
or the mandatory reconsideration

642
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,180
才能申诉或进行强制性再评估
till you have the call from the decision maker.

643
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,560
你能让他们现在就打吗 因为我没有收入
Well, can you ask him to phone us now, because I've got no income.

644
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,140
没有养老金 还要交卧室税
I've got no pension and I've still got the bedroom tax.

645
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,600
我会将此情况录入电脑 先生
I'll make a note on my screen, sir.

646
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,470
能传个纸条给他吗
Well can you not give him the note now?

647
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,140
直接放他手里
You know, put it in his hand?

648
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,150
这里是热线中心 先生
This is a call centre, sir.

649
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,840
迪伦 想不想玩玩螺丝刀啊
Hey, Dylan. D'you want a shot at the screwdriver?

650
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,190
哪一个杀人更多 椰子还是鲨鱼
What kills more people, coconuts or sharks?

651
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,070
那孩子拍球都入迷了
He likes bouncing that ball, doesn't he?

652
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
什么
Pardon?

653
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,870
那个球 他天天拍个不停
That ball. He likes bouncing it, doesn't he?

654
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,220
我们挤在临时救济房的时候 他就这样了
Well, it started in the hostel where we had only one small room.

655
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,180
你觉得是为什么呢
Why d'you think he does that?

656
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,060
可能是想他的朋友了吧
I think he's missing his friends.

657
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,210
但他生气的时候也会拍球
But he also does it when he's angry.

658
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,560
别人从不听他说话 他为什么要听别人呢
People never listen to him, so why should he listen to them?

659
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,270
好了 贴这个可不需要胶水
There you go. And we don't need any glue, nothing like that.

660
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,080
你帮我把这个贴到窗户上
Now you give me a hand and we'll stick this up.

661
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,990
你抓那头 我抓这头
Right, you go that end and I'll go this end.

662
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,300
贴在这里
And we'll stick this up here.

663
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,380
还有这里
Yeah? Just pass it up here.

664
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,080
你把底下铺平 对了
Aye, right. You do the bottom edge. That's it.

665
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,810
太阳会把泡泡里的空气烤热
The sun heats up all the air in these bubbles...

666
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,260
你们的房间就暖和了
And it'll keep your room nice and warm.

667
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,940
帮我从工具包里拿点东西
Can you go into my tool bag there,

668
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,280
就是那个布包
there's a piece of cloth.

669
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,280
能打开吗
Can you open it?

670
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,530
嗯？
Eh?

671
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,290
- 怎么样啊  - 好漂亮啊
- What do you think of that?  - It's gorgeous.

672
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,590
这是给你们新家的小礼物
Well it's a little present for your new room.

673
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,290
- 现在…  - 谢谢
- Now...  - Thank you.

674
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,210
- 放在哪好呢  - 挂在上面吧
- Where shall we put it?  - Up there, maybe.

675
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,140
好 等一下啊
Okay, hang on.

676
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,730
我找个钩子挂上
I'll get a hook and hang it there.

677
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,760
你觉得怎样
Yeah, what do you think?

678
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,440
真好
It's great.

679
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,310
就像住在海底世界一样
It'll look like you're under the sea.

680
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,520
阳光照在它们身上
And the sun will shine on them.

681
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,980
一切都会好好的
I think there will be fine, yeah?

682
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,310
我来点蜡烛
I'll light these candles.

683
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,570
- 哇哦  - 对呀
- Whoa.  - Yeah.

684
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,330
- 等一下  - 好大的火
- Now hang on.  - That one's big.

685
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,910
没错 有四根蜡烛对吗
It is. Now there's four candles. Right?

686
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,330
别烫到手
Mind you don't burn yourself.

687
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,950
不会烫到手的 别担心
I won't burn meself, don't worry about that.

688
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,960
但谢谢你的关心 黛西
But thank you for thinking about us, Daisy.

689
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,290
那根点好了
Put that in there like that.

690
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,000
这根放在这 四根蜡烛都点好了
And I put this one in here. Now there's four candles in there, right.

691
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,750
能烧四个小时呢
And they last for four hours.

692
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,720
我把这个小花盆盖上
I'll put this small pot over. Right?

693
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,140
堵住上面的洞
Block the hole off up there.

694
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,350
再用一个大花盆套住
And then I put this big pot over the top.

695
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,350
再等一段时间 屋子里就暖和了
Now it takes a little while but it'll take the chill off the room.

696
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,330
把手放在上面就有热气了 黛西你试试
And if you just put your hand over there now, you'll feel it, Daisy.

697
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,150
把手放在这 是不是很暖和
If you just put your hand over there, you'll feel it starting to warm up.

698
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,830
- 感觉到了吗  - 有一点
- Huh, can you feel it? Yeah?  - A little bit.

699
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,530
- 你呢  - 有一点
- What about you?  - Yeah, a little bit.

700
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,500
你以前当过兵吗 丹
Were you a soldier, Dan?

701
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,200
当兵？
Was I a soldier?

702
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,710
比那危险多了呢 我是木匠
Oh, more dangerous than that. I was a carpenter.

703
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,380
饭好了
Right, grub's ready.

704
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,930
- 耶  - 坐那边去 迪伦
- Yay!  - Go round that way then, Dylan.

705
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,060
乖 这是你的
Good boy. There's yours, poppet.

706
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,430
把狗狗放在那边
Right, put Sweet on there.

707
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,630
都坐好
Sit down nicely then.

708
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,850
- 丹 这是你的  - 谢谢 我不吃
- And, Dan, this one's yours.  - Oh, no, not for me, thanks, no.

709
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,400
这是你的
That's yours. All right?

710
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,030
吃吧
Here you are. All right?

711
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,320
- 你不吃吗  - 我已经吃过了
- Well, where's yours?  - I had mine earlier.

712
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,770
再吃点水果就行了
I'm just gonna have a bit of fruit.

713
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,490
你昨天和前天也是这么说的
You said that yesterday, and the day before.

714
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,160
好了 快吃吧
All right, eat up then.

715
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,290
看上去很美味 但我饭点没这么早
Looks delicious but, you know, it's a wee... It's a wee bit early for me.

716
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,840
吃吧 丹 这是我的一点心意
Please, Dan. It's the least I can do.

717
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,220
- 谢谢 凯蒂  - 吃吧
- Thank you, Katie.  - All right.

718
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,230
刚才是什么声音 妈妈
What was that sound, Mum?

719
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,980
打扫浴室的时候 有块瓷砖
Oh, babe, one of the tiles just fell off the wall in the bathroom

720
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,320
掉下来了
where I was cleaning it.

721
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,480
都半夜了
It's the middle of the night.

722
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,700
- 我知道  - 你该去睡觉了
- I know.  - You should really get to bed.

723
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,980
好 我马上就去睡
Okay. I'm gonna go to bed.

724
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,150
我马上就去睡
I'm gonna go to bed.

725
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,900
我想赶快把浴室打扫干净
I just wanted to get all the cleaning done in there

726
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,490
明天你们就能泡澡了
so you can have a nice bath tomorrow.

727
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,490
你喜欢泡澡 对吗
You like a bath, don't ya?

728
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,910
嗯
Yeah?

729
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,620
上楼睡觉 把被子掖好
So you're gonna go up and get into bed and wrap up nicely.

730
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,510
好吗 乖孩子 亲亲妈妈
Okay, good girl. Give me a kiss.

731
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,550
快去睡觉
Go and get into bed.

732
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,510
- 好吗  宝贝  - 你保证会去睡觉
- All right? Good girl.  - Promise me you'll get to bed.

733
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,520
我保证马上就去
I promise you I'm gonna go to bed.

734
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,970
- 晚安  - 晚安 宝贝
- Good night.  - 'Night, baby.

735
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,450
丹尼尔·布莱克？
Daniel Blake?

736
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,450
请跟我来 布莱克先生
If you'd like to follow me, Mr Blake.

737
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,710
请坐
If you'd like to just take a seat.

738
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,720
这是申诉人承诺表格
This is the Claimant Commitment form.

739
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,600
你要保证每周用三十五小时的时间求职
You must commit yourself to spending 35 hours a week looking for work.

740
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,070
可以通过报纸求职栏 求职中介
Now that can be newspapers, agencies,

741
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,610
或是政府的求职网站
and online via the Universal Job Match.

742
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,610
只需填好相关细节即可
You just fill in the details.

743
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,870
但您需要证明您确实在找工作
But you must prove that you've done this as well, mind.

744
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,950
医生说我暂时还不能工作
Well I've been told by my doctor that I'm not supposed to go back to work yet.

745
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,210
那您就应该申请就业支持津贴
Then you should apply for Employment and Support Allowance.

746
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,640
我申请了 但被一个冒牌医生驳回了
I have, but I've been knocked back by some quack

747
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,430
所以现在还要申诉
and now I'm trying to appeal.

748
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,590
那是您的选择 布莱克先生
Okay. Well that's your choice, Mr Blake.

749
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,890
不 这不是我的选择
No, it's not my choice.

750
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,190
我没有任何收入来源
I've got no other form of income.

751
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,780
您到底要不要签字
Do you want to sign this or not?

752
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,980
只需要签上您的名字 我会把日期填好
You just need to put your signature here. I shall date it later on.

753
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,210
谢谢
Thank you.

754
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,910
我能看一下您的简历吗
Now can I have a look at your CV?

755
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,660
什么简历
"CV"?

756
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,290
您还是不懂 布莱克先生
You still don't get this, do you, Mr Blake?

757
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,640
这是您和政府间的协议
This is an agreement between you and the State.

758
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,670
不 是你不懂
No, you still don't get it.

759
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,670
- 不 你必须…  - 我很想回去工作
- No, you must...  - I'm desperate to go back to work.

760
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,810
- 如果您很想回去工作…  - 但医生告诉我…
- If you're desperate to get back to work...  - Unless the doctor tells us...

761
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,890
就需要一份最新的简历
You need to have an up-to-date CV,

762
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,230
来帮助您找工作
in order to help you look for work.

763
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,110
请您先等一下
Now, just hold it right there.

764
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,660
我希望您能去参加简历撰写训练班
There's a CV workshop that I would like you to attend

765
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:43,690
时间是这周六早上九点
and it's this Saturday at 9:00.

766
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,280
不用了 我自己搞定吧
No, thanks, I'll sort that out on me own.

767
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:51,160
不 布莱克先生 这是正式指令
No, Mr Blake. This is a formal direction.

768
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:56,710
想拿到失业津贴就必须参加
You will attend if you want to proceed with your Jobseeker's Allowance claim.

769
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,630
我要是不去呢
What happens if I don't?

770
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:01,710
那您就可能会受处罚
Then you will be referred for a sanction.

771
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,770
十秒钟
Ten seconds.

772
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,340
短短的十秒钟
Ten short seconds.

773
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,930
这是雇主浏览简历所用的平均时间
That's how much a typical employer spends flipping through a CV.

774
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,390
千真万确
Fact.

775

我就是太饿了
I'm just really hungry.

912
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:50,240
- 别这样看着我  - 没事 没关系的
- Okay, don't look at me.  - No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

913
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,420
没什么大不了的
There's no harm done.

914
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,580
我撑不下去了 丹 我要崩溃了
I can't cope, Dan. I feel like I'm going under.

915
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,620
你会撑过去的 你会的亲爱的
Look, you'll get through this, darling.

919
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,850
被扔到这个地方 还带着两个孩子
Dumped up here, on your own with two kids.

920
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,890

00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:38,280
要纸巾吗 或者湿巾
D'you need some paper tissues or baby wipes?

930
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:40,300
- 我去给你拿点湿巾  - 谢谢
- I'll get you some baby wipes.  - Thank you.

931
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:44,170
我刚才头好晕
I felt really faint.

932
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:48,050
凯蒂 想吃点什么吗 给你盛点汤吧
Katie, can I get you something to eat? Would you like some soup or something?

933
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,380
能给她拿点水吗
Yeah, yeah, yeah... If you could get her some water.

934
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,010
什么都行 你要不要吃点东西
Sure, yeah, anything. Yeah. You not want some food?

935
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,310
- 那麻烦…  - 吃点甜的
- Yeah, please, get...  - Even something sugary.

936
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,860
我去给你拿个甜甜圈
I'll get you a doughnut or something.

937
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,190
怎样
Yeah, yeah?

938
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,320
没有中间商 直接厂家提货
There's no middlemen. Straight from the factory.

939
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,990
跟专卖店质量一样
Same quality as the shop.

940
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,250
- 完全一样  - 便宜点吧
- Same quality, exactly.  - Well, you're gonna have to do us a deal.

941
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,330
八十镑太贵了
I couldn't pay 80 quid for this, though.

942
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,670
专卖店一百五十镑一双
If you go to the shop, they're 150 pounds.

943
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,630
- 一百五？ - 我这才八十
- A hundred and fifty quid?  - I'm selling these for 80 pounds.

944
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,840
- 什么叫才八十  - 上面还有标签呢
- Only 80 quid.  - See, they've still got the stickers on.

945
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,590
为什么只卖八十
Why are they 80?

946
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,630
只卖八十是因为没有中间商赚差价
The reason they're 80 is because there's no middlemen, nothing.

947
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,760
- 谁都没有  - 看看你俩 商业新贵啊
- No middlemen, whatsoever.  - You and Piper, the top new businessmen.

948
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,260
这是我司机 丹
That's my driver, Dan.

949
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,550
司机你个头
I'll give you a bloody driver.

950
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,390
这不是二手的吧
So no-one's worn them before?

951
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,430
绝对不是 您瞅瞅这质量
No-one's wore them. Nothing, look. Check the quality yourself.

952
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,150
我可以穿去健身房
I'd probably wear them for the gym.

953
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,690
八十镑不行 实在太贵了
I couldn't say 80 quid, mate. This is too expensive for 80 quid.

954
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,480
- 专卖店卖一百五呢  - 一百五
- They're 150 pound in the shop.  - A hundred and fifty pound, yeah.

955
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,580
- 丹 哥们 你还好吗  - 你好 乔
- Oh, Dan. You all right, mate?  - Hello, Joe.

There's a load of us ganning. There's a band on, you know.

959
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:02,370
我会去喝两杯 一起吧
We're gonna sink a few pints. D'you fancy, fancy coming down?

960
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:06,210
馋死我了 但医生说不能沾酒
Aye, I'd murder a pint, mate, but I daresn't. I've been telt to lay off the sauce, you know.

961
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,380
- 是吗  - 我会回锯木厂
- Oh, really?  - But, listen, tell the lads I'll come down

962
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,840

963
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,380

Oh, aye, aye, aye.

964
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,880
我们今晚都在 能来就来吧
You know, if you fancy it anyway, we're all going down.

965
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,380
那回头见吧
So we might see you later, mate.

966
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,590
- 见到你真好 哥们  - 回见了
- Nice to see you, man.  - See you then. Ta-ta, see you.

978
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,320
前几天我们在花园中心见过面…
We spoke the other day at the garden centre...

979
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:22,160
- 哦对  - …当时你给了简历给我的
- Oh, yeah, yeah.  - ...when you came down and handed your CV.

980
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,000
- 你最近还好吧  - 挺好 谢谢
- How are you doing, mate? Are you all right?  - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, thanks, yeah.

981
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,760
我刚刚筛选了这几周
Er, listen. I tell you what, mate, I've been going through all the CVs

982
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,550
收到的简历
I've had handed over the last couple of weeks.

983
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:31,300
我很喜欢你
And I really like the look of yours.

984
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,250
你的经验正是我需要的
Erm, you've got the experience I'm looking for.

985
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,670
你明天是否能来面试
I was wondering if you could possibly, er, pop by tomorrow and that for an interview?

986
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:40,140
很抱歉 爱德华兹先生
Oh... I'm really sorry, er, Mr Edwards,

987
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,470
医生说我的身体状况不适合工作
but, you know, er, my doctor's told us I cannae come back to work yet.

988
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,480
所以你不是真的在找工作？
So you're not actually looking for work, then?

989
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,360
这 说来话长
Well, it's hard to explain, you know.

990
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,770
你不找工作
So, well, what's the point of handing in your CV

991
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,480
给我简历干嘛呢？
if you're not looking for work?

992
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,900
只有这样才能领到福利
Well it's the only way I can get me benefits, you know?

993
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:01,110
“福利”？原来你是那种吃福利的懒人啊
"Benefits"? So you prefer to be on benefits than do a day's graft?

994
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,740
我还以为你是个实诚人呢
You know, I thought you were a genuine bloke.

995
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:05,000
我筛选简历用了很长时间
You know, I've spent a lot of time going through them all.

996
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,700
本想给你点活干
I've... I was gonna put some graft your way.

997
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,050
你却浪费我的时间 赶紧滚吧
You've just wasted my time completely. Why don't you just sod right off!

998
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,550
听着 我不是…

我不去
No, I'm not going to the manager's office.

1011
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,770
收银员明明给我结账了 我有收据
You just stood there and watched her serve me, I've got a receipt.

1012
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,390
我也可以立即锁门报警
I can lock the door and call the police.

1013
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,390
你要锁门报警
You're talking about locking the door and calling the police.

1014
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,020
请跟我来
Would you like to come with me to the manager's office?

凯蒂
Katie.

1032
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,470
这事你知 我知
It's between me and you...

1033
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,970
跟超市没关系 好吗
It's got nowt to do with the store. All right?

1034
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,960
我就当你付过钱了
They're paid for.

1035
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:27,850
你可以走了

1036
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,850
谢谢
Thank you.

1037
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,630
嘿 等等 等一下
Hey, hang on a second. Hey, hang on...

1038
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,080
刚才的事我很抱歉 真的
I'm sorry about that, I am.

1039
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,990
能跟你私下说句话吗
Can I get a quiet word?

1040
01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:00,340
如果你急需用钱 我能帮你
Look, if you're in trouble and you need money, I can help, okay?

1041
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,340
你这么漂亮的女孩 我肯定有办法
Look, a nice girl like you, I can definitely help.

1042
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,100
这是我的电话号码 我叫埃文
That's my number. My name's Ivan, okay?

1043
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,100
有需要随时打给我
Ring me any time, all right?

1044
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,520
好吗
Okay?

1045
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,840
你过来看看他
Come and have a look at this.

1046
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,960
简直是奇迹
That is a miracle.

1047
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:43,760
他安静地坐了整整十五分钟
He's been sat there for about 15 minutes.

1048
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,100
丹 这是什么
What's this, Dan?

1049
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:04,730
卡带
It's a cassette.

1050
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:06,110
卡带是什么
What's a cassette?

1051
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:08,120
放音乐的 来 我放给你看
Plays music. Come here, I'll show you.

1052
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,790
好
All right.

1053
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,200
放进去 得先从盒子里拿出来
You pop that in there. Oh, no, you gotta take it out the case first.

1054
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,370
要不没法放
It'll not play like that.

1055
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,170
好 现在就能放进去了
Right, you put that in there like that. Yeah?

1056
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:28,920
按这个按钮
And press that button there.

1057
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,520
再用点劲儿
Bit more. Harder.

1058
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,060
对啦
That's it.

1059
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,320
这是莫莉的卡带
It was Molly's.

1060
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,990
她从广播上录下来的
She recorded it off the radio.

1061
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:42,770
海上天气播报的音乐
Shipping forecast.

1062
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,780
深夜的节目
It's on late at night.

1063
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,480
曲名是《远航》 好听吗
Sailing By. D'you like that tune?

1064
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:50,740
- 好听  - 莫莉特别爱听
- Yeah.  - Yeah, Molly loved it.

1065
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,170
真是好听
It's nice, isn't it?

1066
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,430
面试怎么样啊
So how'd the interview go?

1067
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,380
和学校的课程时间都有冲突
Oh, nothing's working out with the school times at the minute.

1068
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,810
所以我找了几家中介机构把我的名字放在等候名单里
So I went to, erm, some of the agencies and put my name down on the waiting list,

1069
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,820
我早上可以去做保洁
cos I could do cleaning in the morning.

1070
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:23,820
找了几家酒店 还有咖啡厅
Went to some hotels. Went round all the cafes.

1071
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,570
腿都快走断了
Must have walked for bloody miles.

1072
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,490
在我开始工作前
Well, I can pick the kids up for you, you know.

1073
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,030
可以帮你接孩子
Till I start work again.

1074
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,200
丹 答案是椰子
Dan. The answer is "coconuts".

1075
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,960
回答正确
Correct.

1076
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,840
怎么突然说起椰子了
What's he talking about, "coconuts"?

1077
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:45,050
告诉妈妈
Ah, shall we tell your mum?

1078
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,420
- 说吧  - 我在楼梯上拍球的时候
- Go on.  - When I was bouncing my ball on the stairs.

1079
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,760
- 什么楼梯  - 我们家的楼梯
- What stairs?  - The stairs in our house.

1080
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,720
- 对  - 丹问了我一个问题
- Yeah.  - Dan asked me a question.

1081
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,440
什么问题
What, what question did he ask ya?

1082
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,690
鲨鱼和椰子
"What kills people more?

1083
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,850
- 哪一个杀人更多  - 嗯
- "Coconuts or sharks?"  - Mmm-hmm.

1084
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,180
我说是椰子
And I said coconuts.

1085
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:04,350
你答对了吗
And you got it right?

1086
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,850
- 是这样吗  - 他答对了
- Is that right?  - Yeah, he's right.

1087
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,690
那是莫莉的照片吗
Is that Molly?

1088
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,410
对 是莫莉
Yeah. Yeah, that's Molly, yeah.

1089
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,860
拿过来看看 黛西
Let's see that, Dais.

1090
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,880
给我看看那张
Show me that one.

1091
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:27,290
莫莉 我喜欢这个名字
"Molly." Like the name.

1092
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,640
她是什么样的人
What was she like?

1093
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,920
她很特别
She was special.

1094
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,670
她真的很特别 黛西
Yeah, she was special, Daisy.

1095
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,520
不是温柔的类型
Not easy.

1096
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,270
情绪就像过山车
She was up one minute, down the next.

1097
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,900
聪明 幽默
Smart and funny. Huh.

1098
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:50,900
我经常被她逗得哈哈大笑
Ah, that lass made me laugh.

1099
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,070
她很善良
Kind.

1100
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,040
心胸宽广
She had a big, big heart.

1101
01:05:58,910 --> 01:05:59,920
但是
But...

1102
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:04,370
她说她的脑中就像一片汪洋
She said her head was like the ocean.

1103
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,090
时而寂静 时而狂啸
Dead still, then wild.

1104
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,920
不知自己将漂向何处
Never knew where she'd end up next.

1105
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,350
听音乐缓解了她的病情
I mean, the music helped that.

1106
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:19,690
但她最终还是撞上了礁石
But then she'd hit the rocks.

1107
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:22,360
“今晚小船将驶向何处 丹”
"Where'll we sail to tonight, Dan?"

1108
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:24,390
这是我们之间的小笑话
That was our little joke.

1109
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,190
她的遗言是
Her last words to me were,

1110
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,990
“我想要迎着狂风 扬帆远航”
"I wanna sail away, Dan, with the wind at me back.

1111
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,120
“这样我就满足了 丹”
"That's all I need, Dan."

1112
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:41,080
你们有孩子吗
Do you have any children?

1113
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,120
我很想要孩子 但事与愿违
I'd have loved that, Daisy. No.

1114
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,340
- 你想她吗  - 黛西
- Do you miss her?  - Dais.

1115
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,080
没关系的
It's okay.

1116
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,960
她有精神疾病
She was crazy.

1117
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,760
照料她很累
Hard work.

1118
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,230
但我还是全心全意地爱她
But I loved her to bits.

1119
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,640
她走了 我的生活也迷失了
I'm lost without her, really.

1120
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:10,400
- 喝点茶吧  - 哦 谢谢
- There you go, pet.  - Oh, thank you.

1121
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,980
一定很辛苦吧
That must have been hard for you, Dan.

1122
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,980
她生前是你一直在照顾她吗
I mean, did you look after her right till the end?

1123
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:19,990
我以为她的去世对我是个解脱
Well, you know, I thought it'd be a relief when she passed away.

1124
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,030
因为她的病 耽误了很多工作
Cos it was difficult to go into work, you know, when she was ill.

1125
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,160
但我照顾了她那么长时间
And after you've been looking after somebody for so long...

1126
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,750
她似乎已占据我全部的生活
It seems to take over your life, you know.

1127
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,970
- 是啊 你会忘记自己的生活  - 嗯
- Yeah, and you forget your own.  - Huh.

1128
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,390
身边有你 她很幸运
Well she was lucky to have you.

1129
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:41,760
我以为黛西的爸爸是真命天子
Daisy's dad, I thought was something really special.

1130
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:44,220
但他并不是
He turned out not to be.

1131
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,980
我当时只有十八岁 没有听从妈妈的劝阻
Me mum tried to warn me about it, but I was 18, so I didn't listen.

1132
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,030
在迪伦的爸爸身上又重蹈覆辙
And then I did the same thing with Dylan's dad.

1133
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,610
你很年轻 人生还长着呢
You're a young lass, you got your whole life ahead of you.

1134
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:58,030
等你重回校园 就是一片新的天地
And when you get back to those books, you'll be flying.

1135
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:01,160
我现在看不了书 一看书就心烦
Yeah, I can't look at 'em, Dan. They really upset me.

1136
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:06,030
- 你要坚持下去  - 嗯
- You gotta keep a hold, you know.  - Mmm-hmm.

1137
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:08,280
孩子们都为你骄傲
You're doing your kids proud.

1138
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:16,050
前进总需要风的动力
I mean, we all need the wind at our back every now and then.

1139
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,710
- 不是吗  - 是啊
- Don't we?  - Mmm. Yeah.

1140
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:31,100
这不达标啊 布莱克先生
Well that's not good enough, Mr Blake.

1141
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,490
我怎么确定你联系过这些雇主呢
And how do I know you've actually been in contact with all these employers?

1142
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:40,690
我走街串巷 亲手递的简历
Well, I walked round the town. I gave out me CV by hand.

1143
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:42,940
证明在哪
Well, prove it.

1144
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,740
- 这怎么证明  - 有收据吗
- How?  - Well, did you get a receipt?

1145
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,500
用手机拍照了吗
Take a picture with your mobile?

1146
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,090
用这个吗
With this?

1147
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,580
我用人格担保
I give you my word that's what I did.

1148
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,410
这样不达标啊 布莱克先生
That's not good enough, Mr Blake.

1149
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:58,000
你在求职网站找工作了吗
What about the Universal Job Match online?

1150
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,090
我去了图书馆 这是我的预约卡
I went to the library, there's my appointment card.

1151
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:08,390
我脑门子都快爆了 已经尽全力了
Did my head in. And I tried my best.

1152
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,100
还是不达标
It's not good enough.

1153
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,810
能看一下您的简历吗
Can I look at your CV?

1154
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,240
行
All right.

1155
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:29,110
您在培训班什么也没学到吗
Did you not learn anything at the CV workshop?

1156
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:30,950
我还真学了不少
You'd be surprised.

1157
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,750
还是不达标吗 希拉
Not good enough, Sheila?

1158
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,510
我要把你的情况
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to refer you

1159
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:42,140
反映给决策者 并可能对你进行为期四周的处罚
to a decision maker for a possible sanction for four weeks.

1160
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,420
你的收入将被冻结
Your payment will be frozen.

1161
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,690
您可以申请特困补贴
You may be entitled to Hardship Allowance if you apply.

1162
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,980
您明白吗
Do you understand?

1163
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,310
处罚期间 您必须继续找工作
And if you are sanctioned, you must continue to look for work and sign on.

1164
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,360
如不遵守 将再次受到处罚

Daisy woke up and she forgot to ask you about her school project.

1246
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,070
她要采访一个人 了解他的职业
She's, erm, she's gotta interview somebody about their work

1247
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:38,600
她想要采访你
and she wants to speak to you.

1248
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,450
孩子们都很喜欢你讲的故事

1255
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,680
付给姑娘就行 就是那间
No, you pay the girl. It's that door there.

1256
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:58,690
好

1257
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,660

1258
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,080
凯蒂 你没有必要做这个

1259
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,420
我不想让你看到我这个样子
You shouldn't see me like this.

1260
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,090
对不起

1261
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,800
你触碰了我的底线 出去
No, this, this is cut off. This is separate. Can you... You need to get out.

1262
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:34,720
在家里我说不出口 但在这里我必须要说
Listen, I couldn't speak to you in the flat, I need to speak to you now.

1263
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:36,820
丹 求你了 出去
Dan, please, get out.

1264
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:39,650
凯蒂 我要跟你谈谈
Oh, Katie, please, I need to speak to you.

1265
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,730
我只是想跟你谈谈 凯蒂

1267
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:53,120

Dan, please, I don't want you here! Will you just go, please!

1268
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,740
- 我给你做了一个书架  - 什么？
- I've built you a bookcase.  - What?

1269
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,050

For your books.

1270
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:01,970

- 求你快走 我不想在这看见你  - 我的心都要碎了
- Please, just go, I don't want you here.  - This is breaking my heart.

1272
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:07,140
丹 求你了别管我
Dan, please, just leave me alone.

1273
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:20,100
我已经挣了三百镑
I've got 300 quid in my pocket.

1274
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,150
孩子们能吃上新鲜水果了
I can buy the kids fresh fruit.

1275
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,790
你要是无法接受 我也不想再见你了
If you can't deal with it, I can't see you any more.

1276
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:35,080
我必须回去工作 你明白吗
Listen, I've gotta go back inside. D'you understand?

1277
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:39,960
我不想再跟你说话了
I don't wanna speak to you any more.

1278
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,300
不要再关心我了
And don't show me any more love.

1279
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,140
这会让我崩溃的 丹
Cos you're gonna break me, Dan.

1280
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:18,420
我不明白
I don't understand.

1281
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,790
你申请过什么工作
So what jobs have you actually applied for?

1282
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,210
这就是一场无休止的闹剧
It's a monumental farce, isn't it?

1283
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,850
你坐在那 胸前佩戴着友好的名牌“安”
You sitting there with your friendly name tag on your chest, Ann,

1284
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:36,020
对面坐着个病重的老头 申请着并不存在的工作
opposite a sick man looking for nonexistent jobs,

1285
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:38,390
就算成功也无法上岗
that I can't take anyway.

1286
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:42,940
浪费着我的时间 你的时间 雇主的时间
Wasting my time, employers' time, your time.

1287
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,650
而这一切只是在羞辱我 折磨我
And all it does is humiliate me, grind me down.

1288
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:51,200
或许这就是你们的意图 把我的名字从电脑上抹去
Or is that the point, to get my name off those computers?

1289
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,370
我不玩了
Well, I'm not doing it any more.

1290
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:56,030
我受够了
I've had enough.

1291
01:21:57,870 --> 01:21:59,790
麻烦帮我预约
I want my date for my appointment

1292
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:02,880
就业支持津贴申诉面谈
for my appeal for Employment and Support.

1293
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,210
- 你还没预约上面谈吗  - 没有
- Have you not had that yet?  - No.

1294
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,260
听我一句劝 丹
Please listen to me, Dan.

1295
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:14,850
你目前没有任何收入 停止申请失业津贴的风险太大
It's a huge decision to come off JSA without any other income coming in.

1296
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,890
申诉过程可能要花好几周
Look, it... It could be weeks before your appeal comes through.

1297
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:23,510
强制性再评估的周期没有上限
You see, there's no time limit for a mandatory reconsideration.

1298
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,310
我的时间是有上限的
I've got a time limit.

1299
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,890
可能申诉还会不成功
And you might not win.

1300
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,820
还是继续申请失业津贴吧
Please, just keep signing on.

1301
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:35,950
找个人帮你在网上求职
Get somebody to help you with the online job searches.

1302
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:39,990
否则 你有可能失去一切
Otherwise, you could lose everything.

1303
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:44,990
请不要贸然行事 我就见过类似的情况
Please don't do this. I've seen it before.

1304
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:49,720
好人 诚实的人 最后无家可归
Good people, honest people, on the street.

1305
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,930
谢谢你的建议 安
Thank you, Ann.

1306
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:57,470
但失去自尊就等于失去了一切
But when you lose your self-respect, you're done for.

1307
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,440
哥几个回头见啦
I'll be seeing you gentlemen later.

1308
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:42,720
等保安来看看这个吧
Oh, wait until security sees this.

1309
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,210
喂 你这闹什么幺蛾子呢
What's going on here? What are you fucking playing at?

1310
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:06,950
- 哎 别碰我们  - 你倒挺机智
- Aye-aye. You cannot touch us.  - Well that's clever, in't it?

1311
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,990
这是我新创作的装置艺术
It's me new art installation.

1312
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:27,010
当然可以 小伙子 来吧
Eh? Certainly can, lads. Come on.

1313
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,190
嚯 你们这新潮玩意倒是齐活
Look at this, you got all the technology.

1314
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:01,560
- 看呀  - 真不敢相信
- Look at this!  - I can't believe it.

1315
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:05,800
真不敢相信 看你干的好事
I cannot believe it, man. What have you done?

1316
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:09,050
这是我的新嗜好 要不也写进简历
This is me new hobby. Shall I put that on my CV?

1317
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,970
你就从来没有想过
Did you stop, even for a second,

1318
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:14,560
这样做可能造成的后果吗
to think about the consequences of what you've done here?

1319
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:18,110
我只知道 如果约不到面谈
All I know, mate, is if I divvent get my appeal date,

1320
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:21,070
我就每天上这搞创作
I'll be here every day doing this.

1321
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,820
- 太离谱了 还每天  - 对 每天
- Unbelievable. Every day?  - Every day.

1322
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:26,150
本 干脆报警吧
Tell you what, Ben, just phone the police. Okay.

1323
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,290
真不敢相信
I cannae... Listen, mate, I cannot believe this now.

1324
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:30,740
这事我们不管了 只能报警了
This is out of our hands. We're gonna have to phone the cops, man.

1325
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:32,910
如果你能称职一点
Well, if youse had done your job like you should have done,

1326
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,330
我也不会出此下策
I wouldn't have had to resort to this.

1327
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,380
真不敢相信 真不敢相信
I cannot believe it. I cannot believe it.

1328

Go on, lad, give him a hand.

1329

1334
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,320
你他妈就是丹尼尔·布莱克？
Are you fucking... Are you Daniel Blake?

1335
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,490
就是在下
I am Daniel Blake, yes.

1336
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,200
隆重介绍丹尼尔·布莱克
Hey, this is Daniel Blake!

1337
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,780
此真壮举哉 耶

It's all right, son. Look after yoursel', eh?

注意保暖
Keep yoursel' warm like.

1343
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:15,120
真是位绅士啊
You're a gentleman.

1344
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:19,970
你要申诉的是什么事
So what's, what's your appeal all about?

1345
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:25,050
骗子
Liar!

1346
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,560
你因涉嫌损坏公物被捕
You're... You're under arrest on suspicion of criminal damage.

1347
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,050
这是正义的失败
Hey, a miscarriage of justice, eh.

1348
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:34,930
慢着 你退后
Slow down. Whoa. Back off.

1349
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,140
好吧
All right, all right, all right.

1350
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:37,860
你他妈抓他干什么
What the fuck's going on? Eh?

1351
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:41,150
怎么不抓那些尽知道处罚别人的混蛋
You should be arresting the wankers who came up with sanctions. Eh?

1352
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:44,330
那个红脸蛋的死秃子 叫啥来着
That preachy baldy cunt. What's his name?

1353
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,950
那个叫什么伊恩·邓肯的混蛋
Ian Duncan fucking what's-his-face.

1354
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,860
还有那些住大别墅的土豪
Aye, and the posh dicks in their mansions

1355
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:51,070
搞出了“卧室税”这么个玩意折腾残疾人
who came up with the fucking bedroom tax for disabled...

1356
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:54,990
走吧 反正你们警察也干不长了
Listen, youse are all gonna be out of a fucking job anyway.

1357
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,160
要被私有化了吧 傻缺保守党
Privatizing you, eh? All the fucking Tories, man.

1358
01:26:58,290 --> 01:27:01,170
那些首富俱乐部成员
Aye, members of the fucking big club, eh.

1359
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:02,880
伊顿公学的兔崽子们
Fucking posh Eton twats.

1360
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,180
应该给丹尼尔·布莱克封爵
Sir Daniel fucking Blake, pal!

1361
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:11,350
应该给你建座雕像
Hey, should be a statue made for you, pal.

1362
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,190
丹尼尔·布莱克爵士
Fucking Sir Daniel Blake!

1363
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,610
国民表率 社会栋梁

1364
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:22,320
耶
Yay!

1365
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:28,990
现在怎么办
So, what happens now?

1366
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,740
这是一份警告单的复印件
Right, this is a copy of the caution sheet.

1367
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:35,200
因为你已经供认了全部罪名
Because you fully admitted the offences

1368
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,200
且无犯罪记录
and you've been of good character in the past,

1369
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,210
根据《公共秩序法》第五章
we're cautioning you for the offence of criminal damage,

1370
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:42,760
对你损害公物的行为提出警告
under Section Five of the Public Order Act.

1371
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,130
请切记 如若再犯
But please remember that these can come back

1372
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:50,140
这些记录将对你不利
and haunt you if you re-offend.

1373
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:52,350
所以 不要给自己惹麻烦
So try to keep yourself out of trouble.

1374
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:56,860
好吧
Aye.

1375
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:01,240
- 送他出去吧  - 这边走 先生
- See him out, please.  - This way, Mr Blake.

1376
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:46,410

Come, I need to talk to you.

1378
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,830
我们打电话你都不接
We called you loads of times.

1379
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,010
丹
Dan!

1380
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:13,010
妈妈最近很伤心
Mum's been so sad lately.

1381
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:15,390
你为什么不跟她说话了
Why don't you speak to her?

1382
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:18,020
你电话欠费了吗
Don't you have credit on the phone?

1383
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:32,320
我看见你了
I see you.

1384
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,320
我们知道你心脏不好
We understand what happened to your heart.

1385
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,040
妈妈问过你的邻居了
Mum spoke to one of your neighbours.

1386
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,120
我们之前不知道
We didn't know about it.

1387
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,100
外面好冷啊
It's cold out here.

1388
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:02,350
我冻死了
I'm freezing.

1389
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:09,350
黛西 我身体不太舒服
Please, Daisy, I'm not feeling very well.

1390
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:12,160
我给你做了点古斯米饭
I made you some couscous.

1391
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,980
还带了迪伦的棒棒糖
And Dylan sent you his lollipop.

1392
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:19,360
他也很想你呢
He's really missing you, too.

1393
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,380
黛西 你还是走吧 求你了
Just go, Daisy, please.

1394
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,130
我能问你个问题吗 丹
Can I ask you one question, Dan?

1395
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,100
你是不是帮过我们
Did you help us?

1396
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,960
应该是吧
Suppose so.

1397
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:38,730
那我们为什么不能帮你呢
So why can't I help you?

1398
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,400
对不起
I'm sorry.

1399
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:51,400
对不起 黛西
I'm sorry, Daisy.

1400
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,200
真的对不起
I'm really sorry.

1401
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:10,210
我不是个容易紧张的人 凯蒂 但这次我真的紧张了
You know, I'm not usually a nervous person, Katie, but I'm nervous about this.

1402
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,920
这是人之常情 丹
It's only natural, Dan.

1403
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:13,430
我就是想有个了结
I just want it done, you know?

1404
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:16,430
你准备很充分 文件都备齐了
Yeah. Well, you're prepared. You got all your papers.

1405
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:18,430
代理人也很棒
You've got a good, good person representing you.

1406
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21,590
等结束了 就来我们家吃晚饭庆祝
And then when you're done, you can come, come to dinner to celebrate.

1407
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:23,650
孩子们都很想见你呢
The kids are really looking forward to seeing you.

1408
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:50,460
你好 我是丹尼尔·布莱克 我是来申诉的
Hi, er, Daniel Blake. I've come for my appeal for the reinstatement of my...

1409
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:52,470
想重新申请就业支持津贴
Employment and Support Allowance.

1410
01:31:57,630 --> 01:31:59,710
- 你好 丹尼尔  - 你好

- You're here for support, yeah?  - Yeah.

1413
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:12,030
丹尼尔 你的申诉将由具备法定资格的委员会主席和医生评估
Daniel, your appeal will be heard by a legally qualified chairperson and a doctor.

1414
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:14,110
- 希望能有好运气吧  - 嗯
- Aye, fingers crossed.  - Yeah...

1415
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:16,730
我要是申诉失败 就露宿街头了
If I lose this appeal, I'm out on the streets.

1416
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:20,820
你的医生发来了健康报告
Well, we've got some updated reports here from your GP,

1417
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:23,450
你的个人健康顾问和理疗师
your own consultant and your physiotherapist.

1418
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,210
他们都对结果非常气愤
And they're all furious.

1419
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:27,700
你一定会成功的
You're gonna win this, Dan.

1420
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,130
这种申诉我每周都会处理
I do this every week.

1421
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:33,870
- 我以性命担保  - 我说吧
- I bet me life on it.  - I told ya.

1422
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:40,470
别紧张 自然地回答问题就好
Just be yourself, answer the questions and relax.

1423
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:42,480
我真的很有信心
I'm really confident.

1424
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,520
你有什么问题吗
D'you have any questions?

1425
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:48,510
我的确有几件事不吐不快啊
Well, I've got one or two things I'd like to get off me chest.

1426
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,310
- 他们会听吗  - 这是他们的职责
- But will they listen?  - It's the least they can do.

1427
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:52,860
我能跟他一起进去吗
And can I go in with him?

1428
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:54,520
我帮你问问 你想她陪你进去吗
I'll certainly ask. Would you like her to?

1429
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,690
- 当然好  - 好吗
- Yeah. Definitely, yeah.  - Yeah?

1430
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:58,280
好 我会问的 完全没问题
Okay, I'll certainly ask. No problem at all.

1431
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:00,120
好的 谢谢
All right. Thank you.

1432
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,030
乐意帮助 我先去看看情况
My pleasure. I'll just go and see what the score is.

1433
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:06,530
- 好  - 听上去不错 对吧
- Yeah.  - Sounds good, don't it?

1434
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:09,490
你看那帮人
Look at them.

1435
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,970
真有意思 我的身家性命全掌握在他们手上
It's funny, they've got my life in their hands.

1436
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:21,560
凯蒂 谢谢你陪我来
Thanks, Katie, for coming.

1437
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:23,840
谢谢你让我来
Thank you for asking me.

1438
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:26,300
你这个固执的老混蛋
You stubborn old bastard.

1439
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:34,490
我想去洗把脸
I think I'll go and freshen up, yeah?

1440
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:35,740
好
All right.

1441
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,620
这里谁快打电话叫救护车 拨九九九
Can somebody, er, phone an ambulance, please? 9-9-9.

1442
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:33,910
有人在厕所里晕倒了
There's a guy collapsed in the toilet. He's flat out.

1443
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,700
快打九九九 快
Phone 9-9-9. Somebody, please.

1444
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:38,370
丹
Dan!

1445
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:40,330
不 丹
No! Dan!

1446
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,630
他心脏病发作了 做人工呼吸吧
Just had a heart attack. Yeah, two breaths, please.

1447
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:45,840
哦 丹
Oh, Dan!

1448
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:49,440
- 人工呼吸…  - 他还有呼吸吗
- Just the two breaths...  - Is he breathing?

1449
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,470
哦 丹
Oh, Dan.

1450
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,810
我们已经尽力救他了
Listen, we're trying to help him as much as we can.

1451
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:55,640
继续啊 继续啊 不要停
No, no, no, please keep going, please keep going. Don't stop.

1452
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:56,850
他已经去了
I'm afraid we've lost him.

1453
01:34:57,150 --> 01:35:01,660
不 别说这种话 不要说这种话
No, don't say that, please don't say that. No.

1454
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:05,230
- 不  - 真的很遗憾
- No, please!  - I'm so sorry.

1455
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,400
请节哀
I'm sorry.

1456
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:09,160
- 求你了  - 救护车呢
- Please...  - Where's the ambulance now?

1457
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:11,740
- 求你了  - 病人没有回应
- Please.  - No response at all.

1458
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:19,760
求你们不要放弃
Please. Please try again.

1459
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:12,890
嗯…
Erm...

1460
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:18,900
他们管这个叫“贫民葬礼” 因为早上九点是最便宜的时段
They call this a "pauper's funeral" because it's the cheapest slot, at 9:00.

1461
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:22,900
但对我们来说 丹绝不是贫民
But Dan wasn't a pauper to us.

1462
01:36:24,730 --> 01:36:27,480
他给我们的关爱 千金难买
He gave us things that money can't buy.

1463
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:32,750
他去世后 我从他身上找到了这封信
When he died, I found this on him.

1464
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:37,500
他习惯用铅笔写字
He always used to write in pencil.

1465
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:40,550
嗯…
Erm...

1466
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:45,760
他本想在申诉时读的 但再也没有机会了
And he wanted to read it at his appeal but he never got the chance to.

1467
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,600
他是个满腔热情的人
And I swear that this lovely man,

1468
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,060
本有大把机会回馈和奉献
had so much more to give,

1469
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:59,320
是政府让他过早地离开了我们
and that the State drove him to an early grave.

1470
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,770
他是这么写的
And this is what he wrote.

1471
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:12,370
“我不是客户 不是顾客 也不是服务用户”
"I am not a client, a customer, nor a service user.

1472

"I am not a shirker, a scrounger, a beggar, nor a thief.

1473
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:23,790
“我不是一串社保号码 不是屏幕上的一段数据”
"I'm not a National Insurance Number or blip on a screen.

1474
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:29,220
“我按时纳税 一分不少 我为此深感自豪”
"I paid my dues, never a penny short, and proud to do so.

1475
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,770
“我不向权贵卑躬屈膝 诚心对待邻里 尽我所能伸出援助之手”
"I don't tug the forelock, but look my neighbour in the eye and help him if I can.

1476
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:39,430
“我不接受 更不寻求施舍”
"I don't accept or seek charity.

1477
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:46,440
“我的名字 是丹尼尔·布莱克 我是堂堂正正的人 不是街边乞怜的狗”
"My name is Daniel Blake. I am a man, not a dog.

1478
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,820
“我在此讨回本属于我的权利”
"As such, I demand my rights.

1479
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,450
“并要求你们以尊重之心待我”
"I demand you treat me with respect.

1480
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:58,540
“我 丹尼尔·布莱克 是一个公民”
"I, Daniel Blake, am a citizen,

1481
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:02,420
“无所奢求 无可妥协”
"nothing more and nothing less."

1482
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:04,760
谢谢
Thank you.
