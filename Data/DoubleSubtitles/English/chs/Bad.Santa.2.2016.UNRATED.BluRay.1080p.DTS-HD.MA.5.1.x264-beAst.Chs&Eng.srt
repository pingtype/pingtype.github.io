Why do you have to go so soon? We just got back together

140
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
废话少说 我们不是重聚
Cut that shit out. We're not back together

141
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,490
你肯定忘记今天啥日子了
Guess you don't know what today is

142
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,600
我他妈今年是哪年都不记得了 孩子
I don't even know what fucking year it is, kid

143
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,560
今天我生日
It's my birthday

144
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,080
- 今天你妹的生日？ - 嗯哼
- Today is your fucking birthday?  - Uh-huh

145
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,240
我二十一岁了 正式成人
I'm 21 . Officially a man

146
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,210
妹的 你都二十一了 好冷
Goddamn. You're 21 already. That's creepy

147
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,440
- 你还打算给我破处吗  - 我要干啥？
- Are you still gonna pop my cherry?  - Am I gonna what?

148
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,760
不 滚你丫的
No! Fuck no!

149
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,360
但你答应过 说我二十一岁 就破我的处
But you said that when I was 21 that you'd pop my cherry

150
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,360
我说的是让别人来破
I said I'd get it done by somebody else

151
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,080
另外 我是男人 你不是来搞笑的吧？
Besides that, I'm a fucking guy. You didn't turn funny, did you?

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,480
我搞笑？
Am I funny?

153
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,480
那你还没有和任何人做过
So you haven't done it with anybody yet

154
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,840
不管男人 女人 动物或其他
Not a man or a woman or an animal or anything

155
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,570
对 我一直等你
No, I waited for you

156
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,400
- 不过 你有打飞机…  - 你指的是手淫吧
- But surely, you jerked off or...  - You mean masturbate, don't you?

157
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,210
非要严格来说 就这意思
Well, if you wanna be scientific, yeah, I guess so

158
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
我朋友罗妮说
My friend Ronnie says,

159
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,880
玩自己的小香肠的时候 想想自己的妈
it's when you play with your wiener and think about your mother

160
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,120
我弄过一次 感觉怪胎
I did it once, but it felt weird

161
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,440
她已经升仙了 会在天上看着我的
She's in heaven with God, you know. Watching me

162

[仙人掌花汽车旅店]
[免费 线缆/上网/电话/冰箱]

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,160
好吧 交代一下 他问过我他的小鸡鸡该放哪里
Okay, so here's how it's gonna go down. He's already asked me where his cherry is

164
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,680
你告诉他 把他的鸡鸡放进你的裆裆
So you could tell him to put his dick in your purse

165
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,720
他反正也感觉不到啥区别
and he wouldn't know any fucking difference

166
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
这是你赚过最容易的二十块钱
It's gonna be the easiest 20 bucks you ever made

167
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,640
二十块
Twenty bucks?

168
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
你喝高了吧 威利
You must be high on some strong shit, Willie

169
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,120
一百 否则我立马走人
A hundred. Or I'm gonna carry my ass outta this old piece of a room right now

170
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,640
好吧 五十 不然我让你妈做这单
All right. Fifty, or I'll just go get your mother

171
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
六十块
Sixty

172
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
成交
All right

173
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,320
别在背后搞怪 你负全责 威利
And nothing up my ass. You done took all that, Willie

174
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,440
好的
Okay

175
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,440
就这么办 等下我还得去接孙子芭蕾舞下课
Well, let's get to it. I gotta pick up my grandson from ballet

176
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,920
- 你要三明治吗  - 不
- Can I fix you a sandwich?  - No

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,840
- 我吃过你的三明治  - 威利 三明治
- I got your sandwich, baby  - Willie, I made you a sandwich

178
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,840
我现在要走 三明治等下给奥帕尔好了
I ain't sticking around. Just give it to Opal after

179
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,410
现在 听好了 接下来
Now, listen, here's how it works

180
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,680
她会脱掉内裤 四肢着地
She's gonna pull her rig off. And she's gonna get on all fours

181
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,000
你站她身后 脱掉内内
Now, you stand behind her and drop your rig

182
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,840
你会看到类似于日本料理的玩意
Then, you're gonna see something that looks like some kind of Japanese food

183
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,000
其实不是 不要去吃 那可不是牛眼
It ain't, so don't eat it. That's the bulls-eye

184
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,770
然后你拨弄你的小老二
Then you just start tugging on your little soldier

185
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,410
让它立正 插入那话儿
Wait till he gets to attention, then poke him in there

186
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,050
一直插到它吐出来
Keep poking it in there till he spits up

187
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,330
你需要套套
You're gonna need a raincoat

188
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,720
她肯定有一个 那不用担心
She'll have one, so don't worry about that

189
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,240
完事之后 去浴室 清洗裆部
As soon as you're done, run to the bathroom, wash your crotch

190
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,680
如此 第二天你醒来的时候才不会发现被子上有燕麦粥
That way, you don't wake up wondering why you got oatmeal in your carpet

191
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,200
用嘴呼吸 那样不会呕吐
Breathe through your mouth so that you don't puke

192
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,880
没问题了吧 明白了吗
Shouldn't be a problem for you. You got it?

193
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,400
- 你有六十块吗  - 没有
- You got 60 bucks?  - No

194
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,320
- 你有多少  - 我有二十
- What you got?  - I have $20

195
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,770
小声点
Keep it down

196
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,160
- 我有二十  - 事后给她
- I have 20  - Give it to her after

197
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,880
- 回见 奥帕尔  - 嗯
- Later, Opal  - Mm-hmm

198
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,680
来吧 宝贝 来
Come on, baby. Come on

199
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,960
咬一口我这粗麦面包
Get a bite of this pumpernickel bread

200
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,600
妈的 威利 赶紧 我们要错过火车了
Damn it, Willie. Hurry up! We're gonna miss our train

201
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,040
没看到我急色匆匆吗 我来了
You see me walking backwards, asshole? I'm coming

202

What do you need me for? You can crack a fucking safe

341
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,960
我不得不说 我想你了 我的小天使
Well, I'd like to say it's because I've missed you, my angel

342
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,440
实际上我得了帕金森病 听力也大不如前
But I got a touch of the Parkinson's and my hearing ain't what it used to be,

343
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,360
所以我需要你来开保险箱
so I'm gonna need you on the safe

344
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,560
唔

不行 这事我记你一辈子
No, I think I'll hang on to it

348

If I cut ties with every numbnut who tried to shoot me,

350
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,570
我就不会怀上你
I never would've gotten pregnant with you

351
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
行了孩子 和过去一样吧

你不信任你妈？
What, you don't trust your mother?

357
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,800
信她还不如信你
Yeah, I trust her about as far as I can throw you

358
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,200
信你还不如信她
And I trust you about as far as I can throw her

359
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,930
拜托 威利 我需要这单

你不也是吗 看看你自己
And I know your sorry ass does too. Look at you, man

361
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,810
知道了 如果要我参加 必须你我联手对付她
Okay, if you want me in on this, it's you and me against her

362
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
明白吗？
You got it?

363
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,840
她别想从保险箱拿到一个子儿 听懂我吗？
She don't get a fucking nickel of what's in that safe. Get me?

364
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,520
- 完事后我们甩掉她  - 正确
- We'll cut her out after the grab  - Damn right

365
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,440
我就知道你不会袖手旁观 孩子永远是妈妈的儿子
I knew you couldn't stay away. You always were your mama's boy

366
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,120
别再啰嗦家里的事 好吗？
You just pipe down about the family stuff, okay?

367
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,520
是看在钱的面子上 句号 听懂了吗？
I'm in this for the dough, period. You get me?

Spare some change

370

想想那些悲惨的别人
Think about somebody besides your fucking selves

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,650
我们必须看下保险箱 了解流程
We gotta get eyes on that safe. Need to know the make

372
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,290

I guess the abortion didn't take

379
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,480
保佑你的心灵 你妈的小气鬼

- Well, you don't know shit, then, do you?  - Hey, listen, before we had midget...

385
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,320
不好意思…是小人 也就是威利

喝多少酒都不能忘记
There ain't enough booze to forget it

388
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,320

Well, he'd get panic attacks. It was embarrassing

389
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,160
当我去行骗的时候 我只能把他放在外边
I had to make him stay outside when I was turning a trick or bowling

390
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,080
等一下 你还会犯尴尬？
Wait a fucking minute, you were embarrassed?

391
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,320
你这不是贼喊捉贼嘛 还是掩耳盗铃什么的？
Isn't that kind of like the pot calling the other cot a fuck kettle,

392
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,170
- 反正就是这意思  - 你特娘说什么？
- or whatever it was?  - What the fuck you say?

393

He's home-schooled

394
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
我得去灌点酒
I need a refill

395
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,160
- 在角落里蹲一会儿  - 住手 威利
- And another fucking corner  - Stop it, Willie

396
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,000
干嘛？这些钱迟早都是我们的 谁关心啊
What? We're gonna steal this shit any fucking way. Who cares?

397
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,890
我们被炒鱿鱼的话 就无权进屋了
But if we get fired, we got no access to the building

398
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,120
进不了屋的话 就不能接触保险箱
And if we got no access to the building, we got no access to the safe

399
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,920
接触不到保险箱的话
And if we got no access to the safe,

400
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,440
我还有什么必要站在这里 冻得我蛋蛋的忧伤
there's no reason for me to be standing out here, freezing my fucking nuts off

401
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,050
你的蛋还没有被磨掉吗？
You mean your nuts haven't been scraped off

402
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,560
据说矮子的蛋离地面比较近
because they're so low to the ground already?

403
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,600
每次你醉的不省人事的时候
You know every time you're passed out,

404
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,080
我都坐在你的前额孵蛋 拍照
I lay them on your forehead and take a picture of it

405
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,240
我在朋友圈里发了一大堆我孵你的照片
I got a whole Instagram of that shit of me tea-bagging you

406
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,840
足足四千个赞 你老母 哈哈
Four thousand followers and counting, motherfucker. Ha-ha!

407
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,490
你们请自便 反正我得离开一下
Well, knock yourselves out. I'm getting the fuck out of here

408
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,720
拜托 现在是家庭团聚时间
Aw, come on, we're having family time here

409
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,720
他总是那么的疲软 也许是因为早产的缘故
He's always been too goddamn soft. Probably because he was born early

410
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,360
乖乖 我被他绊了一跤才意识到我生了个小孩
Hell, I didn't even know I'd given birth until I tripped over him

411
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,150
[酒铺]

412
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,840
- 你好  - 嗨 威利
- Hello  - Hi, Willie

413
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,490
孩子 怎么有我的号码？
Kid, how'd you get my number?

414
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,930
破处女狼给我的
The cherry pop lady gave it to me

415
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
天啦噜
Oh, Jesus

416
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,760
我替你的公寓打扫卫生 威利 给宠物昆虫喂食
I cleaned your apartment, Willie. And I fed your insects

417
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,330
它们长得好大
They're getting really big

418
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,970
要不要我替你弄棵圣诞树？
Do you want me to get you a Christmas tree?

419
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,280
- 啥？我要树干什么？ - 以便我俩一起过圣诞节
- What? Why would I want a tree?  - So we can spend Christmas together

420
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,240
我在芝加哥 孩子
I'm in fucking Chicago, kid

421
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,520
那你不回来过圣诞节喽？
So you're not coming back for Christmas?

422
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,770
- 对 我不回来过圣诞节  - 芝加哥在美国的中西部 威利
- No, I'm not coming home for Christmas  - Chicago's in the Midwest, Willie

423
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,410
也有饥饿英雄三明治店
They have Hungry Hoagies there too

424
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,560
那我替你向他们问好 好吗？
Well, good. I'll tell them you said hello, okay?

425
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,760
那家三明治店我谁都不认识
Except I don't know anyone at that Hungry Hoagies

426
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,090
别没事给我打电话 好吧？
All right, listen, you gotta quit fucking calling me, okay?

427
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,690
- 你在燃烧我的时间  - 万一有紧急电话呢
- You're burning my minutes  - But what if it's an emergency?

428
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,880
好吧 如果是紧急电话才打给我 明白？
Fine! If it's an emergency, call me, all right?

429
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,000
不然让我的电话保持安静 知道了？
Otherwise, leave me the fuck alone, okay?

430
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,120
知道了 我只在紧急的时候打
Okay. I'll only call if it's an emergency

431
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,330
拜
Bye

433
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,040
给孩子们食物 给钱吧
Okay, feed the kids. Come on. Give it up

434
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,280
看看那些将军肚的孩子们
You've seen them babies with beer bellies

435
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,250
人在做 天在看
Ho, ho! Come on, you got Jesus and the lambikins watching over you,

436
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,240
再看看他们的购物清单
checking their list twice

437
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,520
说你呢女士 捐赠一点小钱怎么样？
Here you go, lady, how about a little money?

438
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,730
你一定不希望孤儿们暴动
You know what, you'd better hope the orphans don't riot

439
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,640
他们饿到要立马啃吃你们的屁股
They'll eat your fat ass right off the bat

440
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,760
很多孩子断手断脚 什么都断
You know, a lot of these kids don't got any arms and legs and shit

441
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,690
真走运 妈咪 你的小孩身体健全
You're lucky. See, ma'am? Yours got all their parts

我的地盘
Whoa-ho-ho! My spot

445
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,400
你站在我的地盘上
You are standing on my spot

446
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,120
真的？那就搞笑了 这里也没写你的名字啊
Really? That's funny, I don't see your fucking name on it anywhere

447
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,360
公平起见 我把名字写在隐蔽的地方
Well, in fairness, I did leave it unattended,

448
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,760
因为我必须留足小男孩的地方
but that's only because I had to run off to the little boys' room

449
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,770
你算什么 游戏秀的主持人？
What are you, a fucking game show host or something?

狗屎 没门 只收现金
Bullshit. No fucking way. Fucking cash only

455
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,640
- 十块以上  - 好吧
- Ten dollars or more  - Okay

456
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,250
百元大钞更好 干嘛
Hundreds are better. What?

457
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,960
我必须提醒你注意语言
I am going to have to ask you to watch your language

458
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,690
你得对得起你穿的套装

我可警告你
I'm warning you

461

没有任何人和事物能够阻挡我散播快乐
Nothing and no one is getting in the way of me spreading my joy!

吼吼吼吼吼吼
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

463
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,120
知道吗 你就是个变态
You know what, I think you're some kind of pervert

464
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
你害怕我强占你的敏感地带
and you're afraid I'm muscling in on your fucking fondle territory

465
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,200
- 我就是这么想的  - 我终于明白了 对
- That's what I think  - I see what's going on here. Yes, I see

466
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,080
- 你的内心很崩溃  - 是吗
- You are hurting inside  - Is that right?

467
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,200
只有一事可改变
And there's only one thing that can change that

468
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,240
- 是什么？ - 抱抱
- Yeah? What's that?  - A hug

469
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,410
- 你是不是傻掉了？ - 圣诞公公之抱抱
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?  - A hug from Santa!

470
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,160
我才不要圣诞公公的抱抱
No, I don't need no fucking hug from Santa

471
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,640
- 放开我 你老母  - 融解所有的压力
- Let go of me, motherfucker  - Melt all that stress away!

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,080
你有没有感觉到寒意 老兄
Would you cool it, pal?

473

你把小孩子们都吓跑了 知道我是什么意思吧
You're scaring all the kids away. You know what I mean?

You better get out of here

482
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,920

You fucking perverted fucking asshole!

483

干什么 先等一下
What the fuck? Hang on a second

484
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,560
他专门欺骗小孩 不是我 我才是英雄
He's the fucking kid diddler, not me. I'm a hero!

485
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,000
- 你肯定不会死在上面？ - 我钻过更小的空间 相信我
- Sure you won't die up there?  - I've done smaller spaces, trust me

486
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,840
万一你不成功的话 儿子 我有个雪茄烟盒 替你造个漂亮棺材
Well, if you don't make it, son, I got a cigar box, make a nice casket

487
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,640
你叫谁儿子？
Who you calling "son"?

488
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,600
我敢说我的阴户是色盲 这样你就放心了
Well, I'm proud to say that my pussy is color-blind, so you never know

489
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,960

Whoa! You go, little sperm. Get up in there

491
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,880
这种绝活可不是每天都看得到的
Well, you don't see something like that every day

492
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,480
啊 瓶子 不是可回收的吗
Ow! Bottles! Recycle that shit!

493
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,080
啊 干你… 啊 不

Well, I always wanted to shit on a tattooed dick

497

如此我们便各得其所
so we're perfect for each other

498

Lucky for you, Giving City has a high standing in the community,

502

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,840
把自己清理干净后 把套装还掉
You can turn in your suit when you clean yourself up

504
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,160
等一下子 你解雇我了？
Now, hang on a second. You're firing me?

505
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,520
我刚铲除了一个性变态
I rooted out a pervert

506
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,840
明显你应该奖励我
You should be throwing me a fucking parade

507
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,000
那事我们很感激 但你浑身散发着威士忌的臭味
And we're very grateful. But you reek of whiskey

508
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,160
你这是明知故犯
You know the rules and you're flouting them

509
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,480
明知故犯？
Flouting?

510
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,530
我可没吸过谁的酒精 我指的是用吸管
I never sucked jizz out of nobody's ass. I mean, with a straw

511
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,840
你说的就是吸精大法吧
I believe that's felching

512
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,720
那我可不得而知
Not that I would know

513
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,400
节日快乐 库克先生 你的自由算作是我的礼物吧
Uh, happy holidays, Mr. Cook. Consider your freedom a gift from me

514
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,240

Well, hang on a second. Hang on! I only had one drink

515
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,640
只是为了帮助我抵御寒冷 我的蛋都冻掉了
And that was just to keep warm out there. I'm freezing my nuts off

516
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,800
开诚布公的话 你们应当给我们提供
And if we're being honest here, you, you guys should be supplying us

517
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,200
类似电热内衣之类的东西
with some kind of electric underwear or some shit

518
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,600
真开诚布公的话 我不喜欢被骗
Oh, well, if we're being honest, I don't like being lied to

519
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,840
- 拜托 我需要这  - 请不要那么介意嘛
- Please. I need this  - Why do you care so much?

520
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,880
我为什么要介意？
Why do I care? Why do I care

521
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,410
我来告诉你原因 这世界一团糟
I'll tell you why I care. Because the world's a fucking shit hole

522
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,480
然而我穿上了套装 我感觉…
But when I put this suit on, I feel like...

523
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,000
就好比麦克阿瑟将军穿上了他的制服
Well, I feel like General MacArthur must have felt when he put his uniform on

524
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,800
杀光所有的菲律宾人
and went and killed all them Filipinos

525
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,840
我非常的容忍孩子们
Look, I, I put up with a lot of shit from kids...

526
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,920
为了孩子们 我绝对不会有辱此套装 绝对不会
For the kids. I won't piss on the suit. I really won't

527
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,240
就给我娘西皮的一次机会吧！
I mean, give a broke-dick motherfucker a chance, will you?

528
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,280
好吧 我给你改过自新的机会 但你也得帮我一下
Fine. I'll give you a second chance. If you give me a chance to help you

529
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,290
好的
All right

530
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,330
情况如何 爱丽丝？
How we looking, Alice?

531
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,880
根据这份报告
Well, according to this report,

532
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,530
感恩之城今年收入大减
Giving City's gonna lose a record amount of money this year

533
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,280
每次你那么说的时候 我的老二硬如铁
Ugh, every time you say that, my dick gets so hard

534
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,040
- 好吧  - 我们现在来一发吗？
- Okay  - Hey, why don't we just do it right now

535
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,530
- 求你  - 不
- Come on  - No

536
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,520
我把你的佣金提高百分之五
I'll up your commission to five percent

537
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,290
百分之十 我就让你干我的破鞋
Make it ten, and I'll let you do that thing with my shoe

538
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,280
要两只破鞋 你必须旁边看着
Both shoes. And you have to watch

539
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,680
成交
Deal

540
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,920
- 这里不能抽烟  - 去报警啊
- You can't smoke here, sir  - So call the fucking law

541
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,040
当他们扭着肥臀到场的时候
And while they're rolling their fat asses down here,

542
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,930
我已经抽的云里雾里 像台老别克
I'll be smoking like an old Buick, all right?

543
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,320
拘留？天那 威利
Arrested? Christ! William

544
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,080
- 不是拘留 是扣留  - 来发金酒
- Not arrested. I was detained  - Yeah. Shot of gin

545
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,490
你想什么呢？差点搞砸了
What were you thinking? You could have fucked this whole thing up

546
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,360
- 问题解决了  - 唔
- I handled it  - Mmm

547
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,480
答应和她一起去嗜酒者互诫协会
Told her I'd go to an AA meeting with her

548
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,360
别理他们那套 威利 喝酒有什么大不了的
Don't buy their shit, William. No such thing as an alcoholic

549
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,850
只表示你比较弱而已
Just a sign of a weak liver

550
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,650
我说了自有办法 你怎么 聋了？
I said I fucking handled it. What are you, deaf?

551
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,160
你说话舌头打结了 搅屎棍
Well, you talk like you have a cock in your mouth, shitstick

552
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,040
知道他为什么被称作“搅屎棍”？
Hey, you know why we call him "shitstick"?

553
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,650
因为他小时候 就喜欢后入
Because even when he was a baby, he tried to butt-fuck everything

554
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,000
- 妈的  - 玩具猴子 邻居家的狗
- Goddamn it  - Stuffed monkey, neighbor's dog

555
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,400
告诉你 只要有屁股的 他都会去干
I'm telling you, if it had a butt, he'd try to fuck it

556
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,520
用他的小鸡鸡
He's with his little nub, going

557
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,240
另外 你可以考虑和性感天使来一发
Anyway, I think you ought to be working the sexual angle with her,

558
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,680
据我了解 她丈夫不能行事
because I know for a fact that that husband isn't getting it done

559
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,720
那货一辈子就没有啪过小蒂蒂
That guy never rocked a clit in his life

560
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,320
这是我慈母般的肺腑之言 希望你用心
And that is one piece of motherly advice I hope you took to heart

561
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,240
[类似和尚含糊不清地念经]
你的摩托艇必须保持震动 直到她开始用方言祈祷
You motorboat that O-button till she's speaking in tongues

562
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,200
- 你知道“儿子”二字代表什么吧？ - 你什么时候这么娘了？
- You know what "son" means, right?  - When did you turn into such a pussy?

563
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,930
- 别担心 我好的很   - 我才不担心
- Don't worry, I'm fine  - I'm not worried

564
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,920
我只是希望你别把肺咳到我酒里去 明白？
I just don't want you hacking up your lung in my drink, okay?

565
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,840
没机会了 老娘的身子骨还有的一拼
Not a chance. Nah, this chassis' built to last

566
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,280
我一天两包薄荷香烟
You know, I smoked two packs of menthols a day,

567
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,480
再用一升金酒压压惊
washed it down with a liter of this gin...

568
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,160
我还能再来一发那小伙子的精汁
And I could still fill that shot glass with this man's jizz

569
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,010
- 我说了关我屁事 明白？ - 了解了 你还在生气我
- I said I don't give a shit, okay?  - Fine. I get it. You're mad at me

570
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,920
你觉我十三岁就准备真心当妈了吗
You think I was really ready to be a mom at 13?

571
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,890
我们本打算再过至少一年
Huh? We were gonna wait at least another year

572
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,400
你那个混蛋父亲
I mean, the one time your son of a bitch father

573
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,130
没射在我菊花里 结果我怀孕了
didn't put it in my ass, I had to go and get pregnant

574
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,600
- 乱心的事  - 美极了
- Shit happens  - That's fucking beautiful

575
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,410
我不想假装完美老妈
Look, I'm not gonna pretend I was a perfect mother

576
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
的确
Yeah, no shit

577
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,200
你让我背黑锅 我当时十一岁
You made me take the fall for you when I was 11

578
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,720
我俩没必要同时进局子
Well, there's no sense in us both going down

579
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,600
此外 成就了你男人本性 因为我你才有自我
Besides, it made a man of you. You are who you are because of me

580
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,000
我与你完全没有相似点
No, I'm not anything like you

581
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,760
是吗？你继续自说自话好了
Yeah? Well, you keep telling yourself that

582
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,600
那个侏儒怎么样了 天色已晚
Now where's your fucking midget? It's getting late

583
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,960
♪ Pop that pussy Hey, pop that pussy, baby ♪

584
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,730
什么…什么声音
What... What is that?

585
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
妈的
Shit!

586
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,280
那里面有喇叭吗
What, do you have a speaker up there?

587
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,200
多夫曼 上来
Dorfman, get up here

588
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:32,040
你确定是电话铃声吗？有可能是排风机的声音
You sure it was a phone ring? Might have just been the fan turning over

589
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,170
多夫曼 根据我的经验 排风机不会发出“顶你个肺”声
Well, Dorfman, last time I checked, fans don't "Pop That Pussy."

590
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,480
对 的确不会
No, I suppose they don't

591
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,720
我觉得是戴安派人监视我
No, I think Diane hired someone to spy on me

592
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,920
- 戴安？貌似不是她的风格  - 你盯着点她
- Diane? That doesn't sound like her  - I want you to watch her

593
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,890
本楼内的一切动静 任何蹊跷都报告我
Anything unusual, I wanna know about it. And cover the whole building

594
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,160
比如麦克风 摄像头 任何玩意
I'm talking microphones, cameras, everything

595
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,280
收到 女洗手间也已被关照
Copy. Ladies' room is already taken care of

596
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,000
他和爱丽丝有一腿
He's fucking Alice

597
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,970
- 我就说嘛  - 你打我电话干毛？
- Go figure  - Why the fuck would you call me?

598
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,160
就你这种人才才会开铃音模式
Well, you're the genius who left your ringer on

599
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,640
我只认识你们两个 何必打电话？
Because you the only two people I know. Why would you call?

600
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,040
她用鞋子干嘛呢？天
What's she doing with that shoe? Oh, God!

601
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,880
风道的声音被他听见了 有问题吗？
He heard a noise in the fucking vent. What's the big deal?

602
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,930
他听到风道里有“顶你个肺”问题大了
He heard "Pop That Pussy" in the vent, and that is a big fucking deal

603
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,160
她知道情况？
Think she knows?

604
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,000
- 哪个？ - 红发女郎 戴安
- Who?  - You know, the redheaded gal, Diane

605
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,610
知道她男人在鬼混？
That her husband's fooling around with the help?

606
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,880
我说的是 她是否知晓她男人
I'm saying, do you think she knows that her fucking husband

607
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,120
在盗窃善款？
is ripping off the goddamn charity?

608
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,850
谁鸟啊？只要她不挡路
Who gives a shit? As long as she doesn't get in the way

609
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,480
- 你能破保险箱吗？ - 当然能破
- Can you crack the safe?  - Of course I can crack the fucking safe

610
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,680
大约要三分钟 最多三分半钟
Probably take me about three minutes. Three and a half tops

611
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,760
你最好再减少一分钟 以防万一
Well, you shave a minute off that, you may be good for something

612
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,240
- 警报系统何解？ - 那是半人马二一〇〇型
- What about the alarm system?  - It's a Centaur 2100

613
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,760
先切断电源 它重启需要十分钟
We power it down, we have ten minutes before it reboots

614
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,570
但我首先要有电控室的钥匙
But I'm gonna need a key to the electrical room to access it

615
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,610
- 那是入内的唯一途径  - 我们怎么办
- It's the only way in  - Ah, shit, how are we gonna get that?

616
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,370
想都别想 威利
Don't even think about it, Willie

617
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,050
那个大浪蹄子是我的
That big bitch is mine

618
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,920
他得给你放尊重点
He should show you some respect

619
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,120
- 你才是核心人物 不是他  - 嘿 兰德尔
- You're the talent, not him  - Hey, Randall!

620
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,610
介意帮我一把吗
Mind giving me a hand over here?

621
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,370
这些东西要搬去礼堂
I've gotta get this stuff to the auditorium

622
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,480
他乐意至极 亲爱的 他是壮男
He'd love to, darling. Strong, strapping man like him

623
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,920
记住小蒂蒂 儿子 为了老妈
Clitoris, son. Do it for Mama

624
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,410
谢了 阳光姐
Thanks, Sunny

625
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,450
她很甜 我希望有几百个她那样的志愿者
She's so sweet. I wish I had a hundred volunteers like her

626
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,680
对 她是个人物 独此一份
Oh, yeah, she's something. I'm sure they only made one of her

627
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,920
你好吗 美女
How you doing, beautiful?

628
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,920
- 是叫吉娜吗  - 对的
- Gina, was it?  - That's right

629
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,880
- 雷纳德 我们还没有正式介绍过  - 那么你好 雷纳德 现在正式了
- Ronald. We haven't officially met  - Well, hello, Ronald. Officially

630
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,560
我觉得你一定不知道自己有多美
I bet you got no idea how beautiful you really are

631
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,210
不知道 也许多少有些自知
I don't know. I think I've got some idea

632
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,560
- 哦 是吗  - 至少有一点
- Oh, you do, do you?  - Maybe a little

633
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,640
我不是那么轻率的人 我可有标准
I don't mean to be indiscreet, but I do pretty well

634
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,040
没有金刚钻 别揽瓷器活
So if you can't bring your A game, don't even try

635
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,160
甜心 我不敢肯定你能承受我的金刚钻
Sweetheart, I'm not sure you could handle my A game

636
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,720
所谓一发就不可收拾
You get one hit of me and you'll be addicted

637
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,400
- 我喜欢你的自信  - 我会让你生逢七月四
- I like your confidence  - I'd light you up like the Fourth of July

638
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,000
听好了 雷纳德 咱开门见山吧
Look, Ronald, I'm just gonna cut to the chase here

639
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,560
我只坐头等舱
I am strictly first-class

640
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,930
比如克莱斯勒三〇〇 工厂直送 顶配规格
I'm talking Chrysler 300, factory-direct, fully loaded

641

I used to chew and feed you caramels, just like a mama bird does

有人问我不可惜了真牙吗
People ask me if I miss my old teeth

694

900
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,090
你夹的好紧 你干嘛的 伐木工？
That's quite a grip you got there. What are you, a lumberjack?

901
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,440
- 推铅球的 奥运会候补队员  - 好极了
- Shot put. Olympic alternate  - Nice

902
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,200
你可以只玩棍棍
Hey, listen, can you kind of stay up on the business end

903
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,000
不玩球球吗
and stay away from the nuts?

904
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,400
也许你可用拇指捅菊花？
Maybe if you put your thumb up my ass?

905
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,210
我不干
No, I don't do that

906
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,840
- 孩子  - 妈的 我老妈

909
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,960

What? Ugh

910
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,720
戴维！戴维！
Davis! Davis!

911
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,650
- 你朋友那？ - 我没什么朋友
- Where's your friend at?  - I ain't got any fucking friends!

912
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,050
注意语言
Hey, watch your language

913
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,600
我插你老婆鲍鱼的时候 还盯着本大爷的鸡鸡出出入入吗
Why don't I watch my dick go in and out of your wife's pussy lips while I'm at it?

914
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,240
是吗？笑话了 我老婆六个月前仙了 啵
Oh, yeah? Well, joke's on you because my wife died six months ago. Boom!

915
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,160
这样就能阻止我？死后僵直只会让鲍鱼更紧致
Like that will fucking stop me? Rigor mortis just make the pussy tighter

916
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,320
库克在哪？
Oh. Where's Cook?

917
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,960
看见吗
You see that?

918
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,360
赫
Huh? Yeah

919
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,680
- 大功告成  - 差不多吧
- We still got it, kid  - Yeah, I guess so

920
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,410
本该就是这样 威利
It was always supposed to be this way, William

921
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,960
你我 只是我搞砸了
You, me. Before I fucked it all up

922
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,080
但我俩联手的时候 我记挂你
But even when I was in the joint, I thought of you

923
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,960
总为了你的生日而喝一杯…一月三日
And I always had a drink on your birthday... January third

924
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,000
第七次了
Seventh

925
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,160

926
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,440
还有八月
And August. Yeah

927
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,650
日了鸭了 总之 重点是我记挂着
Well, fuck a duck. Anyway, uh, the point is that I miss this

928
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:53,090
想想我们能造成多大的破坏 就我们俩 从来都是
Just think of the damage we could do. Just the two of us. All the time

929
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,490
知道吗？有礼物给你
Hey. You know what? I got you a gift

930
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,640
我的人生 你从来没给过我礼物
You never got me a gift in my entire fucking life

931
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,800
啵吼
Well, boohoo

932
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,010
我孩子时 为娘的天天菊花下雨你以为全都是礼物雨吗？
You think it was raining presents in my backyard when I was a kid?

933
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:09,000
我想弥补失去的老时光
Look, I'm trying to make up for lost time here

934
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,600
- 做个更好的…  - 父母？
- You know, be a better...  - Parent?

935
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,040
我在边桌找到的
Yeah. I found this in the bedside table

936
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,170
脑子快
Think fast

937
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,090
什么鬼
The fuck?

938
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,360
- 别乱搞  - 这归我了
- Don't do that  - Oh, that's for me

939
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,960
闭嘴
Shut up

940
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,080
别用那玩意捅我
Pew-pew- Don't touch me with the fucking thing

941
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,000

942
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,970
- 你拿去吧  - 干嘛用的
- I want you to have this  - What the fuck's that for?

943
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:44,840
对付侏儒 他曾想干掉你 我不会给他第二次机会的
The midget. He tried to kill you once. I'm not gonna give him a second chance

944
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,210
- 我以为他现在变好了 知道吗？ - 嘿嘿嘿
- I think he knows better by now, okay?  - Hey, hey, hey

945
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,330
你是我的搅屎棍 谁都别想在我的监视下搞你
You're my shitstick. And nobody's gonna mess with you on my watch

946
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,280
我没事
I'm fine

947
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,360
我们必须扔掉这车 然后分开
We gotta get rid of this van and split up

948
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,200
- 停在那里  - 干嘛
- Hey, pull over right here  - What for?

949
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,040

Just fucking pull over, okay?

950
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,640
明白 等我 别熄火
Okay, just wait right here. Keep it running

951
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,320
马上回来
Be right back

952
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,200

958
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,000

I'm just tired of that fucking coughing

959
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,560

- I hadn't gotten 'tussed up in a while  - Yeah

961
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,640
只不过是奥尔巴尼城一个没用的地址
Nothing but an old address somewhere outside Albany

962
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,960
- 没别的了？ - 那家伙是个鬼
- Nothing else? Shit  - The guy's a ghost

963
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,000
好的 呼叫十二区的探长欧尼尔
Okay, call Detective O'Neill at Precinct 12

984
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,040
我不是那种浪漫型的
U m, I ain't exactly what you call the romantic type, you know

985
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,770
我不会死缠烂打
I don't go in for all the sappy shit

986
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:40,520
但是 我想说 你的奶好大

No sweat

00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,720

- 最好是紧急电话  - 威利 你在哪
- This better be an emergency  - Willie, where are you?

992
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,840
我在芝加哥 但我找不到你
I'm in Chicago, but I can't find you anywhere

993
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,000
等一下 你妹的来芝加哥干嘛
Wait, hang on a second. What are you doing in fucking Chicago?

994
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,240
我想给你来个圣诞惊喜
I wanted to surprise you for Christmas

995
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,560
最好的圣诞礼物总是惊喜
The best Christmas gifts are always a surprise

996
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,770
你脑子秀逗了？是不是？
Are you off of your goddamn nut? Is that what you do?

997
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,170
你是不是一直跟踪别人？
You follow people all the way across the fucking country?

998
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,800
其他人都没有 就是你
Not everyone. Just you

999
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,600
- 你惊喜吗？ - 不 这种惊喜每天都有
- Are you surprised?  - No, this shit happens every day

1000
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,160
- 真的吗？ - 不 你是哪个星球来的还是…？
- It does?  - No. On what fucking planet...?

1001
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,240
算了 你到底来干嘛？
Never mind. What the fuck are you doing?

1002
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,800
威利 这里真的很冷 我没有带外套 就只有手套
Uh, Willie, it's really cold here. I didn't bring a coat. Only my gloves

1003
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,530
妈的 你别玩我
Goddamn it. You gotta be shitting me

1004
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,200
你有没有铅笔方便书写的？
Do you got a pencil or some shit to write on?

1005
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,280
哪个？
Who is it?

1006
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,480
- 你是哪个鬼？ - 威利奶奶
- Who the fuck are you?  - Grandma Willie!

1007
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,650
威利急匆匆的给我一头大象
And Willie was in such a hurry to get me my elephant

1008
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,050
我猜他他忘记付款
that I guess he forgot to pay for it

1009
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:13,400
这让警察叔叔很生气 他们跟踪他回家
And that made the policemen really mad. So they followed him back to the house

1010
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,000
威利跑得很快 就快要进门
And Willie ran really fast and he almost got to the door,

1011
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,120
他们对着他的后背开了八枪
but then they shot him like eight times in the back

1012
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,850
根据牛仔电影 他们说这样不公平
In the cowboy movies, they say that's not even fair

1013
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,970
这是威利给我的第一个圣诞礼物
And this is the first present Willie ever got me for Christmas

1014
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,080
上面有他的血迹
With his blood

1015
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,480
- 威利 你到家了  - 妈的 孩子 我的老腰哇
- Willie, you're home!  - Goddamn, kid. Watch the spine bone

1016
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,130
我刚跟你妈说你的英雄事迹
I was just telling your mom how you're a hero

1017
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,000
等一下
Yeah, yeah. Hang on a second

1018
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,280
你连外套都没有穿 却把大象带来了
You didn't bring a fucking coat, but you brought that elephant?

1019
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,560
- 你又没叫我穿外套  - 我还没叫你来呢
- You didn't tell me to bring a coat  - I didn't tell you to come

1020
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,530
- 这是你的种？ - 像不像我造的？
- Is this your spawn?  - Do I look like I made him?

1021
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,050
绝对是胎儿酒精综合征
Well, if this ain't fetal alcohol syndrome,

1022
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,600
还能是什么
then what the fuck is it?

1023
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,320
- 他坚持给我做三明治  - 他擅长此项
- He keeps trying to make me a sandwich  - That's what he does

1024
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,120
精灵
Elf!

1025
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,290
你搞到钥匙了吗？
Hey! You get that key?

1026
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,520
你更小了
You got smaller

1027
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,410
妈…我在梦游仙境还是咋的
What the... Am I tripping?

1028
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,760
还真说不定 因为舔穴…
You might be, because, you know, certain pussy

1029
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,960
过多也会造成迷幻药后遗症
has hallucinogenic aftereffects if you eat too much of it

1030
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,960
我是拿自己做实验才得出这个结论的
I found out the hard way once when I messed with my own kind

1031
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,050
有一次 我吃了很多火鸡培根 两个星期没有拉屎
One time, I ate too much turkey bacon, I didn't poop for two weeks

1032
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,960
是四个星期
For four weeks

1033
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,840
- 钥匙 矬子  - 好 操你先！
- The key, shorty  - Okay, first of all, fuck you!

1034
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,040
看见没有？我就说 他没搞定钥匙
See that? I told you. I knew he didn't have it in him

1035
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,880
其次 这小子在这里干什么？
And second of all, what in the fuck is he doing here?

1036
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,850
- 三明治不该这么做  - 威利
- That is not how you serve a sandwich  - Willie

1037
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,960
我正在想办法 明白了？
I'm working on it, okay?

1038
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,080
孩子 听着
Hey, kid, listen

1039
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,360
这里真的不是你该呆的地方 知道吗？
This is really not the right place for you to be, okay?

1040
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,000
是因为床不够吗？我只看到一个床 外加一个沙发
Because there's not enough beds? I only counted one, plus a couch

1041
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,600
- 没错  - 你们应该买双层床 威利
- Exactly  - You should get bunk beds, Willie

1042
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,970
也许吧
Yeah, maybe we'll do that

1043
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,520
借这段时间 我们出去走走吧
But, uh, in the meantime, let's you and me head out, all right?

1044
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,160
拜 精灵 拜 威利的老妈
Bye, Elf. Bye, Willie's mom

1045
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,800
我妈妈在耶稣天堂里 和玛丽和约瑟夫谈论胡桃木呢
My mom's in Jesus' house with Mary and Joseph and the talking walnut

1046
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,400
- 你百分之百肯定他不是你的种？ - 对
- You 100 percent sure he's not yours?  - Yeah

1047
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,450
赶紧摆脱他 有点节操 老天
Well, then, cut him loose. Set some boundaries, for chrissake

1048
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,080
你不能让流浪者像迷失的小狗一样 整天围着你转
You can't have every stray following you around like a lost puppy

1049
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,890
- 老天  - 我说了我搞定 明白了？
- Jesus!  - I said I'm going, okay?

1050
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:30,520
我们可以去吃芝加哥比萨吗？号称意大利披萨 但却在芝加哥
Can we get a Chicago pizza? It's like pizza, but in Chicago

1051
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,330
我们去吃披萨 没问题
Yeah, we'll get a pizza. No sweat

1052
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,280
真的好好玩 威利 我都不知道你还有妈妈
This is really fun, Willie. I didn't even know you had a mom

1053
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:46,490
- 你想什么呢 难道我是石头里蹦出来的？ - 你是哪里出生的？
- What'd you think? I was just hatched?  - Well, where were you born?

1054
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:51,720
我生于普拉斯基县少年犯管教所 阿肯色州的小石城
I was born in the Pulaski County Juvenile Detention Center in Little Rock, Arkansas

1055
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,960
- 听起来很好  - 不好
- Oh, that sounds really nice  - Well, it wasn't nice

1056
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,800
她是个卑鄙的婊子 所以你最好别有任何想法 好吗
And she's a mean fucking bitch, so don't go getting any ideas, all right?

1057
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,280
虽然你有时不太好 但你仍就是圣诞公公
Well, sometimes you're not nice. But you're still Santa

1058
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:08,080
听着孩子 说真的 你现在该长大了 明白了？
Listen kid, seriously. You're all grown-up and shit now, okay?

1059
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,800
- 别再幼稚了  - 你不是真的圣诞公公
- You gotta stop that  - Well, I know you're not the Santa

1060
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,560
你仍就是我的圣诞公公
But you're still my Santa

1061
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,360
来吧 我们走
Come on. Let's go

1062
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,000
[搅屎棍 你还好吗？你死哪里去了]

1063
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,700
另外：谢谢咳嗽药 很管用

1064
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,200
操
Fuck

1065
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,000
操 操啊
Fuck! Fucking pussy!

1066
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,600
看这些圣诞老公公们 我真的可以待在这里吗？
Look at all the Santas! I really get to stay here?

1067
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,360
妈的对
Goddamn right

1068
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,090
这孩子要待多久？
So how long is the kid staying here?

1069
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,160
如果我知道 我就不是他的跟班
Hell if I know, I ain't his fucking secretary

1070
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,880
- 这里也该换你负责了  - 库克 你让我笑了
- You run the joint  - Cook, you crack me up

1071
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,160
我啥？
I what?

1072
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,200
寄宿间楼下往左 任何空床都可以睡
Boarding room's downstairs on the left. Any bed that's not taken

1073
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,240
好了 到了
Alrighty, here we go

1074
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,360
听好了 不要坐在任何马桶上
Now listen, don't be sitting on any toilet seats

1075
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,520
如果你要拉屎 站在马桶圈上 屁股离开点
If you gotta take a shit just stand over it, couple of feet away,

1076
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,120
瞄准然后投弹
take aim and blow it in there

1077
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,680
我非常确定螃蟹也会跳 好吗
'Cause I'm pretty sure crabs can jump. All right?

1078
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,200
洗澡的时候别搭理何人
Don't let anybody muscle up on you in the showers either,

1079
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,560
因为他们会使坏
because they'll try

1080
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,840
如果开始打架 直接掐蛋或插眼
And if a fight breaks out, go straight for the nuts or gouge an eye out

1081
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,240
我不太喜欢这里 威利
I don't think I like it here, Willie

1082
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,800
那你应该回家 就像我开始说的
Then you should go home, like I told you to start with

1083
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,360
家里没人还能叫家吗？
But it's not home if there's nobody there

1084
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,640
外婆不算人吗？我肯定她想你了
What about Granny? I'm sure she misses you

1085
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,960
- 她死了  - 什么时候
- She died  - When?

1086
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,040
两年前
Two years ago

1087
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,160
总统纪念日那天 蓝山的丰田赛扬汽车店里
Same day as the President's Day sale at Blue Mesa Toyota and Scion

1088
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,560
当时轮子里发出“冷冷冷”的刹车声
where they put the "whee" in wheels

1089
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,360
外婆好人有好报
Well, Granny had a good run

1090
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,330
她至少活了一百五十岁
She was about 150 fucking years old, anyway

1091
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,960
这里还不算坏 至少有双层床
Look at this, this is not so bad. Look, you got bunk beds

1092
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,800
看啊
Look at that

1093
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,440
啊！妈的 孩子！干！
Ow! Goddamn, kid! Fuck!

1094
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,530
- 我们还一起过圣诞吗？ - 干 我哪里知道
- Will we have Christmas together?  - Fuck, I don't know

1095
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,160
- 但 威利…  - 别“但是威利了” 妈的！
- But, Willie...  - No "but, Willie." Goddamn it!

1096
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,640
自从我认识你以来 一直替你擦屁股
I've been chasing your ass off ever since I fucking met you

1097
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,520
你听不懂吗？我告诉过你 我不是那个人
Do you not take a hint? I fucking told you that I ain't that guy

1098
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,530
生活就是一根大号 巨型鸡巴 孩子
Life sucks a big, giant dick, kid

1099
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,120
你现在长大了 必须面对现实
But you're a fucking man now and you gotta face up to it

1100
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,200
面对一切吧
Welcome to the shit show

1101
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,610
- 但你是我的家人  - 不 我不是你的家人
- But you're my family  - No, I'm not your family

1102
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:53,240
- 好的 我会尝试着长大 为了你  - 不 不为我 为你
- Okay. I'll try to be a man. For you  - No, not for me. For you

1103
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,930
- 即便我一个人过  - 你不会一个人的
- Even though I'm all alone  - You're not all alone

1104
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,800
别搞我了？看看你的周围
Are you shitting me? I mean, look around here

1105
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,480
有这么多好人
You got all these great guys

1106
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:08,880
除了那个打手枪的 还有那个看打手枪的
Except that one jerking off over there. And that one watching him jerk off

1107
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,360
好好待在这里 好吗？
You know what, just kind of stay in this section right here, okay?

1108
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,480
你不会有事的
You'll be fine

1109
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,080
嘿
Hey

1110
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,450
- 你到底去哪里了？ - 你算我老母吗
- Where the hell have you been?  - What are you, my fucking mother?

1111
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,480
我要处理孩子的事情好吗？
I've been dealing with the kid, all right?

1112
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,320
别忘了重点 我们需要那把钥匙
Oh, well, don't lose your focus. We still need that key

1113
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,600
我试过色诱那个女孩 但她是直的
I tried seducing the girl myself but she's strictly dickly

1114
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,440
音乐会是明晚 你最好抓紧点 小朋友
Concert's tomorrow night. So you better step up, buddy boy

1115
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,170
不是侏儒做这件事吗？
I thought the midget was doing it

1116
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,760
马库斯那货手无缚鸡鸡之力
Marcus couldn't fuck his way out of a wet paper bag

1117
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,480
我去暗示她 你对她来电
I'll make sure she knows you got the hots for her

1118
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,760
- 真的？ - 他告诉我的
- Really?  - That's what he told me

1119
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,720
他来了
Oh, here he comes

1120
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,760
当然 你得采取主动
Of course you may have to make the first move,

1121
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,720
- 因为他有点害羞  - 了解
- because he seems like the shy type  - Okay

1122
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,640
我们明天的计划没问题吧
Hey. We still good for tomorrow? The plan

1123
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,690
- 事成之后把她甩掉 是不是？ - 对 按照计划
- Cutting her out after the grab. Right?  - Yeah, yeah. We're good

1124
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,520

01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,000
我是女高音 我朋友罗妮说我的声线像玛丽亚凯莉
I'm a soprano. My friend Ronnie says I sound like Mariah Carey

1152
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,360
- 你好 你叫什么名字？ - 我叫瑟曼 瑟曼默尔曼
- Hello. What's your name?  - I'm Thurman. Thurman Merman

1153
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,090
真的吗？
For real? Ha!

1154
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,400
你想加入我们吗 瑟曼？
Would you like to join us, Thurman?

1155
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,410
这套看起来合身
This looks like it might fit

1156
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,560
- 我必须穿这套吗？ - 当然得穿
- I get to wear this?  - Of course you do

1157
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,770
你现在是圣诞公公了 瑟曼 赶快穿上
You're a Santa now, Thurman. Go ahead, put it on

1158
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,080
这里面有很多的纸张垃圾
It's got a lot of paper trash in it,

1159
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:13,080
你俩出来的时候自备光源以便着陆 明白？
so I think it should be a light landing for both of you. Okay?

1160
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,490
然后…
So...

1161
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,640
你特么去哪里了？我们必须为明晚做足准备
Where the fuck have you been? We gotta lock everything down for tomorrow

1162
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,040
真是我的孩子
That's my boy!

1163
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,760
- 你怎么搞到的？ - 他上了女保安
- Shit. How'd you get that?  - He tapped that security girl

1164
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:30,520
哈哈 真好笑 等等…真的？
Ha-ha. Very funny. Wait... for real?

1165
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,200
我还没怎么跟她前戏 她已经比密歇根湖还要湿
I didn't exactly have to talk her into it. She was wetter than Lake Michigan

1166
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,480
实际上 我感觉是她奸了我
Matter of fact, I think she roofied me

1167
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,320
“约会强奸”药 极好的破处装备
Ah, rohypnol. Excellent icebreaker

1168
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:42,080
当然 这药不太适合这个女孩 她喜欢后入
Of course, it's harder for the girl because she's gotta get off

1169
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,080
- 好药物只屁股反面有效  - 对
- before the drugs soften the noodle  - Yeah

1170
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,880
你个杀千刀的
Ya! You no good motherfucker!

1171
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,170
- 搞什么搞？ - 你…
- What the fuck?  - You...

1172
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,730
- 天  - 放开他
- God!  - Get off of him!

1173
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,490
放开他 你个小崽子
Hey! Get off of him you little shit!

1174
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,090
- 我杀了你  - 放开我
- I'll kill your ass!  - Let go of me!

1175
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,840
- 去你妹的  - 放开他
- Motherfucker!  - Get off of him!

1176
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,440
呀 抱歉
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry

1177
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,640
嘿 妈的 去死吧！
Hey, goddamn pussy! You motherfucker!

1178
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,160
赶快放开他
Just get off of him. Hey!

1179
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:04,210
妈的！
Goddamn it!

1180
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,720
啊噢
Ow!

1181
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,840
妈的！
Goddamn!

1182
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,200
我十年来的第一炮
My first shot at a good piece of ass after nearly ten years

1183
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,090
被你抢了
and you gotta go and take a dump on that too

1184
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,880
- 操你！ - 只是公务
- Fuck you!  - It was just business

1185
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,490
你毁了一个冰清玉洁的姑娘
You just ruined a perfectly good piece of pussy

1186
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,520
用你那身患重疾的老二
with that diseased-ass dick of yours

1187
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,680
我很高兴孵你的蛋 你个王八蛋
I'm glad I tea-bagged your drunk ass, you fucking piece-of-shit motherfucker!

1188
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,120
还是一起干好吗？明天准时
Would you get it together? Tomorrow is go time

1189
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,280
我需要新鲜空气
I need some air

1190
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:44,400
看见没有？他以为他是谁 跟你这样说话？
Now, see? Who the fuck does he think he is talking to you that way?

1191
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,000
- 我们扔他出局  - 什么？不行
- That's it. We're cutting him out  - What? Fuck no

1192
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,160
他只不过想出口气 他会没事的
I mean, he's just steamed a little bit. He'll be fine

1193
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,560
你想他分一半的钱？
Okay, you wanna share half of your take with him?

1194
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,320
- 随你  - 我真搞不懂你
- Be my guest  - You know, I don't fucking get you

1195
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,840
是你让那个小个子参加进来的
I mean, you're the one that brought that little shit in

1196
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,600
不 搅屎棍 我只带你 你才是保险箱专家
No, shitstick. I brought you in. You're the safe cracker

1197
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,650
他连自己的屁股都破不了
He can't even crack his own ass. Fuck that

1198
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,450
我们之后去墨西哥
We're going to Mexico

1199
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,960
已经上膛 可以用
It's loaded now. You're good to go

1200
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,840
你搞这一出戏
You did this whole fucking thing

1201
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,120
就是为了让我和你一起去墨西哥
just to have me to go to shit-ass Mexico with you?

1202
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:26,760
我就觉得这样和家人一起过圣诞节比较有意思
I just thought it might be fun to spend Christmas with the only family I got left

1203
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,680
- 这算是惊喜吗？ - 呃…
- Why's that such a surprise?  - Well...

1204
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,640
杀人魔王查尔斯曼森之所以被假释是因为
You know, they'd grant Charles Manson fucking parole if it wasn't for one thing

1205
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,720
- 他是查尔斯曼森  - 懂你意思
- He's Charles Manson  - I get it

1206
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:47,330
也许我不怪你 船到桥头自然直
Maybe I don't blame you. But things change at the end of the road

1207
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,920
威利？
Willie?

1208
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,570
- 威利 你在里面吗？ - 除掉他
- Willie, you in there?  - Get rid of him

1209
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,880
- 紧急情况？ - 不
- Is this an emergency?  - No

1210
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,570
我想邀请你参加明天的圣诞音乐会 威利
I just wanted to invite you to the Christmas concert tomorrow, Willie

1211
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,680
我加入了唱诗班
I'm singing in the choir

1212
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,240
一整天都在练习圣诞颂歌《平安夜》《装饰厅堂》
We're doing all the Christmas carols, "Silent Night," "Deck the Halls,"

1213
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,520
《铃儿响叮当》《来吧来吧 厄玛奴尔》这首是拉丁语的
"Jingle Bells," "Veni, Veni, Emmanuel ." That one's in Latin

1214
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,080
我知道你很忙 但只要一个小时 所有的家长都会来
I know you're busy, but it's only for an hour and all the parents are coming

1215
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,240
虽然你不是我真正的家人
And I know you're not my real family,

1216
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:18,680
反正你也没有真正的家 不如自己造一个
but when you don't have real family, then you have to make a new one

1217
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,570
这样其实更好 你可以自由选择
And it's actually better because then you get to pick the people

1218
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,040
谁作为你的家人
who are in your family

1219
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,480
你就是我选择的家人
And you're the family I picked

1220
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,200
所以我一直跟你到芝加哥
And that's why I followed you to Chicago

1221
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,320
因为我不希望你一个人过圣诞节
Because I didn't want you to spend Christmas alone

1222
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,160
你来吗？然后我们可以去圣诞老人专场舞会…
So can you come? And then maybe after we can go to SantaCon or...

1223
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,080
我 我不行 我来不了
I, I can't. I can't come

1224
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:47,520
- 我尽量来 好吗？ - 好的 我等你 威利
- Look, I'll try to make it. Okay?  - Okay. I'll look for you, Willie

1225
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,370
我等你 到时候招手见 好吗？
I'll look for you and I'll wave like this. Okay?

1226
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,280
好 说定了
Yeah. Okay, All right. Good deal

1227
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,250
- 好的 回头见  - 拜 威利
- All right. I'll see you  - Bye, Willie

1228
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,010
你装什么逼 FBI吗？那地方拥挤得很
What are you, the fucking FBI? That place is gonna be crowded

1229
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,520
他完全不知道我是否去过
He won't even know I'm not there

1230
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,170
- 很好  - 晚安 精灵
- Good  - Good night, Elf!

1231
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,200
我还以为你刚才心软了
For a minute there, I thought you were going soft

1232
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:13,720
我痛恨你们两个 但生意就是生意
I hate your guts, motherfucker. But business is business

1233
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,080
我们干活吧
Let's do this

1234
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,570
- 嗨 谢谢光临  - 好嘛
- Hi, thank you so much for coming  - Okay?

1235
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,730
- 你真是容光焕发  - 好迷人 嗨 很高兴见到你
- You look gorgeous  - Amazing. H I, good to see you

1236
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,080
- 几点了？ - 音乐会五分钟后开始
- Time?  - Concert starts in five

1237
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,040
圣诞节是感恩的节日
As you know, Christmas is a time for giving

1238
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,600
感谢诸位今晚大驾光临
And we want to thank you all for being here tonight

1239
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,840
现在核对程序 七点四十五断电
All right, let's sync them up, boys. At 7:45, the power goes down

1240
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,000
这事我负责
That's on me

1241
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,080
你有十分钟去雷金特办公室 破掉保险箱
You got ten minutes to get to Regent's office, crack that safe,

1242
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,440
拿走钞票 塞到垃圾槽里
grab the money, throw it down the garbage chute

1243
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,640
在没被人发觉之前开溜
and then get the hell out of there before anybody knows what's hit them

1244
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:09,960
现在有请感恩之城儿童唱诗班
Now please join me in welcoming the Giving City Children's Choir

1245
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:17,360
现在立刻有请唱诗班指挥蕾妮
And without further ado, I would like to introduce our choirmaster, Renee

1246
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,800
你匹配到了？赶紧发过来
You got a match? Well, send it over!

1247
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,960

糟了
Oh, shit!

1290
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
系统重启

1291
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,320
- 三分钟 威利 快  - 闭嘴 我听不清了
- Three minutes, Willie, come on!  - Shut the fuck up! I can't hear

1292
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,970
快点办事儿
Just hurry your ass!

1293
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,880
到底怎么回事？
What the hell is this?

1294
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,450
调我办公室摄像头 看一下保险箱
Wait, bring up my office, I wanna see the safe

1295
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,680
现在不行 还有八分钟才能启动完毕
I can't, sir. It still has eight minutes to reboot

1296
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,120
什么？报警
What? Call the police!

1297
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,730
- 我们走  - 我现在报警
- Let's go, come on!  - I'm on it

1298
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,040
没有五十万吧 顶多六十万
Well, that can't be more than half a million, 600 tops

1299
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,810
我们就这么点
Well, fuck, that's all we got

1300
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,530
显然够我的那份了
Perfect amount for my cut

1301
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:02,880
开什么玩笑？来真的？老女人还真说得对

老母
Motherfuckers!

1305
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:36,120
- 关闭所有出入口  - 十级紧闭
- Lock it down. The whole building!  - We're on a level-ten lockdown

1306
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,480
十级紧闭
Lockdown level ten

1307
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,360
- 进去  - 你进去
- Get in!  - You get in!

1308
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,440
疏散音乐会 检查所有人
Evacuate the concert! And search everyone

老天爷 你们成功了
Sweet Jesus, you made it!

1313
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,240
你还穿着圣诞服干什么？
What's the fucking Santy Claus outfit all about?

1314
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,000
现在给我靠后站
Now step the fuck back!

1315
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,200
- 你想干什么 小种鸡？ - 这叫自然减员
- What are you doing, runt?  - It's called thinning the herd

1316
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,640
这个世界没有索科一家会更好
World's gonna be a better place without the fucking Sokes in it

1317
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,080
这回我会过上帝王般的生活
I'm gonna live like a king this time

1318
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:22,480
- 苏丹王这种  - 你这辈子别想 吉祥物
- A fucking sultan!  - Not in this lifetime, Sparky

1319
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,280
- 袋子归我  - 你是说我们吧
- The bag goes with me  - You mean with us

1320
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:30,040
- 我是说我  - 你刚才说什么？
- No, I mean me  - What the fuck did you just say?

1321
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:34,250
我之前说过这是我最后一单 是和你的最后一单
When I said this was my last job, I meant it was my last job with you

1322
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,640
我就知道我不该来 还看见了你这张令人讨厌的脸
I knew I should've left, second I saw your miserable fucking face

1323
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,010
我怎么就改不了记性呢？
Why did I forget?

1324
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,520
保险箱破得漂亮 真为你骄傲
N ice job on the safe, though. Yeah, I'm real proud of you

1325
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,960
知道吗 妈妈
Well, you know something, Mama?

1326
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,040
也许你没自己想的那么聪明
Maybe you're not as smart as you think you are

1327
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,600
你忘记了吗？
Did you forget about this?

1328
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,520
我怎么可能忘记？
Oh, how could I have forgotten?

1329
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,880
开枪打我啊 搅屎棍

是空包弹 威利
They're blanks, Willie

1331
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:23,840
你不会傻到以为我把真弹放进去吧
You really think I'd be dumb enough to put real bullets in that gun?

1332
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,480
我才不怕你 看我轰你个大洞
Well, I ain't afraid of you, bitch! I'll blow a hole through your ass so...

1333
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,970

放下武器 举起双手…
Drop your weapons! Put your hands in the...

1335
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,360

Hey, hang on a second. She's got the money, I'm just a fucking guy!

01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,520
他们比你更需要
I'd rather them have it than your sorry ass

1345
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,320
- 不要考验我  - 你真打算开枪打我？
- Don't test me, boy  - You're gonna shoot me too?

1346
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:19,080
- 你居然开枪打我  - 我说过我会开枪 你就是不听
- You fucking shot me!  - I told you I would. You never listen

1347
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,520
放开袋子 威利 放开袋子
Let go of the bag, William. Let go of the bag

下钱雨了
It's raining money!

1351
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,920
她有枪
She's got a gun!

1352
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,330
威利！
Willie!

1353
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,890
放下武器 趴下
Drop the weapon! Get down!

1354
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,920
怎么回事？嘿 妈的！
The fuck is going on? Hey, goddamn it!

1355
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,440
我破了侏儒谋杀案 还有武装抢劫
I caught a fucking midget-murdering fucking armed robber

1356
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,040
我是特么的英雄
I'm a goddamn hero

1357
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:27,090
别担心 威利 我没事 只是打到了屁股
Don't worry, Willie. I'm okay. It's just in my butt

1358
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:30,680
威利？
Willie?

1359
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,600
不
No!

1360
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,120
喔
Oh, f...

1361
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:43,400
准备完毕
Stand clear

1362
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:50,240
卧槽
Oh! Fuck me!

1363
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,240
- 圣诞快乐  - 嘢
- Merry Christmas  - Yeah

1364
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,320
我猜这就是所谓的大圆满结局
Well, I guess this is what they call a happy ending

1365
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,320
然而随着圣诞节过去
But as far as Christmas miracles go, shit, I don't know

1366
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,210
混蛋雷金特被抓个正着
That asshole Regent ended up getting busted

1367
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,480
而我则不体面地得以全身而退 分文未得
while I got off clean by ratting out my steaming pile of shit mother

1368
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,160
我从那个贱人身上学到一件事
Guess I did learn one thing about family from that crazy bitch

1369
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:23,520
所谓 人生处处有危鸡 除却巫山见云雨
And that is, if yours happens to be a bag of dicks, then fuck them
