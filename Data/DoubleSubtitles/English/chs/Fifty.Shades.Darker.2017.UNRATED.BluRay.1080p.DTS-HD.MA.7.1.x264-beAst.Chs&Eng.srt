感觉这里到处都是我的照片
This is, like, so much of my face in here.

68
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,850
如果我不先斩后奏的话 你可能会说 我会不好意思的
Well, if I had asked, you would have been like, "I'm too shy."

69
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,010
是啊
Yeah.

70
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,850

她们超大
They are super large.

75
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,570

所有照片都已售出 买家是同一个人

77
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,120

You're kidding! No.

78
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,960

安娜斯塔西娅
Anastasia.

84
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,470
是你 对吧 是你买了全部照片
It was you, wasn't it? You just went and bought all of these?

85
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,470
我不喜欢陌生人盯着你看
I don't like strangers gawking at you.

86
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,520
你为什么来这里
Why are you here?

87
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,140
为了你
For you.

88
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,440
嗨
Hey.

89
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,820
我们换个地方谈谈好吗？
Can we talk somewhere private?

90
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,990
不行
No.

91
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,490
我不是很擅长这个 我从未
Look, I'm not very good at this. I've never had to...

92
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,160
我从未想过要再次尝试
I've never wanted to try again.

93
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,750
克里斯汀 我
Christian, I don't...

94
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,660
这不是个好主意 我们就聊聊
It's not a good idea. Let's talk.

95
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,830
好么 就是只是单纯的聊聊 拜托
Okay? Just talk, please.

96

97
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,220

98

因为我饿了
Because I'm hungry.

99
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,350
但我们只是聊聊 就这样
But we are only talking and that is it.

100
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,230
等等
Hold on.

101
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,790
嘿 我要先走了
Hey. I'm gonna take off.

102
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,660

谢谢 谢谢 我为你骄傲
Thank you. Thank you. I'm proud of you.

104
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,280
克里斯汀 不能 不能这样
Christian, I can't. I can't do this.

105
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,660
安娜
Christ, Ana.

106
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,790
好吧
Okay.

107
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,500
我有个建议
I have a proposition.

108
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,050
只是来吃饭 我们只是聊聊
Just come to dinner. We can talk.

109
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,380
需要再看看菜单么
Would you like some more time?

110
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,270
不了 两份五分熟牛排 加薯条和青菜
No. Two steaks, medium. Fries. Green vegetables.

111
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,060
我要藜麦沙拉
Um, actually, I'm gonna have the quinoa salad.

112
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,650
好吧
Fine.

113
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,980
两杯西拉葡萄酒
And two glasses of the barossa valley shiraz.

114
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,070
我们只按瓶卖 先生
We only sell that by the bottle, sir.

115
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,150
那就来一瓶
A bottle then.

116
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,650
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

117
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,990
谢谢
Thanks.

118
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
所以
So?

119
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,120
我们来聊聊吧
Let's talk.

120
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,080
我想要你回来
I want you back.

121
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,010
我想重新协商一些条款
I'd like to renegotiate terms.

122
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,430
但我看不到任何可能
But I don't see how.

123
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,850
你想要的那些东西 你说过你就是那样的人
The things you want, you said that's the way you are.

124
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,100
但上回的事不会在发生了
But what happened last time, that's not gonna happen again.

125
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,350
你怎么证明
How can you say that?

126
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,690
我知道我要求过你向我证明 我到底能奉陪到什么程度 但
I know that I asked you to show me how far it can go,

127
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,820
你很享受你所造就的痛苦
but you were getting off on the pain you inflicted.

128
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,870
你就是那种性格
That's still in you.

129
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,540
我正在努力改变
I'm working on it.

130
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,460
改变什么？
Working on what?

131
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,220
要是你一直不讲出来 我根本做不到
I can't do this if you won't talk to me.

132
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,550
你想知道什么
What do you wanna know?

133
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,350
一切
Everything.

134
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,560
好吧
Fine.

135
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,910
我们自己来
Yeah. We'll manage.

136
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,090
我的生母在我四岁时过世了
My birth mother died when I was four.

137
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,550
她是个瘾君子
She was an addict. Crack.

138
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,170
你能想象到那时什么情形
You can fill in the blanks.

139
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,880
你过去为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me that?

140
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,930
我说了
I did.

141
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,600
当时你睡着了
But you were asleep at the time.

142
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,600
好吧
Okay. Well, um...

143
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,560
通常来讲
Generally,

144
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,860
良好的沟通是一个关键点
a key part of good communication

145
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,440
在于沟通双方都神志清醒
is that both parties be conscious.

146
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,950
对于你的母亲我深感抱歉
I'm really sorry about your mother.

147
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,450
那都过去了
It's in the past.

148

现在 我带你来这里商量

00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,990
一段香草之恋

158

我的意思是 我们只做你可以接受的事

有点扎扎的
This is spiky.

165
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,250

我明天打电话给你
I'll call you tomorrow.

167
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,550

174
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,780
嘿 杰克
Hey, Jack.

175
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,380
人事主管到处转悠是想搞什么 我们有麻烦了么
What's the head of hr doing lurking around? Are we in trouble?

176
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,070
不是我只是来给予一些 鼓励
Not at all. I'm just here to encourage.

177
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,580
真的我觉得去洛里喝上一轮能起到效果
Really? Well, I think a round of drinks at Lori's would do the trick.

178
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,750
抱歉 要开会 另找时间吧

180
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,460
那是街旁的一家酒吧
Oh, it's a bar around the corner.

181
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,960
周五去酒吧是惯例
On. Fridays are a bit of a ritual.

182
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,300
你应该和我们一起来
You should come.

183
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,800
就是啊 多去认认人
Absolutely. Go network.

184
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,760
不行我是挺想去的 但是我今晚有别的约会
Oh, no, I would. I have plans tonight.

没关系
It's okay.

192
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,290
我只是个路人甲
I'm nobody.

193
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,300
嘿 洛里酒吧在这边

你知道 现在时间还很早
You know, it's still early.

199
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,100
你对博伊斯·福克斯的评价 很有意思
Your comments on boyce fox were interesting.

200
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,020
通常来讲 我对政治恐怖小说 不是很感兴趣
I'm not usually into political thrillers.

201
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,440
嗯 我觉得
Yeah, well, I think the parallels

202
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,650
但丁名作低于中的排比句很精彩 但我
with Dante's inferno are amazing, but...

203
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,910

No. You convinced me.

204
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,990
我正在读
I'm reading.

205
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,700

216
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,400
我真不敢相信你刚刚竟那样跟他讲话
I can't believe you just talked to him like that.

217
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,400
他想要我的东西
He wants what's mine.

218
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,190
什么是你的东西
What's yours?

219
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,240
你刚才那样有点专横
That's a little presumptuous.

220
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,860
他是我的上司 克里斯汀 你的冷静点
He's my boss, Christian. You gotta calm down.

221
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,240
冷静真不是我的长处
Calm isn't really my forte.

222
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,710
我知道有些东西能帮到你
I know something that could help.

223
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,550
这和我想得不一样
You know, this is not what I had in mind.

224
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,220
你上次购物什么时候
When's the last time you went shopping?

225
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,090
一周前在休斯敦
Houston. A week ago.

其实你动动嘴就好了
You only have to ask.

237
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,030
我想我们应该慢慢来
I think we should take it slow.

238
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,450

It's good.

243
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,710
杰克看起来对我的意见很感兴趣

245
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,420
士气
Morale?

246
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,110
你是问我们会不会早晨
You mean, like, do we all sit in a circle

247
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,180
围成一圈坐下来唱公司司歌？

公司管理如何？员工满意么

No! You can't do that. That's my job.

253
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,280
你不能连我的事业都要介入
You can't start interfering in my career.

254
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,320
跟这个没关系
It's not about that.

255
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,070
我想要进军出版业 sip是个合适的选择
I've wanted to move into publishing. They're the best fit.

256
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,330
你会成为我的上司
But you're gonna be my boss.

257
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,120
严格的说我会是你上司的上司的上司
Technically, I'll be your boss's boss's boss.

258
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,120
然而我会和我上司的上司的上司上床
And I'm gonna be sleeping with my boss's boss's boss.

Right now, you're arguing with him.

260
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,540

混蛋 你说真的
An ass. Really?

262

混蛋
Ass.

263
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,060
呕
Ooh...

264
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,270
你知道这样做越界了
You know that's off limits.

265
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,230
我需要知道哪些地方可以碰触
I'm gonna need a road map.

266
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,670
我以为你想到慢慢来
I thought you wanted to take it slow.

267
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,890
你先要什么安娜斯塔西娅
What do you want, Anastasia?

268
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,890
如果我们要沟通 你必须把你的想法告诉我
If we're to communicate, you have to tell me.

269
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,230
我想要你
I want you.

270
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,420
穿的有点多
I'm too dressed.

271
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,100
继续
Keep going.

272
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,620
吻我
Kiss me.

273
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,330
您想要什么 安娜塔西雅
What do you want, Anastasia?

274
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
我想要你
I want all of you.

275
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,290
为何一直没有找别人
Why do you think you waited?

276
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,460
在性方面
For sex.

277
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,050
嗯
Mmm.

278
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,720
嗯
Mmm.

279
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,390
我一直在读简奥斯丁和勃朗特姐妹的著作
I was reading Austen and bronté

280
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,310
没人能达到小说中的人物标准
and nobody ever measured up to that.

281
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,730
我想我在等待某种例外
I guess I was waiting for something exceptional.

282
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,730
然后我遇到了你
And then I met you.

283
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,240
奥斯丁女士
Would miss Austen

284
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,040
会同意这种事么
approve of this?

285
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,330
我本来是很浪漫的
I was being romantic,

286
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,420
然后渐渐的被你奇怪的方式所分散
and then you just go and distract me with your kinky fuckery.

287
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,090
奇怪的方式？
"Kinky fuckery"? Mmm-hmm.

288
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,590
我不知道那是什么意思但听起来很像样子
I don't know what that is, but I like the sound of it.

289
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,300
你看起来和很平静 我不想叫醒你
You looked so peaceful. I didn't wanna wake you.

290
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,300
做早餐的食物不够了
There's not much for breakfast,

291
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,470
除非你想吃剩饭
unless you want cold stir-fry.

292
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,470

我希望你能和我一起
Want you to come with me.

310
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,180
我从没参加过舞会
I've never been to a ball.

311
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,940
我没有舞会穿的礼服
I don't have a dress for that.

312
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,400
还有 我的发型该怎么办
Also, what am I gonna do with my hair?

313

我知道一个沙龙
I know a salon.

314
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,480
而且你不用担心礼服的事
And you don't need to worry about a dress.

315

一切我都会处理好
It's all gonna be taken care of.

316
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,530
怎么了
What is it? Um...

317
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,160

她昨天在我的办公室外面
And she was outside my office yesterday.

319

她知道我的名字
And she knew my name.

320
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,500
手腕上缠着绷带 她很古怪
And she had a bandage on her wrist. It was really strange.

321
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,920
我们该走了
We should go.

322
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,550
现在
Just now.

323
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,140
是的
Yeah.

324
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,100
随时告诉我
Keep me informed.

325
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,850
你知道那个女孩 克里斯汀
You know that girl, Christian?

326
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,060
我来处理 什么意思
I'm handling it. What does that mean?

327
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,230
我不想让你担心 相信我
I don't want you to worry about it. Trust me.

328
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,910
嗯
Um...

329
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,460
嘿 过的怎么样？
Hey, how are you doing?

330
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,800
很好 好的 我女朋友在这里
Good, okay. So, uh, my girlfriend's here...

331
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,930
噢
Oh.

332
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,010

334
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,760
她名叫艾琳娜·林肯
Her name's Elena Lincoln.

335
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,660
我不在乎她叫什么 克里斯汀
I don't care what her name is, Christian.

336
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,350
你为什么要带我去那里
Why would you take me there?

337
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,980
你为什么要带我去见那个诱惑并虐待过你的女人
Why would you take me to meet the woman who seduced and abused you?

338
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,280
我们的关系几年前就结束了 我们现在只是朋友
Our relationship ended years ago. We're just friends.

339
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,570
兼合作伙伴
And business partners.

340
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,900
合作伙伴 你在逗我么
Business partners? Are you kidding me?

341
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,410
你会带你的女奴们去那里
Would you take your subs there?

342
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,620
老天 为了什么 她的认可
Oh, my god! For what? Her approval?

343
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,790
什么 这是在干嘛
What? What is this?

344
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,960
不 这是…不是这样的
No. It's not like that.

345
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,790
我今早看到的那个女孩也是他们之一对么？
That girl that I saw this morning was one of them, wasn't she?

346
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,130
我们去我家讨论这个吧 我可以叫人来给你做发型
Let's discuss this back at my place.

347

我可以叫人来给你做发型
I can have someone come by, do your hair.

348
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,360

349
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,930
给我解释这到底是怎么回事
Explain to me what's going on.

350

到我家我就给你解释听 来
I'll explain when we're there. Come on.

351
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,890
好吧 要不你自己走 要不我带你走
Okay, you can either walk or i can carry you. Your choice.

352
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,270
你不会那么做的 不 你自己选
You wouldn't do that. No, it's your choice.

353
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,560
好吧 好 好 我自己走
Okay, fine. Fine. I'll walk.

354
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,240
她叫利拉·威廉姆斯
Her name's Leila Williams.

355
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,950
大概两年前我们交往过一段时间
She was my sub for a while about two years ago.

356
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,580
她发生了什么
What happened to her?

357
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,790
她想要更多 而我不想了
She wanted more. I didn't.

358
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,830
所以我和她就分手了
So I ended it.

359
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,670
她离开了 和别人结了婚
She left. Got married.

360
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,840
我以为她会过得很好 但之后她丈夫出车祸死了
I thought she moved on, but then her husband died in a car crash.

361
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,670
她精神崩溃了
She had a breakdown.

362
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,590
她现在想干什么
What does she want now?

363
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,680
当我们一在乔治亚州的时候
When you and I were in Georgia together, she turned up here

364
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,810
她出现在我的管家琼斯夫人面前想要割腕自杀
and tried to slit her wrists in front of Mrs. Jones, my housekeeper.

365
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,770
天啊
Oh, my god.

366
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,070
盖尔送她去医院但当我感到哪里时
Gail took her to the hospital, but by the time I got there,

367
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,440
她已经走了
she'd taken off.

368
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,280
我的人一直试图找到她
My people have been trying to find her.

369
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,150
你的人
Your people?

370
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,280
就是把资料收集在一起的人
Is that who put this together?

371
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,960
也有这样的人在盯着我么
Is there one on me?

372
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,550
让我看看
Let me see it.

373
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,830
咪表在里士满大道的克莱德五金店打工
"Subject works part time at Clayton's hardware, Richmond road."

374
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,000
他们没有算我上厕所的时间
You know, they didn't time my bathroom breaks.

375
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,540
你应该要求退款
You should probably get your money back.

376
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,340
我会让他们接近任何潜在的受虐者
I had them drawn up on any prospective submissive.

377
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,260
很好 老天啊
Nice. Jesus.

378
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,510
我不知道这事会变成什么样
I had no idea what this was gonna become.

379
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,960
我不知道你会变得如此特殊
I didn't know you'd be different.

380
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,350
特殊？真的
Different? Really?

381
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,770
这就是你像带所有你其他的女人那样
Is that why you brought me to Mrs. Robinson's,

382
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,190
带我去见罗宾逊夫人的原因 因为我非常特殊？
where you brought all the other women? Because I'm so different?

383
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,360
这是错误的 我承认
That was wrong. I admit.

384
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,530
这是完全错误的 这一切都是错的
It's all wrong. All of this is wrong.

385
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,700
你汇钱到我的账户 我不想要你的钱
You put money into my account that... I don't want it.

386
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,120
你收购了我在职的公司
You bought the company i work for.

387
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,080
这不是恋爱关系克里斯汀 这是从属关系
This isn't a relationship, Christian. It's ownership.

388
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,250
我努力想要了解你
I'm trying to understand you.

389
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,890
我只是想接近你
Lam just wanting to get close to you.

390
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,180
不过当你像这样一直作怪
But it's really difficult to do that when you keep doing

391
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,890
我真的很难做到这一点
bizarre things like this.

392
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,780
而且你不让我碰你 也让我很难接受你
And it's really difficult to do that when you won't let me touch you.

393
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,280
来我的卧室
Come to my bedroom.

394
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,660
- 性现在解决不了这个问题  - 你疯了么
- Sex is not gonna fix this right now.  - Are you insane?

395
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,870
安娜 求你
Ana, please.

396
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,540
你想要个路线图
You wanted a road map?

397
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,730
从这开始
Start here.

398
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,600
这些是我的底线
Those are my boundaries.

399
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,400
这个我可以接受
I can live with that.

400
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,860
然后我就都是你的了
Then I'm all yours.

401
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,620

00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,250
谁来了
Who's here?

405
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
哇
Wow.

406
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,130
让头发蓬起来 好吧？
Hair up, I think. Yes?

407
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,180
你的脖子很美
Your neck is beautiful.

408
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,430
克里斯汀
Christian?

409
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,810
再见了 贝拉
Ciao, Bella.

410
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,570

You're just gonna stand there gawking?

411
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,280
是的
Yeah.

412
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,070
是的这样挺好
Yeah, I think I might.

413
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,130

So I was thinking

414
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,850
今晚可能会更刺激
tonight might be more stimulating

415
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,640
如果你穿这些
if you wear these.

416
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,810
我该怎么穿呢？
How am I supposed to wear those?

417
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,860
好吧
Well,

418
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,650
你必须先弄湿它们
you have to get them wet first.

419
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,110
好奇吗？
Curious?

420
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,030
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

421
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,950
好吧
Okay.

422
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,330
张开嘴
Open your mouth.

423
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,630
很好
Good.

424
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,100
现在 弯腰
Now turn. Bend over.

425
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,720
不 你不能把它放进我的屁股
No, you're not putting those in my butt.

426
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,520
他们不进你的屁股
They don't go in your butt.

427
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,290
别动
Stay still.

428
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,260
站直 然后转身
Stand up straight and turn around.

429
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,020

How's it feel?

430
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,270

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,690
很奇怪
Weird.

432
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,820

573
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,580
但这是他所需要的
But it's what he needs.

574
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,050
而我觉得你斌不是那种她想要拥有的女人
And you don't strike me as the type of woman who wants to be owned.

575
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,380
如果你真的想要让他幸福 如果你想要幸福
If you really wanna make him happy, if you wanna be happy,

576
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,590
你该离开他
you'll let him go.

577
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,850
想你这种人 是不可能理解我们的感情的
There's no way that someone like you could ever understand what we have.

578
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,680
我曾和你一样
I've been there.

579
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,770
没有什么能够天长地久
Nothing lasts.

580
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:02,350
没有
Nothing.

581
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,770
我和克里斯汀之间的一切
Whatever happens between me and Christian

582
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,900
都不关你的事
is none of your goddamn business.

583
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,150
你离我们远点
So you stay the fuck away from us.

584
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,500
嘿 我们改考虑退场了
Hey, we should think about going soon.

585
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,210
我现在就想走
I wanna go now.

586
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,630
艾琳娜 队你说什么了
What did Elena say to you?

587
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,600
没什么新鲜的
Nothing I didn't already know.

588
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,690
你能把我送回我家么
Will you just take me to my house?

589
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,490
今晚留下来陪我吧
Stay with me tonight.

590
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,000
嘿 醒醒 我们到家了
Hey, wake up. We're home. Hmm.

591
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,220
先生
Sir?

592
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,260
你待在这
Stay here.

593
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,290
我们会找人来拖车的
We'll have the car towed.

594
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,790
怎么了
What happened?

595
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,790
那是我的车 我的车怎么了
That's my car! What happened to my car?

596
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,350
搜索房间 然后确定安全给我打电话
Check the apartment. Call me when it's safe.

597
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,750
是 先生 马上就去
Yes, sir. Right away. Copy that.

598
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,420
史密斯 你跟着格雷先生
Smith, you stick with Mr. grey.

599
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,140
我们要去那儿
Where are we going?

600
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,180
克里斯汀
Christian?

601
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,060
你觉得是利拉么
Do you think it was Leila?

602
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,730
你真的觉的她会做这种事
You really think she would do something like that?

603
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,580
我不明白为什么我们不能回你家
I really don't see why we can't just go back to your apartment.

604
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,690
那个房子像个碉堡
That place is like a fortress.

605
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,030
她不可能进的去
There's no way she could have gotten in there.

606
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,240
她也不该能进的去车库
She shouldn't have been able to get into the garage, either.

607
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,240
我不能冒一点风险
I'm not taking any chances.

608
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,750
晚上好格雷先生
Good evening, Mr. grey.

609
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,040
嗨 艾德
Hey, ed.

610
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,090
剩下的人早上到
The rest of the crew will be here in the morning.

611
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,430
如果你因为我而出事
If something were to happen to you because of me...

612
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,430
不会的
It won't.

613
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,100
我不会出事的
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

614
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,700
我帮你洗吧
Can I wash this off?

615
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,040
不要偏离线条
Don't stray from the lines.

616
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,330
好吧
Okay.

617
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,570
这是烧伤么
Are these burns?

618
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,740
这是谁干得
Who did this to you?

619
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,330
继续吧 已经过去了
Go on, it's over.

620
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:58,050
我知道向我敞开心扉
I know how difficult it is for you to open up to me

621
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,220
告诉我你的过去 对你来说有多困难
and tell me these things.

622
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,350
不过这对我来说就是一切
But it means the world to me.

623
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,020
这意味着你爱我
It means you love me.

624
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,440
是的 我爱你
Yes, I do.

625
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,140
所以你的打结技术就是这么来的
So this is where your knot-tying expertise comes from.

626
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,640
早上好
Good morning.

627
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,640
你睡得好么
Sleep well?

628
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,940
是的
I did.

629
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,610
这船很漂亮
This boat is really beautiful.

630
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,240
这出自于我在写西雅图造船厂
This is from my yard in Seattle.

631
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,950
你建造的？
You built it?

632
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:04,700
在一些人的帮助下
I had some help.

633
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,410
它叫 格蕾丝号
It's called the grace.

634
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,490
以你母亲的名字命名的？
After your mom?

635
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,290
你听起来很惊讶
You sound surprised.

636
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,290
你总是对她很冷淡而且
Well, you're always so cool towards her.

637
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,170
格蕾丝给了我一切
I owe everything to grace.

638
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,840
她在我生母死后拯救了我
She saved my life after my birth mom died.

639
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,840
你还记得你的生母吗？
Do you remember your birth mom?

640
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,600
我尝试去忘记她
I try not to.

641
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,270
她怎么了？
What happened to her?

642
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,600
她吸毒过度而死
She overdosed.

643
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,310
她的尸体三天后被发现
They found her body three days later.

644
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,280
当时你在哪里
Where were you?

645
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,650
我在她身边
I was with her.

646
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,200
哦 我的天
Oh, my god.

647
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:49,700
人们带走了她 带我去了医院
Took her away. Took me to a hospital.

648
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,700
格蕾丝在哪

看看你那栋房子
Look at that house.

651
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:11,310
真美 房子的尽管肯定很漂亮
That's beautiful. The view's probably amazing.

652
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:13,100
真想知道谁会住在哪里
I wonder who lives there.

653
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,850
是个海军的老遗孀
It's an old sea widow.

654
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,060
几年前他的丈夫过世了
Lost her husband years ago.

655
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,320
从此她每晚坐在窗前 等待他回家
Sits at the window every night waiting for him to come home.

656
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,570

715
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,740
抱歉 斯蒂尔女士 我没想吓着你
Oh, excuse me, miss Steele, i didn't mean to startle you.

716
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,430
不 没事
No, no.

717
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,350
你挺安静的
You are very quiet.

718
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,520
我是琼斯夫人 格雷先生的管家 我来吧
I'm Mrs. Jones. Mr. grey's housekeeper. May I?

719
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,940
哦 嗯
Oh, um...

720
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,690
当然 谢谢
Sure. Thank you.

721
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,070
我是安娜
Um, I'm Ana.

722
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:36,200
我已经知道你的名字了 你刚刚叫了我的姓
But you knew that already because you said my last name.

723
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,240
格雷先生在瑞安的书房里 他刚打完一通电话
Mr. grey is in his study, just finishing up a call.

724
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,120
- 如果你需要我 我就在厨房里  - 好的
- I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.  - Okay.

725
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,330
看到你喜欢的东西了吗
See anything you like?

726
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,250
真是的
Oh, fuck.

727
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:14,500
门没锁
The door was, um, unlocked.

728
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,340
我得和琼斯夫人聊聊
I'll have to talk to Mrs. Jones.

729
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,760
她经常进来里？
Does she come in here a lot?

730
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,390
比如 来这里打扫？
Does she dust in here?

731
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,980
那些是乳头夹
Those are nipple clamps.

732
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,650
过来 把你的手给我
Come here. Give me your hand.

733
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,040
打你拿掉它们的时候感觉比夹着的时候更疼
It's even more intense when you take them off.

734
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,210
哇哦
Ow.

735
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:08,310
这是什么？
What's this?

736
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,140
好吧
Okay.

737
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:13,140
示范够了
That's enough show-and-tell.

738
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,690
这是什么？
What's this?

739
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:19,190
欲速则不达
Let's learn to walk before we run.

740
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,820
我还挺喜欢速度的
I kinda like running.

741
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,160
安娜
Ana? Mmm-hmm?

742
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:33,250
我们上回做这事的时候 你看到我的另一面
Last time we did this, you saw another side of me.

743
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,290
然后你离开了我
And you left.

744
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,250
上回情况不一样
Last time was different.

745
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,600
好吧 但不是在这里
All right. But not here.

746
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,610
琼斯夫人
Mrs. Jones.

747
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,450
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

748
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:29,920
你是我的
You're mine.

749
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:32,960
我是你的
I'm yours.

750
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,660
- 你还好么？ - 很好
- You okay?  - Yeah.

751
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,950
你知道我们总得谈谈去纽约的事
You know at some point we're gonna need to talk about New York.

752
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,530
我们已经谈过了
We have talked about it.

753
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,370
你禁止我去不等于我们谈过了
You forbidding it is not us talking about it.

754
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,060
如果你想去纽约别和海德一起去
If you wanna go to new York, don't go with Hyde.

755
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:54,940
让我带你去 我在纽约有房产
Let me take you. I have a place there.

756
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,230
你当然有
Of course you do.

757
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,990
这可不是度假
This isn't some sort of vacation.

758
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:02,820
这是跟我老板出差 我还想给他留些好印象呢
It's a work trip with my boss, who I would like to impress.

759
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:06,200
你知道在过去的十八个月里 他换了三个助理
You know he's had three assistants in the last 18 months,

760
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:08,040
他们三个都匆匆辞职了
all of whom have quit without notice?

761
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,580
你觉得我搞不定他？
You don't think i can handle him?

762
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,500
不是这样的
That's not it.

763
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,790
给我的感觉就是这样
That's what it feels like.

764
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:18,760
安娜 我非常清楚你能搞定任何事
Ana, I know full well that you can handle anything.

765
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,340
我也知道如果你真想去
And, uh, if you really wanna go,

766
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,010
我阻止不了你
then I can't stop you.

767
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,640
不过我想亲自带你去
But I'd like to take you there myself.

768
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:32,770
好吧
Okay.

769
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:35,650
好吗？
Okay?

770
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,270
好的
Yeah.

771
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,490
我是说 我当然更愿意和你一起去看看纽约
I mean, of course I would rather see New York with you.

772
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,280
很好
Good.

773
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,490
我讨厌我们吵架
I hate it when we fight.

774
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,330
刚才那不是吵架
That wasn't a fight.

775
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,790
那是对话
That was a conversation.

776
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,540
那是一个人讲话另一个人听
It was, you know, when somebody talks, and the other person listens,

777
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,290
然后解决问题
and you resolve an issue.

778
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,840
这就是相处之道
That's how it works.

779
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,300
很疯狂 不是吗？
It's crazy, isn't it?

780
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:04,130
晚安 安娜
Night, Ana.

781
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,550
晚安 汉娜
Good night, Hannah.

782
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,550
[一起吃晚饭？]

783
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,350
[两分钟后见]

784
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:32,750
你要走了？
You leaving?

785
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:37,210
我过来就是想和你谈谈 关于去纽约的事
Um, I was actually just about to come talk to you. Uh, about New York.

786
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:39,550
有问题吗？
There a problem?

787
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,750
嗯
Um...

788
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,630
我很感激你给我的这次机会 杰克
I'm so grateful for the opportunity, Jack,

789
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,840
但通知太仓促了 我有其他安排
but with such short notice, i made plans

790
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:48,010
也不能更改
that I can't change. Huh.

791
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:51,100
不过我整个周末都会带着手机
But I will have my phone on me all weekend.

792
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,810
如果你需要我做什么 我随时执行
So if you need anything, I'm available.

793
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:57,350
安娜 请坐
Ana, have a seat.

794
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,530
我真的 很抱歉
I'm really... I'm sorry.

795
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,870
我认为你在这份工作上有很大的潜力
I think you have tremendous potential here.

796
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,330
但我不想浪费时间去培训
But I don't wanna waste my time

797
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:13,040
一个不认真对待这份工作的人
training someone who doesn't take this position seriously.

798
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,290
我很认真
I do.

799
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:16,710
这是我梦寐以求的工作
This is my dream job.

800
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:20,540
那就去纽约 参加书展不该么 是这个梦想的一部分吗？
Then shouldn't going to New York and the book expo be part of that dream?

801
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:21,710
那只是一部分
It is.

802
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,010
那是
It is.

803
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:26,300
之前是我没搞清楚状况 不会再次发生了
It was just a misunderstanding. It won't happen again.

804
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:31,260
外面有很多又能力的人 他们会为这份工作争破头
Because there are plenty of qualified people who would kill for this job.

805
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:35,770
我的意思是 我不想吹牛 我是一个很好的老师
I mean, look, I don't wanna brag, but I'm a pretty great teacher.

806
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:38,900
我确定你是如此
I'm sure you are.

807
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,900
我只是没看出来你有什么进取心
I'm just not seeing the initiative on your side of it.

808
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,340
除了你的要求 我还读了很多
I've read more than you've asked me to.

809
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:49,320
我可以说是读了所有的
And I'm on top of everything...

810
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:53,490
我说的是更上一层楼
I'm talking about going the extra mile.

811
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,460
除非你希望
Unless you want me

812
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,830
我跟克里斯汀
to compete with Christian grey

813
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:02,460
争风吃醋
for your attention.

814
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:08,300
那天克里斯汀对你很无礼 我替他向你道歉
I apologize that Christian was so curt with you the other night.

815
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:10,010
你就是在纠结这个吗？
Is that what this is about?

816
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:15,430
你男朋友向来以
Your boyfriend has a reputation for being

817
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,980
冷酷无情著称
a little ruthless.

818
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,810
你喜欢这种男人？
Is that what you like?

819
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:23,040
如果你对我的工作不满意 那你应该去找人事部
If you have a problem with my work, then you should take it up with hr.

820
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:24,110
哇哦
Whoa.

821
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,940
你这么认真干嘛
Why are you being so serious?

822
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,030
你以为我会怎么做？让你上我
What do you think I'm gonna do? Make you fuck me?

823
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,200
杰克
Jack.

824
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,780
我只是
I just think...

825
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:36,870
觉得
I just think

826
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,460
我只是觉得如果你打算靠出卖肉体爬上去
if you're gonna fuck your way to prominence,

827
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:45,550
最起码你得找个能拉高你智商的人
then you should do it with someone who can at least make you smarter.

828
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:47,800
而不只是让你更有钱而已
Not just richer.

829
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:50,180
对吗？
Right?

830
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:53,800
别 别怎么？
Don't... Don't what? Hmm?

831
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:59,480
听着 这是个非常严肃的问题
Look, this is a serious, serious question.

832
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,650
你是想被无视
Do you wanna be kept

833
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:07,820
还是被当回事儿
or taken seriously? Hmm?

834
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,990
我想离开这里 求你了 杰克
I would like to leave, please, Jack.

835
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,320
还有
Plus...

836
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:18,660
我能让你高潮 给你其他人无法给你的体验
Loan make you come like nobody else has.

837
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,330
他给不了你的
Not him.

838
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:23,500
谁都给不了你
Not anyone.

839
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:24,590
不
No.

840
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,890
安娜？安娜 出什么事了？
Ana? Ana, what happened?

841
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:41,850
杰克·海德 杰克对我欲行不轨
Jack Hyde tried to touch me.

842
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:42,940
我要杀了他
I'll kill him.

843
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,440
不要 求你了 别去
No, no, please don't go. Don't go. Don't leave me.

844
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,820
别离开我
Okay. Go.

845
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,070
好的 走吧 没事了
It's okay. Hey...

846
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,190
我把东西都丢那了 什么也没拿
I left everything. I don't have any of my stuff.

847
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,950
泰勒会拿过来的 没事了 好吗
Taylor will get it. It's fine, okay?

848
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,530
我送你回家 走吧
I'll take you home, come on.

849
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:57,200
他的门禁证件被吊销了？
And his pass has been cancelled?

850
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:58,740
很好
Good.

851
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,870
不 谢谢你 杰瑞 晚安
No. Thank you, Jerry. Good night.

852
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,130
至少那件事已经处理好了
Well, at least that's dealt with.

853
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:10,670
海德出局了 他被炒了
Hyde's out. He's been fired.

854
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:11,760
哇哦
Whoa.

855
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,720
怎么会 真是
How? That's...

856
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:20,310
我以为你跟sip的生意还没完成
But I thought your deal with sip hasn't been finished yet.

857
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:23,270
是的 我认识他们的执行总裁
It's not. But I know the ceo.

858
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,100
我把事情都告诉了他
I told him what happened.

859
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,570
你以后再也看不到他了
You'll never have to see him again.

860
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,280
既然他已经离开 那我还能在那工作吗？
Am I still gonna have a job now that he's not there?

861
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,860
要是你工作没了 你就干脆
Well, if you don't, you can just...

862
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:37,700
克里斯汀 你知道我喜欢工作
Christian, you know i love working.

863
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,830
你不能把我一直关在你加阁楼里
You can't keep me locked up in your penthouse.

864
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,710
我给你钥匙如何
What if I gave you a key?

865
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,340
我是说
I mean,

866
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:55,010
我给你一把这里的钥匙 你可以把一些东西放这
what if you had a key, and you kept some of your stuff here?

867
01:10:55,180 --> 01:11:00,350
你可以吧所有东西都放这儿
Keep all of your stuff here and you slept, you know...

868
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:02,350
不用回你住的地方
Not at your place.

869
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:07,980
你这是让我搬过来和你一起住？
Are you asking me to move in with you?

870
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,320
是的
Mmm-hmm.

871
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,990
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

872
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,320
确定
Yes.

873
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,120
我希望你一直都在这儿
I want you here all the time.

874
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,620
希望你尽快搬进来
As soon as possible.

875
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,050
你之前不是说欲速则不达吗？
What happened to learning to walk before we run?

876
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:38,300
这个么 这是事我们众多早餐话题中的一个
That's just one of the many things that we could talk about over breakfast.

877
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:45,850
我能考虑下吗？
Can I think about it?

878
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,190
当然可以
Sure.

879
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,480
好的
Yeah.

880
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,490
莉兹 嗨
Liz, hi!

881
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:02,700
安娜 不知你是否听说 杰克昨晚辞职了
Ana, don't know if you heard, but Jack resigned last night.

882
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:03,870
走得匆匆忙忙的
In kind of a hurry.

883
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,410
sip 现在不招新人 咱俩快完蛋了
Sip isn't recruiting right now, so we're screwed.

884
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,460
这么说 你不需要我了 对吗？
So you don't need me anymore then?

885
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,420
我们会给你安排个临时工作
I'm gonna try to find you something temporary.

886
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,000
今天早上你能先补下杰克的空吗？
Could you fill in for Jack at this morning's meeting?

887
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:15,800
高级编辑会议？
At the senior editors' meeting?

888
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,010
就今天而已
Just for today.

889
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:19,050
只有你清楚杰克的工作
You're the only one who knows Jack's entire slate.

890
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:21,220
是的 可 我
Well, yeah, but, I...

891
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,270
你说的对 这个要求确实有点过分
You're right. It's too much.

892
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:30,350
不 我能行
No, I can do it.

893
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,020
没关系 我可以的
It's fine. I can do it.

894
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,570
很好
Great.

895
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:40,530
散会了给我打电话
Call me when you're done.

896
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,080
我们应该精简发行作品
We need to print fewer titles.

897
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,790
只跟有名气的作家约稿
Stick with established authors.

898
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,750
关注我们的核心读者
Focus on our core readership.

899
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:50,040
扩大核心读者群
Expand it.

900
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,130
什么？
I'm sorry?

901
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:56,300
那你觉得我们应该出版什么样的作品
Um, uh... so, Ana, what do you think we should be publishing?

902
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:01,260
新鲜的血液
Um, newer voices.

903
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,720
还有你那些有名气的作家
Along with your established authors. Mmm-hmm.

904
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:07,770
比如 博伊斯·福克斯 他的文章上周获得八十万点击量
Boyce fox, for example, got 80,000 hits last week.

905
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:09,230
真的吗？
Really?

906
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:13,060
线上点击不一定能促进纸媒销量
Online hits don't automatically translate to print sales.

907
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,570
但它们可以
Well, but they could.

908
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:18,440
从人口统计血的角度看 他的线上读者年龄处于十八到二十四之间
His online audience is an 18-to-24 demographic,

909
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:22,110
而这些人正是我们需要争取的读者群体
and those are exactly the readers that we should be chasing.

910
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:26,620
我可以给你们看下数据 我觉得他值得我们冒险
Um, I mean, I can show you the stats. I think he's worth taking a risk on.

911
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:30,620
也许我们该看看统计数字
Maybe we should take a look.

912
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,090
这个主意很好
Great idea.

913
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:45,760
安娜？安娜 稍等
Uh, Ana? Ana, just...

914
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,560
洛奇先生 如果我刚才越界了 我真的很抱歉
Mr. roach, I'm really sorry if I was out of line.

915
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,770
不 没关系 你说的很有道理
No, don't be sorry. You made a lot of sense.

916
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:54,940
不 杰克·海德都走了 你还在这儿干嘛
No, so, uh, what are you doing now that Jack Hyde's gone?

917
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,990
莉兹说给我安排个临时工作
Urn, well, Liz mentioned something temporary. I don't know.

918
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:02,820
好的 那你为何不暂时顶替杰克的位置
Okay. So why don't you fill in for Jack temporarily?

919
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,450
行么？
Good? Um...

920
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:08,500
太好了 没问题 就这么定了
Great. Okay. That's settled.

921
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,340
为sip 新任小说编辑干杯
To sip's new fiction editor.

922
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:03,340
代理小说编辑
Acting fiction editor.

923
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:05,890
他们迟早会知道你有多优秀
Till they find out how good you are.

924
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:11,100
这事儿没动用你的关系吗？
Christian, did you have something to do with this?

925
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:15,040
没有 这都是你自己的努力得来的
No. Hey, it was all you.

926
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,790
怎么 你不相信我
What? You don't believe me?

927
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:21,040
我是不相信自己
I don't believe it myself.

928
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,090
我昨晚问了你的问题
I asked you a question last night.

929
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:30,430
你说搬过来和你一起住的事？
About moving in with you? Mmm-hmm.

930
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,890
我只是觉得自己可能
I just think that I'm probably...

931
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:42,690
我需要从自己住的地方拿点东西
I need to get some things from my apartment.

932
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,780
我可以安排
That can be arranged.

933
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:49,400
好的
Good.

934
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,450
也许我们可以
Now, maybe we could

935
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:56,580
回家庆祝一番
take this celebration home.

936
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,580
服务员 结账
The check, please.

937
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,220
脱掉你的内裤
Take off your panties.

938
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:14,590
现在就做
Do it now.

939
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:18,350
在这里吗？
Right in here?

940
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,430
是的 在这里 现在
Yeah, right here. Now.

941
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:22,600
继续
Go on.

942
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,560
嗯
Hmm.

943
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:11,730
抱歉
Excuse me.

944
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,040
不来了
Don't come.

945
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,030
嗯嗯 不
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. No.

946
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:50,330
两分钟 你在开玩笑吗？
Two minutes. Are you kidding?

947
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:52,080
在卧室 你开玩笑吗？
In the bedroom. Are you joking?

948
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,670
两分钟的时间
Two minutes.

949
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,120
你这是要干什么？
What are you doing in here?

950
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,540
你让我等的
You made me wait,

951
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,080
所以现在该轮到你了
so now it's your turn.

952
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,630
你行吗
Are you any good?

953
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:49,970
走着瞧
Hmm. We'll see.

954
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,060
或许我们应该打个赌
Maybe we should make a bet.

955
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:56,770
如果我赢
If I win,

956
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,940
你带我去红房子
you take me to the red room.

957
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,820
如果我赢了
And if I win?

958
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:07,030
你可以选
Your choice.

959
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:21,800
开始
Break.

960
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,010
好吧
Okay.

961
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,280
嗯 全色
Mmm. Solids.

962
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,790
哦 亲爱
Oh, dear.

963
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:49,150
侧袋
Side pocket.

964
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:52,820
红房间 我们来了
Red room, here we come.

965
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:00,750
哦
Oof.

966
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:02,120
该死
Shit.

967
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,630
我希望你不是一个痛苦的输家
I hope you're not a sore loser.

968
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,210
这取决于你如何努力打我屁股
That depends on how hard you spank me.

969
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,440
我非常想粗暴的对你
I want to be very rough with you.

970
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,690
所以对我粗暴吧
So be rough with me.

971
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:57,930
捷达需要人在新版科鲁兹上签字
And Jada needs someone to sign off on the new carusi.

972
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:01,220
我一直让杰克去签
I kept asking Jack to do that.

973
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:03,230
是啊 但杰克有点懒
Yeah, well, Jack was kind of lazy.

974
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:04,600
你没注意到吗？
Didn't you notice?

975
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:05,900
注意到了
Yeah.

976
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,400
他把这叫做 艺术气质
I believe he called it "artistic temperament."

977
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:12,940
谢了 汉娜
Thank you, Hannah.

978
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:14,780
不客气
Yep.

979
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:19,910
嗨
Hey,

980
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,830
你能来做这项工作很棒
it's great that you're doing this, but...

981
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:26,040
但这样 感觉很奇怪 我懂
It's totally weird, i know. I know.

982
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:29,290
我是不是该称呼你斯蒂尔女士
I mean, am I expected to call you miss Steele?

983
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,920
还是叫我安娜吧
I expect you to call me Ana.

984
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:34,300
除非你也需要
And I don't expect you to fetch me coffee

985
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:36,880
否则不用专门去帮我倒咖啡
unless you're getting some for yourself.

986
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:44,270
至于其他的事情 我们慢慢磨合吧 好吗？
And the rest of it, we'll just make up as we go, okay?

987
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,730
好的
Okay.

988
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,370
斯蒂尔女士
Miss Steele.

989
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:09,330
该死
Damn it.

990
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:12,710
接吧 我去拿点东西 查下邮箱
Take it. I'm just gonna grab some stuff and check the mail.

991
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:13,880
我跟你一起上去
I should go up with you.

992
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,510
不没事的 我马上回来
No, it's okay. I'll be two seconds.

993
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,760
接吧
Take it.

994
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:19,970
嗨 罗斯
Hey, ros.

995
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:02,800
利拉
Leila.

996
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:09,640
克里斯汀在楼下
Christian is downstairs.

997
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,150
你想要见他吗？
Do you wanna see him?

998
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,860
我是来找你的
I came to see you.

999
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,200
好吧
Okay.

1000
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:27,490
他都告诉我了
He told me what happened.

1001
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:33,330
我知道你现在很痛苦
I know you're in a lot of pain.

1002
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:36,460
我真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1003
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:39,760
他允许你叫他的名字
He lets you call him by his name.

1004
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:44,390
他总谈起你
He talks about you all the time.

1005
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:46,300
他在乎你
He cares about you.

1006
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:51,810
别说谎了
Don't lie.

1007
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,270
你到底那点比我好
Tell me what you have that I don't.

1008
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,820
我哪点都不如你
Nothing.

1009
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:03,780
我根本不算什么
I'm nothing.

1010
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:07,830
他迟早会厌倦我的
He'll get tired of me.

1011
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:10,580
主人都睡到你床上了
Master sleeps in your bed.

1012
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:13,920
你怎么知道？我看到你了
How do you know that? I saw you.

1013
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,290
我一直在观察你
I watched you.

1014
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:19,090
我知道你爱他
I know you love him.

1015
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:20,880
我也爱他
I do, too.

1016
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,010
我们都爱他
We all do.

1017
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:25,580
那你为何不把枪放下？
Why don't you put the gun down?

1018
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,390
你不了解他 不知道他的喜好
You don't know him or what he likes.

1019
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,880
他想要的你给不了 他跟你不过是逢场作戏
You don't give him what he wants. He's pretending with you.

1020
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:46,570
不 克里斯汀
No, Christian.

1021
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:10,100
跪下
Kneel.

1022
01:28:29,410 --> 01:28:30,620
安娜
Ana...

1023
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,000
去艾斯卡拉大厦等我
Go to escala. Wait for me there.

1024
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:40,460
就听我一次行不行
For once, just do as you're told.

1025
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:47,180
泰勒 让她出去
Taylor, get her out of here.

1026
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:01,820
斯蒂尔女士
Miss Steele.

1027
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,200
斯蒂尔女士 安娜
Miss Steele. Ana!

1028
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:11,740
得了 泰勒
Stop it, Taylor.

1029
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,500
我不管
I don't care.

1030
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:46,880
她走了三小时了手机钱包都没带
She's been gone for three hours, and she doesn't have her cell or her purse.

1031
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,340
算了 她回来了
Forget it. She's here.

1032
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:58,810
你到底去哪儿了
Where the fuck have you been?

1033
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,770
我让你直接来着
I told you to come straight here.

1034
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:06,180
我怕派人四处去找你
I've had people out combing the streets, looking for you.

1035
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:08,820
抱歉我并不总是那么听话
I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.

1036
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:13,200
也许你真的只是需要一个完全服从你的人
Maybe you just really need someone who obeys every command.

1037
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,610
无风不起浪
Don't be ridiculous.

1038
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:16,370
我看到你了 克里斯汀
I saw you, Christian.

1039
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:18,660
我看到你是如何对待利拉的
I saw the way you were with Leila.

1040
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:20,660
她当时有枪 安娜
She had a gun, Ana.

1041
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,830
为了制服她 我没得选
I would have done anything to subdue her.

1042
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:26,330
她现在在哪儿
Where is she now?

1043
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,250
在这吗？
Is she here?

1044
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:29,460
什么？
What?

1045
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:31,010
不 当然不在
No, of course not.

1046
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:33,510
她在精神病院里接受治疗
She's in the psych ward getting the help that she needs.

1047
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:39,010
听着 我知道她吓着你了
Look, I know she scared you...

1048
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:40,890
没错 她是把我吓找了
Yeah. She scared me.

1049
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:44,640
但你更让我可怕
But you scared me more.

1050
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,940
看你对她那样
Seeing you like that with her.

1051
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:53,950
我永远做不到对你卑躬屈膝 言听计从
I'll never be able to give you that kind of submission and obedience.

1052
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,410
安娜
Ana.

1053
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:58,700
别过来 我需要空间
Don't crowd me. I need space.

1054
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,660
安娜 求你了别这样 克里斯汀
No, please don't do this. Christian.

1055
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:03,710
别放弃我 我只是需要想想
Don't give up on me. I just need to think a little bit.

1056
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:06,080
别离开我
Don't leave me.

1057
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,130
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

1058
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:13,670
起来
Get up.

1059
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:18,600
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

1060
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:20,470
看着我
Look at me.

1061
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:23,600
看着我
Look at me.

1062
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,780
我被吓坏了
I'm scared.

1063
01:32:36,570 --> 01:32:38,990
我知道你会说有我在就足够了
I know you say that I'm enough.

1064
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,950
但以前你习惯得到的一些东西
But there are certain things that you are used to getting

1065
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:49,290
我是永远给不了的
that I will never, ever, ever be able to give you.

1066
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:55,170
也许目前我们相处没问题
And it might be fine for right now,

1067
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,340
但万一你又有那些需要的时候这么办
but what's gonna happen when you start needing them again?

1068
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:59,430
不会的
I won't.

1069
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:01,220
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

1070
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:02,430
我如何能相信你
How can I believe you?

1071
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,640
我都不理解你为什么总想支配别人
I don't even understand your need to dominate.

1072
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,560
我不是要支配别人
I'm not a dominant.

1073
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:08,480
我不是
I'm not.

1074
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,480
确切的说我是个施虐狂
The right term is a sadist.

1075
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:15,490
对女人的施虐能给我带来快感 像你这样的女人
I get off on punishing women. Women who look like you...

1076
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:17,240
像你母亲那样的女人
Like your mother.

1077
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:19,860
是的
Yes.

1078
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:22,950
我知道自己有多变态
And I know how fucked up that is.

1079
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:25,330
你走之后
When you left,

1080
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:30,630
我发誓如果你能回来 我就不再施虐
I swore that I would stop it if that's what it took to get you back.

1081
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,800
我再也不会那样做了
But I'm done with it.

1082
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,760
你是我生命里最重要的人
You mean more to me than anything else.

1083
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,890
我想相信你 真的
I wanna believe you. I do.

1084
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:45,220
可我做不到
But I can't.

1085
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:46,850
安娜 给我你的手
Ana, give me your hand.

1086
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:52,110
这就是我
This is me.

1087
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:55,230
所有的我
All of me.

1088
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,400
克里斯汀
Christian.

1089
01:33:57,570 --> 01:33:59,280
我全心全意爱你
And I'm all yours.

1090
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:02,680
不
No.

1091
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:07,510
不要
No!

1092
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,480
嘿 没事的
Hey. Hey, hey. No.

1093
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:13,600
我在这
It's okay. I'm right here.

1094
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:15,900
我在这呢
I'm right here.

1095
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:22,240
嫁给我
Marry me.

1096
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:25,240
什么
What?

1097
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,030
我想要娶你
I want you to marry me.

1098
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:32,540
克里斯汀 我觉得你是在做梦
Christian, I think you're dreaming.

1099
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:37,900
早上好
Good morning.

1100
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,440
早安
Morning.

1101
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:44,400
睡得好么
Sleep okay?

1102
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:47,110
还不错 你呢
I did. You?

1103
01:36:47,530 --> 01:36:49,950
睡得很沉 整晚都没醒
Like a log. Out all night.

1104
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:51,030
嗯
Hmm.

1105
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:59,630
你没做奇怪的梦吗？
You didn't have any weird dreams or anything?

1106
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,380
然后醒来什么的
Or, like, wake up at all?

1107
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:03,550
没有
No.

1108
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:05,920
我完全想不起来
I mean, none that I can think of.

1109
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:07,010
嗯
Hmm.

1110
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:10,510
有件小事 我好像跟你说了嫁给我
I mean, there was a little thing of asking you to marry me,

1111
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,470
但除此之外什么事都没有
but aside from that, no. Nothing.

1112
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,640
别这样耍我
Don't mess with me like that.

1113
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:17,690
不要吗？那我要怎样耍你
No? How should i mess with you?

1114
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:20,150
像这样
Like this? Huh?

1115
01:37:21,310 --> 01:37:22,480
这样好点么
Ls that better?

1116
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:29,070
我认真的
I meant it.

1117
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:32,490
我想娶你
I wanna marry you.

1118
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:34,580
为什么
Why?

1119
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:40,580
我想余生每分每秒都能与你厮守
Because I wanna spend every second of the rest of my life with you.

1120
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:50,590
我并不期待你马上同意
I don't expect you to say yes right away.

1121
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,100
我知道我这个人很复杂
I know I'm complicated.

1122
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:58,100
有那么一点而已
Just a little bit.

1123
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:03,360
你有助手吗？
You have an assistant?

1124
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,190
我还以为你就是助手
I thought you were an assistant.

1125
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,700
说来话长 有什么事吗？
It's a long story. What's going on?

1126
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:11,110
我该给克里斯汀买什么生日礼物
What do I get Christian for his birthday?

1127
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,830
这家伙除了幽默感外什么都不缺
The boy already has everything except a sense of humor.

1128
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:15,950
他的
Uh...

1129
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:19,290
他的生日？什么时候
His birthday? When is his birthday?

1130
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:22,290
周日 他没告诉你骂？太奇怪了
Sunday. He didn't tell you? He is so weird.

1131
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:24,290
爸妈要给他办个派对
Mom and dad are throwing him a party.

1132
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:25,710
他们不是刚办过吗？
Didn't they just have a party?

1133
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:27,630
你和他一样差劲 那是个舞会
Jeez, you're as bad as he is.

1134
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:28,800
生日派对
That was a ball.

1135
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:31,800
只有家人 朋友 音乐 烟花
This is just family, friends, music, fireworks.

1136
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:34,390
没什么大不了的 卖个领带怎么样
No biggie. Hey, what about a tie?

1137
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,220

有礼物盒吗？
Do you have a gift box?

1145
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,120
稍等
One second.

1146
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:07,090

1147

1151
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:22,690
他去那我的行李了

你的行李 你要去哪

1153
01:39:25,190 --> 01:39:28,020
我和罗斯去波特兰开会
Ros and I have to go to Portland for some meetings.

1154
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:29,530

1155

1156
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:35,280
你打算什么时候告诉我你生日的事？

They do this every year.

1160

是啊 这可是生日
Um, yeah. Birthday.

1161
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:52,720
我并不觉得我的降生是件值得庆祝的事
My, uh, arrival in the world isn't something I feel like celebrating.

1162
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:55,970
我倒是觉得该庆祝一番
Well, I feel like celebrating it.

1164

那你为什么现在给我
Then why give it to me now?

1165
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,730
这叫做满足感延迟
Call it delayed gratification.

1169
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:40,300
[格雷先生 你可真固执]

1170
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,300
[斯蒂尔女士 这可不是拒绝]

1171
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,200
[明天约凯特出来喝一杯]

1172
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,750
[别喝多了]

1173
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,900

1174
01:41:12,770 --> 01:41:15,730

Great. You realize that's a volcano, right?

1177
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:28,360
放松 罗斯 如果它爆发 您将有一个首观察席位
Relax, ros. If it goes up, you'll have a ringside seat.

1178
01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:29,450
啊！
Ah.

1179

有点不安 但
It's a little scary, but...

1428

然而你是个不折不扣的疯子
You, however, are certifiably insane.

1432
02:00:07,070 --> 02:00:08,240
抱歉打断你们
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1433

看来我们的谈话让你受益匪浅

1436

你凭什么觉得我会听你的
What makes you think i would ever listen to you?

1437
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,760
你根本不在乎克里斯汀
You don't care about Christian.

1438

他会明白的

艾琳娜 你玩完了
It's over for you, Elena.

1442
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:38,140
你只是垂涎他财产的小角色
You're just a mousy little thing after his money.

1443
02:00:38,310 --> 02:00:40,610
他根本没法驾驭婚姻
He's not capable of marriage.

1444
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:48,780
谢谢你 克里斯汀

1445

艾琳娜 你为什么在这里
Why are you even here, Elena?

1446
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:53,450
她不适合你
She's not right for you.

1447
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:55,450
你不明白什么才适合我
You don't know what's right for me.

1448
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:57,660
艾琳娜 你教会我床笫之事
You taught me how to fuck, Elena.

1449
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:59,290
而安娜教会了我如何去爱
Ana taught me how to love.

1450
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:02,130
她只是你的一个备胎
She's just the next one in line.

1451
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:04,460
从我家滚出去
Get out of my house.

1452
02:01:08,510 --> 02:01:12,260
别碰我的孩子 从我家滚出去
Leave my children alone, and get the hell out of my house.

1453
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:26,480
安娜 亲爱的
Ana, darling...

1454
02:01:29,150 --> 02:01:31,870
麻烦让我们单独谈谈 好吗？
Would you give us a moment alone, please?

1455
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:02,190
抱歉
I'm sorry about that.

1456
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:07,730
你妈妈还好吗？
Ls your mom okay?

1457
02:02:09,030 --> 02:02:10,820
简直怒发冲冠
Furious. Hmm.

1458
02:02:11,650 --> 02:02:13,160
艾琳娜走啦
Elena's gone.

1459
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:15,330
是结束了那种走了吗
Like, gone, gone?

1460
02:02:15,490 --> 02:02:16,660
不管生意上
I'm done.

1461
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:19,080
还是生活上 都结束了
The business. Everything.

1462
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:21,750
我明天会召集员工落实细节
I'll have my people sort out the details tomorrow.

1463
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:26,250
我知道她对你很重要

1464
02:02:26,670 --> 02:02:27,880
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1465
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:31,220
你真的觉得抱歉吗？
Are you?

1466
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:32,550
不是 这就对了
No. No.

1467
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:37,390
你手里拿的是什么
What's that you got there?

1468
02:02:52,450 --> 02:02:55,200
跟我来 我给你看样东西
Come with me. There's something I need to show you.

1469
02:02:58,410 --> 02:03:01,540
上次我们下来的时候我还被你扛在肩膀上
Last time we came down here, i was over your shoulder.

1470
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:03,330

1471
02:03:20,430 --> 02:03:21,770
你先走
After you.

1472
02:03:33,570 --> 02:03:35,110
哦我的天
Oh, my god!

1473
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:38,200
你喜欢的爱心和花束
You wanted hearts and flowers.

1474
02:03:38,370 --> 02:03:39,410
哦 我的天
Oh, my god!

1475
02:03:39,490 --> 02:03:40,490

It's okay.

1476
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:42,200

It's okay.

1477
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:49,790

1485

1486
