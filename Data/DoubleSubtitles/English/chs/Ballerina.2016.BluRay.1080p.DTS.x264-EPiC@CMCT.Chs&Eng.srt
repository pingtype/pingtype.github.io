00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,340
慢慢来，就快到了
Slowly! Almost there!

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,420
立定
Stop!

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,480

Shhh!

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,540
哼
Ha!

25
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,740
菲丽西又去哪了
Where is Felicie?

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,020
呃，先生，我也不知道
Uh, sir, I don't know.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,200
你在看什么呢，臭小子
What are you looking at,you idiot?

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,970
喔
Whoa!

快去找到她
Go get Felicie!

30
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,760
可您让我去哪儿找啊
You know, I'm having a little bit of trouble knowing which direction...

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,650
现在就去！
Now!

32
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,450

你别再闹别扭了
Stop! Stop doing your grumpy face!

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,940
我并没有，我只是有点在意
I'm not, I'm just a little bit hurt that you were...

39
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,800
你居然想丢下我独自逃跑
..I don't know, escaping without me!

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,910
逃跑？我想逃跑？
Escaping? Me?

41
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,450
不，我只是想上去看看这美丽的景色
No, I was just looking at the spectacular view!

42
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,570
你知道的，如果没有我陪你的话
Because, you know, you wouldn't last

43
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,750
外面的世界可是很危险的
more than five minutes out there without me.

44
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,760
哼 哈
Ha! Ha!

45
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,460
快住手 你知道这样做也很危险

我们真的感到很抱歉
We're sorry- We're sorry, and...

62
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,210
行行行，放开他们
Tut-tut-tut! Let them go!

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,020
你，回到你的房间
You, go to your room.

64
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,420
谢谢你 谢谢你 院长嬷嬷
Thank you! Thank you, Mother Superior.

65
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,480
行了，快回去
Enough. Go to your room.

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,650
容我说一句您今天看起来
And may I just say that you are looking very...

67
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:36,970
够了
Enough..

68
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,170
非常光彩照人
Superior today.

69
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:38,910
不要再说了
Enough!

70
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,470
好吧
OK!

71
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,340
菲丽西，我知道你梦想成为一个芭蕾舞演员
Felicie, I know you have this dream of being a dancer.

72
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,430
我们都知道
We all know it!

73
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,920
但是我
But I...

74
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,480
停停停，所有人都有梦想
Tut-tut-tut! All the world has a dream.

75
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,990
但是记住我这句话，梦无法成真
But get this into your head, dreams are not reality.

76
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,370
梦想终究会被埋葬 因为生活是
Dreams are buried because life is

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,450
艰辛的，残酷的，没有人会同情你
hard, brutal and without pity.

78
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:55,790
可是
But...

79
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,520
得得得
Tut-tut-tut!

80
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,800
你记住了没有
Agreed?

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,660
记住了
Agreed.

82
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,030
在巴黎有一所舞蹈学校，小姑娘
A dance school in Paris, little lady,

83
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,110
它叫巴黎歌剧院
the Opera de Paris,

84
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,450
那里全是舞蹈演员和舞蹈
full of dancers and dance!

85
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,000
你从哪找到这个的
Where did you find this?

86
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,380
我自有办法
I have my sources.

87
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,800
怎么样，看够了吧
OK? Enough!

88
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,830
我能再看一下吗
Can I see it again?

89
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,550
不行
No.

90
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,880
求你了
Please!

91
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,190
不行，除非你和我今晚能逃出去，我向你保证
No, but if you escape with me tonight, you have my word.

92
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,850
我会带你去这个舞蹈学校
I will take you to this dance school,

93
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,000
你会成为最伟大的的舞蹈家
and you will become the greatest dancer,

94
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,960
而我会成为最伟大的发明家
And I will become the greatest inventor ever!

95
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,480
那么说 你有计划了
Do you have a plan?

96
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,700
一个聪明绝顶的计划
A brilliant plan!

97
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,080
集合了本天才毋庸置疑的才华与智慧
A plan worthy of my total, utter, unquestionable genius.

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,800
让我看看
Let me see.

99
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,120
等我们逃出去再看
After we escape.

100
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,330
不行
No!

101
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:44,740
给我 我要看
Now! Now!

102
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,630
都说了现在不行
I said after.

103
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:45,930
现在就看
Now!

104
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,330
不行
After !

105
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,920
现在就看嘛
Now!

106
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,560
不行不行
After !

107
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,330
噢
Ow!

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,950
巴黎的舞蹈学校
A dance school in Paris.

109
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,270
嗯
Hmm.

110
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,910
嘘，是我，快跟我来
Shhh! It's me! Come on!

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,660
啊 我的天
Oh, my!

112
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,870
你的绝妙计划里还有只鸡
Is a chicken part of your brilliant plan?

113
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,880
没错
Affirmative!

114
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,200
好极了
Great!

115
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,600
哦额
Aaah!

116
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,080
院长嬷嬷让我带这个逃跑的孩子
I'm taking this pitiful deserter

117
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,450
去见她
to Mother Superior.

118
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,050
没问题 修女
OK, Sister. Hmm...

119
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,540
嗯～
Hmm?

120
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,110
啊
Ahh!

121
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,000
紧急情况 警报 启动备用计划
Emergency! Emergency! Activate Plan B!

122
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,680
从这走
This way!

123
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,540
执行备用计划
Activate Plan B!

124
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,750
这就是你无与伦比的计划？
That was your best ever plan?

125
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,000
你别这么挑剔好吗
You are so critical!

126
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,950
你真是个差劲的逃跑家
And you're a terrible escaper!

127
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,400
“逃跑家”根本就不是个词
'Escaper' is not a word!

128
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,900
噢天，又撞了一次
Ow! God, not again!

129
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,200
都给我下来
Get back down here!

130
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,430
给我把门打开
Open this door!

131
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,450
这三个月来
For the last three months,

132
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,370
我一直在研究母鸡
I have been studying chickens.

133
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,680
我知道了它们怎么进食
I know how they eat.

134
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,330
给我把门打开
Open this door!

135
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,610
我知道了它们怎么走路
I know how they walk.

136
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,770
我还知道它们如何下蛋
I know how they lay an egg.

137
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,080
我现在可以说对它们是完全了解的
There is nothing about a chicken that I do not know!

138
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,150
哒哒
Ta-da!

139
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,090
这就是我发明的“鸡翼”
I call them chicken wings!

140
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,140
可是 鸡根本不会飞啊
Chickens don't fly!

141
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,360
可它们有翅膀 一定会飞的
But they have wings. They must fly.

142
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,570
你会飞，对吧
You fly, don't you?

143
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,480
飞吧
Fly!

144
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,540
啊哦
Uh-oh!

145
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,440
终于逮到你们了
I'm going to... Got you

146
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,160

Come here, you rascals!

147
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,790
后会无期了
Goodbye!

148
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,460
什么
What?

149
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,270
让我们飞吧
Let's go!

150
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,310
咯咯哒
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

151
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,230
总有一天 人们会这样出行
One day, everyone will travel like this!

152
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,160
噢
Ow!

153
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,460
我的音乐盒
My music box!

154
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,880
维克多 他追来了
Victor! He's behind you!

155
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,540
快给我停下 你们是逃不掉的
I've got my eye on you! You're not going anywhere!

156
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,520
哦不
Aaah! Oh no!

157
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,380
抓紧了
Hang on!

158
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,420
谢谢
Thanks!

159
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,080
小心前面
Victor, watch out!

160
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,020
哈哈 现在你们哪也去不了了吧
Yeah! Ha-ha! Now I've got you!

161
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,290
看到你们了
I see you!

162
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,230
快点儿 跟我来
This way! Let's go!

163
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,530
等等我 哦不 快点儿
Wait! Oh! Oh, no!

164
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,760
快抓住我的手
Yah! Grab on! Grab on!

165
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,580
放手
Oh! Let me go! Let him go!

166
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,970
放开我 你这个坏蛋
Let me go, stinky!

167
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,520
啊
Oh!

168
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,000
还算顺利吧
That went well, no?

169
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,160
你可真棒
You're unbelievable.

170
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,150
那当然了
I know.

171
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,140
维克多 我们居然逃出来了
Victor, we actually did it!

172
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,960
是啊 我们居然逃出来了
Yes, we actually did!

173
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,280
噢 它坏了
Oh.

174
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,360
没关系 我可以修好它
I can fix this.

175
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,140
我想说的是
But I should say

176
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,760
因为当初
that seeing as this is the one thing

177
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,240
它和你一起被留在了孤儿院门口
That was in your crib when you were left outside the orphanage,

178
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,480
你真的应该小心保管它
you should take a teeny-tiny, eensy-weensy

179
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,740
别让它受到磕碰
little bit more care of it.

180
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,100
修好了 不用谢我
Fixed! Don't thank me!

181
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,120
等到了明天 巴黎
And tomorrow, chérie, Paris...

182
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,370
将会成为我们的舞台
..will be ours.

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,640
早安 我的公主
Good morning, sunshine!

184
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,920
恶 你是有多久没刷牙了
Eww! When's the last time you brushed your teeth?

185
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,810
这边 这个箱子
Start with this one.

186
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,540
喔
Whoa!

187
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,940
哦
Ugh!

188
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,380
我们到哪儿了
I can't see where we are.

189
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,070
别担心 我们在巴黎
Relax! We're in Paris!

190
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,210
呃
Aaah!

191
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,220
安静 你想被抓住吗
Quiet! We're going to get caught!

192
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,090
不准再出声了
Not another noise out of you.

193
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,470
不是我放的
That wasn't me!

194
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,330
哇
Wow!

195
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,080
这儿就是巴黎
It's incredible!

196
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,630
巴黎太美了
Paris is amazing.

197
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,400
巴黎这么大 可舞蹈学校在哪儿呢
So, where's the dance school?

198
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,960
别担心 菲丽西
Relax, Felicie!

199
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,310
好好享受吧 这可是梦想之都巴黎啊
Enjoy Paris. Breathe it in.

200
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,450
你好吗
Hi there!

201
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,230
您的小胡子不错啊
Love your moustache, monsieur!

202
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,290
啊 这就是巴黎
Ah, yes, Paris!

203
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,010
这里有浪漫 这里有梦想
City of romance. City of dreams.

204
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,200
这里有名望与财富
City of fame and fortune!

205
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,800
还有 路灯和鸽子
City of lamp posts. City of pigeons.

206
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,320
浪漫说过了吗
Did I say romance?

207
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,570
是的 说过了 那舞蹈学校在哪儿呢
Yes, you did. Now, where's the dance school?

208
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,370
呃…我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

209
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,240
没关系 我们是伙伴
Don't worry. We're a team.

210
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,880
我们一起去找
We'll find it together.

211
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,800
呃
Ugh!

212
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,480
你不觉得这样逃出来有点太鲁莽了
Do you think it was stupid to come to Paris?

213
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,880
别这样说 我们可不能因为这点小事就轻言放弃
Don't say that! We should never give up on our dreams.

214
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,500
可我们只是孤儿 对巴黎一无所知
We're kids! We're all alone.

215
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,150
或许我梦想成为舞蹈家 真的是异想天开呢
Was I really crazy to think I could be a dancer?

216
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,700
你觉得呢
What do you think?

217
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,120
维克多？
Victor?

218
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,280
唉我说
I said...

219
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,160
维克多？
Victor?

220
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,340
我没事
I'm OK!

221
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,600
你去那做什么 快回来
Come back!

222
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,210
可我不会游泳
I can't swim!

223
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,900
明早七点 在这座桥上等我 我们不见不散
Meet me on this bridge at this time tomorrow.

224
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,090
无论遇到什么情况
No matter how dangerous it is,

225
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,180
我一定会到的
I will return!

226
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,920
维克多
Victor!

227
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,910
你快回来
Come back!

228
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,080
别丢下我
Don't leave!

229
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,810
求你了
Please.

230
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,710
嗯
Huh?

231
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,180
[每个女生都值得拥有一套宝诗龙首饰]

232
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,630
嗷
Aaah!

233
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,040
给我老实交代
What have you come here to do, huh?

234
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,830
你来这儿想偷什么
You came here to steal, didn't you?

235
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,720
告诉我 你这个贼
Answer me! You're a thief!

236
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,280
我没想偷东西 我只是在看她跳舞
I wasn't stealing! I was looking at the dancer!

237
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,460
别想撒谎 把东西拿出来
Liar! Empty your pockets!

238
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,600
放开我
Get off me!

239
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,200
你想得美
Oh, yeah?

240
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,460
住手 放开她
Leave her alone.

241
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,510
她是个小偷
She came here to steal!

242
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,680
我不是 我没有偷东西
I didn't! I really didn't!

243
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,040
先想清楚
Think this through.

244
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,250
如果你指认她是小偷 那你得向院长解释一下
If you hurt her, then you will have to explain

245
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,200
她是怎么溜进来的
how she got here in the first place,

246
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,280
而你 守门人 那时到哪里去了
and aren't you supposed to be taking care of the building?

247
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,100
D你能承担起这个责任吗
o you really want to take the fall for this?

248
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,910
别挡路
Clear off.

249
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,840
等一下
Wait!

250
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,240
快走吧 离开这里
Go. Get out of here.

251
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,940
我可没什么让你偷
I have nothing to steal!

252
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,590
我这样 说不出话来
I-I can't sp... I can't speak!

253
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,250
我只是想说 谢谢你救我一命
I just wanted to say thank you for saving me!

254
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,080
你谢过了 好自为之吧
You've said it. Have a nice life.

255
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,700
请问 刚才跳舞的人是谁啊
Excuse me, but who was that dancer on stage?

256
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,260
罗西塔莫里 芭蕾舞明星
Rosita Mauri, top dancer at the Opera.

257
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:23,870
哇
Wow!

258
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,200
刚才她做出的那个惊人的跳跃 这是太美了
And what she did - that crazy jumpy thing, what was that?

259
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,280
你也是个舞蹈演员吗？
Are you a dancer too?

260
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,910
我只是个清洁工 你真的有点烦
I'm a cleaner, and you are an irritation.

261
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,720
别再跟着我了
Go away.

262
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,560
可您是在这儿第一个
But you're the first person

263
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,740
对我这么好的人
to show me any kindness in this city.

264
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,680
我和同伴走丢了
I've been separated from my best friend.

265
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,020
我现在无家可归
I have nowhere to go,

266
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,260
而且我是个孤儿 拜托
and I'm an orphan.

267
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,500
是很可怜 可我讨厌小孩儿
Nice try, but I hate kids,

268
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,660
尤其是孤儿
especially orphans.

269
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,700
给我让开
Go find another idiot.

270
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,320
擦楼梯去 奥黛特
The stairs, Odette.

271
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,950
它们脏兮兮的 丢我的脸
The stairs are a disgrace.

272
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,690
明天还有客人来呢
I have guests tomorrow afternoon,

273
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,200
我要你把房子彻底打扫得焕然一新 听见了吗
and I want my building looking worthy top to bottom.

274
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,200
是的 夫人
I understand, ma'am.

275
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,630
既然你听清了
If you understand,

276
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,640
打扫干净之前不准休息
why are you entering your rooms?

277
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,460
我来帮您吧
Let me help you!

278
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,820
别碍事
Get out of here!

279
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,550
但您需要我 帮您打扫
You need me. I can clean.

280
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,380
我可以打扫得非常干净
In fact, 'Squeaky Clean' is my middle name.

281
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,780
我还年轻 腿脚灵活 不像您一样…
I'm young. My legs work. Yours don't.

282
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,360
呃我是说 我可以帮您非常轻松地完成工作啊
Uh, it's gonna feel so much easier with me helping.

283
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,540
还要我请你进来吗
Are you coming?

284
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,780
哇 这儿台阶真多
Whoa! That's a lot of stairs.

285
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,850
您在这里工作吗
Are you the caretaker?

286
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,440
是的 你在能够独立生活之前 可以暂住在我这里
Yes. And you can stay with me until you get on your feet,

287
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,260
但有个条件 别再问问题了
On one condition -no more questions.

288
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,960
那我可以住多久呢
How long can I stay?

289
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,110

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,880
他是谁啊
Who is that?

430
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,540
你在开玩笑么
You are joking, right?

431
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,560
他就是梅拉特先生
It's Louis Merante,

432
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,660
芭蕾舞大师级人物
ballet master, world-famous choreographer,

433
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,840
他曾经在独舞中跳出了最恐怖的弗韦泰转
the man who performed the most fouettés ever in a single solo.

434
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,490
孚维泰…？
Fou-whats?

435
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,030
就是旋转啦 特别难的旋转
Turns. Really difficult turns.

436
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,100
一共转了一百八十七圈 据说他一下台就吐了
187 in total, and right after, he vomited!

437
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,790
安静 孩子们 单手扶把准备
Silence, mam'selle! First position!

438
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,090
嗯？
Uh...

439
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,130
二位
Second!

440
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,600
什么
What?

441
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,290
三位
Third!

442
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:04,780
呃
Uh...

443
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,130
四位 收五位
Fourth, and rest in fifth!

444
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,850
啊 哦
Huh? Oh!

445
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,190
我要宣布一件大事
Today is an important day.

446
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
孩子们 你们将有机会
I've gathered all the coryphées together

447
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,860
出演《胡桃夹子》中的克拉拉一角
to audition for the part of Clara in 'The Nutcracker',

448
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,080
并与罗西塔莫里在平安夜一同演出
which will debut on Christmas Eve and star Rosita Mauri.

449
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,930
罗西塔 罗西塔莫里
Rosita? Rosita Mauri?

450
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,790
太好了 我简直不敢相信
Oh, I don't believe it!

451
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,140
你们都有机会得到这个角色
So every girl in this room has a chance to dance in my new ballet

452
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,080
除了你
except you.

453
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,000
你们每个人都很努力
You've all worked hard

454
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,080
除了你
except you.

455
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,330
你们由于出众的天赋与勇气来到了我的教室
You are here because of talent and guts.

456
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,740
除了我
Except me.

457
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,660
知道就好
Exactly!

458
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,030
从明天开始 我们将会进行选拔
Starting tomorrow, we'll have an audition.

459
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,130
每天都会淘汰你们其中之一
One of you will be eliminated each day.

460
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,130
所以 大小姐
So, tomorrow, little rich girl,

461
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,930
不管你托了谁的关系
no matter what strings you pulled to get here,

462
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,490
明天要走的人 就是你
that will be you!

463
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,060
可是我们家有全巴黎最好吃的牛肋排
But my mother serves the best prime rib in Paris!

464
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,080
我是素食主义者
I am a vegetarian.

465
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,030
一位 二位 嗯二位
First, second. Second.

466
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,210
不对 二位 三位…
No, second, third.

467
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,970
三…三位？
Third? Third?

468
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,780
三位 四位
Third, fourth.

469
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,120
五位
Fifth? Fifth.

470
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,980
一位 二位…
First. Second.

471
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,430
你好啊
Hello!

472
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,440
三位…
Third. Third?

473
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,070
下午好
Bonjour!

474
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,700
五位 六位
Fifth, sixth.

475
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,130
见到你很高兴
How are you?

476
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,310
不对 根本没有六位啊
There is no sixth.

477
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,210
好吧 我也很高兴见到你
Well, I'm happy to see you too.

478
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,250
嗨 维克多
 Oh, Victor!

479
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,620
你好啊
Hello!

480
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,410
我有好多事要与你分享
I have so many things to tell you!

481
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,180
我也是
Me too.

482
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,960
这次可真是彻底坏了
Wow! This time, it's really broken.

483
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,730
你能修好它吗
Can you do something?

484
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,650
没问题 交给我吧
Don't worry, I've got it.

485
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,630
我可是在我们的小赌约里先拔头筹了
I am the winner of our little bet.

486
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,380
赌约？
What bet?

487
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,170
就是赌我们谁会先实现梦想啊
You know, the one about who gets their dream first.

488
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,330
我就要成为一名发明家啦
 I am going to be an inventor!

489
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:52,840
真的？
Really?

490
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,230
你就羡慕我吧
You're just jealous that, in 24 hours,

491
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,490
我还找到了一份工作 而我的老板就是建…这个的
I've got a job with the man who is building that!

492
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,200
你不是掉到船上时摔到脑袋了吧
Did you bump your head when you fell in the boat?

493
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,860
呵呵
Nope!

494
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,820
你一定想不到我昨天经历了什么
Yesterday, after you got separated,

495
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,410
昨天与你分开之后
I just took a quiet walk around the streets of Paris.

496
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,380
我感到非常轻松惬意 十分开心
It was all good, totally good.

497
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,330
完全没感到害怕
I was really not scared at all.

498
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,860
这里的人也很友善 总给我指路
I met some charming locals who helped me find my way.

499
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,110
最不可思议的是
And you will never believe this,

500
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,770
我走到了一间酒吧里
but then I stumbled on a Breton bar

501
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,150
那里的人都很友善 给了我一个大大的拥抱
  and I got a big, warm and friendly welcome.

502
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:25,740
他们像对待亲侄子…不对 亲儿子一样对待我
They welcomed me like a brother, a son, a nephew!

503
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,760
然后我就遇到了一个名叫马汀的家伙
And then I met this super guy called Mathurin.

504
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,480
我们有说有笑 又唱又跳
We talked, we laughed, we danced together,

505
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,060
我们就成了好哥们
and then my new best buddy and I

506
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,010
总之 玩够了我们就去他家了
decided to head home to his place.

507
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,410
更难以置信的是
And you are never, ever going to believe this

508
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,840
他的老板竟然就是古斯塔夫埃菲尔
but he works in the atelier of Gustave Eiffel,

509
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,530
一位绝无仅有的 慧眼独具的
the nicest, best

510
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,150
才华横溢的
and most magnetic inventor

511
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,090
世界上最伟大的发明家
in the whole world!

512
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,400
我做梦都想不到
I am going to be

513
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,950
我可以在这样一位世界闻名的工程师手下工作
the most famous engineer's right-hand man.

514
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,090
哦对了 我还会再想办法升级我的“鸡翼”
Oh, and I've gone back to square one with my chicken wings.

515
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,060
我现在正在研究纤维材质的空气集流系统
I am now working on combining air velocity with fibrous catchment systems.

516
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,740
也就是风筝
I'm trying a kite.

517
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,660
真棒啊 我也有了些进展
Wow! I made progress too!

518
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,200
比如说
Really?

519
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,450
我现在是巴黎歌剧院的学员 差不多算是吧
I'm a dancer. Yes! Yes! A student at the Opera.

520
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,800
马上我就会成为巴黎的芭蕾舞明星
And soon I'm going to be an étoile at the Opera de Paris.

521
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,150
你 现在是巴黎歌剧院的学员？
You, a dancer at the Opera?

522
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,260
是吗 那你跟我讲讲你是怎么混进去的
OK, and may I know how you came to be at the Opera?

523
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,800
走进去的啦 那里有灯光 还有…
By the door, I saw some lights and...

524
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,300
撒谎
Liar!

525
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,280
好吧 是卡米尔勒奥 就是她摔坏了我的音乐盒
OK! It's Camille Le Haut, the one who broke my music box.

526
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,940
还在撒谎
Liar!

527
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,500
她心存愧疚
She wanted to apologise

528
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,080
接着编啊
Liar!

529
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,790
先听我说完
Let me finish.

530
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,410
不听不听你撒谎
Liar, liar...

531
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,440
所以她想要把机会让给我
She gave me the letter that allowed her into the Opera.

532
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,100
你一撒谎 鼻子就会动
When you're lying, your nose shivers.

533
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,250
你真没劲
You're exhausting!

534
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,620
好吧 我冒充了她
I stole her identity.

535
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,040
什么 冒充别人 你是不是疯了
What? You stole it? Are you insane?

536
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,160
喔喔 哦不
Whoa! Whoa! Uh-oh!

537
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,160
啊～
Whoa!

538
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,950
维克多
Victor!

539
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,960
维克多 维克多
Victor! Victor!

540
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,290
啊
Whoa!

541
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,030
维克多
Victor!

542
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,670
你去哪儿 快回来
Come back! Don't leave!

543
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,480
我一定会回来的
I'll be back!

544
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,610

And to finish, the splits.

559
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,400
呃
Hmm?

560
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,510
现在 请起立
Now rise.

561
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,280
今天的课程结束了
The class is over,

562
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,760
宣布一下今天被淘汰的人 就是你
and the person who's leaving us today is you.

563
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,040
你很有热情与活力
You have the energy of a bullet,

564
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,640
可你的动作笨拙得像一头大象
but the lightness of a depressed elephant.

565
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,920
你现在可以走了
Pack your trunk!

566
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,270
呃～
Ahem!

567
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,970
请起立 孩子
Rise, please, mam'selle.

568
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,710
但是我觉得这样…还挺舒服的
But I like it here!

569
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,880
我说 请起立
Rise now!

570
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,130
我卡住了
I'm stuck!

571
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,920
送她去医院
Get her out of here.

572
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,360
您不是说一天只淘汰一个人的吗
Didn't you say one person per class?

573
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,480
好吧 今天你可以留下
Very well. Until the next audition.

574
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,540
但等到明天的课程结束 你一定会和我们说再见
Then it really will be bye-bye.

575
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,490
梅特拉先生讨厌我
Merante hates me.

576
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,890
别这么说 他对谁都这样
Don't say that. That's just his way.

577
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,040
不 他就是很讨厌你
No, she's right. He hates you.

578
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,220
他恨不得拿手杖敲碎你的膝盖骨
If he could, he'd smash your kneecaps with his cane.

579
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,960
我没机会了
Oh, I have no chance.

580
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,710
别这么说 机会永远都在
There's always a chance.

581
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,560
不一定
Not always.

582
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,670
有的时候你就是一点机会也没有
This might be one of those times there's no chance at all.

583
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,160
可我真的很想留下
But I really wanna stay here.

584
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,720
这样的话 你还有十二个小时可以练习 努力一下
Then you have 12 hours to work really hard, listen,

585
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,160
说不定会有进步呢
push yourself and then work some more.

586
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,360
这是谁啊
Who is that?

587
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:47,640
鲁迪 巴黎歌剧院芭蕾舞团最美颧骨奖得主
Rudi from the top boys class. Holder of the Best Cheekbones at the Opera award.

588
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,880
我喜欢她 看他那头阳光般的金发
I love him! He's so blond and shiny.

589
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,020
哦 哇
Oh, wow!

590
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,450
你就是新来的吗
Ooh! You are new, yes?

591
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,030
是啊
Yes.

592
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,340
她叫卡米尔 她有两只眼睛
he's Camille. She has two eyes.

593
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:22,910
呵 眼睛倒是挺有灵气的 可你的舞姿烂到没眼看
Ha! You have spirit, Camille, but your dancing sucks.

594
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,120
别和我抢！
It's mine!

595
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,280
他以为他是谁
Who does he think he is?

596
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,660
我们会再见面的 小美人
Until we meet again, Minoushka!

597
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,360
做梦去吧
Only in your dreams.

598
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,850
菲丽西
Felicie?

599
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,200
你为什么会在这
What are you doing here?

600
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,370
我可以解释
I can explain!

601
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,490
不必了
There is nothing to explain.

602
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,560
等等 别走
Wait! Wait!

603
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,280
真的对不起 我也不知道该怎样道歉才好
I'm sorry! Triple sorry.

604
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,760
真心感到抱歉
If there was a bigger word for 'sorry', I'd say it.

605
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,880
我收留你 你却用撒谎和冒名顶替来回报我
I let you into my life, and you lied to me.

606
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,380
我不喜欢撒谎的孩子
I don't like lies.

607
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,790
你会害我丢掉工作的
I could lose my job because of you.

608
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,990
真的对不起 我不该那样做的
I get it. I messed up.

609
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,050
我只是太渴望跳舞了
But you don't understand.

610
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,750
我从小就喜欢跳舞
Since I can remember, I've wanted to dance.

611
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,150
当我看到罗西塔莫里的舞姿时
And when I saw Rosita Mauri and she did those amazing moves,

612
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,080
我就知道我想成为她
I knew that's what I wanted to be.

613
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,020
想跳出像她那样优美而富有情感的舞蹈
I knew my dream could come true!

614
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,330
说起来您可能不信
I know it's hard to understand.

615
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,720
您不能再跳舞了
You hate dancing.

616
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,990
对此我真心感到惋惜
But I just want you to know I'm truly sorry.

617
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,120
信来了吗
Any mail?

618
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,500
没有信件 夫人
There is no mail.

619
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,350
信件一到 立刻送来
As soon as there is, fetch it.

620
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,880
你会跳舞吗
Can you dance?

621
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,130
会吧 我想还算会的
Yes. At least, I think I can.

622
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,880
明早五点开始训练
Training starts at 5am tomorrow.

623
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,410
您来教我吗
Are you a teacher?

624
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,540
你有的选吗
Do you have another option?

625
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,450
明早五点？
5am?

626
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,070
训练时间到
Time to train!

627
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,080
现在 跳起来摸这个铃铛
Jump and ring the bell!

628
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:17,980
摸它做什么？
Why?

629
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:18,760
按我说的做
Just do it.

630
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,040
你不是训练我跳舞的吗 ？
You don't want me to dance?

631
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,360
别问那么多 照做就是了
No talking. Jump and ring the bell!

632
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:26,820
再来
Again.

633
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,380
我们是要进行芭蕾训练的吧
You said we were going to train.

634
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,640
这就是 再来
This is it! Again!

635
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,220
嗯
Hmm!

636
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,460
哈哈
Ha!

637
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,960
菲丽西 你的动作毛躁毫无技巧可言
Felicie, you lack precision and finesse.

638
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,080
肢体协调性也不够
You have little or no sense of rhythm.

639
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,200
平衡感也有所欠缺 更别说优雅了
You're without balance, grace and charm.

640
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,490
不是吧 只跳两下就能看出这么多毛病 真的假的
Come on! You can't tell all that from one jump, can you?

641
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,500
好吧 你说的没错
You can.

642
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,530
你的优点是很有活力
On the good side, you have the energy of a bullet,

643
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,820
可你的动作却又笨拙得像头大象
but you also have the lightness of a depressed elephant.

644
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,810
天呐 梅特拉也这么说我 而且你们说的一字不差
Hey! Merante used exactly the same phrase!

645
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,140
毕竟在那里旁听多年 耳濡目染惯了
After 10 years of cleaning, you pick stuff up.

646
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,600
不说这个 现在跳起来摸铃铛
OK, now jump up, ring this bell,

647
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,970
落地时不许溅起水花
land and do not splash the water.

648
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,170
我怎么可能做到
But that's impossible.

649
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,880
你不去努力尝试 梦想永远无法实现
I thought it was your dream to dance.

650
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:09,790
好吧
OK!

651
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,530

Last time we met, I was so very rude.

686
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,140
自我介绍一下
Let me introduce myself.

687
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,640
我叫
I am

688
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,140
鲁道夫迪梅忒列夫斯坦尼斯拉夫阿列亚穆拉科夫斯基
Rudolph Dimitriev Stanislaw Artiem Rankovsky...

689
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,530
三世
..the Third.

690
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,530
你名字可真长
Big choice of names there.

691
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,280
别太担心 芭蕾之路并非易途
Don't worry.Everyone finds it hard at first.

692
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,320
可你我都是非凡的天才
But you and I are unique,

693
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:44,600
并不需要像普通人那样努力 不是吗
and we do not follow silly rules, yes?

694
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,890
哈 你这些花言巧语向来都很有用吧
How is that pick-up line working out for you?

695
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,640
你误会了 这些话我只会对你说 卡米尔
It is no line. I say it only to you, Camille.

696
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,240
只会对你说
Just to you.

697
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,530
跳吧
Et hop!

698
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,160
小心啊
Minoushka!

699
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,000
你没事吧
Uh, are you alright, Camille?

700
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,130
我没事
Yep! I'm OK!

701
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,640
那个叫鲁道夫的芭蕾舞演员
There's this boy, Rudolph, who, it turns out,

702
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,960
居然是俄罗斯王子
is a real Russian prince

703
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,810
他住在城堡里 养孔雀 有漂亮的高颧骨
with a castle and peacocks and cheekbones!

704
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,540
他带我去歌剧院屋顶
And he took me on the roof of the Opera,

705
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,130
然后这样看着我
and he was looking at me like this.

706
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,050
像这样
Then like this.

707
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,060
然后这样看着我
And then once like this.

708
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,630
等等 我有点乱 剧团里有男生 什么样的男生
Wait! Uh, a boy? What type of boy?

709
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,280
养孔雀 还有高颧骨
Peacocks? What type of cheekbones?

710
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,370
鲁道夫又是谁
And Rudolph?

711
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,430
他就是我的新朋友啊
He's a friend.

712
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,860
他说我一定会心想事成的
He says I'm gonna be everything I wanna be.

713
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,140
我也说过啊
I say that too!

714
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,880
可他说得特别深情
But he's deep as well.

715
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,960
好吧 深情…但 我有这个
Deep? Yeah, well, I have these.

716
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,560
哒嗒
Ta-da!

717
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,650
哦豁 你有扇铁门吗
Whoo-hoo. Doors.

718
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,290
没错 这扇门后就是埃菲尔先生的工作室
Yes, the doors to the atelier

719
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,120
他可真是个天才
of my new boss, engineer, genius.

720
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,080
要是你看到这门后的东西
If you saw what was behind these doors,

721
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,920
我就得杀你灭口…
I would have to kill you.

722
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,020
啊
Ahh!

723
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,630
糟糕 这下子你只有杀我灭口了
Looks like you're gonna have to kill me, then!

724
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,210
哦 我的天哪
Oh la la!

725
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,750
这是什么啊
What's that?

726
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,700
青春女神像
The Statue of Puberty,

727
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:24,940
它就要被运往美国
soon to go to America!

728
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,160
但这是一个大秘密
But it is a super secret,

729
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,840
所以你就当什么也没看过 明白吗
so you did not see it, OK?

730
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,080
好吧
OK.

731
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,270
这就是我的工作室
So, here's my office,

732
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,360
天才与伟大创意之家
the home of big ideas and genius.

733
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,690
比如说这个 这就是我设计的第三代“鸡翼”
For example, here we see the plans for chicken wings version 3.

734
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,590
啊～
Oh! Aaah! Ahem!

735
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,950
我和老板正在研究几项…
At the moment, my boss and I are working on several,

736
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,010
呃…重大发明
uh, important...inventions.

737
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,670
他…
He, uh, he...

738
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,800
他管我叫他的创意顾问
He calls me his ideas man.

739
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,720
这些设备你都会用吗
Do you know how to use all this stuff?

740
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,760
不全会 可我有 办公椅
Uh, not yet, but I... I have a chair!

741
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,600
喔 喔 喔
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

742
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,240
哈哈
Ha!

743
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,950
早 维克多
Oh, hey, Victor!

744
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,920
他管这儿的卫生
He's the cleaner.

745
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,660
两块三明治摞起来也高过他
He's two sandwiches short of a picnic.

746
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,080
老板要我们削好铅笔
So the pencils all need sharpening,

747
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,170
还有擦干净他明天要穿的靴子
and the boss wants us to polish his boots for tomorrow.

748
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,220
所以你的老板让他的“创意顾问”干这活儿？
So, your big boss calls you his ideas man, huh?

749
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,170
呃 现在是他负责给出创意
Well, uh, he... he has the ideas,

750
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,710
而我只负责叫好
and I think they're great.

751
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,640
但这只是个开始而已
But it's a start!

752
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,730
但你说的没错 维克多
Hey, Victor, you were right for once.

753
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,200
梦想终究会成真的
Dreams can come true!

754
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,010
哦…噢…哦不
Oh! Oh! Oh no!

755
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,260
一位…二位
First position, second,

756
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,040
三位…四位…五位
third, fourth, fifth.

757
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,010
这五种站法就是一切的基础
These five positions form the basis of everything.

758
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:57,450
一位 二位 三位 四位 五位
First position, second, third, fourth, fifth.

759
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,380
小跳
Now you jump.

760
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,440
一位 二位 三位 四位 五位
First position, second, third, fourth, fifth.

761
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,000
保持住 微笑
And pose and smile!

762
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,920
如果你感到累了 那说明你有进步
It's when you're tired that you start to progress.

763
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,150
你以前…就是…芭蕾舞演员 是不是？
You were a dancer, weren't you?

764
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,210
不许问东问西
No more questions.

765
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:14,920
再来
Again!

766
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,310
哎呀呀 够不到吧 你得踮起脚尖才能晾上去
Oh, to reach, you might need to stand on your pointes.

767
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,560
找到那个平衡点
Feel the balance.

768
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,710
你的脚趾 就如柳条般柔美
Your toes must be as flexible as willow

769
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,120
又像顽石般坚韧
and hard as a rock.

770
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,760
一位准备！
First position!

771
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,610
不不不 可不能用手擦
Uh-uh-uh! No hands allowed.

772
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:44,870
什么
What?

773
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,580
试试…这样擦
Try this way.

774
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,310
疼疼疼 要断了啊～
Oh! Stop! Stop! Oh!

775
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,050
你以前就是练过跳舞 对不对
You were a dancer, weren't you?

776
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,760
你说的没错 满意了吗 小侦探
Of course I was a dancer, Sherlock Holmes.

777
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,250
旋转就是控制眩晕感的方法
To pirouette, you must become the mistress of your dizziness.

778
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,740
你得盯住一个点旋转 别转晕了
Stare at a spot, and don't ever lose it.

779
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,470
好的 现在走向我 别让水洒出来
OK, now come to me, and don't spill the water.

780
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,440
哦～～～
Whoa!

781
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,670

00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,870
谢谢 孩子们
Thank you, mam'selles.

795
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,080
你进步很大
That was... better!

796
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,090
谢谢
Thanks!

797
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,400
我觉得我可以做那个惊人的跳跃动作了
I'm ready to do that crazy, jumpy thing.

798
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,600
可不是吗 我也觉得我可以加冕为后了
And I'm the Empress Josephine.

799
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,160
我没在开玩笑啊
I am!

800
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,560
绝对不行
Of course you are,

801
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,120
能做和能做好是两码事
but there's a difference between being ready and being ready to do it well.

802
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,480
我们每天练习就是为了做好它
That's why we train every day.

803
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,080
我们的确每天都有练习啊
That's all we've been doing!

804
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,830
想做那个动作 那你先要面对一个问题
And then you'll be ready when you can answer the question,

805
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,870
你为什么要跳舞呢
"Why do you dance?"

806
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,760
我说过啊 那是我的梦想
I've answered it! It's my dream!

807
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,250
哦
Oh! Oh!

808
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,700
啊～
Ow! Ow!

809
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:49,420
唉
Oh!

810
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,200
我的小姑娘啊 那个惊人的动作叫做“大跳”
By the way, that crazy jumpy thing is called le grand jeté,

811
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:55,720
以你现在的水准还欠些火候呢
and you're not ready.

812
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,360
你是在练功夫吗 刚才那一招叫什么
Are you doing dance or kung-fu?

813
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,460
一点儿也不好笑
You are SO funny.

814
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,720
这是维克多 我们一起从孤儿院逃出来的
This is Victor. We escaped from the orphanage together.

815
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,980
贵安 美丽的女士 这套裙衬得您清丽脱俗
Hello! I am loving your apron.

816
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:12,280
那么说 你们晚上要出去玩咯
It seems that you are going out tonight.

817
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:12,910
没错
Yep!

818
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:16,200
她要是回来晚了 我会让你的个头再矮上几寸
Bring her back late and you will be six inches smaller.

819
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,810
我们不会玩太晚的 只是出去随便逛逛
Of course, of course, of course!

820
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:22,970
绝不沾酒 真的
It's a quiet, sober, quiet, sober thing.

821
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,980
布列塔尼的音乐 太棒了
Breton music?Whoa!

822
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,120
噢 抱歉
Whoa! Excuse me!

823
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,220
我好喜欢这音乐啊
 I love it here! Whoo!

824
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,900
一起跳吧！
Let's party!

825
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,800
你是喜欢这间酒吧 还是喜欢我
Did you say you loved me or the bar?

826
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,160
耶～～～
Yeah! Whoo!

827
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,230
哇
Whoa!

828
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,350
太赞了
Wow!

829
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,010
哇哦
Whoo!

830

That's my girlfriend!

831
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,730
你可真走运 小子 哈哈
You're a lucky guy!

832
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,600

833
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,400
哦呜
Oh! Oh!

834
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,930
希望明天上课时 你能稍微优雅一点
I hope that tomorrow you act with a little more dignity.

835
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,000
不过今晚的演出…倒是很不错
Anyway, tonight was...a good performance.

836
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,440
谢谢您
Thank you, sir.

837
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,750
啦啦啦
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

838
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:09,820
我不知道你为什么这么开心 但是这样很不错
I have no idea why you're happy, but it is great!

839
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,920
好了 我得回去了
Well, I'd better go in.

840
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,200
我明天就可以去测试了
I've got my audition tomorrow.

841
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:26,060
好极了 那你睡个好觉 我…
Of course! Sleep well. And I... I...

842
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,040

843
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,900

844
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,070
我觉得你很棒
I think you're great.

845
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:34,520
谢谢
Thanks.

846
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,270
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

847
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,960
额 没什么
Uh, oh, nothing!

848
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:47,670
我在做伸展运动
I'm stretching.

849
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,840
嗯没错 再做一个
Yeah, gotta...Ooh, gotta get that one!

850
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,320
嗯…我觉得我是时候走了
OK! Yeah, it's best I leave.

851
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,480
蠢透了，蠢透了，蠢透了
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

852
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,980
嘿 维克多
Hey, Victor!

853
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,960
怎么了
Uh-huh?

854
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,990
我今天玩得很开心
I had the best time.

855
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,910
谢谢你 晚安 菲丽西
Thanks! Goodnight, Felicie.

856
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,980
哦 抱歉 是尊贵的卡米尔小姐
Oh, sorry. Mademoiselle Camille Le Haut.

857
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,290
真是可怜
Wretch!

858
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,470
我要把她送进监狱
I want her put in prison!

859
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:38,430
她偷了我的生活 我的荣耀 我的名字
She stole my life, my honour and my name!

860
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,190
现在我要夺回来
I want it back!

861
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:43,420
有点过了
Too much.

862
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,040
我知道了
OK.

863
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,070
你叫什么名字
What is your name?

864
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,870
我叫菲丽西
My name is Felicie Lebras.

865
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,860
我来自布列塔尼地区的一个孤儿院
I come from an orphanage in Brittany.

866
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,130
我并不是故意冒充卡米尔的
I didn't mean to hurt Camille.

867
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,280
我只是想在这儿…
I just wanted to be at the Opera and...

868
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,810
对不起
I'm sorry.

869
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,290
夫人
Madame...

870
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,530
你这个叛徒
You traitor!

871
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,200
你竟然知道这件事
You knew this!

872
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,000
原来是你在背后捅刀子
You stabbed me in the back!

873
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,240
你会被开除的
You are sacked!

874
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:17,000
不要吵了
Silence!

875
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,320
好了 不喜欢就憋着 这儿我说了算
Alright, like it or lump it, here is my deal.

876
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,240
勒奥女士
Miss Le Haut,

877
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:26,870
卡米尔明天可以进班练习
you may enter the coryphée class starting tomorrow.

878
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:30,250
也可以参加《胡桃夹子》的试镜
And you will also be in the auditions for the part in 'The Nutcracker'.

879
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,360
但是我得说清楚
But I want to be clear,

880
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,500
如果你解雇奥黛特女士 我就解雇卡米尔
if you sack Madame Odette, I will sack Camille.

881
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,490
你！
You!

882
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:40,250
你给这个班开了个坏头
You made a terrible start to the classes,

883
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,390
你已经欺骗了我们
and you have lied and cheated to be here.

884
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:48,270
但你同时也做了很好的承诺
But you have also shown great promise,

885
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:51,420
你也很努力的奉献了那么多
and you've worked hard and shown your dedication.

886
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,850
你应该有一个好老师才行
You must have a good teacher.

887
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,370
所以你也可以来试镜
So you may also stay in the auditions.

888
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,760
如果你能公平公正的成功试镜
If you get the part in 'The Nutcracker' fair and square,

889
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,240
你也可以拥有一个芭蕾舞的重要角色
you may become a coryphée too.

890
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,800
如果你失败了 那你必须离开
If you fail to get the part, then you must leave the Opera.

891
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,360
明白了吗
Is that clear?

892
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,460
明白了
Yes.

893
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,150
你也听清楚了吗 女士
Is that also clear to you, madame?

894
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,790
清楚了
Clear.

895
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,000
来自孤儿院的菲丽西
Then, Felicie Lebras from Brittany,

896
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,700
你的未来掌握在你的手里
your future at the Opera is in your hands.

897
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,020
哼
Hmm!

898
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,870
要是她做到了怎么办 妈妈？
What if she's good, Mother?

899
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,210
你必须夺得那个角色 懂了吗
Get that part, do you hear me?

900
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,040
我要复仇
I want vengeance.

901
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,730
把属于我的东西夺回来
I will have it.

902
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,750
她连扫地都那么优雅
She even makes sweeping look graceful.

903
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,920
她是个很好的舞者 不是吗
She was a good dancer, wasn't she?

904
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,930
她不只是一个很好的舞者 她是这一代最好的舞者
Not just a good dancer. The best of her generation.

905
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,810
她是舞台上的一团火
And then there was a fire onstage.

906
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,410
哦
Oh!

907
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,670
这是为什么
What's this for?

908
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:11,550
为你所做的一切
For everything!

909
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,680
我们可没时间做这些
We don't have time for this.

910
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,080
我们得考虑你的未来
We're talking about your future now.

911
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:21,150
你只有一个对手 卡米尔
You have only one opponent  Camille.

912
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,170
我见过她跳舞 我知道
I have seen her.I know her.

913
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,220
她的舞技堪称完美
Her technique is perfect,

914
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,280
而且她比我们所看到的还要厉害
and she is stronger than she looks.

915
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,970
她精准而又敏锐
She is precise, she is sharp,

916
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,520
她的字典里没有“输”这个字
and losing is not a word in her vocabulary.

917
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,110
上，下，上，下
Up, down! Up, down!

918
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,610
上，下 再来一次
Up, down! Again!

919
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,000
上，下
Up, down!

920
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,240
我累了
I'm tired.

921
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:46,250
“累”只属于失败者
'Tired' is for losers!

922
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,360
再来一次 我一定要夺得那个角色
Again! I am going to get that part!

923
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:53,360
如果你想和她正面对决 那你现在就输定了
If you try to take her down on her turf, you will fail.

924
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,530
你吃得少 营养跟不上
Your diet suffers from eating very little food.

925
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,710
肌肉就没有爆发力
Your muscles are like marshmallows.

926
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,570
就目前而言 理论上你很难取胜
In short, on paper, you're going to get humiliated.

927
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,520
真会安慰人 那我凭什么去赢她啊？
Great pep talk! So, how do I get that part?

928
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,320
你能行 你拥有她梦寐以求的一片拼图
You get the part because you have something she can only dream of

929
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:14,520
那就是热情
passion!

930
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,300
以它为基础
Build on this.

931
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:28,410
感受愤怒 欢快 悲伤
Feel your anger and your pain and your sorrow and your joy,

932
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,410
将它尽情融入进你的舞蹈中
and put it all into your dance.

933
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,800
感受音乐的生命力
Live the music, feel it.

934
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,160
每个音符 每段旋律 每首曲子
Every note, every sound, every harmony

935
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,260
都会带动你的身心随之起舞
needs to have your body vibrating

936
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,050
都会带动你的身心随之起舞
from the end of your hair to the tips of your toes.

937
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:50,540
到那时 只有到那时 你才有资格胜过她
And then, and only then, will you take her down.

938
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,520
好了 今天要离开的人是
Alright! The person leaving us today is...

939
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:10,970
嗯～～～
Ahem!

940
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:14,960
哼
Hmm!

941
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,800
诺拉小姐 这条路你走到头了
This is the end of the road, Miss Nora.

942
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:24,680
什么路 哦 我被淘汰了 加油 打败她
What road? Oh, I'm finished. I like you. Beat her.

943
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,730
卡米尔和菲丽西 明早八点
Camille and Felicie, tomorrow morning at 8:00am,

944
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,480
我们就会知道你们中的哪一位
we will know which one of you will have the honour

945
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,840
将会成为克拉拉 与罗西塔莫里一起出演胡桃夹子
of dancing Clara in 'The Nutcracker' with Rosita.

946
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,490
希望明天你们可以展现最好的水准
I can only advise you to give everything, ladies.

947
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,110
你的确进步了不少 脏兮兮的小耗子
You've made lots of progress, dirty, little rat,

948
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:45,040
但明天他们绝对会选我
but tomorrow I am going to be the chosen one.

949
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,130
我看未必
We'll see.

950
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,060
那就放马过来 你整夜练习都没关系
You can work as hard as you like, you can train 24 hours a day,

951
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,420
你永远什么都不是
but you will always be nothing!

952
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:53,800
我是有身份的人
 I am somebody.

953
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,530
有身份是吗 那请你告诉我 你有什么身份
Who exactly? Answer me! Who are you?

954
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,070
你一无是处
You're nothing!

955
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,770
就是个冒名顶替的小耗子
Nothing!

956
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,160
是她错了 知道吗
She's wrong, you know.

957
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:11,800
你并不孤单
You're not alone.

958
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:12,240
什么
What?

959
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,900
你还有我呢
You have me.

960
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,390
我们今晚需要做点什么
And I know exactly what we are going to do.

961
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,320
来证明我们心有灵犀
Tonight, to prove our connection,

962
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,380
那就是一场浪漫的约会
we will embark on a little romantic party.

963
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:31,120
我们今晚七点 一起登上埃菲尔铁塔观看烟花
I offer you the Eiffel Tower. I offer you fireworks. Tonight, 7:00pm

964
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,000
不行 我还得练习呢
I should train.

965
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,950
你不用练习
You don't need to train.

966
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,480
更不用在意你的身份
You don't need to know who you are.

967
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,740
你是独一无二的
You are unique.

968
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,310
再说一次给我听
Say that again?

969
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:41,130
晚上见
Tonight.

970
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:46,320
菲丽西 我郑重其事地把它送给你
Felicie, it gives me great pleasure to present to you...

971
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,160
哦不对
No!

972
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:55,580
维克多 我进了最后一轮选拔
Victor! I'm in the final audition!

973
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,660
真的吗 恭喜啊
Wow! Congratulations!

974
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,840
我也有个好消息 老板终于和我说话了
I have great news too. My boss finally spoke to me!

975
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:04,480
他说“别再踩我的脚了 你这个讨人厌的小怪胎”
He said, "Get off my foot, you biological mutation!"

976
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,660
是不是挺好
That's good, right?

977
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,130
呃 你可真没品味
Ugh! You have no class.

978
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,440
你怎么就知道我没品味
What, me? No class?

979
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:14,730
鲁迪就有品位
Rudi has class.

980
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,270
又是他
Rudi again?

981
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:18,670
怎么 他现在是你的男朋友了吗
What, is he your boyfriend now?

982
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:22,990
不 但我们…心有灵犀
No! He and I, we're connected.

983
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:28,840
好好好 我给你品味 还有你要的心有灵犀
OK, OK. You win! I'll give you class and connectivity-ness.

984
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:30,510
我约你吃晚餐
Dinner! You and me.

985
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,260
我们手持刀啊叉啊 还有餐巾纸什么的
Some knives and forks, napkins.

986
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:36,640
就今晚七点 埃菲尔铁塔北侧
Uh, 7:00pm, north leg of the Eiffel Tower.

987
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,660
这就算答应了吗
Is that a yes?

988
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,390
是啊 她肯定答应了
Yeah. That's a yes.

989
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:48,620
坐 我给你看个宝贝
Sit! I've got something for you.

990
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,830
这是我以前的舞鞋 现在它属于你了
They were mine. Now they're yours.

991
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,800
哇哦 谢谢
Wow! Thanks.

992
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,210
不用谢 快吃饭吧 然后我们去训练
OK, enough talking. Eat, and then we practice for tomorrow.

993
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,340
怎么了？
What?

994
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,000
呃 鲁迪约我出去
Well, I'm going out with Rudi.

995
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,240
他说我是独一无二的 没必要再练习了
He says I'm ready. He says I'm unique.

996
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,080
你为什么要跳舞呢
Why do you dance?

997
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:16,490
别问了好吗
Stop asking me that question!

998
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,950
我还是舞蹈演员的时候 在演出之前训练也从不间断
When I was a dancer, the night before an audition, I trained and then I rested.

999
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,710
鲁迪还在等我呢
Rudi's waiting for me.

1000
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:24,200
别去了
Stay!

1001
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,120
才不要 你又不是我妈妈
No! You're not my mom!

1002
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,120
对不起
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

1003
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,000
算了 你去吧
OK. Go, then.

1004
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,090
你看看那飞鸟
Look at the bird.

1005
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,060
额…
Um...

1006
00:58:58,090 --> 00:58:59,770
再看看我
Now Look at me.

1007
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,260
看那飞鸟
Look at the bird.

1008
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,840
不 再看看我
No! Hmm? Look at me.

1009
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,410
这是我特意为你写的一首诗
This is a poem I composed in your honour.

1010
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,160
噢 当然了 一首诗
Ah, of course, a poem.

1011
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,710
看啊 那飞鸟 翱翔于云天之上
"Look at the bird! He flies in the sky.“

1012
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,150
来去无踪 身心自由
"No-one can trap him."

1013
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:21,450
咕 咕咕 咕咕咕
 Coco-co-cocococo

1014
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,380
你喜欢吗
Do you like?

1015
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:27,120
这首诗 是挺特别的…
That's, uh...well, original.

1016
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,300
我就知道你会喜欢 来吧 小美人 我们走
I know. Thank you. Come on, Minoushka!

1017
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:33,660
去塔顶摘星星咯
Let us go to the very top! To the stars!

1018
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,510
好了 马汀 我们排练一遍
OK, Matty, we practise.

1019
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,320
音乐起 古典音乐
Music, please! Classical!

1020
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,920
好吧 可我不怎么擅长古典音乐
OK, but that's not my musical comfort zone.

1021
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,440
喔 快停下 不行不行
Oh, stop! Stop, stop, stop!

1022
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:51,160
还是乡村音乐吧 不过要轻柔浪漫
We'll go Breton, but soft and romantic.

1023
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,720
一定要震撼到她
This will blow her away.

1024
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,440
等她来了 一定喜出望外
She arrives, she giggles.

1025
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,420
而我则深沉又神秘地拿出音乐盒
I am looking dark and mysterious. I give her the music box.

1026
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:03,530
她一定会这样 哦～人家好感动啊～
She's... "Oh! Oh!" Overwhelmed!

1027
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,400
我不是很了解女孩子
Uh, I don't know much about girls.

1028
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,000
应该说我完全搞不懂她们
Frankly, they are a mystery to me.

1029
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,010
但我很确定她今晚不会来了
But I do know that this one's not coming.

1030
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:15,660
你还太小还不明白 她一定会来的
Young, innocent fool! Of course she will come!

1031
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,780
我已经闻到了她的香水味
I can already smell her perfume.

1032
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,160
哦 不
Oh, no!

1033
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,000
是乞丐啊 恶！
Oh, beggars! Ugh!

1034
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:31,200
巴黎怎么到处都是这种人 恶心
Paris is infested with beggars! Yuck!

1035
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:31,960
但是…
But...

1036
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,580
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

1037
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:32,910
但我…
But...

1038
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,570
你别说话
Quiet! Follow me.

1039
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:40,680
我根据哥萨克舞蹈中的动作 自创了一套拳法
Have no fear, I have developed a fighting technique based on Cossack dancing.

1040
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,250
你别胡闹了
Don't be ridiculous!

1041
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,460
好了 够了 听我说 他是我的朋友
OK, stop right there! He's my friend!

1042
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,590
你在开玩笑么
Oh, is this some kind of joke?

1043
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:53,200
不 他叫维克多 我们从小就认识
No! This is Victor. We grew up together.

1044
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,630
天呐 你成功逗笑了我
Oh, my! This is funny.

1045
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:56,670
朋友 哈？
Friends, huh?

1046
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:59,240
只是朋友的话 你怎么一脸羞愧
If we're friends, why are you looking so ashamed?

1047
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:00,990
我没有一脸羞愧啊
I'm not looking ashamed.

1048
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:05,200
明明就有 你真让我失望 菲丽西
Oh, yes, you are! I feel sorry for you, Felicie.

1049
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,300
哦 你在妒忌
Oh! You're jealous.

1050
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,490
才没有 你进巴黎歌剧院到底想干嘛
No! Ever since you started at the Opera, who are you trying to be?

1051
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,540
就为了和这个一身毛的大蒜苗鬼混吗
Mixing with this big, hairy asparagus?

1052
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,140
你真可悲
You're so sad.

1053
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:20,170
喔喔喔 矮矬穷
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1054
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:24,300
我只要动动手指就能把你打晕
I could knock you out with one flick of my tiny finger,

1055
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:28,250
可这样会弄脏我的手指 洗都洗不干净
but that would make my finger dirty and smelly.

1056
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:32,730
我是很脏没错 可是我从来不穿娘炮才穿的紧身裤
So, I'm dirty, but at least I don't spend my day in tights!

1057
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,800
你们不要闹了
I can't believe this!

1058
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,380
她是我的女神
She is my muse.

1059
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:39,710
是吗 那她也是我的女神
Yeah, well, she is my whatever-you-just-said, too,

1060
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,700
我们先认识的 你这个大蒜苗
with knobs on, asparagus!

1061
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:46,800
住手
Stop!

1062
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,540
你们两个白痴
You're both idiots!

1063
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:58,120
好吧 那再会了
OK. Well, goodbye, then.

1064
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:01,180
再见
Well, goodbye.

1065
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,210
这招可真够阴险的
That is so low!

1066
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:06,800
噢 糟了 最后一轮选拔
Oh, no! The audition!

1067
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,680
我敢保证这次的…
I'm sure this...

1068
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,580
看着点儿
Watch it!

1069
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:18,540
《胡桃夹子》的演出肯定…
..production of 'Nutcracker' is going to...

1070
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:19,150
借过
Excuse me!

1071
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,740
嘿
Hey!

1072
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,560
好极了 堪称完美
Bravo! Bravo!

1073
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,160
谢谢你的表演 卡米尔小姐
Thank you, mademoiselle.

1074
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:40,000
那位还没来 看来没必要再比了
The orphan is late. It's over.

1075
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,860
好吧 既然菲丽西不想来
Well, as Felicie did not deign to show up for the audition,

1076
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,420
那么就让卡米尔和罗西塔一同登台
it is Camille who will dance with Rosita.

1077
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,440
等等 等等 请等一下 我来了
Wait! Wait! I'm here!

1078
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,080
求求您 让我跳吧
Please, please let me dance.

1079
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,410
已经太迟了 你不懂规矩吗
It's over! Don't you understand?

1080
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,270
请您 坐下
Sit down!

1081
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:59,040
我…我很抱歉
I-I apologise.

1082
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:00,220
你睡过头了？
Did you sleep?

1083
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:02,250
也不是
Not much.

1084
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,740
那昨晚训练了吗
Did you train yesterday?

1085
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:05,900
没有
No.

1086
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:07,020
为什么
Why?

1087
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,340
音乐 起
Alright, music!

1088
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:24,540
哼
Hmm!

1089
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,680
再来一遍
Start again.

1090
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,700
这不合规矩
She fell! She's eliminated!

1091
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,670
我说 再来一遍
Start again!

1092
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,590
我们有言在先
You remember our deal?

1093
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:58,990
卡米尔 《胡桃夹子》中的克拉拉由你出演
Camille, you will have the honour of dancing Clara in 'The Nutcracker'.

1094
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,650
你以为这样就算完了吗 小耗子
Did you think it would end here, little rat?

1095
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:19,280
不 放开我 不要
No! Let me go! No!

1096
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,090
哦 不
Oh, no!

1097
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,740
别走 别走
Please! Please!

1098
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,330
奥黛特 不
Odette! No!

1099
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:29,950
奥黛特
Odette!

1100
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,290
菲丽西
Felicie!

1101
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,240
真可怜 你们再也没法见面了吧
You will never see her again.

1102
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:37,660
当然 你也该走人了
And, of course, you're sacked.

1103
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:59,450
立正
Stop!

1104
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,090
菲丽西这次又去哪儿了
Where is Felicie?

1105
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,400
咳
Ahem!

1106
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:10,300
我在这儿
I'm here.

1107
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:14,840
喔 哦 好吧 很好
Oh! Well, uh, good.

1108
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,160
看她的样子好像丢了魂一样
She's lost her spirit.

1109
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,130
得得得 打起精神来 你帮过什么忙
Tut-tut-tut! Pull yourself together, you big fool!

1110
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,670
我知道你在想维克多去哪儿了 我也很想他
I know. I miss him too.

我是想逃跑没错
OK, I was escaping,

1133
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,600
可又被您捉到了 我真傻
but it's stupid, and you caught me.

1134
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,760
真是对不起 我马上回房间去
So, a big sorry to you, and I'll just go back to the dorm.

1135
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,090
跟我来 快点儿
This way, quick!

1136
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:16,750
嗯？
Huh?

1137
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:24,430
喔～～～
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

1138
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,090
谢谢您
Thank you!

1139
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:02,680
快去吧
Go now.

1140
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:19,710
我来帮您吧
Let me help you.

1141
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,950
您需要我 我会打扫
You need me. I can clean.

1142
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:31,290
我可以打扫得非常干净
'Squeaky Clean' is my middle name.

1143
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:35,980
不 是我需要您
In fact, I need you.

1144
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:37,920
我再也不想离开您了
I wanna stay with you.

1145
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,880
对不起 我好想您
I'm so sorry! I really missed you!

1146
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:58,240
我也是
Me too.

1147
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:02,990
来吧
Come on.

1148
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,910
莫里小姐把阁楼的房间安排给我了
Merante has given me a room in the attic.

1149
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,910
有个角落可以留给你
There's a little corner for you.

1150
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,940
我们早晨六点开始工作 午休时间一小时
Work starts at 6:00am. One hour for lunch.

1151
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,010
早晨六点？
6:00am?

1152
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,480
我发誓 他不在这儿
I promise, he is not here.

1153
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,060
那他什么时候回来呢 拜托
Do you know when he's coming back? Please!

1154
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,270
好吧 那…
Well, actually...

1155
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:27,870
噢
Ow!

1156
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,320
不 我不知道
Nope! I don't know that.

1157
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,120
那好吧
So...

1158
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:41,340
请帮我转告他 对不起
Will you please tell him that I'm sorry?

1159
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,640
我不该那样对待他
I've been unkind and foolish

1160
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:48,160
那样做真的太蠢了 太不知好歹了
and silly and stupid.

1161
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:49,180
也很无礼
And rude.

1162
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,750
没错也很无礼
And rude.

1163
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:55,000
告诉他我们是最好的朋友 永远都是
Tell Victor that he's my best friend ever.

1164
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:58,220
哦…呃…
Oh! Uh...

1165
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,680
那是我的第三只手
That's my other hand.

1166
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,100
我有三只手 没毛病
I have three hands, actually.

1167
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:16,880
谢谢
Thank you.

1168
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:18,500
不客气
You're welcome.

1169
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,270
你走吧
Goodbye, then.

1170
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:22,510
再见 维克多
Bye, Victor.

1171
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,940
那不是他 他真的出去了
That wasn't him. He is not here.

1172
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:30,040
真看不出来维克多还有这样的本事
Victor has worked a miracle! Who'd have thought?

1173
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,430
他看起来傻兮兮的
He just has the look of a total nitwit.

1174
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,260
他再也不会理我了
He doesn't wanna speak to me ever again.

1175
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,200
他会的
He will.

1176
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,120
不对 不对 不对
No, no, no!

1177
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,440
又来了
Here we go!

1178
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:42,680
停！ 毫无内涵
Stop! As cold as lard!

1179
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,880
勒奥小姐 公演在即
Miss Le Haut, you perform tonight

1180
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,790
为什么我在你的舞姿中看不到一丝丝的感情
and so far, we have no emotion!

1181
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,010
可是我每个动作都符合您的技术标准啊
But I'm doing exactly the steps you told me.

1182
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,520
我没有在跟你谈技巧
It's not enough to do the steps.

1183
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:00,670
你的舞蹈里 愤怒 欢快 悲伤 一样都没有
Find some anger or some pain or some love, but find something!

1184
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,120
她缺的就是这个 今晚见分晓
She lacks this. Tonight will make that clear.

1185
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:10,590
好了 你继续看吧 我去打扫别的地方了
OK, I'm going to do the stairs in the lobby. You can finish here.

1186
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,160
好的
OK.

1187
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,760
干嘛 还给我
Leave it. Give it back.

1188
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,150
我真傻 第一次丢的时候干嘛不用点劲儿呢
Silly me! I didn't throw it hard enough the first time.

1189
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:37,340
同样的错误 别再犯第二回
Don't make the same mistake.

1190
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:43,290
你这就走了？是怕被我羞辱吗？
Why are you leaving? Scared of being humiliated?

1191
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,180
我想你还需要多练练
Looks like you need more training.

1192
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,560
这一字马你开的挺吃力吧
You are nowhere near ready.

1193
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,870
是时候让你见识见识科班出身的专业芭蕾舞演员了
I'm going to show you what a real dancer looks like.

1194
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:54,880
哦哈 原来你是专业芭蕾舞演员啊
Are you sure about that?

1195
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:55,560
闭嘴
Quiet!

1196
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,740
今晚台下将坐满观众
Tonight these seats will be full.

1197
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,710
他们都会为我的演出倾倒 崇拜我
Paris will be looking at me, adoring me!

1198
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:02,940
我看未必
Or not.

1199
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,800
我说过了
I already told you!

1200
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:08,790
你谁也不是 小耗子 你成不了什么角儿
You are nothing. You will always be nothing!

1201
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,280
那只有试过才知道
Only one way to find out.

1202
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:14,760

01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,270
两位都跳得不错
Impressive, ladies.

1221
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:32,440
但我还有个问题要问你们
But let me ask you both an important question.

1222
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,280
你们为什么要跳舞呢
Why do you dance?

1223
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:42,280
我跳舞是因为…是因为…因为…
I dance because... I dance because... because...

1224
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,030
我妈逼我的
..my mother makes me.

1225
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:51,150
因为跳舞一直是我的梦想 是生命的一部分
Because it's always been a part of my life.

1226
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:54,300
我还在襁褓中就和妈妈一起跳舞
It was there with my mom when I was a baby,

1227
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,960
而现在我有了奥黛特
and it's here now, thanks to Odette.

1228
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:01,920
我爱跳舞 舞蹈让我的人生有了意义
It allows me to live, to be myself.

1229
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,020
让她跳好了
She should dance.

1230
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:10,360
勒奥小姐 你既诚实又勇敢
That was very honest, Miss Le Haut, and brave.

1231
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,960
若你仍愿意留在我的剧团里 我将非常欢迎
You have a future at the Opera, if you wish it.

1232
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:18,600
菲丽西 今晚的《胡桃夹子》将由你来演
Felicie, tonight, you dance 'The Nutcracker'.

1233
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:22,950
恭喜你了
Great job.

1234
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,090
做的太棒了 我的小甜心们
Well done, my sweetness!

1235
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,060
精彩绝伦
OK. Bravo, bravo. Oh, bravo!

1236
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,630
太好了
Yes! Yes!

1237
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:46,860
完成了
Voilà!

1238
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:50,270
这就是第三代“鸡翼”
I call them Pigeon Wings! -

1239
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,870
哇 真棒
Wow! Great!

1240
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:54,350
不过我不是很想试用它
But I'm not sure I want to test them.

1241
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:56,370
有点冒险精神好不好 马汀
Live dangerously, Matty!

1242
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:59,900
我可以向你保证它能基本正常地运行
I promise you they will almost certainly work.

1243
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,240
哦～
Oh!

1244
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,370
这下可好了
This is nice!

1245
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,790
马汀 给我们挪挪地方好吗
Matty, can you give us some privacy?

1246
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:07,280
什么时候？
When?

1247
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,150
马汀 出去啦
Matty, privacy!

1248
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,120
噢 这就出去
Oh, now. OK!

1249
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,080
我今晚在歌剧院演出
I'm dancing tonight at the Opera.

1250
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:20,520
我希望你能来看
I want you to be there.

1251
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,290
真的吗
Really?

1252
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:22,750
没错
Really.

1253
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:28,160
菲丽西 我喜欢你
I like you, Felicie.

1254
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:32,200
你现在搞得我哭笑不得 手足无措的
You make me laugh and cry at the same time.

1255
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:35,760
你可真是个怪胎
You're a weirdo!

1256
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,900
哒哒哒 你救不了他
Tut-tut-tut! You cannot help him.

1257
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,720
你先是欺骗我的女儿
First you deceive my daughter.

1258
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,040
又窃取她的身份
Then you take her identity!

1259
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:46,490
妈妈 住手
Mom, stop!

1260
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,410
现在还想盗走我们的荣誉
Now you try and take our honor and our future?

1261
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:51,470
妈妈 不
Mother!

1262
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:56,720
你以为离间了我们母女 我还会轻易地放过你吗
Do you think you can turn my daughter against me and get away with it?

1263
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,630
你骗过我女儿 却骗不了我
Ah! No-one cheats me!

1264
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,280
妈妈 你吓到她了 不要
Mother! You scared her! Stop!

1265
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:10,560
上回她迟到时 后果很严重
The last time she was this late, it did not end well.

1266
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:24,860
啊
Aaah!

1267
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:47,440
我怎么看到 有两个马汀啊
Hey, it's Matty and his twin sister!

1268
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:49,320
发生了什么
What happened?

1269
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:54,110
有位可怕的夫人追着你女朋友上了青春女神像 要杀了她
There's a big, scary lady chasing your girl up the statue, trying to kill her.

1270
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:54,590
什么
What?

1271
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:57,640
我快要吓死了 根本拦不住她
And, also, I wet myself.

1272
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:01,960
快 快去救她
Come on! Quickly! Save her!

1273
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,060
马汀 准备第三代“鸡翼”
Matty, the Pigeon Wings!

1274
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:39,420
这就是你今天可以得到的唯一一顶皇冠
This is the only crown you will touch today,

1275
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,900
恐怕你要出点儿什么意外 缺席今晚的演出了
victim of a terrible accident on the night of your debut.

1276
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:49,770
就像奥黛特一样 从此告别芭蕾了
You will have something to share with Odette. Both of you used to be dancers.

1277
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,150
菲丽西 我来了
Felicie!

1278
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:53,530
起飞吧
Let go! Oh!

1279
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,820
啊偶 还好
Uh-oh! OK!

1280
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:00,760
啊哦
Uh-oh.

1281
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,760
菲丽西
Felicie!

1282
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,550

1286

别担心 菲丽西 维克多在此为您效劳 使命必达
Felicie, don't worry. We'll be on time!

1287
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:50,280
飞得更高 耶！
Higher! YES!

1288
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:56,430
使命必达
We will be on time!

1289
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:03,950
我觉得你这个玩意儿该装个刹车什么的
In version three, it might be a good idea to work on some brakes.

1290
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,590
哈哈 你就不能说点好话 夸我一下吗
Can't you just say that I've invented something and it worked?

1291
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:09,420
好啊
I can.

1292
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,200
那你倒是说啊
Then say it!

1293
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,410
