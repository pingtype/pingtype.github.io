所以 你才这么傻

Yeah, I know you are.

266
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,770
割掉他的舌头
Cut off his tongue.

267
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,150
让他再也说不了话
Make sure he doesn't ever use it again.

268
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,780
不 不 罗伯特 回来！
No, no. Rob! Rob, come back!

269
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,280
别这么做 拜托 拜托 别这么做
You can't do...please! Please! Please, don't do...

270
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,780
别这么对我！

271
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,450
不 不 拜托
No, no, no, no, no, no. N-n-no, please...

272
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,960
快 让我出去！
Come on. Let me out!

273
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,380
有人吗？
Anyone!

274
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,000
救命
Help!

275
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,010
该死的！
Shit!

276
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,530
该死
Shit.

277
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
- 嗨 德娜  - 托马斯在哪里 文森特？
- Hey, d.  - Where's Thomas, vin?

278
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,990
没事的
It's okay.

279
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,990
他的教练打了电话 说他没去比赛 他在哪里？
His coach called, said he missed the game. Where is he?

280
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,700
他走了不久
Yeah, yeah. He took off a little while ago.

281
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,910
我大概知道他在哪里 我就去接他
I think I know where he is. I'm gonna get him now.

282
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,710
走了？他从不错过比赛
Took off? He'd never miss a game.

283
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,750
德娜 我和托马斯发生了争吵
Look, d, t and i had a little fight.

284
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,050
他现在可能只是故意气我
So, uh, I think he's just punishing me right now.

285
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,260
- 什么样的争吵 文森特  - 不知道
- What kind of fight, vin?  - I don't know.

286
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,760
他就那个脾气
He was just being him.

287
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,340
- 我也知道 你那个脾气  - 是啊
- And I'm sure you were just being you.  - Yeah.

288
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,850
总之 我不同意他干某件事
Look, at the end of the day, I told him no, he couldn't do something,

289
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,730
他就生气走了 我大概知道 他在哪里
 he got pissed off, he took off, so I think I know where he is.

290
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,060
- 我就去接他  - 找到他
- I'm gonna go get him right now.  - Find him.

291
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,120
一楼
 First floor.

292
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,600
那里
There.

293
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,980
他在干什么？
What the hell's he doing?

294
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,810
一楼
First floor.

295
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,670

It's novak.

296
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,630
嗨 罗伯特
Hey, rob.

297
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,840
是的 终于一切妥当了
Yeah, and we're finally all set here. Right.

298
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,840
在一楼见面 再见
Meet you on the floor. Bye.

299
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,720
跟我来
Follow me.

300
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,860
我是警察 这里几分钟前 来了一个人
Police. There was a man in here a few minutes ago.

301
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,700
- 他提了个帆布包  - 我没注意到
- He had a duffel bag.  - I didn't notice.

302
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,240
是个大帆布包
It was a big duffel bag.

303
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,200
我说了 我没注意到
And I'm telling you i didn't notice.

304
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,910
你要干什么？
What are you doing?

305
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,750
这是男厕所
This is the men's room.

306
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,210
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

307
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,420
好吧
Okay.

308
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,340
来过一个人 像你这么折腾
There was a guy banging around just like you in that one.

309
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,970
你应该说 你找的是黑人 六英尺高
You should have said he was black, six-feet-tall,

310
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,600
在厕所里折腾
banging around in the stalls.

311
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,980
- 那我就知道 你说的是谁了  - 谢谢
- Then I would have known who you were talking about.  - Thanks.

312
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,350
我会描述的更清楚一些
I'll work on my descriptions.

313
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,380
哦
Oh.

314
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,970
这混蛋
Motherfucker.

315
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
我就知道
I knew it.

316
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,380
你的毒品呢？
Where are my drugs?

317
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,840
我儿子呢？
Where's my son?

318
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,140
爸爸！
Dad!

319
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,970
托马斯
Thomas.

320
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,390
这是怎么回事？
What's goin' on?

321
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,850
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

322
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,810
拜托
Come on, man.

323
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,440
你抢了我的货
You steal from me...

324
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,690
还杀了我的人
And you kill my guys.

325
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,520
我们好商量
Let's just figure it out.

326
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,440
你这蠢货
You stupid shit.

327
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,160
这是我运过的 最大的一批货
This is the biggest amount I ever moved.

328
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
难道我会不严加保护吗？
You think i wouldn't protect it with everything I've got?

329
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,080
我们不知道 毒品是你的
Look, we didn't know the drugs was yours.

330
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,160
你不知道 你闯出了什么祸
You have no idea what kind of mess you've made here.

331
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,040
那可卡因 本来是送到诺瓦克那里的
That cocaine is supposed to go to the novaks.

332
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,170
你知道 他们的能耐
You know what they're capable of.

333
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,010
这件事 我该怎么跟罗伯特诺瓦克解释
How am I supposed to explain this to rob novak?

334
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,670
或是他父亲？
Or his father?

335
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,340
如果弗兰克亲自过问…
If frank gets involved here...

336
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,590
我把毒品给你带来了
I got your drugs.

337
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,850
其他的 我藏起来了
I got the rest stashed.

338
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,220
把儿子给我 我就去把它拿来
I'll get it to you when I get my son.

339
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,950
真不明白你 唐斯
I don't get you, downs.

340
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,370
做事有正确的方式 有错误的方式
There's a right way to do things and a wrong way.

341
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:03,370
你就是不肯按规矩来
I just don't think that you respect the established protocol.

342
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,250
是的
Yeah.

343
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,220
我一般都是用正确的方式做事
The right way is how i usually do things.

344
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,550
十分钟
Ten minutes.

345
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,010
十分钟后 我会带来 来接我儿子
I'll bring it back in ten minutes, get my son.

346
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,600
- 带我去哪里 爸爸  - 十分钟
- No, where am I going? Dad!  - Ten minutes.

347
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,110
如何保证 我把可卡因拿来 你就会把儿子给我？
How do I know if I bring you that coke, you don't give my son back?

348
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,530
我们走吧？
Shall we?

349
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,090
喂？
Hello?

350
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,970
我跟踪文森特唐斯 到了拉克萨斯赌场
I followed Vincent downs to the luxus.

351
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,640
干嘛跟踪他？
What do you mean you followed Vincent downs?

352
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,810
我们谈过 你说该调查一下他
We discussed it. You said he was worth looking into.

353
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,980
调查并不等于跟踪 南希朱尔
Yeah, looking into does not mean tailing, Nancy drew.

354
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,360
他在男厕所天花板内 藏了二十三公斤可卡因
He hid 23 kilos of coke in the ceiling of the men's bathroom.

355
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,320
所以 我说他 值得调查一下
 So I'm saying he's worth looking in to.

356
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,690
好 封锁厕所 我马上就去
Okay, seal off the bathroom. I'm on my way.

357
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,150
- 我把它拿出厕所了  - 你没做调查
- I took it out of the bathroom.  - You moved evidence

358
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,990
就把证物拿走了？
without properly conducting an investigation?

359
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,160
拿走证物 是因为需要拿走
I moved evidence because it needed to be moved.

360
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,040
我在前门等你
I'm waiting out front for you.

361
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,000
呵呵
Oh, ho, ho.

362
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,120
你会收到一堆警戒线 做为生日礼物的
Oh, you are getting a roll of police tape for your birthday.

363
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,070
给你
Here you go.

364
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,500
去拿货 在我办公室等我 五分钟

367
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,220
- 你父亲还好吗？ - 他很好
- Oh, hey, how's the old man?  - He's good.

368
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,230
十…
Ten...

369
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,110
又来了
here we go again.

370
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,950
不管你在找什么 一个女警察 已经进去过了
Whatever you're looking for, that lady cop was already in there.

371
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,200
该死的！
Shit!

372
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,290
她怎么进去了？
What do you mean she was already in there? Huh?

373
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,830
她有没有拿着垃圾袋？
She have a garbage bag?

374
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,630
你没听见吗？
You don't hear me?

375
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,210
没有？
No, huh?

376
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,800
她有没有…
Did she have a gar...

377
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,220
好 听着 听着
all right, listen. Listen.

378
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,140
听着 我需要找回那个垃圾袋
Listen. I need to get that garbage bag.

379
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,100
这个给你
You take this.

380
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,810
这是我父亲的表
It's my father's watch.

381
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,520
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

382
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,440
拜托
Please.

383
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,820
我们喝一杯吧
Let's get a drink.

384
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,440
不了 我还赶时间
No. No. I'm in a bit of a hurry.

385
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,280
只想拿着我的货 走人
I just want to get my stuff and go.

386
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,870
我的人 正把货拿到我的办公室 只需要再过几分钟
My guy's bringing the stuff to my office. Just be a few more minutes.

387

Something wrong?

388
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,790
没有 一切正常
No. Everything's fine.

389

Here's the thing.

403
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,540
你知道 我的家族
You know my family.

404
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,760
我们涉足很多行业
And we got our fingers in a whole lot of pies.

405
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,170
毕竟
I mean, shit,

406
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,930
谁不想分一杯羹呢？
who doesn't love a hot, steaming slice of pie?

407
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,470
美味
Delicious.

408
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,810
但我父亲 考虑深远
But my father, he's a...he's a big thinker.

409
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,020
我们正开发一个新市场
We got a new pie getting baked up.

410
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,190
加拿大
Canada.

411
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,940
没办法？他喜欢雪
What can I say? He likes snow.

412
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,530
听我说 罗伯特
Listen, rob...

413
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,910
不 斯坦 好听的在后面
no, Stanley, it gets better.

414
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,700
这本来是一件小事
It was supposed to be a small deal this week...

415
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,580
二十五公斤可卡因 只是先给他们尝尝
25 kilos, you know, just to give them a taste.

416
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,380
但我的蠢货表弟 成了缉毒局的线人
Then my idiot cousin decides to become a DEA informant,

417
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,920
我们失去了整整…
and we lose an entire...

418
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,800
一批货
Shipment.

419
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,090
但我站了出来
But me, I step up

420
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:54,140
向我父亲保证 加拿大的市场 不会有问题
and I promise my father that our Canadian pie is safe,

421
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,730
我可以弥补这损失
and that I could cover the shortage

422
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,480
再搞来…
with an extra...

423
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,070
二十五公斤
25 kilos.

424
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,610
你的二十五公斤
 Your 25 kilos.

425
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,410
- 我只是帮忙  - 不 斯坦利
- I was just trying to help.  - No, Stanley.

426
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:16,080
你提出给我一批货 那是帮我
When you made me the offer, you were helping me out.

427
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,920
但当我向父亲保证 不会有问题之后
But when I promised my father that I had it all covered,

428
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,460
这就成了你的责任
then you became obligated.

429
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,050
那我
So,

430
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,300
我的可卡因在哪里？
where is my goddamn cocaine?

431
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,590
好的
Okay.

432
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,640
你能等一下吗？谢谢
Can you hold one moment, please? Thank you.

433
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,430
我想租一个储物柜？
I'd like to rent a locker, please?

434
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,640
对不起 储物柜 只能温泉的客人使用
I'm sorry. Lockers are reserved for spa guests only.

435
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,020
如果你想预订…
If you'd like to book a...

436
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,480
我想租一个储物柜
I'd like to rent a locker, please.

437
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,900
谢谢
Thank you.

438
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,830
一楼
First floor.

439
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,180
- 你查过所有摄影机了吗？ - 是的 没找到他
- Did you check every monitor?  - Yes. I lost him.

440
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,470
- 该死的  - 他儿子在我们手上
- Goddamn it.  - We got his kid.

441
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,810
他会把毒品给我们的 斯坦
He's gonna bring us our drugs. Stan...

442
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,490
嘿 你不是说 在外面等我的吗
hey, I thought you said you'd meet me outside.

443
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,580
- 我就知道他腐败  - 他在哪里？
- I knew he was dirty.  - Where is he?

444
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,870
我只顾保护证物了
I stayed with the evidence.

445
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,540
我的天
Jesus Christ.

446
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,090
首先 有一名死者 是这里的员工
First of all, we got a dead guy who worked here.

447
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,210
我跟踪斯坦来这里
Right? I followed downs here

448
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,380
看到他跟赌场经理 斯坦罗比诺交谈
and see him talking to the casino manager, Stan rubino.

449
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,930
然后罗伯特诺瓦克带着人来了 跟罗比诺见了面
Then rob novak and his guys turn up, and they're meeting with rubino.

450
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,390
这显然 跟今早的犯罪现场有关
Clearly, this ties in to our crime scene this morning.

451
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,510
为什么 就因为我们在犯罪现场 发现了警用子弹？
Why? Because we've got a police-issued bullet at the crime scene,

452
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,520
还因为 唐斯来了这里
and because downs comes here

453
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,350
把一批可卡因 藏在厕所天花板内？
and shoves a ton of cocaine into the bathroom ceiling?

454
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,940
那么 就是他杀的人
Then he killed the guy.

455
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,190
是的
Yes.

456
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,690
好 他是嫌疑人了
Okay, he's our guy.

457
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,860
你把毒品 放哪里了
Where'd you put the drugs?

458
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,700
放在温泉 一个储物柜里了
I put them in a locker in the spa.

459
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,410
天啊 这是胡闹 这是胡闹
Oh, my god. This is nuts. This is nuts.

460
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,240
- 我们要找个法官批准  - 不
- We got to get a judge in on this.  - No.

461
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,200
如果我们等待批准 就会错过了 这是大事
If we hang around waiting for paperwork, we'll miss it. This is big.

462
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,910
如果我们同时查获了 诺瓦克家族和一个腐败警察
We can bring down the novaks and have an internal bust at the same time?

463
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,540
- 珍妮弗  - 我是对的
- Jennifer...  - I'm right about this.

464
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,840
- 珍妮弗  - 我没事
- Jen...  - I'm fine.

465
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,800
好 你想做什么？
Okay. What do you want to do?

466
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,760
我想试探一下唐斯
I want to give downs a poke.

467
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,340
该死
Shit.

468
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,460
嗨 德娜
Hey, d.

469
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,340
- 你找到他了吗  - 是的 收到他的一个短信
- Do you have him?  - Yeah. Got a text from him.

470
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,170
- 他说要去拉克萨斯赌场 见个女孩  - 什么女孩？
- Said he was going to meet some shorty at the luxus casino.  - What girl?

471

You know, the...with the girl. The girl, uh...the girl he always with.

472
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,930
- 那个…  - 他没女朋友
- The girl...  - he doesn't have a girl.

473
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,930
也许他不希望你知道
Maybe he don't want you to know who the girl is.

474
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,600
我了解你 文森特 了解你的声音
I know you, vin, and I know your voice.

475
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,480
你没对我说实话吧？
You're not telling me the whole story, are you?

476
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,690
现在别扯这些 我找到他后 会给你打电话的 好吗？
Don't start that right now. When I get him, i will call you, okay?

477
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,360
我找到他后 给你打电话
I'll call you when I got him. Shit.

478
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,820
文森特
Look, vin...

479
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,990

00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,870
你知道 机场的庸播
You know what they say at the airport.

481
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,450
要照顾好自己的行李
Never leave your bag unattended.

482
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,870
布莱思特 我需要那个包包
Bryant, I need that bag.

483
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,790
- 我们见个面谈谈吧？ - 去你的吧！
- Why don't we meet up and talk about it?  - Fuck you!

484
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,090
好
Okay.

485
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,020
我必须离开这里
Oh, I gotta get out of here.

486
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,030
打扰一下
Excuse me.

487

492
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,650
怎么这么久才来？
What the hell took you so long?

493
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,440
这个人是谁？
Who the fuck is this?

他是文森特唐斯 他拿来了你的货
This is Vincent downs. He's the man who's got your product.

495
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,650
为什么等了你这么长时间？
And why have we been sitting around waiting on you?

496
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,780
栖下有很多警察

你怎么知道 他们是缉毒局的？
How do you know they're narcotics?

502
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,960
因为我是个警察
'Cause I'm a cop.

503
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,800
别冲动
Easy.

542
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,170

543
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,260

00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,000
- 别担心  - 我怎么不担心？
- Don't worry about it.  - What do you mean don't worry about it?

555
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,170

556
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,840

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

564
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,170
只是划了一下 我没事的
It's just a cut. It's just a cut. I'll be okay.

565
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,300
只要给我一点时间
Just give me a minute.

566
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,510
你偷了他们的毒品？
You stole drugs from them?

567
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,350
- 你胡说什么？ - 所以 你很少回家
- What you talking about?  - That's why you're never home.

568
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,390
这就是你的加班？
This your overtime?

569
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,390
我还以为 你在做好事
Thought you out doing something good,

570
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,980
其实 你在这里贩毒

576
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,450
快大功告成了 所以 我很少回家
I almost got it done. That's why I haven't been around.

577
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:43,250
所以 没带你去什么比赛
That's why I haven't been able to take you to your games or whatever that is.

578
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,750
我对此 很抱歉
And I apologize for that.

579
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,540

00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,960
所以 你要跟紧我 我们会脱身的
So you got to stay close, and we gonna get out of this.

找到他了吗？
Any sign of him?

596
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,710
我跟我父亲通了话
I spoke with my father.

597
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,250
如果四小时后 还搞不到那批可卡因
If we don't have the coke in the next four hours,

598
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,710
他就缩短度假回来
he's cutting his vacation short and coming home.

599
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,760
我要你告诉我们收买的所有警察
I want you to tell every cop on our payroll

600
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:48,430
我会出钱 干掉文森特和他的搭档
that I will pay to see Vincent downs and his partner on their knees.

601
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,480
让开！
Move!

602
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,320
- 让开！ - 过来！
- Get the fuck outta the way!  - Come here!

603
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,160
- 托马斯！ - 爸爸 爸爸！
- Thomas!  - Dad! Dad!

604
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,660
我对天发誓 小混蛋！
I swear to god, you little shit!

605
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,000
如果你吵闹 我就宰了你！
If you make a scene, I'll fucking kill you!

606
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,630

608
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,180
好消息
Good news.

609
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,970
抓回他儿子了
Got his son back.

610
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:09,760
预计这件事 很快就能解决
I expect this will all be wrapped up momentarily.

611
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,810
你在这里干什么 斯坦？
What are you doing here, Stanley?

612
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,690
你有个工作
You have a job.

613
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,400
一个好工作
A good one.

614
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,570
是的
Yeah.

615
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,530
看来 你混得很不错
Looks like you've done pretty damn well for yourself.

616
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,540
请让我喝杯水
Let me have a water, please.

617
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,880
从我在你那里进的货中
From what I buy from you for the clients here,

618
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,920
我每月都存一点
I, uh...i save a little back every month.

619
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,800
那二十五公斤 本是我的保障
That 25 kilos was my... safety net.

620
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,470
你为何需要保障？
And why do you need a safety net?

621
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,940
跟你们这种坏人打交道
When you hang with scumbags...

622
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,570
就需要保障
You need a safety net.

623
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:03,530
回答得好
Good answer.

624
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,950
这是什么？
What's that?

625
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,330
打开看看
Open it.

626
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,880
- 这是不是…  - 舌头？
- Is that a...  - tongue?

627
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,050
是的
Yeah.

628
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,310
我的天
Jesus.

629
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,890
我表弟的
My cousin's.

630
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,270
听着
So look.

631
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,400
嗯
Mmm.

632
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,360
我的家族
My family...

633
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,770
我们有很多朋友
We have a lot of friends.

634
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:47,780
所以 你不管去哪里
So there's gonna be nowhere that you can go

635
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,450
我们都能找到你
that we won't be able to find you.

636
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,410
我给你一小时时间
So I'm giving you one hour.

637
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:56,330
一小时
One.

638
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,420
收下这小盒子
Hang on to the box.

639
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,630
我要你留着它 让它提醒你
I want you to keep it so it'll remind you

640
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,720
自以为比我精明的人 会是什么下场
of what happens when people think that they're smarter than me.

641
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,490
该死！该死！
Fuck! Fuck!

642
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:35,830
- 救出他了吗？ - 没有
- You get him?  -  No.

643
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,450
货也不在这里
And the product ain't here either.

644
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,620
- 该死的！ - 来拉克萨斯赌场找我
- Shit!  - Just come down and meet me at the luxus.

645
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,370
马上来这里
 Just get here now.

646
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,300
- 怎么回事？ - 你是谁？
- What the fuck?  - Who are you?

647
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,680
不是谁
Ain't nobody.

648
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,970
喂 你不能来这里
Ho. You can't be in here.

649
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,850
对 你说的对 别说我来过
Right. You're right. I'm not even here.

650
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,060
看起来 是真的 你没来过这里
Hmm. Right. Looks official. You're not coming in here.

651
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,690
我给妳三个选择 要嘛 放我过去
Look, you got three options: Either you let me pass,

652
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,980
要嘛 被我揍一顿 要嘛 被我逮捕
or I'll whup your funny-looking ass or I can arrest you.

653
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,520
嗯
Hmm.

654
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,820
逮捕我！
Arrest me...oh!

655
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,320
约翰特拉维斯
John Travis.

656
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,510
我去车库 他的车上找找看？
I'm going to the garage, see if I can find something in his car.

657
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:33,880
问问前台
Check the front desk. No.

658
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,680
- 也许她们见过他  - 不查了
- Maybe they saw him.  - We're done.

659
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,760
我们己经搜遍赌场各处
We have searched every inch of this casino.

660
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,470
文森特 早就走了 好吗？ 他打败了我们
Vincent downs is long gone. All right? He beat us.

661
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,560
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

662
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,900
当一个男警官调查时被打
You know, a guy gets beat up on the job,

663
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,700
人人都会祝贺他
and everyone congratulates him on the size of his balls.

664
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,530
但我被打了 人人都认为
If I get hit, everyone acts like

665
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:57,740
我需要看看心理医生 才能回去工作
I need tape and a shrink to get put back together.

666
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,080
不是说 你精神有问题
No, you know what? This isn't about this.

667
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,700
而是你的心理状态
It's about your state of mind.

668
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,580
你对眼皮底下的事 视而不见
You missed things that were right in front of you

669
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,210
在错误的时间 去了错误的地方
and put yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time

670
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:08,420
差点没命了
and almost got yourself killed.

671
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,590
我现在就是正确的时间 去了正确的地方
I am in the right place at the right time.

672
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:13,920
我们发现了一个腐败警察 参与了鲁比诺和诺瓦克的交易
We've got a dirty cop in the middle of a deal between rubino and novak,

673
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,550
他们公开交往 说明他们不怕
and they're associating in public, which means they are not afraid.

674
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,600
- 好吧  - 说明他们有保护伞
- Okay.  - Someone is protecting them.

675
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,890
好吧 我懂你的意思
Okay. Point taken.

676
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:25,600
到明早 我们会开始正式调查
And in the morning, we will start a formal investigation.

677
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,560
但今晚 我会让搜证组来
But tonight, i am gonna take the labs to the precinct

678
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,490
今晚 我们就到此为止
and then I am going to call it a night.

679
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:40,950
好吧 我会把毒品 送到证物处
Fine. I'll take the drugs into evidence.

680
