I don't see... what the point of all this is.

98
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:06,308
因为这是强制的规定
Well, because this is mandatory,

99
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:10,320
直到我的表时针指向七点
until my local clock strikes seven,

100
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,788
之间这段时间 你都得留在这儿 所以...

我们可以把这段时间好好利用起来
we might as well make the most of it.

I signed up for Greenpeace.

180
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,097

刚才在那边 你应该告诉他这些

198
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,155
- 真的没事吗? - 没什么 就是睡不着觉
- Hey, are you okay? - Yeah, I just can't sleep.

199
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,028
我是说 就是睡一会儿就醒 懂吗?
I mean, I sleep but then I'm up, you know?

200
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,089

对 跟老师谈一谈
Yeah, you need to talk to the teacher,

206
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,347
还有 有个家长 孩子妈

Let me just get it right here.

222
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,151

你在那儿才看不见我
You can't see me from there.

225
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,325
我能啊 我现在就看着你呢

现在看不见了
Now I can't see you,

229
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,172
但是如果我看不见你的话 你也就看不见我了
but if I can't see you, you can't see me.

230
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,903
为什么?
Why is that?

231
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,447
我也不知道 就是这个规律
I don't know why is that, it's just the rules.

232
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,777
你在学校学啥了?
What are you learning in school?

233
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,323
学到了什么有意思的东西吗?
You learning fun stuff?

234
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,255
就读书啊 然后课间休息
We read, do recess,

235
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,124
听音乐 跳舞
listen to music, dance.

236
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,653
休...什么玩意...跳舞?
Rec... What kind of...? Dancin' around?

237
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,824
这怎么听着这么作啊 哥们
That sounds very arty-fatty to me, bud.

238
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,264
说到这儿...
Speak of the devil...

239
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,331
- 爸爸! - 噢 不!
- Dad! - Oh, no!

240
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,498
是什么!
What is that!

241
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,916
你最好把窗户打开 兄弟
You'd better get the window, bud.

242
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,271
- 我要死了! - 不!
- I'm gonna die! - Oh, no!

243
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,940
噢 不! 全体都有 撤离! 医务兵 有友军倒下!
Oh, no! Marines, clear out! Medic, man down!

244
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,539
呃...
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

245
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,141
他还有反应吗? 还有反应吗?
Is he responding? Is he responding?

246
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,949
- 啊 还有反应 - 好了 好了!
- He's responding. - Okay, okay, okay, okay!

247
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,284
- 你说的那是什么意思? - "反应"吗?
- What does that mean? Responding?

248
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,884
不是, "友军倒下"
No, "man down."

249
00:16:56,983 --> 00:17:01,659
"友军倒下"是个军事术语 意思是
Man down is a military term. It's what you say when...

250
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,702
我方的兄弟被击倒 或者受伤了 这样
one of your boys goes down or someone gets hurt, or...

251
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,030
哦
Oh.

252
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,866
让我猜猜是哪个孩子欺负人
Let me take a wild guess of who that is.

253
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,030
是那个小子吗?
Is that him right there?

254
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,004
我跟你一起过去 这样他就不敢欺负你了
I'm gonna come in with you so they don't mess with you.

255
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,739
- 不要! 求你了 - 为什么
- No! Please. Why?

256
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,476
- 就是... - 咋了 你觉得跟我一起很尴尬吗
- It's just... - What are you embarrassed of me?

257
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,519
我一个人可以走过去的 真的
I can walk from here, really.

258
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,316
我知道你可以 你是个大孩子了
I know you can walk from here. You're a grown boy.

259
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,382
这是怎么开始的? 某天他们无缘无故就开始欺负你?
How'd this start up? You just walked in one day and they started in on you?

260
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,983
- 不是 - 那是怎么回事?
- No. - What happened?

261
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,656
有次他们听见妈妈送我的时候 说了句"我爱你"
They heard Mom say "I love you" when she dropped me off.

262
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,563
她在你朋友面前说了 "我爱你"?
She said "I love you" in front of your friends, huh?

263
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,226
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

264
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,771
好吧 我明白了 这样不好
All right, I understand. It's no good.

265
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,842
- 你给妈妈讲过吗? - 嗯
- And you told Mom? - Yeah.

266
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,103
她说什么?
What'd she say?

267
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,905
他说他要把那些孩子的家长们揍一顿
She said she was gonna beat the mother up.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,071
她说要把那些家长揍一顿? 好吧 听着
She was gonna beat the mothers up? All right, look.

269
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,581
我不是妈妈 但是我肯定
I'm not mom, but I damn sure am gonna tell my kid

270
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,743
我也想在你下车时跟你说"我爱你"
I love him when he gets out the car, all right?

271
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,446
所以我们想个能过得去的办法吧
So we gotta come up some kind of little middle ground,

272
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,614
比如一个暗号什么的
like a secret word or something.

273
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,787
"友军倒下"好不好?
What about "man down"?

274
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:06,091
- "友军倒下"? - 很好吧

You know, we'll just sneak it out anytime we want to say it.

没其他人会知道这是什么意思
Nobody will know what we're talking about.

00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,530
真他妈美!
Huh? Fucking beautiful!

410
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:56,629
你们问 为什么要承受痛苦? 为什么要剥夺你们的权利?
You ask, why the pain? Why the deprivation?

411
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,868
去他妈的
Ah, fuck, man.

412
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,675
行吧 得了
All right, come on.

413
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,008
当你的敌人听到声音向你开火时
Pain doesn't subside as your enemy listens

414
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,548
痛苦不会平息
for sounds to fire towards.

415
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,674
快点 傻逼们 快点!
Move, motherfucker, move!

416
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,775
继续前进!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

417
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,788
把枪交了
Hand over your rifle.

418
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,620
Roberts 快帮帮你的哥们
Roberts, help out your fellow Marine.

419
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,217
给他拿水冲冲眼睛
Looks like he could use some water.

420
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,795
下一个!
Next!

421
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,195
睁开眼 睁开眼
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

422
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,392
加油 哥们 加油
Come on, brother, push it out. Come on.

423
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,128
加油
Push it out.

424
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,832
好吧 总得有人给最后一名鼓鼓掌咯
Well, somebody gotta applaud the Jamaican bobsled team.

425
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,306
我说的对吗 大兵们?
Am I right, Marines?

426
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,398
对 长官!
Yes, Sergeant!

427
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,536
- 我说的对吗? - 对 长官!
- Am I right, Marines? - Yes, sir!

428
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,074
妈的
The fuck.

429
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,809
烧得我疼死了
That burns like a motherfucker.

430
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:41,977
疼死了
Like a motherfucker.

431
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,577
真他妈疼死了 哥们
Like a motherfucker, man.

432
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,315
快在那儿吹吧
Hit that fan. All right.

433
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,417
你会没事的 哥们 我爱你
You'll be all right, brother. Love you, man.

434
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:01,070
嘿 Miller中士 来讲几句怎么样?
Yo, Sergeant Miller, how about a speech?

435
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,434
来吧
Come on.

436
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,239
我讲了又没人给我钱 小屌贝
They don't pay me for speeches, little spoon.

437
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,073
- 他屌可大了 - 我听说的可不是这样
- It's big spoon, man. - Ain't what I heard.

438
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,871
我可是看过的哦
Peek at you, snuggling.

439
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,107
是的 长官
Sir.

440
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,618
好吧 再过短短几天
All right. Um, in a few short days,

441
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,887
你们就要被分配到各个部队
you guys will be assigned units,

442
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,892
执行自己的任务
and there you'll go where duty calls.

443
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,585
就这么简单
It's that simple.

444
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,253
所以也没什么好说的
So with not much left to say,

445
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,887
我只引用一句
I will leave you with the words

446
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,924
埃琳诺·罗斯福的名言
of the late, great, Eleanor Roosevelt,

447
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,732
说的是
who so eloquently stated,

448
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,966
"在这个世界上 我见过的海军陆战队员
"The Marines I've seen around this world

449
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,064
拥有最洁净的身体
have the cleanest bodies,

450
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:43,944
最肮脏的心灵 最高的士气
filthiest minds, highest morale...

451
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,276
以及在我所见过的任何动物群体之中
and lowest morals

452
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,714
最低的道德标准"
of any group of animals I've ever seen."

453
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,719
你为什么盯着我看?
Why are you looking at me, man?

454
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,416
感谢上帝让我们拥有美国海军陆战队!
Thank God for the United States Marine Corps!

455
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:56,460
- 喔喔喔! 耶! - 喊起来!
- Hooah! Yeah! - Let's give him one!

456
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,119
吃饭吧 我要吃了
Eat up. I'm-a eat.

457
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,755
- 你要什么? - 给我个热狗 大屌贝
- What you want? - Give me a hotdog, big spoon.

458
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,958
好
All right.

459
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,466
给我也拿一个
Hey, bring me one.

460
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,233
说得很好
Great speech.

461
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,437
嗯
Yeah.

462
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,811
没有什么能比埃琳诺·罗斯福这话
Nothing like an Eleanor Roosevelt quote

463
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,814
更能鼓舞士气了
to get the crowd going.

464
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:22,078
- "埃莉诺" - 是埃琳诺 宝贝
- "Elyeanor." - It's Eleanor, baby.

465
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,678
我是学他呢
I'm just saying it 'cause he said it.

466
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,449
投得好 Jon!
Good throw, Jon!

467
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,355
上旋球漂亮 宝贝!
Nice spiral, baby!

468
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,757
- 你这孩子真会扔! - 是啊
- Kid's got an arm, man! - Yeah, he does.

469
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,853
送孩子去小足队吧 我说
Peewee league, man, that's all I'm saying.

470
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,487
这主意还真不错
That's a good idea, actually.

471
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,932
- 小足队 - 你觉得呢?
- Peewee league. Yeah. - You think?

472
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,527
可能对他也有好处
I guess it would be good for him

473
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:43,869
在你不在的时候 他可以跟其他孩子的爸爸一起相处
to be around other dads and stuff while you're away.

474
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:48,172
- 可以啊 - 好吧
- Yeah. - Yeah.

475
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,941
好啊
So, yeah.

476
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,382
嗯 如果能让她开心的话
Yeah, if it makes him happy, yeah.

477
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,453
肯定会让他开心的 嘿 Jon!
It'll make him happy. Jon! Hey, Jon!

478
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,352
你想去小足队打球吗?
What do you think about peewee league?

479
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,946
想!
Yeah!

480
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,959
- 小足队? - 想
- Peewee league? - Yeah.

481
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,462
- 说定了 - 说定了
- Sold. - Sold.

482
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,555
给我扔一球 Jon
Throw me one, Jon.

483
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,507
- Devin Roberts下士 - 嗯哼
- Corporal Devin Roberts. - Mm-hmm.

484
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,745
我想了解一下你俩之间的关系
I'd like to understand the relationship between you both.

485
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,180
没什么可了解的 我俩在一个街区长大
There's not much to understand. We grew up on the same block.

486
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,878
他父母把他赶出家门 我父母收留了他
His parents kicked him out, my parents took him in,

487
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:37,484
然后那段时间我们两个人 碰巧有了共同的目标 就一起走了
and right around the time we ran into things in common, we shipped off.

488
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,228
去打仗了
To war.

489
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,697
嗯 去打仗了
To war.

490
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,665
<i>他是我的战友</i>
<i>He's my battle buddy.</i>

491
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,104
<i>我们一起踢开敌人的大门 承受敌人的进攻...</i>
<i>We kicked in doors together, we took enemy fire...</i>

492
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:55,270
<i>这种关系 如果不亲身经历的话...</i>
<i>it's just not a relationship you'd understand...</i>

493
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,904
我猜你是不会懂得的
if you haven't been through it, I guess.

494
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:01,212
这样 我听过很多人讲述这样的故事
Well, I've seen it discussed a lot,

495
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,345
不如你给我讲讲?
so why don't you try me?

496
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:10,721
"很多人讲过"?
"Discussed a lot."

497
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,625
怎么了 很可笑吗?
Something funny about that?

498
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,692
那不一样的
It's just different.

499
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,935
"地面部队"
Boots on the ground.

500
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:25,964
是吗?
Yeah?

501
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,941
我不是说这个
Yeah, it's not that,

502
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,604
只是这种事讲不出的
it's just something you don't discuss.

503
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,145
你看见了什么
What you saw.

504
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,054

This is my wife and son.

510
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,931
你是跟那个大天使加百列同名吗
Gabriel the archangel.

511
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,635
你能不能看一眼这照片?
Can you look at the photo?

512

- 这儿一个人都没有 - 你见过他们吗?
- Ain't nobody here, man. - Have you seen these people?

516

- 这儿一个人都没有 - 这不是有你吗
- Ain't nobody here, man. - Yeah, but you.

517
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,818
你不是在这儿吗
But you. You're here.

嘿 你觉得我不敢杀你吗?
Hey, you think I won't kill you?

Yo, fuck this fool, man. Let's just take his shit and go.

527
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,782

534
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,827
我跟Johnny学校的老师
Hey, so I was talking to some of the aides

535
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,092
谈了一些学校橄榄球队的事
over at Johnny's school about the little football program.

536
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,563

Gabe 我能不能跟你单独待一会儿?
Gabe, can I please just have a minute with you?

548
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,252
好
Yeah.

549
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,026
所以这是干嘛 你要假装
What, so you're just going to pretend

550
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,073
一切都没发生 你不会走吗?
like this isn't happening?

551
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,234
我不知道你想听我说什么 Nat
I mean, I don't know what you want me to say, Nat.

552
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,440
- 我受不了当个单亲妈妈 Gabe - 你不是单亲妈妈
- I can't be a single mom, Gabe. - You're not a single mom.

553
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:25,482
你知道 战争是真的 不是我编的
You know, there's a war going on, I'm not making it up.

554
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,818
我们报名时就知道的
It's something we were both aware of when we signed up.

555
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,450
- 是你报名 不是我们 - 好吧 Natty
- When you signed up. - Okay, Natty.

556
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,586
还有 Devin要怎么办?
And what. What does Devin get to do'?

557
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,995
为什么他就能留在这里 因为胳膊断了吗?
Why does he get to stay back, 'cause he broke his arm?

558
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,066
他留在这儿有什么用?
I mean, he gets to stay back for what?

559
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,682
因为我们也需要有人留守啊
Because we need a presence here as well.

560
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,397
为什么? 有谁打进美国了吗?
Why? Who the fuck's attacking America?

561
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,462
你会没事的 Nat
You're gonna be okay, Nat.

562
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:44,973
真的吗?
Really?

563
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,108
Gabe 那可是阿富汗
Afghanistan, Gabe?

564
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,168
你以为我是愿意去
You think that I want to do this,

565
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,646
特别想去
that this is something I want to do,

566
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,172
好像我等不及去打仗一样?
like I can't wait to go to war?

567
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,945
你知道吗 我想留在这儿 跟你在一起 Natty
You know, I'd love to stay here and just be here with you, Natty,

568
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,146
但是我不能 我别无选择
but I can't do that. That's not an option for me.

569
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,517
天啊...
Man...

570
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:04,625
对不起
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,163
这对于我来说也很难
You know, it's not easy for me, either.

572
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,632
你也生我气 他也生我气...
You're mad and he's mad and...

573
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,636
我没生气 我是伤心! 他也伤心!
No, I'm sad, and he's fucking sad,

574
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,672
整个邻里都伤心!
and the whole neighborhoods sad.

575
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,209
别这样 Nat 过来
Stop. Hey, come on. Stop, Nat.

576
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,479
Natty 对不起
Natty, I'm sorry.

577
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,672
别这样
Come on.

578
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,847
会没事的
We're gonna be fine.

579
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,790
我们会没事的
Hey, we're gonna be fine. Come on.

580
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,654
别看我
Don't look at me.

581
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,300
我们会没事的
We're gonna be fine.

582
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,208
- 我爱你 - 我爱你
- I love you. - I love you.

583
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,051
嘿 小伙子
Hey, bud.

584
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:13,387
- 你要走了 - 是的
- You're leaving. - Yeah.

585
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,399
你不想玩了? 为什么?
You won't play anymore? Why?

586
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,609
你知道吗 我在想...
You know, I was thinking about...

587
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,948
在想...
I was thinking about...

588
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:42,253
过去 我们都是寄信的
You know, in the old days, we used to send letters.

589
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,190
在很久很久以前
I mean, way back, you know.

590
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,559
那可是超级庞大的一个工程
It was, like, a big process.

591
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:49,599
信必须是手写的
You had to, like, write it by hand.

592
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:53,465
还要找张邮票 再找一个信箱
You had a find a stamp, find a mailbox.

593
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,299
总之是件相当大的事
It was just this whole big thing.

594
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,873
现在都没人这么做了
Now, we don't have to do that anymore,

595
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,637
因为有了电子邮件 视频聊天...
'cause now we got email and Skype...

596
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:04,202
就好像对方就在你身边 明白吗?
It's almost like I'm here already, you know?

597
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,408
我也是一样 不知不觉中 我就会回到你身边的
And before you know it, I will be.

598
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,546
明白吗?
You know?

599
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,726
我想送你个东西
I could give you something.

600
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,055
好啊
Yeah.

601
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,497
是什么?
What is it?

602
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,624
是我和妈妈
It's me and Mom.

603
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:27,567
哇!
Oh!

604
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,970
妈妈知道你有这张照片吗?
Mom know you have this?

605
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,566
你这狡猾的小鬼
You sneaky little weasel.

606
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,410
我爱你
I love you, man.

607
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,321
我好爱你
I love you so much.

608
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,986
那你到了那儿之后
And when you get there,

609
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,860
会给我写信吗?
will you do that letter thing with me?

610
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,732
会啊 我一到那儿就给你写
Yeah, I'll do the letter thing as soon as I get there.

611
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,635
等我一落地就开始写
Soon as I land, I'll start with the letter thing.

612
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,968
天天都写 行不?
In hand, every day. All right?

613
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,689
看着我 "友军倒下"
Look at me. Man down.

614
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,616
"友军倒下"
Man down.

615
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,569
好啦
All right.

616
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,672
最后一站啦
Last stop.

617
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,879
你知道吗 是你把我拉进来的
You know, it was you that got me into this shit.

618
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,751
是 但是当时看起来像个好主意
Yeah, well, seemed like a good idea at the time.

619
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,051
嗯
Mm.

620
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:03,192
嘿 你也可以把你的手伸到窗外去啊 (负伤就不用去了)
Hey, man, you could always put your arm through a fucking window.

621
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,061
是
Yeah.

622
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,761
我真不敢相信
I can't believe this shit.

623
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:19,576
兄弟 你是我这辈子唯一的亲人
You're the only family I ever had, man.

624
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,281
得了 不要说这些矫情的
All right, don't do that shit now.

625
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,912
帮我照顾我的家人 好吗?
Just watch out for mine, all right?

626
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,616
- 你知道我会的 - 我知道你会

你问我地址干什么?

他们还想我手把手送过去啊
They want a fucking hand delivery.

710

851
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,951
那边那摊我还没检查
I haven't checked those motherfuckers over there yet.

852
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:08,853
- 哦 那人死透了 - 没事的

- You see that? - I'm on it.

862
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,944
<i>- Drummer - 收到</i>
<i>- Drummer. - Little joy.</i>

863
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:35,808
那么...
So...

864
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,105
关于那次事故
About the incident.

865
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,950
你一直说那是一次"事故"
You keep calling it "the incident."

866
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:47,486
给你什么感受?
How does it make you feel?

867
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,853
它让我感觉糟透了
It makes me feel like shit.

868
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:58,463
把它写下来吧
Let's write that down.

869
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,502
这样可以吗?
Does that work?

870
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,006
抱歉 长官
I'm sorry, sir.

871
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,878
我感觉被背叛了
I felt betrayed.

872
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:20,682
背叛?
Betrayed?

873
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,996
是的 我想 如果死的是其他人 而不是他 我都不会有这种感觉
Yeah, I think if it was anybody but him, I wouldn't feel like that.

874
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,536
就是因为 是他
It was him.

875
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,201
我明白了
I see.

876
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:43,911
我还以为...我们 是在聊那个房间里的事故
I... I thought we were talking about the incident in the room.

877
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:48,450
你又说"事故"...
What you call it... What is it?

878
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,575
最后还是要回到"事故"
You keep going back to that incident.

879
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,527
那个房间...

880
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,127
我以为那个房间安全了
I thought the room was clear.

881
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,307
我以为那里安全了
The room was clear.

882
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:24,484
见鬼 妈的!
Goddamn it! Fuck!

883
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,896
我操!
What the fuck.

884
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,970
我操
Oh, fuck.

885
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,235
我打中了平民
I got a civilian.

Oh, Dev.

我操 哪儿中枪了?
Fuck. Where?

890
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,919

我以为那片区域安全了
Yeah, I thought the area was secure.

我以为安全了 但其实没有
I thought it was clear. It wasn't.

那里有一对母子
There was a mother and a son in there,

905

我后悔也来不及了
and I can't take that back.

906

没有后悔药 不能倒带 就是...

I just feel like I'm dead, sir. I don't give a shit anymore.

- Gabriel. - I'm just trying to talk to you.

926
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,461
正确答案是什么呢 "是的"?
What is the right answer, "yes?"

927
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:18,164
那就写上 是的 这是你要的正确答案吗?
Write yes. What's the right answer?

928
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,239
写上正确答案 让我看看答案是什么
Write the right answer. Just give me the right answer.

929
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,833
你写什么我就说什么
I'll say whatever you want me to say.

930
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:25,504
你看到那些邮件 是在那件事故发生前 还是之后?
The emails. Did you know before or after the incident?

931
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:27,146
你又他妈说那是"事故"
You keep calling it the fucking incident.

932
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,748
你来回来去 就会说事故
You keep going back to that fucking incident.

933
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:30,283
我只是说明 又一名当时在场的战士
The fact that another Marine was present at the time

934
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:33,345
出现了令人担忧的状况
is understandably cause for concern.

935
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,684
你需要一个替罪羊
You need a fall guy.

936
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:42,093
就这样 你只是需要一个替罪羊
That's what this is. You just need a fall guy.

937
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,758
不 那是你乱七八糟的疑心病
No, that's your paranoia speaking.

938
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,767
我没有立场
There's no agenda here.

939
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,201
只是想知道发生了什么而已
I'm simply trying to understand what happened.

940
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,602
你不可能知道发生了什么
You can't understand what happened.

941
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,369
你永远都不会理解我所经历的事
You will never understand what I'm going through.

942
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:56,000
- 可能吧 - 不是可能
- Maybe. - No, not maybe.

943
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,479
不 我能理解负罪感 和悔恨
No, maybe I can understand guilt. I can understand regret.

944
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:03,882
我也能理解背叛
I can understand betrayal.

945
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:08,820
这些都是人类的情感困境
These are all human conditions.

946
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:12,792
接着说 你刚才提到了自杀
Now, you brought up suicide before,

947
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,022
这让我很担心
and that concerns me.

948
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:21,165
你想自杀吗 Gabriel?
Do you want to kill yourself, Gabriel?

949
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,670
你真的想自杀吗?
Do you really want to kill yourself?

950
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:29,843
是的
Yes.

951
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:31,708
那是什么让你没有动手呢?
Then what stops you?

952
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:44,681
是这个
This.

953
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,569
打开后备箱
Pop the trunk.

954
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:16,189
<i>那么 接下来会怎么样呢 我带着一封</i>
<i>So, what happens now, I go home with this letter</i>

955
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:19,056
<i>上面写着我太虚弱 不能承受重压的信回到家</i>
<i>that says I was weak and I couldn't handle it,</i>

956
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,393
<i>然后一切就都会没事了吗?</i>
<i>and everything's just fine again?</i>

957
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:24,365
<i>不是的 我再说一次 不是</i>
