2
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,600
坠入

3
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,950
伊芙琳护士！伊芙琳护士！
Nurse Evelyn! Nurse Evelyn!

4
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,810
我有讯息要跟你说，用英文写的！
I have a message for you. In English!

5
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,600
就是这个
And here we go.

6
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,080
看看，这是上个月以来所有病人的名单
Now, look, here's the list of all the patients we've had in the ward in the last month.

7
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,610
谢谢，护士
Thank you, Nurse.

8
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,950
- 你是亚历珊卓？ - 是的
- You're Alexandria?  - Yes.

9
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,250
你的纸条飞进来，掉在我的膝部
Your note came in, and landed on my lap.

10
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,560
完全看不懂，是胡乱涂鸦还是什么的
Couldn't even understand it. It's written in gibberish or something.

11
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,360
你看不懂，对吗！你看不懂，那不是写给你的
You didn't understand it, didn't you, didn't understand it, it's not for you.

12
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,230
我叫罗依
My name's Roy.

13
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,880
- 你是怎么伤了手臂的？ - 我跌了下来
- How'd you hurt your arm?  - I fell.

14
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,130
我也是
Me too.

15
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,080
当时我在采橘子
I was picking oranges.

16
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,850
是那样吗？
Is that so?

17
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,360
那你要如何上厕所？
How do you go to the potty?

18
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,480
我不用去，他们让我在这里上
I don't. They let me go right here.

19
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,290
- 在床上？ - 是呀！是真的
- In bed?  - Yeah, it's true.

20
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,950
我不相信
I don't believe.

21
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,100
嘿！亚历珊卓
Hey, Alexandria.

22
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,730
嘿！你知道你的名字是根据阿历山大大帝的名字取的？
Hey, do you know you're named after Alexander the Great

23
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,600
他是史上最伟大的战士喔！
who was the greatest warrior who ever lived?

24
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,440
是的，我的纸条不是随便涂鸦，那是英文！
Yes. And my note is not in gibberish. It's in English!

25
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,980
嘿！我可以看到你，快过来这
Hey, I can see you. Come on out here.

26
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,780
我看见你躲在那
I can see you hiding.

27
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,450
亚历珊卓
Alexandria.

28
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,990
嘿！你知道亚历山大也在等待讯息吗？
Hey, did you know he was also looking for a message?

29
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,400
他迷路了
He was lost.

30
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,700
几乎要死了，跟他的大军走散了
He almost died, separated from his army.

31
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,410
- 他收到讯息了吗？ - 什么？
- Did he find the message?  - What?

32
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,140
后来他有收到讯息吗？亚历山大大帝
Did she find the message? Alexandria the Great.

33
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,950
好好，我告诉你，你过来
All right, right, I'll tell you, just come in here.

34
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,350
过来，抓把椅子过来坐下
Now, come on, grab that chair right there.

35
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,890
好的，别弄断了另一条手臂
All right, don't break your other arm.

36
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,260
- 谢谢  - 不客气
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

37
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,410
- 盒子里有什么？ - 我喜欢的东西
- What's in your box?  - Things I like.

38
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,710
- 是你偷的吗？ - 不
- Things you stole?  - No.

39
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,680
是照片
A photo.

40
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,320
你那来的大象？
Where'd you get the elephant?

41
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,790
我朋友送的
My friend gave it to me at work.

42
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,790
他是印度人
He's from India.

43
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,230
看，这是我的马
Look, this is my horse

44
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,200
- 这是我的父亲  - 是吗？
- and this is my father.  - Yeah?

45
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,700
他的门牙中间有缝隙，这应该是你们家族的特征
He's got the same gap in his teeth, must run in the family.

46
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,440
- 是呀！这是我家  - 是吗？
- Yeah, and here is my house.  - Oh, yeah?

47
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,040
- 这曾经是我家  - 怎么了？
- It was my house.  - What happened?

48
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
- 他们烧了它  - 谁？
- They burn it.  - Who burned it?

49
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,090
愤怒的人们
Angry people.

50
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,520
听到这我很难过
I'm sorry to hear that.

51
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,620
我说，听到这我很难过
I said, I'm sorry to hear that.

52
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,790
愤怒的人们
Angry people.

53
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,660
是呀！我知道，听到你的房子被烧了我很难过
Yeah, I know, I'm just sorry that your house got burned.

54
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,960
为何阿历山大
Why did Alexander

55
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,130
没有从建筑物里面骑马出来？
didn't go from that buildings on his horse?

56
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,540
- 若是他迷路了…  - 什么？
- If him was lost...  - What?

57
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:19,740
为何阿历山大不从房里面骑马出来？
Why did Alexander didn't go from that middle of the buildings from that buildings on his horse?

58
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,390
嗯…
Well...

59
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,560
首先，他没有马，因为他的马在战争中死了
First of all, he didn't have a horse because his horse was killed in a battle.

60
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,130
况且，他也不是在任何房子里
And he wasn't in the middle of any old buildings.

61
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,570
而是在广大沙漠中迷路了，四周尽是橙黄色的沙子
He was lost in the middle of a vast desert, full of orange sand

62
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,670
身边只有几个随从
with only a handful of men

63
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,420
但是他们连一滴水也没有
but they didn't have any water.

64
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,300
看！
Look!

65
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,300
“大人，一切希望都没了
"My Lord, all hope is lost.

66
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,240
“似乎您的大军终将被征服
"It seems your mighty army shall finally be conquered.

67
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,640
“不是被波私人，而是被缺水所打败
"Not by the Persians, but by our own greed and gluttony for water.

68
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,700
“这顶头盔，就是我们仅能提供的
"This helmet contains our last supply.

69
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,520
“喔！大王，我相信你的智慧将会让我们得救”
"Oh, King, I believe your wisdom shall save us all."

70
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,460
- 为什么？ - 为什么？
- Why?  - Why?

71
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,620
什么？
What?

72
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,130
为什么？
Why?

73
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,770
因为水不够所有人喝
Well, because there wasn't enough water for all of them

74
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,370
而且那就是阿历山大大帝做事的方法
and it was Alexander the Great's way

75
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,000
像他的军队显示他们一切平等…
of showing his army that they were all equal...

76
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,910
真是蠢啊
It's stupid.

77
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,350
那你会怎样做比较好？
What would you do better?

78
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,980
阿历山大为什么把水倒掉
Was Alexander throw the water

79
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,820
而不是给每个人都喝一小口呢
instead to give every soldier a little bit.

80
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,530
嘿！你何不明天再来，我再跟你说另个故事
Hey, why don't you come back tomorrow and I'm going to tell you a different story.

81
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,430
史诗般的爱情与复仇故事
An epic tale of love and revenge.

82
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,800
- 你知道“史诗般”是什么意思吗？ - 不知道
- You know what "epic" means?  - No.

83
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,100
我这里仍然闷闷的，好像连…
I still got this tightness here. It's like I can't even...

84
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,510
那表示是个很长的故事，而且发生在印度
It means a really long story, and it's set in India.

85
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,980
…好像胸口有只大象那样沉重
...the elephant sitting on my chest.

86
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,980
- 你将会很快好转的  - 好的，继续
- You should be fully recovered.  - All right, go on.

87
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,980
- 我要你帮我检查  - 你明天会在来吗？
- I want you to examine me.  - Will you come back tomorrow?

88
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,810
我觉得不太好
You personally. I'm not very well.

89
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,660
肿胀似乎消了点
The swelling seems down.

90
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,820
我知道那很痛
I know how much it hurts.

91
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,140
幽默一下
A sense of humor.

92
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,470
几周后疼痛会消失，然后在做一次手术
In the next couple of weeks the pain should abate, then one more operation.

93
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,310
跟上次一样吗？
Like the last one?

94
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,370
这需要你的努力，知道吗？
This is going to take some effort on your part, too, you know that?

95
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,570
看见没？
See?

96
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,950
过来
Come on, then.

97
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,750
- 午餐前回来  - 好的
- Be back before lunch.  - Okay.

98
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,930
亚历珊卓，离开那冰块
Alexandria, get away from that ice.

99
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,000
我看到你舔冰块，你会生病的
I see you licking that ice, you're gonna get sick.

100
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,050
去别地方玩！
I want you to go play, go!

101
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,240
下次我会将你的舌头黏在冰块上将你载走
Next time, I'll glue your lips to this and carry you away.

102
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,320
只有马死了你要觉得幸运了
You're lucky it was just a horse that got killed.

103
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,420
我是说，从铁道桥上跳下来，无疑是自杀
I mean, jumping off a train bridge was suicide, too.

104
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,560
若是你想要上她印象深刻…
And if you were trying to impress her...

105
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,600
辛克莱比较吸引她
Sinclair already did a better job.

106
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,430
你知道，那男演员
You know, the actor,

107
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,630
- 男主角  - 我知道他是谁
- the leading man.  - I know who he is.

108
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,980
只有熬过困难才会有拨云见日的一天，那是一定的
Every cloud has a silver lining, that's for sure.

109
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,110
拿另外一张牌
Take another card.

110
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,780
- 在我发生意外前…  - 那是红心Q
- You know, before my accident...  - That is the Queen of Hearts.

111
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,180
…事事顺利
...nothing was happening for me.

112
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,880
现在我的腿被粗鲁的人砍伤
Now I've had my leg hacked off by savages,

113
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,720
被马车压过，然后被锯掉
mangled by chariots, sawed off by lumberjacks.

114
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,920
嗯，还被一只鱼叉穿过，我一直在工作
Hell, I've even had a harpoon through it. I'm working all the time.

115
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,800
这是黑桃二
That is the two of spades.

116
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,840
- 片场正想要补偿你  - 抱歉，沙巴提尼先生
- The studio is just trying to do right by you.  - Excuse me, Mr. Sabatini.

117
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,040
钱就收下吧
Take the money.

118
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,410
无论如何，娱乐圈不适合你，罗依
Anyway, gags are not for you, Roy.

119
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,780
你该是个读书人
You're a college man.

120
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,870
我不是
Wasn't me.

121
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,650
一个瘸子的忠告…
One cripple to another...

122
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,050
我没有朝你丢橘子
I didn't throw orange at you.

123
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,220
…没有女人值得为她自杀
...no woman is worth suicide.

124
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,650
想要跟那人一样当明星，看在老天的分上
Like the guy's a movie star, for chrissake.

125
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,670
你的朋友是个海盗吗？
Was your friend a pirate?

126
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,150
你的朋友是个海盗吗？
Was your friend a pirate?

127
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,220
有时候是
Sometimes.

128
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,090
他当海盗才伤了脚？
Is that how he hurt his leg?

129
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,260
不，他…他为电影做特技
No, he... He does tricks for pictures.

130
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,130
就是电影啊
You know, flickers.

131
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,100
动画片
Moving pictures.

132
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,160
- 我没看过电影  - 你也没错过什么啦
- I never seen one.  - You're not missing much.

133
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,030
你也跟你朋友做一样的工作吗？
Is that what you do, like your friend?

134
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,280
只做了一次
Just once.

135
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,420
现在可以跟我说故事了吗？
Will you tell me the story now?

136
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,010
- 什么故事？ - 史诗故事啊
- What story?  - The epic.

137
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,220
好吧
All right.

138
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,650
好，闭上眼睛
All right, close your eyes.

139
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,060
你看到什么？
What do you see?

140
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,770
什么都没有
Nothing.

141
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,910
柔一柔
Rub them.

142
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,410
看到星星没有？
Can you see the stars?

143
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,180
是的
Yes.

144
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,510
那是一个多星的夜晚
It was a starry night.

145
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:10,320
四个人在一个小岛上焦急地等着
Four men waited impatiently on a small island

146
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,380
四周海水平静无声
surrounded by a calm sea.

147
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,660
但是这平静是假的
But that calmness was deceptive.

148
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,830
因为在那时候
For at that moment

149
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,340
有个腿绑绷带的印度人，朝向他们游了过来
an Indian with a bandaged thigh swam towards them.

150
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,810
告诉我，印度人
Tell me, Indian.

151
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,280
是真的吗？
Is it true?

152
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,480
路易奇，什么是真的？
Luigi, is what true?

153
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,660
欧迪亚斯总督明天将会将你的孪生哥哥处死
Governor Odious will execute your twin brother tomorrow morning.

154
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,630
我可怜的哥哥
My poor brother.

155
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,780
现在他们有五个人
In all, there were five of them.

156
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,510
他们只有一个共通点
They had only one thing in common,

157
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,520
憎恨欧迪亚斯总督
a hatred of Governor Odious.

158
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,820
第一个人以前是个奴隶，奥塔・班加
The first was an ex-slave, Otta Benga.

159
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,060
他与他哥哥生而为奴隶
He and his brother were born into slavery

160
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,260
工作只是为了填满邪恶欧迪亚斯总督的金库而已
only to fill the coffers of the evil Governor Odious.

161
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,210
有天他正在田里做苦力…
One day while toiling in the fields...

162
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,320
因为哥哥的死伤心至极，他释放了其他奴隶
Heartbroken at his brother's death, he freed the slaves

163
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,800
发誓他要亲自杀死欧迪亚斯总督
and swore that he would be responsible for Governor Odious's death.

164
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,900
我喜欢他
I like him.

165
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,270
然后是印度人
Then, there was the Indian,

166
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,180
当他紧张时，总是会拨弄眉毛
who, whenever anxious, always stroked his brow.

167
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:23,110
印度人原本要娶世界上最美的女人
The Indian was supposedly married to the most beautiful squaw in the world

168
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,850
但是没人见过这女人
yet nobody had seen her.

169
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,360
为了证实，他伪装成q疯病患者
To verify this, Odious disguised himself as a leper

170
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:34,420
他见到她的倒影时，立刻为她神魂颠倒
but when he saw her reflection, he was smitten.

171
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:43,270
锁住他的小屋，印度人持续看守着
Locking the doors to his wigwam, the Indian stood guard.

172
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,340
但是他不知道，他看守的是个空屋
Little did he know, he was guarding an empty home

173
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,350
因为他的妻子已经被欧迪亚斯总督所绑架
for his wife had already been kidnapped by the evil Governor Odious.

174
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,120
但是那女人拒绝了总督
But the squaw refused to show herself to him.

175
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,090
欧迪亚斯将她送进“绝望迷宫”里面去
So, Odious had her thrown into the Labyrinth of Despair.

176
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,830
她终于明白，唯一的出路是
Eventually she realized there was only one way out.

177
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,280
因为妻子的死
While mourning his wife's death

178
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,920
印度人发了血誓，决不再看其他女人一眼
the Indian took a blood oath never to look at another squaw

179
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,830
发誓他要亲自杀死欧迪亚斯总督
and that he would be responsible for Governor Odious's death.

180
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,090
我也喜欢他
I like him, too.

181
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,300
路易奇是炸药专家
Luigi was an explosive expert.

182
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,070
当欧迪亚斯听说了他的新式炸药的威力
When Odious heard about the power of his new bombs,

183
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,370
他将他从公开场合带走
he had him publicly banished.

184
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,280
他回来后，路易奇发现所有的人都躲着他
On his return, Luigi discovered that everybody hid from him

185
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,760
因为连跟他说话，也会招致杀身之祸
because even speaking to him was punishable by death.

186
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,190
当连他的神父也拒绝听他告解之后
But when his own priest refused to hear his confession,

187
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:14,190
路易奇发誓他要亲自杀死欧迪亚斯总督
Luigi swore that he would be responsible for Governor Odious's death!

188
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,270
下一个是英国自然科学家
Next was the English naturalist

189
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,910
查尔斯・达尔文
Charles Darwin.

190
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,180
他热爱生命
He loved all living things,

191
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,150
动物，植物，所有生物
creatures, plants, everything alive.

192
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,160
达尔文有个害羞又聪明的伴
Darwin was always accompanied by his shy, brilliant colleague,

193
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,460
猴子华乐斯
Wallace the monkey.

194
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,050
那是什么，华乐斯？
What is that, Wallace?

195
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,430
我不知道为何火鹤全身粉红
I don't know why flamingos are pink.

196
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,440
虽然他们一起已经发现了许多理论
Even though they had developed many theories together

197
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,030
他们仍持续寻找
they were still looking for something.

198
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,080
- 什么？ - 蝴蝶
- What?  - Butterfly.

199
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,110
猜的好
That's a good guess.

200
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,980
是一种非常特殊的蝴蝶
In fact, a very specific butterfly

201
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,460
叫做“新美洲蝶”
called Americana Exotica.

202
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,290
有一天，欧迪亚斯寄给他一只死掉的
One day, Odious sent them a dead one.

203
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,330
蝴蝶礁
Butterfly Reef.

204
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,730
欧迪亚斯，是个坏人吗？
This Odious, it's bad man?

205
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,270
喔！是呀！
Oh, yeah.

206
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,240
蝴蝶礁
Butterfly Reef.

207
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,050
欧迪亚斯总督就是将这些人放逐在那
That's where Governor Odious chose to banish our heroes,

208
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,960
要他们绝望
to mock them,

209
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,290
希望他们在挣扎生存的过程中会自相残杀
hoping that in their fight for survival they would devour each other.

210
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,990
所以，这些buccaneer（海盗）就在这珊瑚礁上
So, the buccaneers were trapped on this island.

211
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,930
什么是buccaneer？
What means a buccaneer?

212
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,500
就是海盗一样的意思
Well, it's like a pirate. Pirate and buccaneer, it's like the same thing.

213
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,980
但我不喜欢海盗的故事
But I don't like pirate stories.

214
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,750
是你叫我说海盗故事的
You're the one who asked for a pirate story.

215
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,180
- 我没有  - 你有
- No.  - Yes, you did.

216
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,050
我只是想问，你朋友是不是海盗
I just wanted to know if your friend was a pirate.

217
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,890
- 为什么？ - 因为他只有一条腿
- Why?  - Because he has just one leg.

218
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,690
喔！
Oh, right.

219
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,470
是呀！那不是海盗故事，那是强盗的故事
Well, yeah, it's not a pirate story. It's a story about bandits.

220
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,530
事实上，我们的蒙面侠，不会游泳
In fact, our masked hero couldn't even swim.

221
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,230
我要学游泳
I need to learn to swim.

222
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,450
最后，门牙有缝的蒙面侠
Finally, very little was known about the gap-toothed Masked Bandit.

223
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,650
- 跟我父亲一样？ - 就像是父亲
- Like my father?  - Yes, your father.

224
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,950
但是他有个孪生兄弟，蓝侠
Except that he and his twin brother, the Blue Bandit,

225
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,800
蓝侠逃过了西班牙欧迪亚斯总督的处死令
had escaped execution from the Spanish Governor Odious.

226
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,860
因为知道他们最好分头逃亡
Knowing that their chances of survival were better apart

227
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,430
生存机会比较大，他们分开了
the two brothers separated

228
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,970
发誓他们将会亲手杀死欧迪亚斯总督
swearing that they would kill Governor Odious.

229
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,840
我们该来计划一下
We must conceive a plan!

230
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,650
我要逃离这个岛，拯救我兄弟
I need to get off this island, and rescue my twin brother.

231
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,030
什么？什么？
What? What?

232
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,100
大象？
All elephants?

233
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,480
我说，我们…
I say, we...

234
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,750
我有主意了
I have an idea.

235
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,990
达尔文！真是个好点！
Darwin! That was a great idea!

236
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,850
快，奥塔・班加！
Come on, Otta Benga!

237
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,330
再见，朋友，游的愉快！
Goodbye, my beautiful friend! Have a nice swim!

238
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,300
达尔文，你真是天！
Darwin, you are a genius!

239
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,860
非常感谢！
Much obliged!

240
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,410
你的点子怎么想到的？
Where do you get these ideas?

241
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,250
那是什么，朋友？
What is it, my friend?

242
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:54,030
真可怜，这男人疯了
How sad. The tortures of this world have driven the poor man mad.

243
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,870
不是的
Not true.

244
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,840
他说他是由神秘教派所派来
He said he has been sent by his mystic cult

245
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,010
帮助我们对抗欧迪亚斯总督跟他的西班牙党羽
to help us against Governor Odious and his Spanish henchmen.

246
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,740
这地方原本是座森林，到处是鸟儿与树木
This region was once a lush forest alive with birds and sacred trees

247
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,680
但欧迪亚斯将他们都烧掉了
but Odious had them all burned down.

248
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,130
欧迪亚斯总是说鸟儿在肚子里面比较安全
He also says the birds are safe inside his belly

249
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,900
但是我们要小心，因为适者生存的法则
but we must take care for only the fittest shall survive.

250
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,030
告诉他我们不了解神秘教
Tell him we have no use of a mystic.

251
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,380
我们正在执行一个危险任务
We are on a dangerous mission.

252
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,810
我们要快去城里面，拯救我兄弟
We need to hurry to the fort to save my twin brother.

253
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,940
他会拖慢我们的
He will only slow us down.

254
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,950
鱼，男士们！
Fish, ser!

255
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,210
靠边，朋友
Stand aside, my friend.

256
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,320
在你一眨眼之前，我就可以将这门打开
Before you say kaboom, I have this door open.

257
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,660
饶恕我，伟大的教主，原谅我的不敬
Forgive me, wise mystic, for my disrespect.

258
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,270
毫无疑问的，你有战争的天份
Undoubtedly, you have a flair for war-mongering.

259
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,950
若是你能加入我们的行列
It would be my honor if you consider joining us

260
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,480
那将是我们极大的荣耀
on our quest.

261
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,850
我们要拯救我兄弟！
We must save your brother!

262
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,160
首先
First,

263
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,760
小小册是
a little test.

264
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,570
你不可以在这中断
You can't stop there.

265
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,440
我只是想玩个小测验，我要你去摸我的脚趾头
I just wanna play a little game. I want you to go outside and touch one of my toes.

266
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,210
不，我要听故事，后来蓝侠怎么了？
No, tell me the story. What happened with the Blue Bandit?

267
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,980
不会很久的
It won't take long.

268
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:07,210
- 到床尾，去摸我的脚趾  - 好的
- Just go outside and touch one of my toes.  - Okay.

269
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,580
- 我在摸你的小趾  - 不！
- I'm touching your little toe.  - No!

270
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,830
别告诉我，你摸那一趾，让我猜
Please don't tell me which toe you're touching. I gotta guess.

271
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,830
那是游戏的重点
That's the whole point of the game. All right.

272
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,560
我在摸了
I'm touching one.

273
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,870
我在摸了
I'm touching one.

274
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,110
你在摸大拇趾？
You're touching my big toe?

275
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,380
你是说真的吗？
Are you telling the truth?

276
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,890
看
Look.

277
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,620
真的
Really.

278
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,400
喔！我猜对了？
Oh, I got that?

279
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,230
怎么了？
What happened?

280
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,200
他兄弟怎么了？有被救出来吗？
What happened with his brother? Did he save him?

281
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,140
不，不，不，你是在说笑吗？
No, no, no, no. Were you telling a story?

282
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,210
不，不，不，你是说真的吗？
No, no, no. Were you telling the truth just now?

283
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,410
我是说真的
No. I was telling the truth.

284
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,640
不，你说假话
No. You just said no, you weren't telling the truth.

285
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,310
不，我说得是真的
No, I tell you it.

286
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,010
- 你说真的吗？ - 是呀！
- Were you telling the truth?  - Yeah.

287
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,320
当你摸我脚趾的时候？
When you just touched my toe?

288
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,390
- 你这小骗子  - 不是
- You little liar.  - No.

289
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,260
亚历珊卓，你有骗我吗？
Alexandria, were you lying to me?

290
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,930
我摸你的大姆指
I touch your big toe.

291
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,400
我们要快点！
We need to hurry!

292
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,170
你要我说完故事吗？
Do you want me to finish the story?

293
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,310
蒙面侠太晚抵达吊灯大厅
The Masked Bandit arrived at the Chandelier Hall too late.

294
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,750
欧迪亚斯已经折磨了他兄弟与同党
Odious had already tortured his brother and crew

295
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,310
并且吊死他们
and hung them.

296
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,240
好，够了！这里不是马戏团，也不是你们的游乐场…
All right, that's it! It's not a circus. It's not a playground for all your...

297
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,680
够了！听见没？
Please! Are you listening to me?

298
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,840
滚出去！
Get out of here!

299
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,480
- 你放开他  - 过来，宝贝
- You leave her alone.  - Come here, baby.

300
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,350
走开！去你的！
Get off! Goddamn!

301
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,390
不，不，宝贝，过来，过来
No, no, no, sweetheart, come here, come here. Come on.

302
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,250
爸爸？
Dad?

303
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,950
- 爸爸？爸爸？ - 我觉得不太舒服
- Dad? Dad?  - I'm not feeling real well.

304
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,180
- 你要什么？ - 他又来了
- What do you want?  - He's doing it again.

305
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,320
停下来？放开他！
Will you stop that? Leave him alone!

306
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,820
- 那是什么？ - 食物
- What's that?  - Food.

307
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,260
- 那里拿的？ - 教堂
- Where'd you get it?  - The chapel.

308
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,990
很抱歉我对你大吼大叫
I'm sorry I shouted at you.

309
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,600
当时我太生气
I was angry.

310
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,040
没关系
No problem.

311
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,030
你是在拯救我的灵魂吗？你是在拯救我的灵魂吗？
Are you trying to save my soul? Are you trying to save my soul?

312
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,720
- 你听的懂吗？ - 什么？
- Do you understand me?  - What?

313
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,910
- 你懂我的意思吗？ - 你说什么？
- Did you understand what I meant?  - What you said?

314
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,750
我说，你是在拯救我的灵魂吗？
I said, are you trying to save my soul?

315
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,020
- 给我那个  - 什么那个？
- Giving me that.  - What mean that?

316
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,390
圣餐，那是…
The Eucharist. It's a...

317
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,030
什么？
What?

318
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,300
圣餐，你给我的东西…
The Eucharist. The thing you gave me. It's a...

319
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,130
可以拯救你的灵魂
It saves your soul.

320
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,300
我给你的东西，什么？
The thing I gave to you, what?

321
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,310
你给我的一小块面包，拯救我的灵魂
The little piece of bread that you just gave me.

322
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,110
可以拯救你的灵魂
It saves your soul.

323
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,340
- 什么？什么？什么？ - 你担心我吗？
- What? What? What?  - Are you worried about me?

324
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,050
拯救你的灵魂，你知道“灵魂”是什么意思吗？
Saves your soul. Do you know what "soul" means?

325
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,610
- 不  - 像是力量一样
- No.  - It's like strength.

326
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,860
为何那老人晚上要将牙齿放在杯子里？
Why does the old man keep his teeth in a glass at night?

327
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:25,360
那是他保存力量的方法，他的灵魂
It's where he keeps his strength, his spirit.

328
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,260
他的灵魂在那牙齿里？
His spirit is in those teeth.

329
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,540
是呀！
Yeah.

330
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,810
喔！你现在失去了一些力量
Oh, you're missing a little strength

331
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,450
就在你的嘴巴前面
right in the front of your mouth.

332
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,920
教堂在大道上，是吗？
The chapel's in the main block, isn't it?

333
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,520
是的，蒙面侠怎么了？
Yes. What happened with the Black Bandit?

334
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,200
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

335
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,500
没事
It's okay.

336
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,040
他们都将药物存放再大街上，是吗？
They keep the medicine in the main block, don't they?

337
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,370
是的
Yes.

338
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,760
从我身上拿走的，是无法取代的
That which has been taken from me can never be replaced.

339
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,960
我的兄弟…
My brother...

340
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,870
- 为何他要这样说？ - 因为他是你父亲
- Why he speaks like this?  - Because he's your father.

341
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,810
但父亲死了
But my father is dead.

342
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,140
什么？
What?

343
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,680
好，那你要我…那你要我怎么说话？
Okay, how do you want me... How do you want him to speak?

344
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,580
我想到我们一起的快乐时光
I think of all the joys we had.

345
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,880
正常的说话，像你一样
Normal, like you.

346
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,550
我没有来得及救你，因为当时我虚弱
I could've saved you, but I was weak.

347
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,050
我的悲伤以化成血染的复仇
My grief has gone blood-red with revenge.

348
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,190
我现在已经更强壮
I'm stronger now.

349
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:09,570
我会在世上各个角落找寻欧迪亚斯总督的踪迹，然后杀掉他！
I will search the four corners of this Earth, find Governor Odious and joyously kill him!

350
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,010
以蓝侠之名，我在此发誓
By the Blue Bandit's honor, I swear

351
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,210
我会歼灭他，还有他的所爱！
I will annihilate him and everything that he loves!

352
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:31,530
我会歼灭他！我会歼灭他！
I will destroy him! I will destroy him!

353
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,860
我会歼灭他！歼灭他！
Destroy him! I will destroy him!

354
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,510
还有所有西班牙的东西
And every Spanish thing.

355
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,870
我还以为他是西班牙人
I thought he was Spanish.

356
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,940
不
No.

357
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,350
他是法国人
He was French.

358
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,440
你们跟我同一阵线吗？
Are you with me, bandits?

359
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,900
达尔文！要怎么去找欧迪亚斯总督？
Darwin! Which way to Governor Odious?

360
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:25,480
我跟他说过，别将地图跟虫子放在一起
I tell him not to put the map with the bugs.

361
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,050
我们迷路了吗？
Are we lost?

362
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,210
抱歉，队长
Sorry, Capitaine.

363
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,390
嘿！不！
Hey! No!

364
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,960
嘿！你不可以吃，那有毒！
Hey! You can't eat it, it's poisonous!

365
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,310
他说什么？
What's he saying?

366
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,740
他说跟着他，可以到青翠葱绿的牧场！
He says we should follow him to greener pastures!

367
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:57,580
- 什么？ - 他说下面有青翠葱绿的牧场
- What?  - He say it's greener down there.

368
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,710
绿洲？下面？
Green? Down where?

369
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,880
我不知道
I don't know.

370
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,120
青翠葱绿的牧场！
To greener pastures!

371
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,680
慢点！
Slow down!

372
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,950
他肚子里的鸟儿渴望着绿洲！
The birds in his belly crave greener pastures!

373
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,090
嘿！青翠葱绿的牧场
Hey! It is greener down there.

374
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,830
青翠葱绿的牧场
Greener pastures.

375
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,340
慢点！
Slow down!

376
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,750
别跑！越跑毒性发作越快！
Please don't run! The poison works faster if you run!

377
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,760
慢点
Slow down.

378
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,470
那有毒
It's poisonous.

379
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,140
什么？
What?

380
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,500
他在指引我们方向
He's giving us directions.

381
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,660
去！
Go!

382
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,990
奴隶！
Slaves!

383
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,370
欧迪亚斯的旗帜
Odious's flag.

384
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,540
我们要是放那些奴隶
We must free the slaves.

385
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,370
告诉我，亚历珊卓，你会看英文吗？
Tell me, Alexandria, do you read English?

386
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,600
你总是在最美好，
You always stop at the same part when it's very beautiful

387
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,200
最有趣的时候停下来
and interesting.

388
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,440
我想知道你会不会看英文
I just wanted to know if you can read English.

389
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,840
会吗？
Can you?

390
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,480
- 你会看英文吗？ - 是呀！
- Can you read English?  - Yeah.

391
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,180
- 这是什么？ - 纸
- What's this?  - Paper.

392
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,050
不，这是什么？这个
No. What's this? This.

393
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,530
M，o，r，p，h…
M-o-r-p-h...

394
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,660
三
Three.

395
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,560
- 那是什么？ - 三
- What's that?  - Three.

396
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,000
很好
That's good.

397
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,000
我一直睡不好，故事不记得了
I'm having a hard time sleeping and I can't remember that story.

398
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,310
我需要一些药物
I need some pills.

399
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,480
我需要的药物，装在写有这些字的瓶子里面
I need pills in a bottle that has this written on them.

400
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,710
M，o，r，p，h，i，n，三？
M-o-r-p-h-i-n-three?

401
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:05,720
是的，而且就在大道上
Yes. And it's in the main block.

402
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,290
大街上的房间里
In that room in the main block.

403
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,760
懂吗？
You understand?

404
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,400
- 问问护士长  - 我是以朋友的身份求你
- Ask the head nurse.  - I'm asking you as a friend.

405
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:23,930
- 但那是偷窃  - 不，若是你需要，就不是偷
- But it's stealing.  - No, it's not. Not if you need it.

406
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,310
那跟从教堂偷面包没有差别
It's no different than stealing bread from a church.

407
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,180
- 我去帮你问他们  - 不
- I'll ask them for you.  - No.

408
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,820
那是同伙的秘密
It's a bandit secret.

409
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,860
我需要那药丸，才能继续说故事，懂吗？
I need the pills to finish the story. Understand?

410
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,120
- 我拿不到…  - 我会去做
- I can't get it...  - I'll do it.

411
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:48,560
谢谢
Thanks.

412
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,180
你看起来好漂亮
You look beautiful.

413
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,290
你为何在脸颊上擦上红色？
Why do you put red on your cheeks?

414
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:13,550
因为那会让你看来更漂亮
Because it makes you look pretty

415
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,430
也更健康
and healthy, too.

416
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,300
- 记得，午餐前回来  - 我知道！
- Remember, back before lunch.  - I know!

417
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,070
亚历珊卓，今天没有舔冰块？
Alexandria, no licking the ice today?

418
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,700
没有，谢谢！再见！
No. Thank you! Bye!

419
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,420
也许咬一口，但是一窝蛇？
One bite maybe. But a pit of snakes?

420
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,650
[药房]

421
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:37,140
M，o，r，p，h，i，n，三，M，o，r，p，h，i-n…
M-o-r-p-h-i-n-three. M-o-r-p-h-i-n...

422
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,110
M，o，r，p，h，i，n…
M-o-r-p-h-i-n...

423
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,880
也许你…我知道，听我的很重要
Maybe you got... I know it's important that you listen to me.

424
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,940
你也该想想你的其他孩子
You've gotta think of your other children.

425
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,810
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

426
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:27,660
你该警告其他孩子，有关响尾蛇的声音
You have to warn your other children about the sounds of rattlesnakes.

427
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:32,560
这不是好时机，这附近到处有蛇窝
This isn't a good time. There are snake pits all over this area.

428
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:42,900
醒醒！醒醒！快起来，否则他们会砍你
Wake up! Wake up! You better get up or they'll chop you.

429
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,280
快起来！你最好快起来，让他们知道你只是在睡觉
You get up! You better get up and show these people you are sleeping.

430
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,780
你不起来那人会剁了你，快起来！
These men will chop you if you don't get up. Get up!

431
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,320
快起来，不是开玩笑
Get up. This isn't funny.

432
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,750
求你，离开这里
Please, let's leave this place.

433
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,840
来！
Come on. Come on!

434
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,110
我一直都那样做
I do that all the time.

435
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:26,120
你要做的就是换掉湿的衣服，将他们藏起来直到干了为止
All you have to do is change your clothes and hide the wet ones until they're dry.

436
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,810
你知道我遇到可怕的事情时，我怎么做吗？
You know what I do when something frightens me?

437
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:34,760
我就说神奇咒语
I say the magic words.

438
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,260
走开，走开，走开，走开
Googly, googly, googly, begone.

439
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,660
我们来一起练习
Let's practice together.

440
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,370
神奇咒语
The magic words.

441
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:53,270
走开，走开，走开
Googly, googly, googly. Go away.

442
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,810
- 你拿到我要你拿的东西吗？ - 是的
- Did you get what I sent you for?  - Yes.

443
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,590
- 这个  - 是吗？
- This it is.  - Yeah?

444
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,560
里面只有三个
There's only three in here.

445
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,720
- 你叫我拿三个  - 不，我叫你拿一整瓶
- You asked me for three.  - No, I asked you for a full bottle.

446
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,170
- 但，你写的…  - 这瓶子里有满满的吗？
- But, you wrote...  - Was this bottle full of pills?

447
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,770
- 里面有更多药丸吗？ - 是呀！
- Were there more pills in here?  - Yeah.

448
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,100
那你拿去哪了？
What did you do with them?

449
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,800
丢进马桶里面了
I throw them in toilet.

450
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:30,510
因为你写三个，我才丢掉其他的
But I throw them away because you wrote

451
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:35,380
m-o-r-p-h-i-n-三
m-o-r-p-h-i-n-three.

452
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,850
这可以帮你入眠吗？
Will they help you sleep?

453
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,130
可以小睡一下
A nap perhaps.

454
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,160
我们要解放奴隶
We must free the slaves.

455
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,230
他们有解放了奴隶吗？
Did they free the slaves?

456
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:15,910
出来，欧迪亚斯
Come out, Odious.

457
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:41,070
像只蝴蝶
Just like a butterfly.

458
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,820
为何又戴面具？
Why the mask again?

459
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,720
他不想吓到她
He doesn't want to scare her.

460
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:57,790
她对他一无所知，但是他却知道她的所有事情
She doesn't know anything about him, but he knew everything about her.

461
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,090
眼睛的颜色
The color of her eyes.

462
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:05,660
棕色
Brown.

463
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,130
她最爱的食物
Her favorite food.

464
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,500
橘子？
Orange?

465
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,670
她最喜欢的书
Her favorite book.

466
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,900
圣经
Bible.

467
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:18,070
各位，她是我的
Boys, she's mine.

468
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,250
- 炸弹怎么了？ - 什么？
- What about the bomb?  - What?

469
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,580
炸弹
The bomb.

470
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,490
强盗们绑架了公主，留下了她的小表妹
The bandits kidnapped the princess, leaving behind her little nephew.

471
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,970
他们从高山上骑马下山
They rode down from the high mountain deserts

472
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,810
到了他喜爱的地方
to a place he loved.

473
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,350
他跟他孪生兄弟玩耍的地方
He had played as a child with his twin.

474
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,120
就在湖的中央
A palace in the middle of a lake.

475
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,030
那可怜的人怎么了？
What's the matter with that poor fellow?

476
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,570
自从印度人发生了不幸
Ever since the Indian's misfortune

477
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,700
他发誓不再看其他女人
he took a vow to never look at another squaw.

478
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,770
但是男人一旦蒙住脸，就无法显现她的内心所望
But a man cannot show what's in his heart when he hides his face.

479
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,690
谁，请问你是谁？
Who, may I ask, are you?

480
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,810
大家都叫我蒙面侠
To most I am known as the Masked Bandit.

481
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,090
东南方的灾难大侠？
The Scourge of the Southeast?

482
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:12,450
正是
That's the one.

483
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,500
但也只有我戴上面具才算是
But that's only when I wear the mask.

484
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,850
你是谁？
Who are you?

485
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,350
护士伊芙琳
Nurse Evelyn.

486
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:44,290
我曾经是伊芙琳、伊芙列丝、伊芙哈特女士，但是我现在就是…
Once I was Lady Evelyn Everest Everhardt, and now I am simply called...

487
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,290
- 伊芙琳姊妹  - 她不是姊妹
- Sister Evelyn.  - She is not a sister.

488
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,460
不，什么？她是的
Bless you. No. What? Yes, she is.

489
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,300
他没有兄弟姊妹
She doesn't have brothers and sisters.

490
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:58,330
不，她是修女，跟其他修女一样
No, she's a nun, like these nuns out here.

491
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,410
他转向蒙面侠，说…
And she turned from the Masked Bandit, and she said...

492
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,510
- 我可以跟你坦白说吗？ - 当然
- May I be frank with you?  - Of course.

493
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,320
虽然我将我的生命侍奉主
Although I've dedicated my life to God and goodness

494
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:16,790
我私底下喜欢朝神父丢橘子
I secretly love throwing oranges at our priest.

495
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,350
向左转两个弯，就是厕所
Take two turns to the left and go to the bathroom.

496
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,830
不，你看了我的纸条
No, you read my note.

497
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,270
你说什么，快去厕所？
What are you talking about? Go to the bathroom.

498
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,130
不
No.

499
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,570
那你怎么知道我对神父丢橘子？
How do you know about the priest and the orange?

500
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,110
每个人都知道你喜欢丢神父橘子
Everybody knows you like throwing oranges at the priest.

501
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,340
每个神父都知道，我不是从你那胡言乱语的纸条得到的讯息
Even the priest knows, but I didn't find that out from your gibberish message.

502
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,180
那不是胡言乱语
It's not gibberish.

503
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,140
她想问你，会停留多久
She wants to ask you how much days I have to stay here.

504
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,050
嗯，我要你待到好了为止
Well, I want you to stay here until you get better.

505
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:15,880
她的石膏几天后就可以拆除
Her cast will come off in a few days

506
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:20,120
但我要她待到完全康复为止
but I'd like her to stay here until she's completely recovered.

507
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:32,000
她说我们在这里待太久了
She wants to say that we are spend here too much times

508
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,900
我们必须离开这里
and we have to leave the city.

509
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:38,200
不，你告诉她，别再果园里工作
No, well, you just tell her that you shouldn't be working in the groves.

510
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,010
那样太危险了
That at your age it's dangerous

511
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,050
你剩下的日子，只要捡水果就好
and you'll spend the rest of your days picking fruit.

512
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:45,740
否则她会摔下来，一定会摔下来
And then she'll fall. She surely will fall.

513
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,540
谢谢
Thank you.

514
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,710
- 她怎么说？ - 他说好的
- What did she say?  - She says okay.

515
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,550
- 真的？ - 真的
- Really?  - Really.

516
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,640
亚历珊卓，他问了我一些事情，对吗？
Alexandria, she asked me something, didn't she?

517
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,620
不，那是我们之间的对话
No, that how we speak.

518
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,080
- 你确定？ - 确定
- You sure?  - Sure.

519
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:51,180
美丽的机器，美丽的机器
Beautiful machina. Beautiful machina.

520
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:11,500
美丽的机器，美丽的机器
Beautiful machina. Beautiful machina.

521
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:18,300
美丽的机器，美丽的机器
Beautiful machina. Beautiful machina.

522
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,710
这真是慷慨的出价啊
It's a very generous offer.

523
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:25,740
若你看这个数字，比我一年所赚的钱还要多
If you look over here at the number, it's more money than I actually make a year.

524
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,480
我还要加一些东西
I want to add something to it.

525
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:29,490
别一开始就加这个加那个
Don't start adding stuff to this.

526
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,220
你知道，片厂里面有数不清的律师
You know, the studio's got a building full of lawyers.

527
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:36,350
跳跃，坠落，撞车
Jumping, falling, crashing.

528
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:38,990
我是说，牛仔将会赢得那份殊荣
I mean, cowhands are getting all the glory.

529
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,930
无论如何，那是谁的主意？
Whose idea was it anyway?

530
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,800
从火车铁桥跳上一匹马？
Jumping onto a horse from a train bridge?

531
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:52,270
将这一幕写进合约里面，我就会签署
Add the screening to the contract and I'll sign it.

532
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,540
那要是我死了，钱会怎么处理？
What happens to the money if I die?

533
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:58,950
罗依，你别再干这种自杀的是晴了
Roy, you need to get off this suicide thing.

534
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:03,690
让医师好好的为你治疗
Let the doctors finish what they started.

535
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,310
问题不再他的背
Problem is not his back.

536
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:10,820
而是破碎的新
It's a broken heart.

537
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:14,490
他需要忘记掉她
He needs to get over her.

538
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,660
我是说，他又不是第一个失去女人的男人
I mean, he's not the first guy to lose a girl.

539
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,740
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

540
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,710
你是个名人
You are someone famous.

541
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,240
他们是这样说得啦
So they tell me.

542
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,640
嘿！孩子！
Hey, kid!

543
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,990
我为你做了这个
I made this for you.

544
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,090
面具后面是谁？
Who's in the mask?

545
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:56,040
你坐在轮椅上
You in the wheelchair.

546
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,740
很漂亮
It's beautiful.

547
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,310
我会永久保存
I'll keep it forever.

548
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:07,820
我希望我不会好转
I hope I never get better.

549
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:14,790
- 为什么？ - 这样我就可以一直跟你在一起
- Why?  - Because I want to stay here with you.

550
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:26,200
- 嘿！这是今天要给你的  - 真的？
- Hey, this came for you today.  - Really?

551
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:31,340
- 喜欢巧克力吗？ - 喜欢
- You like chocolate?  - I like it.

552
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,540
- 你要我讲完故事吗？ - 是的
- Do you want me to finish the story?  - Yes.

553
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,750
- 我需要帮忙  - 要帮什么忙？
- I need a favor.  - What kind of favor?

554
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,160
你知道我们的朋友华特？
You know our friend Walt?

555
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:49,320
- 他不是我朋友  - 他也不是我朋友
- He's not my friend.  - He's not my friend either.

556
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:54,960
我从他那拿到这钥匙，因为他偷走了我的药丸
I retrieved this key from him because I think he's been stealing my pills.

557
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,200
我想他把它藏在那个小柜子里面
I think he's got them in his cabinet there.

558
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,830
我要你去查看一下
I want you to go check and see if he's got them.

559
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,400
为什么？我已经帮你拿了那瓶药丸
Why? I got you the bottle.

560
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:09,640
里面的药物，不够帮助我入睡
There weren't enough in there for me to go to sleep.

561
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:16,710
拜托，做个好强盗
Come on. Be a good bandit.

562
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,180
我不要做强盗
I don't want to be a bandit.

563
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,490
那真糟
That's too bad.

564
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:31,960
因为欧迪亚斯的城堡是被一个很大的蓝色城市围绕
Because Odious's castle is surrounded by a big blue city.

565
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:39,470
就是那群强盗要去的地方，最后一战
And that's where the bandits are headed for their final encounter.

566
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:46,340
这是故事最棒的部份，因为你就要离开了
It's the best part of the story, and since you're leaving soon

567
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:50,680
我不想让你一辈子都在猜，故事的结局是怎样
I'd hate for you to spend your whole life wondering how it turned out.

568
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,280
- 抽屉里有什么？ - 东西
- What's in the drawer?  - Stuff.

569
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,960
- 什么东西？ - 华特从我这偷走的东西
- What kind of stuff?  - Stuff Walt's been stealing from me.

570
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:03,960
什么？
What?

571
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,030
你没有去看我也不知道
I won't know until you go look.

572
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:09,370
- 发誓你会讲完这故事？ - 是呀！
- Promise you'll finish the story?  - Yeah.

573
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,130
是一个棕色的瓶子
It's that brown bottle.

574
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:40,770
- 这个吗？ - 就是
- This one?  - That's the one.

575
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:44,170
他从我这偷走的
I think he stole it from me.

576
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,080
那原本是我的
That's mine.

577
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:56,580
我们要往那去？
Where did we leave off?

578
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,550
他们诉说彼此的秘密
They were telling secrets each other.

579
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,290
我要去找谋害我父亲的人
I'm looking for the man who murdered my father.

580
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:03,820
蒙面侠说道
The Black Bandit said.

581
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,890
我兄弟，蓝侠…
My brother, the Blue Masked Bandit...

582
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,100
他说…为父亲的死报仇
He said. ...tried to avenge our father's death.

583
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:13,900
我一直寻求复仇的机会
I've been on a quest for revenge.

584
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:15,130
被酷刑且吊死
Tortured and hung.

585
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:20,510
他告诉她一生的事迹，除了欧迪亚斯总督的名字以外
He told her everything about his life except for the name of Governor Odious.

586
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:22,510
你该走了
You need to leave.

587
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,880
你该走了
You should go.

588
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:36,320
但你答应过要讲完故事
But you promised you'll tell me the story.

589
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,790
你深深地打动了我的心，伊芙琳
You've captivated my heart, Evelyn.

590
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,130
那也是为何我再也不能束缚着你
That's why I can no longer keep you in captivity.

591
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,870
我已经深深地爱上了你
I've fallen in love with you.

592
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,940
但我全心全意为了复仇
But I am consumed with revenge.

593
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:02,380
我不是可以被爱的男人
I'm not a man who can be loved.

594
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:05,850
当我睡着后，你就要走
When I fall asleep, you gotta go.

595
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:11,520
明天也不要再来
And don't come back tomorrow.

596
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,160
好的
Okay.

597
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,100
谢谢
Thank you.

598
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,850
- 很抱歉  - 为什么？
- I'm sorry about this.  - Why?

599
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,850
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

600
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,750
为什么？
Why?

601
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,890
我不要你看到我这样
I don't want you to see me like this.

602
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:52,200
你认为你的魅力俘虏了我？
You think you took me captive?

603
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,610
事实上，你是我的救星
In fact, you're my savior.

604
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,350
我就像是在金色鸟笼里的小鸟
I was like a bird in a golden cage.

605
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:15,290
一旦解放了我，你就俘虏了我的心
By freeing me, you captured my heart.

606
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,060
让他们亲吻
Make them kiss.

607
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:29,700
不，我不要让他们接吻
No, I don't want to make them kiss.

608
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:32,670
为什么？
Why?

609
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:36,040
因为他们接下来要发现的事情
Because what they're about to find out.

610
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,880
她不该跟我们一起来的
She should have not come with us.

611
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:50,560
- 为什么？ - 太危险了
- Why?  - It is too dangerous.

612
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:55,120
要是我们被抓，欧迪亚斯总督一定会杀了她
If we are captured, Governor Odious shall surely kill her.

613
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,070
你说的是欧迪亚斯？
You mentioned Odious?

614
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,330
他就是我发过誓的仇家
He is my sworn enemy.

615
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,660
也是我未婚夫？
And my fianc?

616
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,060
不
No.

617
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,780
我要一直看着你，直到我死为止
I want to look at you until I die.

618
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:46,150
这世界真是神奇
What a mystery this world.

619
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:48,690
有一天你爱死他们
One day you love them

620
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:52,620
隔一天你又想将他们千刀万剐
and the next day you want to kill them a thousand times over.

621
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:57,950
上帝饶恕他
God forgive him.

622
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:07,600
幸好我没有吻过你
I'm glad I never kissed you.

623
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,940
她不能死
She can't die.

624
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:22,010
她还活着！
She's still alive!

625
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:32,090
她项链下黄金小盒挡住了子但
The solid gold locket stopped the bullet.

626
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:43,970
“我最亲爱的女儿
"My dearest daughter,

627
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:49,600
“永远不要为了名、利、权力或是安定而结婚
"never marry for money, fame, power or security.

628
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:54,910
“一定要顺着你心所想
"Always follow your heart.

629
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,680
“最爱你的父亲”
"Your ever-Ioving father."

630
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:59,520
小盒上面可以写那么多字？
It says all that on that little locket?

631
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:04,530
我从无法打开它
I've never been able to open it.

632
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,160
没有人可以打开它，你是第一个
No one's been able to open it. You're the first.

633
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:16,470
那时，他了解了，她就是他该爱的女人
And he knew that she was the woman he was supposed to love.

634
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:20,100
拜托，拜托，他们可以接吻了吗？
Please. Please. Now they can kiss-kiss?

635
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,540
是的
Yes.

636
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,370
但是得先结婚
But first, marriage.

637
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,450
然后才能接吻
And then they can kiss.

638
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,580
戒指
The ring.

639
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:23,740
神秘使者在你掌中发现危险
The Mystic spies danger in your palm.

640
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:27,070
你服用了太多药物，死亡离你不远了
You've taken too many pills. Death is near.

641
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,380
危险？
Danger?

642
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:32,780
自杀不是唯一的解决方法
Suicide is not the answer.

643
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,450
他说他知道一种秘密咒语
He says he also knows of a secret chant.

644
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,150
只要我们有险难…
Whenever we're in trouble...

645
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:45,220
好像是什么“googly-googly？”
Something about "googly-googly?"

646
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:50,330
他说要是你睡着，就永远不会再醒来
He says if you fall asleep, you will never wake up.

647
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,420
神秘使者是对的
The Mystic was right.

648
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,330
面无表情的神父出卖了他们
The stony-faced priest had betrayed them.

649
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,760
那他们有被救出来吗？
And then they were saved?

650
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:30,890
不
No.

651
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:39,130
没有人可以救他们了
There was no one left to save them.

652
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,750
华乐斯？
Wallace?

653
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:58,190
华乐斯，是你吗？华乐斯？
Wallace, is that you? Wallace?

654
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,750
不，是我
No, it's me.

655
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,530
难怪，这袋子这么重
No wonder the bag was so heavy.

656
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:27,380
发射！
Shoot!

657
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,630
发射！发射！射死他们，爸爸！
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot them, Daddy!

658
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:39,140
射死他们！
Shoot them!

659
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:47,400
爸爸，你认不出我吗？
Daddy, don't you recognize me?

660
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,210
你认不出我吗？是我！
Don't you? It's me!

661
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,850
你认不出我吗？
Don't you recognize me?

662
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,190
- 你是谁？ - 是我，爸爸
- Who are you?  - It's me, Da-da.

663
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,250
- 谁？ - 我！
- Who?  - Me!

664
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:06,190
- 我女儿？ - 是！你认出我了
- My daughter?  - Yes! You recognize me.

665
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:11,090
是呀！跟前妻生的女儿
Yeah. My daughter from a previous marriage.

666
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,600
是的
Yes.

667
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:18,800
因为你长了牙，所以我认不出来
I didn't recognize you because you have teeth.

668
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,110
你现在一定更强壮了
You must be stronger now.

669
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,220
不是睡觉的时候啊
Not the time to sleep now.

670
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:32,990
不是睡觉的时候啊
Not the time to sleep.

671
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:39,530
现在不是睡觉的时候啊
It's not time to sleep.

672
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,780
醒醒
Wake up.

673
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:12,830
醒醒，现在不是睡觉的时候
Wake up. It's not time to sleep now.

674
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,260
醒醒
Wake up.

675
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,630
别假装睡着
Don't pretend to sleep.

676
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:25,410
醒醒，笑一个，笑一个
Wake up. Laugh, laugh.

677
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:32,910
不是睡觉的时候
Not the time to sleep.

678
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:36,440
美洲新蝶
Americana Exotica.

679
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,250
史耐得博士知道这个吗？
Does Dr. Snider know about this?

680
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,690
他还在被观察中，但我想他正在好转中
He was under observation, but I thought he was getting better.

681
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:57,860
嘿！
Hey!

682
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:02,070
亚历珊卓，进去！快！
Alexandria, go inside! Go on!

683
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,800
好的，很抱歉，请继续
All right, carry on. Sorry about that.

684
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:26,490
罗依，醒醒
Roy, wake up. Wake up.

685
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,500
罗依，醒醒
Roy, wake up.

686
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:35,760
他们要剁掉你，切开你，快醒醒
They're going to cut you up. Gonna chop you up. Wake up.

687
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,170
- 走！快！ - 醒醒
- Go on! Shoo!  - Wake up.

688
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:43,970
喔！不，不
Oh, no, no, no.

689
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:47,020
他还是跟往常一样，你知道，微笑，玩弄牙齿
He was his usual self, you know, smiling away, playing with his teeth.

690
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,780
我觉得不太舒服，医生
I just don't feel very well, Doc.

691
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:53,050
我不知道我怎么了，咳嗽
I don't know what the hell's wrong with me. Cough.

692
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,650
什么，吃药让我精神错乱了吗？
What, am I going delirious from the medication?

693
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,960
我不知道怎么了…
I don't know what the hell...

694
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:04,930
罗依！
Roy!

695
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:10,630
罗依，我还以为你死了
Roy, I thought you were dead.

696
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:14,510
看见两个人，抬着尸体走了
Saw two men, and they were carrying the body away.

697
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,480
当时我还试着捏捏你的脚趾
And then I tried to pinch your toe.

698
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,610
我跑着追你
I run after you,

699
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:29,680
后来有个医生叫我走，我不得不走开
and after that one of the doctors told me, "Shoo!" and I had to go away.

700
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,420
很抱歉我发誓，但是你…
I'm sorry. I promise, but you...

701
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,970
- 若是你需要，我会带给你更多药丸  - 糖
- I bring you more medicine if you want.  - Sugar.

702
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,270
- 我发誓…  - 他们一直喂他吃糖
- I promise...  - They're giving him sugar.

703
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,830
过来！
Come here!

704
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:51,310
喔！太好了，你醒了，我带了你的X光片…
Oh, well, that's great, you're awake. I brought your x-rays...

705
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,650
- 嘿！你要看看…  - 医生，那老人死了，你却…
- Hey, you wanna take a look...  - Doc, the old man's dead and you're...

706
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,380
- 嘿，罗依！ - 够了！
- Hey. Roy!  - That's it!

707
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:58,810
- 你快闭嘴！ - 你才闭嘴！
- Will you shut up, already?  - You shut up!

708
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:02,260
滚开！你并没有真的生病，华特！他们一再喂你吃糖！
Get out of here! You're not really sick, Walt! They're feeding you sugar!

709
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,520
- 嘿！嘿！嘿！嘿！ - 我受够了你！
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!  - I've had enough of you!

710
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:05,620
护士！
Nurse!

711
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,360
你说，他们一再喂我吃糖，是什么意思？
What do you mean, they're giving me sugar?

712
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:09,760
- 给你，医生  - 她身上都弄湿了
- Here you go, Doctor.  - She's wet herself.

713
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:11,630
带她离开这里
Get her out of here.

714
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:16,740
回你房间去，看护人！
Go back to your room. Orderlies!

715
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,550
你该睡觉了，亚历珊卓
You should be in bed, Alexandria.

716
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:16,120
田里面好多萤火虫
There's more fires in the field.

717
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:23,900
那是煤油火，煤油火让水果不会受冻
It's kerosene. The kerosene stops the fruit from freezing.

718
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:27,640
不，那是神秘使者
No, it's Mystic.

719
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:30,680
他会从树里面出来帮助罗依
He's coming out of that tree to help Roy.

720
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:36,520
小女孩，该睡觉了，不是开玩笑的时刻
I think it's bedtime, young lady. No more time for funny talk.

721
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:39,090
现在上床去
Into bed now.

722
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,490
也许有一天
And maybe one day

723
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:45,460
你可以带我到楼下，跟我介绍你的朋友罗依
you can take me downstairs and introduce me to your friend Roy.

724
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:49,520
我们去楼下，道声晚安？
We go downstairs and say good night?

725
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,360
不，他不能接见访客
No. He's not allowed any visitors.

726
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,100
你朋友，罗依，需要休息
Your friend, Roy, needs to rest.

727
01:21:56,170 --> 01:22:00,400
他失去了女友，非常伤心，需要睡眠
He's very sad. He's lost his girlfriend. He needs to sleep.

728
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:04,910
但他睡不着，需要药物，他已经没有药丸了
But he can't. He needs medicine to sleep, but he doesn't have any.

729
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,210
问题就在这里
That's the problem.

730
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,840
我确信他们会好好的照顾他
I'm sure they're taking very good care of him.

731
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:12,920
现在，该睡觉
Now, it's time for bed.

732
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:16,750
小女孩也需要睡眠的
Little girls need to go to sleep, too.

733
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:19,520
- 我不小了，我五岁了  - 当然
- I'm not little. I am five.  - Of course.

734
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:21,800
我忘了
I forgot.

735
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:25,860
走开！走开！走开！走开！
Googly, googly, googly, go away. Googly, googly, googly, go away.

736
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:29,730
走开！走开！走开！走开！
Googly, googly, googly, go away. Googly, googly, googly, go away.

737
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:39,070
走开！走开！走开…
Googly, googly. Go away. Googly, googly, googly. Go away.

738
01:23:56,790 --> 01:24:00,460
走开！走开！
Googly, googly. Go away.

739
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:04,760
走开！走开！走开！
Googly, googly. Googly, googly, googly, go away.

740
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:33,090
爸爸，他们偷了我们的马
Papa, they steal our horse.

741
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:39,960
爸爸，他们偷了我们的马
Papa, they steal our horse.

742
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,330
爸爸
Papa,

743
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:48,570
他们偷了我们的马
they steal our horse.

744
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:52,600
爸爸，愤怒的人们烧了我们的房子
Papa, angry people burn our home.

745
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:55,880
人们烧了我们的房子，别出去
They burn our house. Don't go outside.

746
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:56,980
小偷
Thieves.

747
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:00,180
暴民乱杀人
Angry people kill.

748
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,810
小偷！
Thieves!

749
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,590
X光片看起来不错
The x-ray seems fine.

750
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,980
- 妈咪！ - 是你给罗依药丸的吗？
- Mommy!  - Were you taking medicine to Roy?

751
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:04,650
那是你的责任，这也是你要治疗的
That is your responsibility and this is how you treat it.

752
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:07,780
要好转起来，你需要意志力
To get better, you gotta have the will

753
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:11,520
你想活下去的意志力
and your own desire to live.

754
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,560
我在次跌了下来
I fell again.

755
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:54,330
我听说了，每个人都听说了
I heard. Everybody's heard.

756
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:57,960
你很有铭
You're famous.

757
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:04,640
他们生气了吗？
Are they angry?

758
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:06,010
是呀！
Yeah,

759
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,950
但不是针对你
but not at you.

760
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:14,720
我想要帮你多拿些药丸，但是跌了下来，那是不对的事情…
I try to take more pills, but I fell. It was the wrong thing, and...

761
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:19,230
- 什么？ - 我将脚放在那上面
- What?  - I put my foot on it when I went up

762
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:25,930
后来事情就发生了，我坠落了下来
and later on the thing made me go like that and I fell.

763
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:36,770
我没有跟任何人说我们的秘密
I didn't tell anybody about our secret.

764
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:42,510
即使他们用针头折磨我
Even when they tortured me with needles.

765
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:47,290
那个是海盗的旗帜吗？
Is that a pirate's flag?

766
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,160
那是还是不是？
Is that yes or no?

767
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,120
跟我说故事
Tell me the story.

768
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,990
你需要休息，我该走了
I should go. You need your rest.

769
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:58,660
但是我想讲话
But I want to talk.

770
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:01,000
- 我知道  - 你答应过的
- I know you do.  - You promised.

771
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:06,240
那故事是假的，只是为了让你帮我做事情
The story was just a trick to get you to do something for me.

772
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:08,280
- 什么？ - 我…
- What?  - I was...

773
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:12,750
但我需要听故事
But I need the story.

774
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:16,950
你去找别人讲给你听
You should ask someone else.

775
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:20,810
对我而言，没有什么快乐式结局
There's no happy ending with me.

776
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:25,380
我仍然想听
I still want to know.

777
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,720
问你的朋友护士伊芙琳，她讲的故事会更棒
Ask your friend, Nurse Evelyn, she'll tell it better than I will.

778
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,100
我不想有她在故事里面！
I don't want her in the story!

779
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:33,570
她还好啊
She's okay.

780
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:38,710
喔！她不是真的爱欧迪亚斯总督
Oh, she doesn't really love Governor Odious.

781
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:43,000
她是假装的
She's just pretending.

782
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:46,410
我看过她跟医院的人在一起
I saw her with one of the hospital men.

783
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,040
她是假装爱你
She was just pretending to love you.

784
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,780
跟你的女友一样
Just like your girlfriend.

785
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:57,050
我懂了
I see.

786
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:04,800
欧迪亚斯总督跟护士伊芙琳！
Governor Odious with Nurse Evelyn!

787
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,910
她是对的
She's right.

788
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,010
她是对的！
She's right!

789
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,390
我们不需要她
We don't need her.

790
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:39,230
她是不可信任的
She can't be trusted.

791
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:46,100
你对他们掏心掏肺，但是他们只想要你的钱
You give them your heart, but all they really want is your wallet.

792
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:51,310
早晚有天，她会为了更有钱的人而离开
Sooner or later she's gonna leave him for a richer man.

793
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:52,680
是个陷阱
Is a trap.

794
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:56,080
- 我懂了  - 我不喜欢
- I understand.  - I don't like it.

795
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:58,180
谢谢你告诉我
Thank you for telling me.

796
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:03,080
对我们简直就是自杀
Is a suicide. For all of us.

797
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:07,020
我们走吧
We're going.

798
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,640
嘿！印度人，你说自杀是什么意思？
Hey, Indian, what means suicide?

799
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:12,720
华乐斯？华乐斯！
Wallace? Wallace!

800
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,230
华乐斯！
Wallace!

801
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:22,340
华乐斯，你在做什么？
Wallace, what are you doing?

802
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,930
华乐斯，快下来好吗？
Wallace, please will you come down?

803
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,380
快，现在不是玩耍时间
Please, this really isn't the time.

804
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:31,910
华乐斯，拜托！华乐斯，下来好吗？
Wallace, please! Wallace, will you come down?

805
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:36,010
华乐斯！
Wallace!

806
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,050
华乐斯！
Wallace!

807
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:50,490
华乐斯，你做了什么？
Wallace, what did you do?

808
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,140
美洲新蝶！
Americana Exotica!

809
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,550
美洲新蝶！
Americana Exotica!

810
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,340
真美丽！
It's beautiful!

811
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:22,520
他真的死了吗？
Does he really died?

812
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,010
走吧！
Let's go!

813
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:38,440
我已经精疲力竭了！
I'm all washed-up!

814
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:41,420
- 达尔文叔叔，有暴民  - 别离开我，朋友
- Uncle Darwin, there's angry people.  - Don't leave me, my friend.

815
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,450
我会告诉每个人说，那是你的发现
I'll tell everyone they were your idea.

816
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:48,020
他们会发现我只是个骗子！
They're going to find out I'm a fraud!

817
01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:53,990
来吧！射啊，畜生！
Go on! Shoot, you animals!

818
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:59,630
杀死达尔文，他们会给你们很高的报酬
They'll pay you well for Darwin's hide.

819
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:13,940
他也死了
He died, too.

820
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:17,080
华乐斯也是吗？
And Wallace, too?

821
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,110
他真的死了吗？
Did he really died?

822
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:23,820
是呀！对华乐斯而言，何尝不能算快乐的死
Yeah, and in Wallace's case, happily so.

823
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:27,860
生死也是大自然的法则
It was the natural order of things.

824
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,240
万物皆会死
All things must die.

825
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,890
去她的！
Damn it all!

826
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:21,510
退后！退后！
Back! Get back!

827
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,520
卡--蹦
Kaboom.

828
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,520
若是要成就些什么…
If you want something done...

829
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,160
下去那里！
Get down there!

830
01:35:43,230 --> 01:35:45,060
…你要自己去做
...you have to do it yourself.

831
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:47,470
下去那里，畜生们！
Get down there, you animals!

832
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:49,440
将他们带上来！
And bring them up here!

833
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,910
我不喜欢这样，我不喜欢这个故事
I don't like this! I don't like this story.

834
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:04,780
我们为何要逃跑？
Why are we running away?

835
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:18,600
为何路易奇要同归于尽？
Why did Luigi kill himself?

836
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:21,600
为何不跟我们一起来？
Why did not he come with us?

837
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:23,470
跟人们一样生活？
And live as half a man?

838
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:28,080
他无法那样做
He couldn't do that.

839
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:29,740
他投降了
He gave up.

840
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:33,570
不是尽如人意，是吗？
It's not very satisfying, is it?

841
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:35,740
他也这么认为
He didn't think so either.

842
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:47,190
拜托，神秘使者
Please, the Mystic.

843
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:50,600
为什么？他们为何要杀神秘使者？
Why? Why are they killing the Mystic?

844
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:55,040
我们应该去救他
We need to go help him.

845
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:02,240
神秘使者！
Mystic!

846
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:04,780
- 嘿！ - 神秘使者！
- Hey!  - Mystic!

847
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:08,870
曲线，曲线，曲线，曲线
Googly, googly, googly, googly, googly, googly.

848
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:52,220
很抱歉！很抱歉！
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

849
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:56,290
很抱歉！
I'm sorry!

850
01:37:59,570 --> 01:38:01,090
很抱歉！
I'm sorry!

851
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:08,740
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

852
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:13,750
曲线，曲线，曲线！
Googly, googly, googly!

853
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:22,620
没事
It's okay.

854
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:17,310
印度人！
Indian!

855
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:25,710
起来！
Up!

856
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:26,980
救命！
Help!

857
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,770
不，不，不，不
No, no, no, no, no.

858
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,430
不，不，不，不
No, no, no, no!

859
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:57,150
为何你要杀每个人？
Why are you killing everybody?

860
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:02,250
为何你要每个人都死？
Why are you making everybody die?

861
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,990
这是我的故事
It's my story.

862
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,390
也是我的啊
Mine too.

863
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:10,990
将他们带上来！
Bring them up here!

864
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:15,590
留活口！
Alive!

865
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:17,100
我们在这
We are here.

866
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:22,110
活着
Alive.

867
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:26,810
罗依！
Roy!

868
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,680
别看着她
Don't look at her.

869
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:33,950
- 他也是跟欧迪亚斯一伙的  - 安静
- She is also with Odious.  - Quiet.

870
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:39,750
- 跟你女友一样  - 闭嘴
- Just like your girlfriend.  - Shut up.

871
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:41,520
不！
No!

872
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,230
你女友跟欧迪亚斯一起来…看你了
Your girlfriend came with Odious to see you...

873
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:47,170
强盗们进入了欧迪亚斯的花园…
The bandit entered Odious's garden...

874
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,230
但是她站在车子里面，而且她…
But she stood in the car and she...

875
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:54,300
- 但是看不见欧迪亚斯的踪影  - 欧迪亚斯…
- But Odious was nowhere to be seen.  - And Odious...

876
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:59,180
当强盗们跑过欧迪亚斯躲藏的地方，欧迪亚斯打断了他的鼻子！
As the bandit ran past Odious' hiding place, Odious cracked him in the nose!

877
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:06,820
不，等等，请等等！
No, but wait a little. Wait, please!

878
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:17,720
后来他沉到了池底
So he sank to the bottom of the pool.

879
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:21,230
一点也没有试着游泳
He didn't even try to swim.

880
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:25,100
- 一切都是你杜撰的  - 不，我没有
- You are making this up.  - No, I'm not.

881
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:28,470
他开始下沉，就要死亡
And he started to sink and he was dying.

882
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:31,770
让他活着
Let him live.

883
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,010
起来！
Get up!

884
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,080
罗依，起来，战斗！
Roy, get up and fight!

885
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:39,150
起来！
Get up!

886
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,850
喔！真丢脸！看，妈的！
Oh, what a shame! Look, God damn it!

887
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:46,190
起来！
Get up!

888
01:41:48,030 --> 01:41:50,520
看着他！看着他！
Look at him! Look at him!

889
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:51,620
起来！
Get up!

890
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:54,760
- 我要你看他究竟有多可悲  - 我站不起来！
- I want you to see how pathetic he really is.  - I can't get up!

891
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,570
- 起来！ - 我站不起来！
- Get up!  - I can't get up!

892
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:58,660
- 老天啊，这水只有及腰深  - 起来，爸爸！
- For God's sake, the water's only waist high.  - Get up, Daddy!

893
01:41:58,740 --> 01:41:59,870
我不是你父亲
I'm not your father.

894
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:03,780
多可悲啊！看看他！他是个要瘾者！
How pathetic! Look at him! He's a drug addict!

895
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:06,040
你父亲是个懦夫
Your father is a coward.

896
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:08,380
一无是处的懦夫！
A useless good-for-nothing!

897
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:09,970
爸爸，起来！
Dad, get up!

898
01:42:10,050 --> 01:42:11,780
他赢不了的！
He can't win!

899
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:14,520
因为我们的蒙面侠是个懦夫！
That's because our Masked Bandit's a coward!

900
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:17,880
是呀！他绝对不会发誓
Yeah, he never took an oath.

901
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:21,890
- 骗徒，懦夫  - 你说晃！
- A fake, he's a liar and a coward.  - You're lying!

902
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:24,660
不，他祝你好运
No. He had his fingers crossed.

903
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,030
他必须死
He has to die.

904
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,730
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

905
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:34,380
他就要死了
He was dying.

906
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,780
别杀他
Don't kill him.

907
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:41,750
- 你需要的话我会给你带来更多药丸的  - 爸爸，起来！
- I'll bring you more pills if you want.  - Dad, get up!

908
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:44,810
- 别杀他  - 他已经无牵无挂了
- Don't kill him.  - There's nothing left for him.

909
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:46,050
他女儿
His daughter.

910
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:48,350
他也不是父亲
He wasn't her father, either.

911
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:50,790
她爱他
She loves him.

912
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:55,660
她会活下来，她还年轻
She'll survive. She's young.

913
01:42:55,730 --> 01:42:57,790
我不要你死
I don't want you to die.

914
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:10,070
别杀他
Don't kill him.

915
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:21,510
让他活
Let him live.

916
01:43:25,290 --> 01:43:26,780
让他活
Let him live.

917
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:29,250
别杀他
Don't kill him.

918
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:44,810
发誓？别祝福我
Promise? And don't cross your fingers.

919
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,510
我保证
I promise.

920
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:48,810
让我看你的手
Show me your hands.

921
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:53,810
看见没？
See?

922
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,060
别再打斗了
No more fighting.

923
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,770
他要去找他的女儿，好的
He needs to go to his daughter. It's okay.

924
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:11,700
没事，没事，一切结束了
It's okay. It's all right. It's over now.

925
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:16,340
亲亲我
Give me a kiss.

926
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:37,260
罗依
Roy,

927
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:42,590
你真的了解，这只是看你是否真的爱我的测试，对吗？
you do realize it was all a test to see if you truly loved me, don't you?

928
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:57,280
我们终于可以顺着我们的真心而行了
We're finally free to follow our hearts.

929
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:06,380
当然是
By all means.

930
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,190
顺你的真心而行
Follow your heart.

931
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:20,670
我觉得不太舒服
I'm not feeling very well.

932
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:36,790
我们是奇特的一对，是吗？
We're a strange pair, aren't we?

933
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:54,830
行动，行动，行动，行动
Action, action, action, action.

934
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:59,740
这就是我们将要制作的东西
So, this is the kind of trash we're gonna be making now.

935
01:46:59,810 --> 01:47:04,340
人们从屋顶跳下，从桥上、马背上跳下
People jumping off buildings, bridges, horses.

936
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:39,470
我错过了什么吗？
Did I just miss something?

937
01:47:41,650 --> 01:47:43,350
就这样？
That was it?

938
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:45,390
那就是他的绝技？
That was his big stunt?

939
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:48,680
他连跳马背都没有
He didn't even use that horse thing.

940
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:42,770
我将老人的牙齿放在那里，因为我认为
I put old man's teeth there because I think that

941
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:47,980
神秘使者从树木里出来，这样会长成一株特别的树
the Mystic comes out of the tree and it will grow a special orange tree.

942
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:50,450
亚历珊卓！亚历珊卓！
Alexandria! Alexandria!

943
01:48:55,460 --> 01:49:00,450
我们就会有里面长牙齿的橘子，长牙齿的橘子
And we'll have oranges inside with teeths, with teeth inside.

944
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:20,450
我出院以后，我非常想念罗依
When I get out from the hospital, I miss Roy very much.

945
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:25,920
我母亲告诉我，他有演出电影
My mother told me that he plays in pictures

946
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:29,420
他会做其他演员做不到的动作
and he does things that the other actors cannot do

947
01:49:29,490 --> 01:49:32,390
像是爬到什么上面
like falling and hitting

948
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:38,160
然后掉下来
and when they climb on something, when they...

949
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:44,710
我原本不相信，直到我亲眼看见
I didn't believe my mother, but then I saw him.

950
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:58,280
我一遍又一遍的看那片子
I watch the picture again and again and again

951
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:02,020
要确认那是罗依，真的是罗依！
and to make sure that was Roy, and was Roy!

952
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:09,590
后来，我超爱电影，所有电影
And then, I like the action from all the pictures

953
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:16,300
因为我知道，罗依会演出所有的高处坠落等等特技
because I know that Roy is making all the falling and hitting and climbing

954
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:17,900
他爬到梯子上
and he was on the stairs

955
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:21,670
上上下下，上上下下的
and he was going up and down and up and down.

956
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:27,840
还有从火车上跳下，跳上车子…
And he was falling from the train and he was taking the car...

957
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:03,310
从单车上跳下，从大房子屋顶跳下
And he was falling from the bicycle and from a big house.

958
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:04,480
那是华乐斯！
It was Wallace!

959
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:06,140
他跟绳子一起坠落
He was falling with the rope

960
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:08,750
他被打，然后将会…
and he was hit and he was going...

961
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:14,320
“谢谢，谢谢，非常感谢！”
"Thank you, thank you, thank you very much!"
