3
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,310
嘿
Hey.

4
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
不会有事的
It's going to be okay.

5
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,110
只要告诉我，我们做的是正确的事
Just tell me we're doing the right thing.

6
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,030
不，亲爱的，我知道，你想去修补
No, sweetheart,I know you want to fix this.

7
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,390
这是你的本行，但我们尽力了
It's what you do.But we've tried.

8
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,870
好吗？我们尽力了，但看看结果是什么
All right? We've been trying and look where it's gotten us.

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,750
我觉得分开一段时间对他有好处
And I think the space is gonna be good for him.

10
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,230
对我们都好，而且这是一所好学校
For all of us.Besides, it's a good school.

11
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,600
等夏天一过，他就回家了
He'll be home by the end of the summer.

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,820
是啊
Yeah.

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,030
我不会有事的，我保证
I'll be okay.I promise.

14
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,470
我保证
I promise.

15
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,180
我爱你
Love you.

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,630
我也爱你
Love you, too.

17
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,430
- 打电话给我  - 我会的
- Call me.  - Will do.

18
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,950
我爱你
I love you.

19
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,590
哇
Wow.

20
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
好棒，史蒂芬
Well done, Stephen.

21
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,750
太棒了！
Amazing!

22
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,430
住手，妈妈！
Oh, stop, Mom!

23
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,750
- 那是什么？那是什么？ - 什么？噢
- What's that? What's that?  - Huh? Oh!

24
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,030
一，二，三！
One, two, three!

25
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,990
- 漂亮  - 耶！
- Nice.  - Yeah!

26
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,030
它基本上死了
He's pretty dead.

27
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,430
它死了
He's very dead.

28
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,900
今天，我儿子成了大人
Today my son has become a man.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,510
为此…
Because of that...

30
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,920
我知道，你觉得我们这么做是为了惩罚你
I know you think we're probably doing this to punish you

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
但我们不是
but we're not.

32
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,190
好吗？
All right?

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,080
你妈妈和我是为了你好
Your mother and I want the best for you.

34
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,710
你根本不知道她想要什么
You have no idea what she wants.

35
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,120
我不知道你为什么这么做
I don't know why you're doing this.

36
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,660
是你被学校开除的
I'm not the one that got expelled, pal.

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
她不想赶我走，是你想
Well, she doesn't want me gone. It's you.

38
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,590
不是的，史蒂芬
That's not true,Stephen.

39
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,760
就是的，你要把我送走
Yes, it is.You're sending me away.

40
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,910
不是的，史蒂芬
It's not true,
Stephen.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,750
你妈妈和我经过长时间的商量…
Your mother and I had a long conversation...

42
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,350
- 商量什么？ - 我们需要缓一缓，史蒂芬！
- About what?  - We need a break, Stephen!

43
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,400
- 我不想缓一缓！ - 好吗？
- I don't want a break!  - All right?

44
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,150
- 我们两个，好吗？ - 闭嘴！我恨你！
- Both of us, okay?  - Shut up! I hate you!

45
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,190
- 冷静，冷静！ - 不，别碰我！
- Just calm down. Calm down!  - No, don't touch me!

46
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,710
- 别碰我！ - 你冷静！
- Don't touch me!  - You just calm down!

47
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,070
- 别碰我！ - 冷静！
- Don't touch me!  - Calm down!

48
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,730
禁闭

49
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,080
六个月后

50
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,790
醒醒，醒醒
Wakey, wakey.

51
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,070
起床了
Rise and shine.

52
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,190
你准备好复健了吗？
You ready for your workout?

53
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,230
张开嘴
Open.

54
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,510
…很可能整个新英格兰地区的暴雪
...significant snowfall likely across all of New England

55
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
总之就是这样
when all is said and done.

56
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,470
随着暴风雪的临近
So, as the storm approaches

57
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,150
你要确定采取了必要的预防措施
you'll want to make sure you take the necessary precautions here

58
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,230
准备好，你所在的地区会有重大的降雪…
and plan on some very heavy snow in your area for much of...

59
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,150
轮到你了
It's your turn.

60
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,470
要不要试试看？
How about a quick try?

61
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,750
很棒
Great job.

62
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,950
嗨
Hey.

63
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,910
我想继续再给他治疗几周
So I'd like to continue working with him

64
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,510
继续治疗几周
for another couple weeks.

65
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,110
这不是我的决定
It's not my decision.

66
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,500
他们要送他去波士顿
They're moving him to Boston.

67
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,990
一个聋哑儿童的福利机构
Some group home for deaf kids.

68
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,670
但我们在进步
But we're making progress.

69
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,510
这些事需要时间
These things take time.

70
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,740
他是个好孩子，我们可以…
He's a great kid,we can...

71
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,310
他上周又打断了一个孩子的胳膊
He broke another kid's arm last week.

72
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,950
他不能留在斯威策
He can't stay at Sweetser.

73
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,790
我很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

74
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,980
我们要走了
We're leaving.

75
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
琼！
Joan!

76
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,190
等一下
Wait a second.

77
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,360
我觉得就像…
I guess it was like a...

78
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,950
我觉得就像所有聪明人的证书
I guess it was like certificates for all the smart people

79
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,120
所以基本上我什么都没有
so basically I have nothing.

80
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,870
我…我没有…
I... I did not...

81
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
我想送给你这个
I want you to have these.

82
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,550
别冻着，好吗？
Keep warm, okay?

83
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,990
你不可能照顾缅因州所有的孩子，玛莉
Well, you can't take care of every kid in Maine, Mary.

84
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,670
我知道
I know.

85
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
呃…
Um...

86
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,340
没有人会因为你需要帮助，而瞧不起你
No one would judge you for needing help.

87
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,630
谢谢
Thanks.

88
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,190
嗨，威尔森医生
Hi, Dr. Wilson.

89
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,230
你怎么样？还好吗？
How are you? How's it all going?

90
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,070
漫长的一天
Long day.

91
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,380
漫长的一周
Long week.

92
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,310
史蒂芬一直让你分不开身，是不是？
Well, Stephen really keeps you on your toes, doesn't he?

93
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,750
他还好吗？
How's he doing?

94
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,150
我收到了文件
I received the papers.

95
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,060
我们要把他送到卡文顿
I'm moving him to Covington.

96
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,310
在身体上，我能照顾他
Physically, I can manage.

97
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,830
基本上没问题
Just about

98
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,990
但这不是他
but it's not him.

99
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,070
只是一个我喂饭、擦洗、穿衣的一具肉体
It's just a body that I feed,and wash, and clothe.

100
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,950
在我失去理查德的那一天，我也失去了他
I lost him that day I lost Richard in the car.

101
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,670
玛莉，身为心理医生，不等于就是好父母
Mary, being a psychologist doesn't make you a perfect parent.

102
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,020
没有这样的事
There's no such thing.

103
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,500
你做了你认为是正确的事
You did what you thought was right.

104
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,510
我把他送走了
I sent him away.

105
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,790
我把我儿子送走了，现在他没了
I sent my son away and now he's gone.

106
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,470
妈妈会给你买一只模仿鸟
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

107
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,390
如果这只模仿鸟不唱歌
And if that mockingbird don't sing

108
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,990
妈妈会给你
Mama's gonna buy you

109
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,390
买一个钻戒
A diamond ring

110
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,240
九一一，你有什么紧急情况？
911, what's your emergency?

111
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,630
喂？
Hello?

112
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,150
我是玛莉波特曼
Yes, this is Mary Portman

113
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,670
住在Delphi巷二十八号
from 28 Delphi Lane.

114
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,910
我家里好像有人进来了
I think there is an intruder in my house.

115
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,710
好，别挂电话
Okay, stay on the line.

116
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,150
波特曼夫人，你在房子里吗？
Mrs. Portman,are you inside the house?

117
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,160
你能听到我吗？
Can you hear me?

118
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,270
- 波特曼夫人，你还在嘛？ - 喂？
- Mrs. Portman, are you still there?  - Hello?

119
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,470
对不起，我的错
I'm sorry, my mistake.

120
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,350
只是一只浣熊
It's just a raccoon.

121
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,230
给你，喝了能暖和
Here you go.This will warm you up.

122
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,070
你没事吧？
You okay?

123
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,190
噢等等喂？
Oh. Hold on. Hello?

124
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,990
琼，嗨，谢谢你回电话
Joan, hi.Thanks for calling back.

125
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,670
对不起，我知道现在很晚了
I'm sorry,I know it's late.

126
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,750
你怎么到这里的？外面零下九度
How did he even get here? It's 15 degrees out.

127
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,750
我知道，但是拜托，琼
I know it's not,but please, Joan.

128
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,070
我可以帮他
I can help him.

129
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,110
他可以住在这里
He could just stay here.

130
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,070
等一下，有这个必要吗？
Hang on a second.Is that necessary?

131
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,070
什么？让我…给我个机会吧，好吗？
What? Let me... Give it a chance, okay?

132
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,510
我可以帮他
I can help him.

133
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,710
报警有什么用处？
What good could it do to involve the police?

134
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,030
我愿意承担这个风险，他才九岁，琼，拜托！
I'll take that chance. He's nine years old,for God's sake, Joan, please!

135
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,340
你能不能让他…
Can you just let him...

136
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,270
琼，我等一下再打给你
Joan, I'll call you back.

137
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,350
汤姆！
Tom!

138
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,420
汤姆！
Tom!

139
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,470
天啊
Jesus.

140
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,510
汤姆！
Tom!

141
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,310
你回去之前不再喝一杯吗，乔？
You sure I can't get you another before you head back out, Joe?

142
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,150
谢谢你，玛莉，我要加快时间
Thanks, Mary.I'm gonna press on

143
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,310
开始挨家挨户打听
start going door to door.

144
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,510
这种低温，一个小孩子在外面不会活很久
A young kid out alone won't survive long in these temperatures.

145
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,200
…在他们的公司网站上
...though on their company website

146
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,060
削售额和转化率要高得多
have much higher sales numbers and conversion rates.

147
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,910
我感觉很无助
I just feel so helpless.

148
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,110
是啊，我…
Yeah, I...

149
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,950
我一下午都在外面找他
I've been out all afternoon looking for him myself.

150
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,550
噢，天啊，琼
Oh, God, Joan.

151
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,910
我不敢想象他一个人在外面会是什么样子
I can't stand to think of him out there on his own.

152
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,110
好，呃…
Yeah, okay, um...

153
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,830
向我保证一有消息，就打电话给我
Well, just promise me you'll call as soon as you hear anything.

154
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,020
好
Okay.

155
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,500
好的
Great.

156
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,110
好，再见
Okay. Bye.

157
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,790
汤姆！
Tom!

158
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,220
玛莉？
Mary?

159
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,750
亲爱的？
Hon?

160
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,110
你没听到我吗？我很担心
Didn't you hear me? I was worried.

161
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,390
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing in here?

162
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,950
我，呃…我刚才…
I, uh... I was just...

163
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,750
我想收拾一下史蒂芬的床万一…
I thought I'd make up Stephen's bed in case...

164
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,150
万一汤姆回来
In case Tom came back.

165
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,430
哦
Oh.

166
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,030
现在几点了？
What time is it?

167
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,390
很晚了
It's late.

168
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,470
亚伦哈特正在办公室等你
Aaron Hart is waiting for you in the office.

169
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,470
这孩子一直都在不停的…
I mean, the kid's been bouncing around foster homes

170
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,830
换领养家庭，那时没人关心
for, like, half his life,but no one gave a shit then.

171
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,790
现在全镇的人
And now suddenly the whole town's

172
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,110
都突然开始关心了
decided it's time to give a shit.

173
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,950
你知道，光是美国每年就有
Do you know how many children run away

174
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,580
多少孩子离家出走或失踪吗？
or go missing every year in the United States alone?

175
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,110
我不知道
I don't know.

176
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,420
你看不出这有多荒唐吗？
Don't you see how fucked up that is?

177
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,310
而且，这孩子死了，人人都知道
Besides, the kid's dead.Everyone knows it.

178
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,270
好的，亚伦，今天就谈到这里吧
Okay, Aaron, that's about all we have time for today.

179
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,830
随便，好的
Whatever, sure.

180
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,910
非常谢谢
Thanks a lot.

181
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,190
你爸爸要来接你吗？
Is your dad coming to get you?

182
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,310
嗯
Uh-huh.

183
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,190
青少年，啊？
Teenagers,huh?

184
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,510
怎么样？
How's it going?

185
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,910
他今天恨我更多
Does he hate me more or less

186
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,080
还是世界更多？
than he hates the rest of the world today?

187
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,270
没有，他只是不适应你们的搬家和离婚
No, he's just having a rough time with the move and the divorce.

188
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,720
有时候，我已经记不起他几年前
Sometimes it's hard to remember he was just a cute little kid

189
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,270
还是个可爱的孩子喜欢和爸爸一起打棒球
who liked to throw a ball around with his dad a few years ago.

190
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,540
他现在一直很暴躁
He's so angry all the time.

191
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,470
会过去的
He'll get through it.

192
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,510
只是个尴尬的年龄
It's just a difficult age.

193
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,030
你听说暴风雪要来了吗？
You hear about this storm coming in?

194
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,150
是的
Yeah.

195
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,320
如果验变成冰爆
If it turns into an ice storm

196
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
可能会停电几天
we could be without power for at least a couple of days.

197
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,590
嗯
Mmm.

198
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,580
你不能独自在这里
You probably shouldn't be up here all alone.

199
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,270
我和亚伦打算去镇上的
Aaron and I are thinking of moving into

200
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,270
旅馆住几天，等风暴过去
one of the hotels in town to ride it out.

201
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
呃…
Uh...

202
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,590
如果我们一起去，也许我可以请你吃个晚饭
If we do, maybe I could take you for dinner.

203
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,550
我不会有事的，我们不会有事的
I'll be fine.We'll be fine.

204
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,750
我儿子生病了，我不能带他走动
My son, he's sick,so I can't really move him.

205
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,590
哦，我很遗憾
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

206
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,990
我还不知道你有个儿子，他多大了？
I didn't even know you had a son.How old is he?

207
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,150
他十八岁，史蒂芬十八岁
He's 18. Stephen's 18.

208
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,910
他是我的继子
He's my stepson.

209
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,470
我还不知道…
I didn't know that...

210
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,870
我丈夫过世了，所以
My husband passed away, actually

211
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,950
现在只有史蒂芬和我
so it's just Stephen and me now.

212
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,550
也许我们四个人哪天可以一起吃个晚饭
Well, maybe the four of us can get dinner one day.

213
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,430
我们和两个暴躁的青少年
You know, you, me and our angry teenagers.

214
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,310
这不合适
Look, it's not really appropriate.

215
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,190
亚伦是我的病人，所以…
Aaron's my patient,so...

216
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,630
而且他还在车上等你
And he's waiting for you in the car.

217
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,910
好的
Sure, okay.

218
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,060
呃，呃…
Uh, um...

219
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,030
听着，谢谢你
Well, listen, thanks.

220
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,310
对不起，我…
Sorry, I just...

221
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,350
我希望你的儿子能好转
I hope your son feels better.

222
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,950
谢谢
Thanks.

223
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,270
天
Shit.

224
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,110
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

225
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,710
没事的
It's okay.

226
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,550
我感觉我要疯了
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

227
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,780
玛莉，冷静
Mary, calm down.

228
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,790
听听你说的话
Look, listen to what you're saying.

229
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,030
我当时在场，是真实的
I was there. It was real.

230
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,230
你是个理性的成年人
You're a rational adult.

231
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,110
世上并没有鬼，你是知道的
There's no such things as ghosts,and you know that.

232
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,670
哦，天啊
Oh, God.

233
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,870
我觉得你经历的是深眠状态
I think that you experienced something known as parasomnia.

234
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,670
一种能引发夜惊的睡眠失调
A sleep disorder that can trigger night terrors.

235
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,510
但我…看到了他，我看到了汤姆
I... But I saw him.I saw Tom.

236
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,380
人人都说他死了
Everybody's been saying he's dead

237
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,990
我一直希望这不是真的，但这确定是真的
and I kept wanting it not to be true, but it must be.

238
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,910
我觉得考虑到你受到的压力
I think that with the amount of stress you're under

239
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,110
以及你已经有的睡眠失调
and the existence of disturbed sleep already

240
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,470
这完全说得通
it makes complete sense.

241
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,940
坦白说，你知道
And frankly,you know, the fact that

242
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,430
你看到出走的孩子，也能解释
you saw the runaway boy also tracks.

243
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,030
你一直在找他
You know, you've been looking for him

244
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,710
你担心他
you're worried about him.

245
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,710
这不意味着他死了，更不用说变成鬼纠缠你
Does not mean he's dead,let alone haunting you.

246
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,230
你觉得你梦里那个孩子的脚步声
Do you think that the sound of the child's footsteps

247
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,700
是不是因为你想起
in your dream could be a reminder of the child that

248
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,430
你失去的儿子？
you might think you've actually lost?

249
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,110
让你想起以前你儿子害怕时
You know, of the son that used to come into your room at night

250
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,870
就来你房里
when he was scared.

251
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,430
你觉得，你梦里
Do you think that that voiceless child

252
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,030
那个不说话的孩子即可能是史蒂芬…
in your dream could be Stephen...

253
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,550
…也可能是汤姆？
...as much as it's Tom?

254
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,390
在车祸之前很长时间，我记得你就跟我说过
Long before the accident,I remember you telling me that

255
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,110
你感觉在失去史蒂芬
you were feeling like you were losing Stephen.

256
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,790
在失去你的儿子
That you were losing your little boy.

257
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,190
你还记得吗？
Do you remember that?

258
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

259
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,030
我经历了很多不幸
I had been through so much.

260
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,230
是啊，跟我说说那个史蒂芬
Yeah. Well,tell me about that Stephen.

261
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,990
你知道，车祸之前的史蒂芬
You know,Stephen before the accident.

262
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,670
甚至是他出现问题行为之前
Before the behavioral problems even.

263
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,430
有件事我从没告诉你，那天早晨
I never told you this,but that morning

264
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,580
他求我别把他送走
he begged me not to send him away.

265
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,830
继续
Go on.

266
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,070
史蒂芬一直怪在理查德的身上
Stephen always blamed Richard.

267
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,830
不过是我找到了那所学校
But I was the one who found the school.

268
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,470
我不知道如何兼任他的心理医生和母亲
I just didn't know how to be his therapist and his mother.

269
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,430
玛莉？
Mary?

270
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,430
玛莉？
Mary?

271
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,590
关于汤姆的噩梦
Look, the nightmare about Tom

272
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,180
可能是关于史蒂芬的
may be about Stephen

273
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,550
但是这是因为一切都是关于史蒂芬
but that's because everything's about Stephen.

274
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,520
我想跟你谈谈，开点药
Look, I'd like to talk to you about prescribing something

275
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,030
来调和你的睡眠，好吗？
to regulate your sleep, okay?

276
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,590
所以我要做个血液检查
So I'm gonna need some blood work.

277
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,910
在此期间，你照顾好自己
In the meantime,take care of yourself.

278
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,310
谢谢
Thanks.

279
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,950
…开始袭击人类
...starts to attack humans

280
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,110
即使我们不是它们的天然猎物
when we're not their natural prey.

281
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,590
科学家们能找出办法防止这样的悲剧吗？
And can scientists find a way to prevent these tragic events?

282
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,350
嗨，对不起，我刚才，呃…请进
Hi. Sorry, I was,uh... Come in.

283
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,590
这种鲨鱼是海洋中最非凡的鱼类
This shark is the most charismatic fish in the ocean.

284
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,430
大白鲨，体重可以超过四到五千磅
White sharks can weigh in excess of 4 or 5,000 pounds.

285
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,350
体长超过二十英呎，所以，这是一种很大的鱼
Get in excess of 20 feet long.So, that's a very big fish.

286
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,710
我们知道这些鲨鱼可以活到…
We know that these sharks can live...

287
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,070
今天要为这位年轻人做什么？
So, what are we doing for this young man today, then?

288
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,990
不，是为我
Actually, it's for me.

289
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,310
我需要做个血液检查
I just need some blood work done.

290
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,020
你生什么病了？
What's wrong with you?

291
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,550
没什么，我没事
Nothing, I'm fine.

292
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,350
那为什么没去医生那里检查？
Then why haven't you taken yourself to the doctor?

293
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,790
我不想留下他一个人
I don't like to leave him alone.

294
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,590
我尽量少离开家
I try not to leave the house too much.

295
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,830
帅气的男孩
Handsome boy.

296
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,150
他的眼睛像你
He's got your eyes.

297
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,390
他不…
He's not...

298
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,700
谢谢
Thank you.

299
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,310
你自己一个人照顾他？
You take care of him on your own?

300
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,030
嗯
Mmm-hmm.
Hmm.

301
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,110
他看起来很好，强壮
He looks good.Strong.

302
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,470
你一定照顾得很好
You must be doing something right.

303
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,630
你这个年龄的女人血压不应该这么高
Blood pressure is too high for a woman your age.

304
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,030
我们能不能只是，呃…
Could we just, um...

305
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,670
是我多管闲事了
None of my beeswax.

306
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,630
我来
I get it.

307
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,310
你等着就好
You just wait.

308
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,320
医生拿到血液检查结果之后也会这么对你说的
The doctor will tell you the same thing when he gets the results.

309
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,670
你什么时候送史蒂芬去？
So, when are you taking Stephen in?

310
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,270
月底
End of the month.

311
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,790
威尔森医生说我该开始练习离家了
Dr. Wilson says I need to start practicing leaving the nest.

312
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,070
这不算离家吧
I'm not really sure this counts.

313
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,870
我昨天在镇上看到道格哈特了
I saw Doug Hart in town yesterday.

314
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,110
哦，天啊，我那天对他很不客气
Oh, my God,I was so rude to him.

315
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,430
有意思
Funny.

316
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,950
他还觉得惹你生气了
He thought he'd offended you.

317
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,030
你该打电话给他
You should call him.

318
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,430
跟他约会
Ask him out.

319
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,990
也许我只是打电话跟他道个歉
Maybe I should call him just to apologize.

320
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,310
是啊，道歉
Yeah, to apologize.

321
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,830
我那天很不应该
I felt like such an ass the other day.

322
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,590
我不知情
I had no idea.

323
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,390
露西把情况都跟我说了
Lucy explained everything to me.

324
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,150
哦，她一定会的
Oh, of course she did.

325
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,830
你一个人照顾他，一定很辛苦
That must have been hard,taking care of him by yourself.

326
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,430
这也是她跟你说的？
She told you about that, too?

327
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,110
是的，史蒂芬…
And yes, Stephen...

328
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,190
我要把他送到一个护理中心
I'm moving him to a care home.

329
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,260
哦，对不起，我不知道她没有告诉我这个
Oh, I'm sorry, I had no idea.She didn't tell me that.

330
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,790
我以为…
I thought...

331
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,070
对不起，我…
I'm sorry. I...

332
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,670
你知道，我…我都不会说话了…
You know, I... This is hard. I haven't...

333
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,980
我很久没跟男人一起吃饭了
I haven't done this in a while.

334
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,370
车祸之前，你们很亲近？
Were you guys close before the accident?

335
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,670
非常亲近
Very.

336
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,590
我和理查德结婚时，他五岁
He was five when Richard and I got married.

337
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,670
他对我比对他爸爸更亲近
He was closer to me than his dad.

338
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,750
但后来他到了青春期
But then he hit puberty

339
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,230
就像家里有了一个陌生人
and it was like I had a stranger in the house.

340
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,270
我家的亚伦也是
Yeah, Aaron, too.I'm just like

341
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,310
就像完全换了一个人
he's a completely different species.

342
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,940
亚伦是个好孩子
Aaron is a good kid.

343
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,910
他的老师不这么认为
Well, his teachers disagree.

344
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,830
我上周去见了校长
I had a meeting with the principal last week.

345
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,550
黑斯廷斯校长？他很差劲！
Principal Hastings? He's the worst!

346
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,470
史蒂芬也在那里上过学
So, Stephen went there, too.

347
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,110
但后来被开除了
Until he was expelled.

348
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,870
不会吧！为什么？
No! What for?

349
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,190
嗯，是学校小题大作了
Mmm, the whole thing was totally blown out of proportion.

350
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,550
几个学生在游泳池里打闹
There were some kids,and they were messing around in the pool.

351
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,270
他们可能只是戏弄史蒂芬
And I guess they were just teasing Stephen.

352
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,070
有一天，他报复了，但没伤到任何人
One day he retaliated,but no one got hurt.

353
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,710
他生母去世后，他经历了很多痛苦
After his mom died,he was dealing with a lot of grief.

354
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,740
等他进入青春期，他几乎不跟任何人说话
And by the time he was a teenager,he barely spoke to anyone

355
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,440
只除了我，后来就出了…你知道…
except me,and then it was, you know...

356
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,470
我感觉亚伦跟任何人都说话，只除了我
I feel like Aaron talks to everyone but me.

357
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,710
对我完全不理不睬
He just completely shuts me out.

358
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
嗯
Hmm.

359
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,230
我想我就不打扰你们休息了
Well, I guess I should let you two get to bed.

360
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,950
不早了
It's getting late.

361
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,430
史蒂芬？
Stephen?

362
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,420
史蒂芬？
Stephen?

363
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,710
史蒂芬？
Stephen?

364
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,750
我说过了，一定发生了什么，不只是我的幻觉
I told you, something's going on,and it's not just in my head.

365
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,190
玛莉，深呼吸
Mary, take a deep breath

366
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,750
然后想想你说的话
and think about what you're saying.

367
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,670
请听我说
Please just listen to me.

368
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,250
我以为是一个梦，但不是
I thought it was a dream,but it wasn't.

369
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,230
我当时醒着…
I was awake and...

370
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,520
是深眠状态…
Well, sleep parasomnia...

371
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,430
不是什么他妈的深眠状态，好吗？
It's not fucking sleep parasomnia, okay?

372
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,710
拜托，你一定要相信我
Please, you have to believe me.

373
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,830
听听你说的话，你在谈鬼！
And listen to what you're saying.You're talking about ghosts!

374
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,980
这不是你
This isn't you.

375
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,790
真是的，难道我不知道这听起来很荒唐吗？
For God's sake, don't you think I know how this sounds?

376
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,260
一定发生了什么事，我能证明
Something is happening.I can prove it.

377
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,190
史蒂芬的脸上有抓痕
Stephen, he has scratches on his face.

378
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,790
你睡眠不足
You are sleep deprived.

379
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,990
头脑不清
You're confused.

380
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,490
你想搞明白一切
You're struggling to make sense of everything

381
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,940
然后得出了一些荒谬的解释
and latching onto irrational explanations.

382
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,350
听着，也许是你不小心抓了他的脸
Look, maybe you scratched him yourself by accident.

383
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,150
什么？
What?

384
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,030
哦，天啊
Oh, God.

385
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,310
我不知道哪个更糟
I don't know what's worse.

386
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,430
要嘛这些都是真事，要嘛是我疯了
Either this really is happening,or I'm losing my mind.

387
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,630
我经常听到
I keep hearing these weird noises

388
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,070
墙里和地板下有奇怪的声音
in the walls and under the floor.

389
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,790
玛莉，我是来帮你的
Mary, I am here to help.

390
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,260
听着，我会催促他们尽快完成你的血液检查
Listen, I'm gonna rush the lab for your blood work,

391
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,870
然后就可以给你
and then I think we should get you

392
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,510
开一些抗忧郁药
straight onto an anti-depressant.

393
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,270
几小时后我们再聊，好吗？
I'll talk to you in a few hours, okay?

394
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,390
好
Okay.

395
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,960
现在是实时新闻
Now, to some breaking news

396
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,740
关于儿童福利机构几天前报告的…
concerning the young deaf boy reported missing several days ago...

397
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,670
…失踪聋哑儿童
...by Social Services.

398
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,980
不到一小时前
Within the past hour

399
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,780
有人在佛罗里达州哈索恩的一个公园里
a boy fitting the description of 9-year-old Tom Patterson

400
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,390
看到了和九岁的汤姆帕特森特征相符的男孩
has been spotted in a park in Hawthorne, Florida.

401
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,780
接到一个当地居民的报警之后
Acting on a call from a local resident

402
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,230
哈索恩警方正在这一地区进行大规模的搜索
Hawthorne police are now conducting a wide search of the area.

403
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,830
他们怀疑他可能是乘长途汽车来这里
They speculate he may have traveled by Greyhound bus

404
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,870
但是现在还不知道
but as yet are still to determine

405
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,710
他具体在哪里
his exact whereabouts.

406
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,310
接下来报导的是
We'll be back after the break with more

407
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,390
即将到来的暴风雪
on the winter storm heading our way.

408
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,430
- 只有我！ - 嗨！
- Only me!  - Hey!

409
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,990
我知道你说过什么都不要，但是…
Okay, I know you said that you didn't need anything, but...

410
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,910
我也不是第一次了，露西
It's hardly my first rodeo, Luce.

411
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,360
呃…你今晚真的不和我们一起吗？
Um... Sure you don't want to stay with us tonight?

412
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,030
不，我们没事
No, we're fine.

413
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,950
我刚才还以为…
For a moment there,I thought I was...

414
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,550
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

415
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,790
是的，没什么
Yeah, it's nothing.

416
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,110
我只是一直没睡好
I just haven't been sleeping that well.

417
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,500
呃，你真的什么都不缺了吗？
Um, sure you have everything?

418
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,470
灯笼？毛毯？
Lanterns? Blankets?

419
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,750
足够的木柴？
Enough wood?

420
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,150
是的，谢谢你
Yes, thank you.

421
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,710
好吧，你保重，好吗？
Okay, take care,all right?

422
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,940
好的，你也是
Yeah, you, too.

423
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,100
好，再见
Yeah. Bye.

424
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,670
再见
Bye.

425
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,390
灯笼…
Lanterns...

426
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,940
- 哦，天啊…  - 是我
- Oh, God...  - It's just me.

427
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,560
你吓了我一跳
You scared me.

428
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,590
对不起闯了进来，我敲过门，但没人应答
Sorry to barge in.I tried knocking, but no one answered.

429
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,510
我没听到你的车
I didn't hear your car.

430
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,480
有一辆铲雪车挡住了你家的车道
Yeah, that plow just came.Your drive's blocked.

431
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,550
我只能把车停在路边走了过来
I had to park down the road and walk in.

432
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,230
哦，好的
Oh. Okay.

433
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,470
我来是为了感谢你昨晚的款待，也来看看你还好吗
I just came to say thank you for last night and see if you're okay.

434
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,470
我和亚伦在假日饭店订了一间房间
Aaron and I did end up getting a suite down at the Holiday Inn

435
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,200
你们真的不和我们一起去吗？
so, you're sure you guys don't want to come with us?

436
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,270
不，你太客气了
No, that's kind of you.

437
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,820
我们经历过更坏的天气
We've weathered worse.

438
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,750
我昨晚很开心
I had a great time last night.

439
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,310
我也是
Me, too.

440
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,470
呃…
Um...

441
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,230
我真是无比的欣慰，他们找到了汤姆
I can't tell you what a relief it is they found Tom.

442
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,270
你知道，那个离家的孩子
You know,the runaway kid.

443
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,790
是啊，是啊，佛罗里达州
Yeah, yeah, Florida.

444
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,710
但后来发现不是他
That turned out to be a false alarm.

445
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,190
你没听说吗？
You didn't hear?

446
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,030
没有
No.

447
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,310
我相信他会出现的
I mean, I'm sure he's gonna turn up.

448
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,390
可能会在附近的某个镇上发现他
They'll probably find him two towns over.

449
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,520
…越向北，就越
...a little bit as you head further up to the north.

450
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,710
不管你怎么看
No matter how you look at it though

451
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,830
这都是一次严重的冬季风暴…
we're talking about a major winter storm...

452
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,030
你不要紧吧？
You okay?

453
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,070
呃…
Uh...

454
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,630
我还有很多事要做
I have a lot to do.

455
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,110
我就不送你了
You don't mind letting yourself out.

456
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,910
好的
Sure.

457
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,590
道格！我…
Doug! I'm...

458
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,660
嗨，威尔森医生，抱歉，我刚才在楼下
Hi, Dr. Wilson.Sorry, I was downstairs.

459
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,790
- 玛莉？ - 是的
- Mary?  - Yeah.

460
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,880
我刚拿到了你的血液检验报告
I have just gotten your blood work back from the lab.

461
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,960
好
Okay.

462
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,070
- 坦白说，我有些失望  - 什么？
- Frankly, I'm a little disappointed.  - What?

463
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,920
如果你告诉我你在自行用药
If you'd have told me you were self-medicating

464
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,950
我们就能避免很多误会了
we could have avoided a lot of confusion here.

465
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,840
鉴于你吃了那么多药
It's no wonder you're having so many problems

466
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,200
难怪你出了那么多问题
given the amount of pills you're taking.

467
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,990
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

468
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,990
玛莉，苯二氮平类药物不是随便能吃的
Mary, benzodiazepines are not a class of drugs we mess around with.

469
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,910
我什么都没吃
I'm not taking anything.

470
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,230
除了混合用药有可能会致命之外…
Aside from the fact that mixing prescription drugs can be lethal...

471
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,320
混合？
Mixing?

472
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,150
我只能估计你在吃史蒂芬的药
I can only assume that you are taking medication from Stephen

473
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,150
这不光威胁到你的健康
which not only puts your health at risk

474
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,240
还有他的健康
but his also.

475
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,030
你没听我说，我不懂你说什么
You're not listening to me.I don't know what you're talking about.

476
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,990
我什么药都没吃
I haven't taken anything.

477
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,520
我本来很愿意给你开一些有助于睡眠的药
I would have happily prescribed you something to help you sleep.

478
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,640
虽然药效会温和一些
It would have been less potent

479
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,760
但我确定会有效的
but of course I would have done it.

480
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,950
你搞错了，这不是我的血液检验结果
You've made a mistake,those are not my results.

481
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,750
对不起，我现在不方便说
I'm sorry, I really can't talk right now.

482
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,350
我回头再联系你
I'm gonna have to call you back.

483
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,990
玛莉
Mary.

484
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,180
玛莉！
Mary!

485
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,350
玛莉？玛莉？
Mary? Mary?

486
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,280
你拨打的电话
The number you are trying to call

487
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,830
无法接通
is not reachable.

488
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,030
史蒂芬，史蒂芬…
Stephen. Stephen...

489
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,070
不！住手！
No! Stop!

490
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,520
安静，小宝贝
Hush little baby

491
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,470
别说话
Don't say a word

492
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,910
妈妈会给你买一个模仿鸟
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

493
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,660
如果这只模仿鸟
And if that mockingbird

494
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,390
妈妈会给你买一个…
Mama's gonna buy you a...

495
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,380
别怕，别怕，别怕，别怕，别怕
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.It's okay. It's okay.

496
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,070
嘿，别怕，我在这里
Hey.It's okay. I'm here.

497
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,990
不，不，不，不，不，不！不！
No, no, no,no, no, no! No!

498
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,460
别怕，对不起，对不起
It's okay.I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

499
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:02,470
看着我，我是你儿子，史蒂芬
Look. Look at me.It's your son, Stephen.

500
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,110
别怕，我要把它撕下来
It's okay.I'm gonna take this off.

501
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,860
好
Okay.

502
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,870
对不起，好吗
I'm sorry. Okay.

503
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,750
安静，不！嘘！
Hush, no! Shh!

504
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,980
别喊！
Don't scream!

505
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,070
没事，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿
It's okay.Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

506
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,760
别怕
It's okay.

507
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,630
这是怎么一回事？拜托
What's happening? Please.

508
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,590
我在照顾你
I'm taking care of you

509
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,310
就像你照顾我
just like you take care of me.

510
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,110
我在做梦吗？
Am I dreaming?

511
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,590
不是
No.

512
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,940
不再是了
Not anymore.

513
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,470
我不明白
I don't understand.

514
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,430
这…
Is... And...

515
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,630
车祸一周后
When I woke up in the hospital

516
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,750
我在医院醒来
a week after the accident

517
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,190
你在我身边
you were by my side

518
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,630
伺候我的一切
waiting on my every need.

519
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,150
但是你不动，你不说话
But you didn't move.You didn't speak.

520
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,670
是的
No.

521
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,790
你们都以为我不能
And you all assumed I couldn't.

522
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,110
我只是不希望这一切的结束
I just didn't want it to end.

523
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,940
我越是什么都不做，这事就越轻松
And the longer I did nothing,the easier it got.

524
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,750
医生一直对你说
The doctors kept telling you

525
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,830
现在的医学对大脑的了解有多少
how little is known about the brain.

526
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,750
我那时不明白
I couldn't understand.

527
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,870
你的大脑扫描一直在改善
Your scans kept improving.

528
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,470
你的反射也正常
Your reflexes were normal.

529
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,980
我只是看到了你想看到的
You saw what you wanted to see.

530
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,150
这几个月，我们在一起那么幸福
These last few months,we've been so happy together.

531
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,950
只有你和我
Just you and me

532
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,270
直到他来了
until he came here.

533
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,860
汤姆
Tom.

534
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,420
我不能放他走
I couldn't let him go.

535
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,030
他看到我了
He'd seen me.

536
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,470
- 你杀了他  - 我是你儿子！
- You killed him.  - I'm your son!

537
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,830
我是你儿子
I'm your son.

538
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,590
你为什么总是更关心他们？
Why did you always pick them over me?

539
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,310
我比不上他们吗
I won't compete anymore.

540
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,870
嘿，不，不，没事的，嘘
Hey, no, no.It's okay. Shh.

541
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,790
嘿，听着，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿
Hey, look, hey,hey, hey, hey.

542
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,070
没事的
It's okay.

543
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,350
他不是鬼
He's not a ghost.

544
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,270
他就在楼下
He's downstairs.

545
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,790
我本来打算杀了他，但是他爬进了管道间里
I was gonna deal with him,but he climbed into the crawlspace.

546
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,700
到我房间的就是他
That was him in my room.

547
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,950
呃
Uh-huh.

548
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,470
我以为都过去了
Yeah, I thought it was all over.

549
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,230
但是我低估了这个药
But I underestimated these.

550
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,060
他还活着
He's alive.

551
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,870
我把他堵在里面
I blocked him in.

552
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,350
我等着他饿死
I was waiting for him to starve.

553
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,710
他的那个声音
That sound of him.

554
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,220
他在黑暗中刮擦的声音
That sound of him scratching around in the dark.

555
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,720
你知道，在你的茶里放一粒就能让你安睡一整夜
You know, one in your tea used to put you down all night.

556
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,590
由于他来了之后我不得不加大了剂量
I had to up the dosage since he's been here.

557
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,580
嘿，过来，过来
Hey, come here,come here.

558
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,790
张开嘴
Open your mouth.

559
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,030
- 拜托  - 张开
- Please.  - Open.

560
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,220
不，不…
No, no...

561
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,360
啊！
Ow!

562
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,430
停下！停下！停下！
Stop it! Stop it!Stop it!

563
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,150
咽下去
Swallow.

564
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,390
咽下去
Swallow.

565
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,020
乖女孩
Good girl.

566
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:49,590
等你醒来时，他就不在了
When you wake up,he'll be gone.

567
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,390
我们就能回到正常

568
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,230
只有你和我，我保证
Just you and me.I promise.

569
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,990
喂？
Hello?

570
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,150
不！不，别再让我等
No! No,do not put me on hold again.

571
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,590
我需要你们派人去找玛莉波特曼
I need you to send someone out to see Mary Portman.

572
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,790
在Delphi巷二十八号
At 28 Delphi Lane.

573
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,140
不，她…
No. She...

574
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,390
不，她没出事故
No, she has not been in an accident.

575
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,780
我觉得她被下药了
I think she's being drugged.

576
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,590
你已到达目的地

577
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,820
什么？
What?

578
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,750
该死
Shit.

579
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,270
哦，天啊…
Oh, God...

580
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,470
闭嘴！
Shut up!

581
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,470
闭嘴！
Shut up!

582
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,670
我以为你会开心
I thought you'd be happy.

583
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,260
现在你不必把我送走了
Now you don't have to send me away.

584
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,990
我只想帮你，史蒂芬
I just want to help you, Stephen.

585
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,190
你出了严重的车祸

586
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,550
你身体不好
You're not well.

587
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,790
我听见你说了

01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,620

589
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,780
你又要把我送走
You're trying to send me away again.

590
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,860
因为他！
Because of him!

591
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,310
不，不，不是因为他
No, no, it's not because of him.

592
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,630
你把我的房间给了他
You gave him my room.

593
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,910
你要替换我！
You're replacing me!

594
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,990
没人能取代你
No one could ever replace you.

595
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,350
我保证
I promise.

596
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,460
拜托，把斧头放下
Please, just put the ax down

597
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,270
我们可以谈谈

598
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,150
我能解决此事

599
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,190
我们可以回到以前的样子
We can go back o how it was.

600
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,240
我还可以请人帮你，好吗？
And I can get you ome help, okay?

601
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,990
拜托，把斧头放下
Please, just put he ax down.

602
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,870
枪里没有子弹
It's not loaded.

603
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,190
我这是为了我们！
I'm doing this for us!

604
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,140
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

605
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,270
我要带你离开这里
I'm gonna get you ut of here.

606
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,420
不！
No!

607
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,940
快跑！
Run!

608
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,310
史蒂芬，拜托，住手！
Stephen, please, stop!

609
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,950
别说了！别说了！你要毁了一切
Stop it! Stop it! ou're ruining everything.

610
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,120
冷静
Calm down.

611
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,750
我是在帮你收拾残局
I am trying to fix our mess.

612
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,790
史蒂芬，这不是你
Stephen,this isn't you.

613
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,910
闭嘴，快闭嘴，你不了解我
Shut up. Just shut up.You don't know me.

614
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,150
- 你是一个好孩子，史蒂芬  - 不
- You're a good boy, Stephen.  - No.

615
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,830
只是因为车祸
It was just the accident.

616
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,030
那不是意外车祸！
It wasn't an accident!

617
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,350
我不在乎自己的死活，只要能撞死他
I didn't care if I died as long as he did.

618
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,890
你是我的一切…你…
You're what I... You...

619
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,510
你要把我送走
You were sending me away.

620
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,620
我必须阻止他
I had to stop him.

621
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,100
我不能让他带我离开你
I couldn't let him take me away from you.

622
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,980
别碰我
Don't touch me.

623
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,590
我宁愿死，也不想离开你
I would rather die than be away from you.

624
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,350
嘘…
Shh...

625
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,110
我们不需要别人
We don't need anyone else.

626
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,110
哦，天啊，汤姆！
Oh, God. Tom!

627
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,350
不！
No!

628
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,390
哦，天啊，你在哪里？
Oh, God. Where are you?

629
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,620
哦，汤姆
Oh, Tom.

630
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,470
汤姆，来
Tom, come.

631
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,270
下来，来
Come down. Come.

632
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,820
跟我来，快！
Come with me. Quick!

633
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,550
安静，小宝贝
Hush little baby

634
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,510
别说话
Don't say a word

635
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,150
妈妈会给你买一只模仿鸟
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

636
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:28,590
如果这只模仿鸟不唱歌
And if that mockingbird won't sing

637
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,670
玛莉？
Mary?

638
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,430
我是威尔森医生，你…
It's Dr. Wilson, are you...

639
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,910
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

640
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,030
玛莉？
Mary?

641
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,390
有人在家吗？
Anybody home?

642
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,620
你们都好吧？
Everybody okay?

643
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,950
我觉得，呃
I just thought we'd, uh

644
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,550
在警察来之前，我们该聊一聊
have a little chat before the police get here.

645
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,030
哦，天啊
Oh, God.

646
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,990
我觉得我们没时间…
I don't really think that we have time for...

647
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,750
没时间玩游戏，是嘛？
For games right now, do we?

648
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,190
史蒂芬，我是威尔森医生
Stephen, it's Dr. Wilson.

649
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,380
史蒂芬？
Stephen?

650
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,510
你要她送走我
You told her to get rid of me.

651
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,470
但是她爱我
But she loves me.

652
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,430
没人能分开我们
And no one is gonna keep us apart.

653
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,190
汤姆，没事，他走了
Tom. It's okay, he's gone.

654
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,780
没事
It's okay.

655
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,990
这里，穿上
Here. Put this on.

656
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,220
他来了
He's coming.

657
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,910
哦，天啊
Oh, God.

658
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,740
你待在这里
You stay here.

659
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,910
我会回来找你的
I'm coming back for you.

660
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,950
哦，天啊，道格！
Oh, God, Doug!

661
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,830
快，跟我来
Quick, come with me.

662
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,940
等等…
Wait...

663
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,230
在这里等着，等等
Wait here. Wait.

664
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,630
威尔森医生…
Dr. Wilson...

665
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,270
对不起
I'm sorry.

666
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,550
没事的，我会带你离开这里
It's okay. I'm gonna
get you out of here.

667
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,990
他在这里…
He was here...

668
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,830
一直都在
The whole time.

669
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,310
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

670
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,060
在史蒂芬的脑子里…
In Stephen's mind...

671
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,310
不要去反驳他的错觉
Don't challenge his delusions.

672
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,550
你知道吗？
You understand?

673
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,030
别让他看到那个孩子
Don't let him see the boy.

674
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,830
他要的是你，只有你
It's you he wants, only you.

675
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,030
进入他的错觉中…
Enter his delusions...

676
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,510
没事的，我帮你
It's okay, I get you.

677
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,350
不，带那个孩子走
No. Get the boy out.

678
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,940
哦，天啊！
Oh, God!

679
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,500
哦，天啊
Oh, God.

680
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,990
待在这里
Stay here.

681
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,910
没事的
It's okay.

682
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,520
不！
No!

683
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,510
住手！住手！拜托！
Stop! Stop! Please!

684
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,110
不，住手！
No, stop it!

685
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,950
不，听我说
No, listen to me.

686
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,070
- 住手，听我说  - 不！不！
- Stop. Listen to me.  - No! No!

687
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,870
冷静，冷静
Calm down, calm down.

688
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,550
你说得对，好吗？
You were right, okay?

689
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,790
我专注于我的病人
I was focused on my patients

690
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,250
没能考虑到你
when I should have been thinking about you.

691
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,830
- 不！不，已经太晚了！ - 等等！住手！
- No! No, too late!  - Wait! Stop!

692
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,910
我不知道
I didn't know.

693
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,620
我不明白你这么做是为了我们
I didn't understand that you were doing it for us.

694
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,860
我不知道
I didn't know.

695
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,230
为了我们能在一起
So that we could be together.

696
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,270
不，你撒谎！你在帮他
No. You liar! You're helping him.

697
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,910
- 不，我赶走了他  - 不
- No, I got rid of him.  - No.

698
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,550
是的！他现在走了
I did! He's gone now.

699
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,870
现在只有你和我，我保证！
It's just you and me,I promise!

700
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,470
- 这是我们的房子  - 不
- This is our house.  - No.

701
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,750
你说的对
You were right.

702
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,190
他不该在这里
He shouldn't be here.

703
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,110
是我胡涂
I was confused.
