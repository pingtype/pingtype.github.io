00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,280
女士们，先生们，晚上好，这已经是到西雅图的最后一段路了
Good evening. ladies and gentlemen. We are on our final approach for Seattle.

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,030
目前天气状况良好，有些许东风
The weather is fair. with winds out of the east.

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,350
地表温度二十摄氏度
The temperature on the ground. 68 degrees.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,950
我们全体机组人员在这里
On behalf of our cabin crew and us here on the flight deck.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,790
谢谢大家与我们一起乘坐这次航班
we'd like to thank you for flying with us tonight.

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,270
睡不着真是能折磨死人
Life sucks when you can't sleep.

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,600
哦，说来听听
Yeah. tell me about it.

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,120
有些时候聊聊天比较好
Sometimes it's good to talk.

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,870
好吧
Okay.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,790
这听起来很疯狂
This is gonna sound crazy.

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,590
但你听说过一种看完就会死的录像带吗？
but you ever hear about the videotape that kills you after you watch it?

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,110
我在一次聚会上，我遇到了一个来自西雅图的女孩
Well. I'm at this party and I meet this girl from Seattle.

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,910
我们很投缘
We totally hit it off.

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,870
第二天，她寄给我一个录像带，上面写着“看我”
The next day she sends me this video that says. "Watch me."

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,390
于是我找到一个录像机
So. I find a VCR.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,880
开始看
watch it.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,110
但它的画面…
but the images on it...

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,280
看完录像带的那一刻，我的电话突然响了
The second it was over. my phone rings.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,510
对方是个女生说我将会在七天后死亡
And this girl says I'm gonna die in seven days.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,830
也就是今天
That was a week ago tonight.

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920
从那以后，一切都变得奇怪了
Ever since. everything's been strange.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,830
我唯一需要做的就是挺过记下来的五分钟
All I got to do is make it through the next five minutes.

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,300
- 提醒…  - 天呐，不好意思
- As a reminder...  - God. I'm sorry.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,470
- 先生！先生，请待在您的座位上  - 请待在您的座位上
- Sir! Sir. please stay in your seat.  - Please remain in your seats

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,830
并系好安全带
with your seat belts fastened.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,990
先生！
Sir!

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,910
怎么了？
What was that about?

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,190
那个坐在我们旁边的帅哥
That cute guy sitting right next to us...

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,910
可能脑袋有点问题
It turns out he's a total head case.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,670
他在跟我说一部将会杀死他的电影
And he was telling me about a movie that's supposed to kill you.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,470
什么电影？
What movie?

35
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,590
一些视频之类的
Some video.

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,990
当你看完的时候会有个电话打给你
A chick calls you on the phone after you watch it

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,640
还说什么“七天”，好像就是现在
and says. "Seven days." which was. like. right now.

38
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,630
开门
Open up!

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,840
你有复制一份吗？
Did you make a copy of it?

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,670
你有复制一份录像带吗？
Did you make a copy of the tape?

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,910
没有！我…
No! I...

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,030
- 女士，安全带的提示灯亮了  - 天呐
- Miss. the seat belt light is on.  - Jesus.

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,830
你到底怎么了，这只是个故事
What is going on with you? It's just a story.

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,790
我看过它！
I've seen it!

45
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,950
航控中心，我是七十七号客机
Traffic control. this is Flight 77.

46
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,030
我们遭到一些信号干扰
We have some signal interference.

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,790
如果你不想买，能不能让一下，我看看
If you're not interested in buying. I'd love to take a look.

48
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,190
好的，可是谁会买这个老式录像带？
Sure. I mean. who would want an old VCR?

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,830
想当年它也是一场技术革命
Well. once upon a time this was a technological revolution.

50
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,540
好吧
Okay.

51
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,680
刚刚和那个人讲话
Just talking to the guy.

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,960
他所有的东西原来是从
It turns out that he got all this stuff from

53
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,310
一户人家那里拿到的，他们的儿子死于一年前的飞机事故
a family whose son died in a plane crash a couple of years back

54
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,750
现在那些东西已经变成一团过时的垃圾
And now it's just a bunch of outdated junk.

55
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,160
我喜欢用“复古“”这个词来形容
I prefer "vintage."

56
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,350
快啊，你这个老家伙
Come on. old man.

57
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,670
你还有好几年还可以活呢
You still got some life in you.

58
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,270
嘿，Skype？
Hey. Skye?

59
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,310
你猜怎么着
Guess what.

60
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,520
什么？
What?

61
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,080
里面有一个录像带
Had a tape in it.

62
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,190
想知道什么会放出来吗？
Care to see what's down the rabbit hole?

63
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,230
我要上课迟到了
I'm gonna be late for class.

64
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,800
不过你可以一会儿告诉我
But then. maybe you can tell me about it later.

65
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,870
玩的开心，教授
Have fun. Professor.

66
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,630
快点，运转
Come on. work.

67
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,510
你好？
Hello?

68
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,510
七天
Seven days.

69
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,240
什么？你是谁？
What? Who is this?

70
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,940
朱丽亚
Julia.

71
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,750
我一直在想这个故事
I keep thinking about this story.

72
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,670
它简直就像是历史上最浪漫的故事
It's. like. the most romantic story in the history of stories.

73
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,070
是吗，可我们不是这么相遇的
Well. it's not how we met.

74
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,990
不是，这是关于这个男人奥菲斯
No. It's about this guy. Orpheus.

75
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,150
他的女朋友死了，然后他不得不进入地狱来拯救她
His girlfriend dies and he has to literally go down into Hell to rescue her.

76
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,270
为什么一直是男人救女人？
How come it's always the guy rescuing the girl?

77
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,400
因为…
Just...

78
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,790
他一直在寻找她，好吧？最后终于找到了她
He tracks her down. All right? He finds her.

79
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,390
但是恶魔答应让她离开的条件是
And the Devil's gonna let her go on one condition.

80
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,670
他必须在没有女友陪伴的情况下先离开地狱
He has to start first. without her.

81
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,430
他必须先走而且不能回头看她
He has to walk away without looking back at her.

82
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,430
- 但是  - 他忍不住回头瞄了她一眼
- But...  - He looks back to glimpse her

83
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,750
于是，他在第九层地狱永远失去了他的女友
and loses her forever. Ninth grade.

84
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,270
- 英语文学课  - 好吧，原来你懂这个故事
- English Lit.  - Okay. You know it.

85
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,230
所以，你什么意思？
So. what's your point?

86
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,110
我不知道，我只是
I don't know. I just...

87
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,950
在那个男人的处境上想
I relate to the guy.

88
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,400
我简直无法想象能不回头看你
I mean. I can't imagine not looking back at you.

89
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,630
事实上，你必须得走了
Actually. you got to go.

90
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,550
因为我的男朋友要离开这里上大学，而我答应了他帮他收拾行李
Because my boyfriend's leaving for college. and I promised I'd help him pack.

91
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,830
- 不要！ - 来，起床
- No!  - Come on. get up.

92
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,600
宝贝，宝贝，宝贝，他是个失败者，回到床上吧
Baby. baby. baby. he's a loser. Come back to bed.

93
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,310
现在回到床上
Come back to bed. now.

94
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,470
- 你真的需要这些东西？ - 是的
- You really need all this?  - Yeah.

95
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,230
我们走吧，快点，快点
Let's go. Come on. come on.

96
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,990
快点，霍尔特！
Come on. Holt!

97
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,590
我们一小时前就该出发了
Supposed to be on the road an hour ago.

98
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,190
老爸，等我一分钟
Just give us a second. Dad.

99
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,030
你做了一件正确的事
You're doing the right thing.

100
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,670
你的妈妈，她现在真的很需要你
Your mom. she really needs you right now.

101
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,470
我会想念你的气味
I'm gonna miss your smell.

102
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,870
真的？
Really?

103
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,230
真的
Yeah.

104
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,110
好
Okay.

105
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,790
我会在周末的哥伦布纪念日来看你
I'll see you Columbus Day weekend.

106
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,710
还有告诉汤米·隆巴迪，我和他干上了
And tell Tommy Lombardi that I'm on to him.

107
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,910
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

108
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,230
他在我离开的那天得到了一份你公司的工作？
He gets a job where you work the day I leave?

109
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
你神经病！
You're crazy!

110
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,740
不要回头看！
Don't look back!

111
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,790
记得今晚九点半Skype视频！
9:30. Skype. tonight!

112
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,190
- 妈的你的衬衫在哪？ - 今晚！
- Where the hell is your shirt?  - Tonight!

113
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,390
- 还有以后的每天晚上！ - 以后的每天晚上！
- And every night!  - And every single night!

114
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,070
除非我和汤米·隆巴迪在一起的时候
Unless I'm with Tommy Lombardi!

115
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,430
你刚刚说什么！
You did not just say that!

116
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,550
宝贝，现在已经六个星期了，我好想你
Baby. it's been six weeks. I can't take it.

117
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,830
为什么你突然变得这么好？因为我们现在不住在一个镇上？
Why are you so much nicer now that we don't live in the same town?

118
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,960
不好意思，你叫什么名字来着？
Sorry. what's your name again?

119
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,950
- 闭嘴  - 那可是个很奇怪的名字
- Shut up.  - That's a weird name.

120
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,680
你上课怎么样？
How are your classes?

121
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,190
有点无聊
Kind of uninspiring.

122
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,510
不过有一门实验生物学课
There's this one Experimental Biology class. though.

123
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,790
那门课的老师有点爱惹是生非
The teacher's kind of a badass.

124
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,760
听起来很有意思
That sounds cool.

125
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,390
是啊
Yeah.

126
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,230
不过不是每件事都有意思
Not everything's cool. though.

127
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,710
感觉就像是过了整整一个星期我才见到你
It's still. like. a whole week until I get to see you.

128
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,750
那么你现在见到我了
Well. you're seeing me now.

129
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,750
是啊，我想是吧
Yeah. I guess.

130
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,590
我现在可以摘下我的发卡吗？
What about I start by taking off my hairclip?

131
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,950
好的，没问题
Yeah. Okay.

132
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,830
然后呢？
What's next?

133
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,990
“带我，带我，我忍不住！”
"Take me. take me. I can't stand it!"

134
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,350
你是怎么进来的？
How did you even get in here?

135
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,110
这些白痴闯进了我的房间
These idiots just broke into my room.

136
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,230
来吧，我们是寻梦之旅，加布里埃尔说你来了
Come on. Vision Quest. Gabriel says you're up.

137
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,350
让我们去第七层
Let's go to the 7s.

138
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,310
- 妈的今晚吗？ - 今晚
- Shit. Tonight?  - Tonight.

139
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,710
抱歉，小姐，你的男朋友今晚有事
Sorry. little lady. but boyfriend's got plans tonight.

140
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,110
- 你知道我们可以聊天  - 我觉得我还好
- You know. but we could talk.  - I think I'm good.

141
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,270
我会补上的，我保证
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

142
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,190
- 我明天就和你说…  - 他会跟你说…
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.  - He'll talk to you...

143
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,190
好的，没问题
Yeah. sure.

144
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,750
我说过我会给你补上的
I told you I'd make it up to you.

145
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,390
朱丽亚…
Julia...

146
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,760
你欠我一个好觉
You owe me a good dream.

147
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,950
- 他在哪？ - 你是谁？
- Where is he?  - Who are you?

148
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,070
霍尔特在哪？
Where's Holt?

149
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,630
我不知道，我已经几天都没有和他说话了
I don't know. I haven't spoken to him in days.

150
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,710
不要对我撒谎！
Don't lie to me!

151
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,950
我没有撒谎！
I'm not lying to you!

152
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,430
你在他的电脑上做什么？
What are you doing on his computer?

153
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,980
告诉他不要再逃，告诉那个死人他逃不了
Tell him there's no hiding. Tell the dead man he can't hide.

154
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,830
什么…你在说什么？你怎么了？
What... What are you talking about? What's wrong with you?

155
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,110
她来了
She's coming.

156
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,910
没有人能够阻止她
There's no stopping her.

157
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,550
告诉霍尔特
Tell Holt that…

158
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,710
请拿起电话
Please pick up the phone.

159
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,760
这是霍尔特，你知道什么…
This is Holt. You know what to…

160
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,510
这是霍尔特，你知道该怎么做
This is Holt. You know what to do.

161
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,320
霍尔特，这是怎么回事？
Holt. what's going on?

162
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,710
我刚刚和那个奇怪的女孩有一段有史以来最奇怪的对话
I just had the strangest conversation in my life with that weird girl.

163
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,190
这是霍尔特，你知道怎么做
This is Holt. You know what to do.

164
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,950
你好？
Hello?

165
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,470
科学告诉过我们，我们仅仅只是
Science has told us that we are merely

166
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,510
由碳和蛋白质构成的原始生物
the primal stirrings of some carbon. some proteins.

167
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,310
我们生活着，可以的时候，
We live a while. eat.

168
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,550
也吃着，做着
have sex. when we can.

169
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,470
这就是生活的全部，直至我们死去
And that's it. then we die.

170
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,590
勒温，这不重要
Lewin. there's no need to take notes on that part.

171
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,510
等一下！
But wait. hold on.

172
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,190
因为没有人否认我们的本体意识
because no one is denying that we have consciousness.

173
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,940
有很多内在的生命没有被解释
Some inner life that's not quite accounted for here.

174
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,790
让我们记住这个邪恶的双重撕裂实验
Let's remember the infamous double-slit experiment.

175
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,270
当没有人看的时候，这些微粒会在同一时间穿过两个缝隙
When no one is watching. the particles just pass through both slits at the same time.

176
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,470
但当观察者在的时候，它们就会表现得向子弹一样
But with an observer. they behave like bullets.

177
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,870
穿过一个或者另一个缝隙
passing through one slit or the other.

178
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,430
朋友，这很重要
This is big. guys.

179
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,270
这非物质的人类意识
The immaterial human consciousness

180
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,000
已经到达并且接触了这里
has reached out and touched the material.

181
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,630
在这个真实的世界上存在可计算的改变
There is a calculable transformation in the real world.

182
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,520
而且仅仅因为
and solely because

183
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,270
有人在这里看着它
someone was there to watch it.

184
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,070
这也解释了
Which may account for the fact

185
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,990
为什么当我发现有一个神秘的陌生人在我房间后面注视着我时
that I have become significantly sweatier once I've noticed

186
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,590
我会汗流浃背
the mysterious stranger watching me from the back of the room.

187
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,510
好吧，就是这样，我们去喝一杯吧
All right. that's it. Go get drunk.

188
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,790
嗨！我记得见过你们…
Hey. I remember you guys from…

189
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,310
- 你为什么会来这里？ - 别这样，哥们
- Why'd you come here?  - Come on. dude.

190
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,190
继续向前，这边请，这边请
Move it along. There you go. There you go.

191
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,750
我能为你做些什么吗？
How can I help you?

192
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,790
我在找我的男朋友
I'm looking for my boyfriend.

193
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,280
他应该在你们这里
He's supposed to be in your class.

194
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,270
好的，请问他叫什么名字？
Okay. What's this guy's name?

195
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,790
霍尔特·安东尼
Holt Anthony.

196
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,390
是的
Yeah.

197
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,870
不确定
Not sure.

198
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,350
我总是要花很多时间，直到感恩节才能弄清楚谁是谁
It always takes me until Thanksgiving to start putting names to faces.

199
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,030
真的吗？
Really? 'Cause

200
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,590
因为我们以为他会为你做一些能取得额外学分的事
he was supposed to do some sort of extra credit thing for you.

201
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,310
他有吗？
Did he?

202
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,790
也许吧，我不知道
Maybe. I don't know.

203
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,870
我知道我还有二十五篇文章要打分
I do know that I have 25 essays to grade.

204
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,160
听着，好吧
Listen. Okay.

205
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,550
对于新学生来说，找到一个比班级更有趣的人或者事
It's not uncommon for a new student to find something or someone

206
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,350
是很罕见的
that's more interesting to them than class.

207
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,310
我可以给你几个忠告吗？往前看
My advice to you? Move on.

208
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,710
- 请你冷静！ - 我告诉你，这是不一样的
- Calm down.  - I'm telling you. it's different.

209
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,630
每个人都这么说，没关系，你的尾巴去哪里了？
Everyone says that. It's okay. Where's your tail?

210
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,430
我再也没有了
I don't have one anymore.

211
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,840
我告诉过你别打给他
I told you not to call him.

212
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,910
那个混蛋挂我电话！
That asshole hung up on me!

213
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,400
我想知道为什么
I wonder why.

214
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,670
好吧，我们来交换尾巴，你和霍尔特说了？
Okay. We'll switch tails. You talk to Holt?

215
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,870
没有！我试过了，他没接电话
No! I tried. He isn't answering his phone.

216
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,630
- 拜托  - 霍尔特有他自己的问题
- Come on.  - Holt has his own problems.

217
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,240
加百列[加布里埃尔]你必须帮助我
You have to help me. Gabriel.

218
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,630
- 都是你的错！你先开始的！ - 请你冷静
- It's your fault! You started this!  - Calm down.

219
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,230
加布，听我说
Listen to me. Gabe!

220
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,470
那些视频，那些尾巴，所有的那些人
The videos. the tails. all these people.

221
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,430
- 这是错的而且她生气了  - 你简直是荒诞不经
- It's wrong and she's pissed!  - You're being ridiculous.

222
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,160
我可以感觉到她，这一切都在改变
I can feel her. It's all changing.

223
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,390
你没有多少时间了，你必须相信我
You don't have much time.You need to trust me.

224
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,070
我该如何才能再次相信你？
How could I ever trust you?

225
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,070
去你的工作室，一路上别和任何人说话
Get to your studio. Don't talk to anyone along the way.

226
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,710
把视频复制下来，然后等我
Make a copy of the video and wait.

227
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,870
我现在就要把它寄给其他人，哎，哎，哎！
I'm gonna send someone right now.Hey. hey. hey!

228
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,270
一切都会好起来的，亲爱的，你能明白吗？
Everything's gonna be fine. darling. You understand?

229
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,790
好的！我知道！
Yes! I understand!

230
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,790
不，你不知道
But you don't.

231
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,270
老实说，我没有找到那段可怕的录像带，但是…
I honestly didn't find the tape to be that scary. but…

232
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,880
哎，你不该出现在这里！
Hey. you're not supposed to be here!

233
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,150
哎！
Hey!

234
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,190
那天晚上你打电话给我
You called me the other night.

235
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,870
哎！看着我
Hey! Look at me.

236
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,350
你是霍尔特的女朋友
You're the girlfriend.

237
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,870
谁是霍尔特？
Where's Holt?

238
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,630
我…我可以帮助你
I... I can help you.

239
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,790
但是我必须要先给你看一样东西
But I need to show you something first.

240
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,990
你住在这里吗？
You live here?

241
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,910
是的，美术，研究生项目
Yeah. Fine Arts. Grad program.

242
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,760
我需要一个清醒的头脑才能做我的工作，以及…我喜欢我的秘密
I need a clear head to do my work and I like my privacy.

243
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,430
霍尔特来过这里吗？
Is Holt even here?

244
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,670
他说过他会在这里吗？
Did I say he would be?

245
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,550
注意脚下，我刚刷了天花板
Be careful where you step I just painted the ceiling.

246
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,190
没有什么问题，他没有在躲你
Nothing's wrong. He's not avoiding you.

247
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,830
他只是正在路上
He's just on a journey.

248
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,870
我想让你看一些东西，然后你会明白的
I want you to watch something and then you'll understand.

249
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,150
- 这是我的手机吗？ - 你在说谎！
- Is that my phone?  - You're lying!

250
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,750
我需要你为我做这个
I need you to do this for me.

251
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,790
这只是一段两分钟的视频，它不会伤害你的
It's just a two-minute video. It won't hurt you.

252
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,040
开门！把门打开！
Open the door!

253
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,030
朱莉娅！我需要你的帮助！
Julia! I need you to help me.

254
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,230
霍尔特看过这个，我们都看过这个
Holt watched it. We've all watched it.

255
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,310
把门打开！
Open the door!

256
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,270
你不是真的
You're not real.

257
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,870
你不是真的！
You're not real!

258
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,470
七点十分
7:10.

259
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,030
我赢了，小婊砸
I win. bitch.

260
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,230
朱勒！
Jules!

261
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,750
发生什么了？发生什么了？！
What happened? What happened?

262
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,670
告诉我你没有看它对吧，告诉我！
Tell me you didn't watch it. Tell me!

263
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,070
她死了！她死了！她死了！[重要的事情说三遍]
She's dead. She's dead. She's dead.

264
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,750
你好？
Hello?

265
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,590
加布里埃尔寄给我的
Gabriel sent me.

266
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,390
我应该要看这个视频
I'm supposed to watch a video.

267
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,270
你好
Hello.

268
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,070
加布里埃尔，加布里埃尔
Gabriel. Gabriel.

269
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,260
你知道斯凯吧？
Do you know about Skye?

270
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,990
我知道，有人在网上放了她的照片
I know. Someone put a picture of her online.

271
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,630
每个人都在退出
Everyone's dropping out.

272
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,230
等一下
Wait.

273
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,400
等一下，你的尾巴现在仍然在？
Wait. Do I still have a tail?

274
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,110
加布里埃尔？
Gabriel?

275
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,150
还有人在看我吗？
Is someone still watching for me?

276
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,430
我会帮你找到人的，我发誓
I'm gonna find you someone. I promise you that.

277
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,870
在原地别动
Just stay where you are.

278
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,110
那是谁
Who was that?

279
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,070
是加布里埃尔
It was Gabriel.

280
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,990
一切都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be fine.

281
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,910
这些就是他告诉斯凯的
That's what he told Skye.

282
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,390
听着，朱莉娅
Listen. Julia.

283
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,910
对于你看到的一切，我很抱歉
I'm really sorry that you had to see that.

284
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,830
但是我不能让你也陷入其中
But I can't let you get caught up in this.

285
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,910
我觉得现在这样有点迟了
I think it's a little too late for that.

286
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,520
我看了它
I watched it.

287
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,430
在斯凯之后的十二小时
Twelve hours after Skye.

288
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,590
我们应该通过这个帮助对方
We were supposed to help each other through it.

289
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,900
帮助对方？
"Help each other"?

290
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,910
是的
Yeah.

291
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,790
- 所以你和她…  - 不
- So were you and her…  - No.

292
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,310
加布里埃尔说，我们当中的一部分人会被选中加入这个实验
Gabriel said a few of us were gonna be chosen for this experiment.

293
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,590
如果你听过他描述它的方式
If you just heard the way he described it.

294
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,590
我们可以证实人死后
That we could prove the existence of a soul.

295
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,310
灵魂的存在
Of life after death.

296
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,190
我知道，我知道，这听上去很荒谬
I know. I know. It sounds crazy.

297
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,470
但我只是…
but I'm just…

298
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,150
这个磁带是一扇门通往另一边
The tape is the doorway to the other side.

299
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,710
那，为什么她死了？
Then why did she die?

300
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,670
在你死前，你有七天时间
You have seven days before you die.

301
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,790
你不得不看这份磁带并且复制一份，然后给别的人看
You just have to watch the tape and make a copy. and show it to someone else.

302
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,310
然后你就会没事
And then you're fine.

303
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,550
加布里埃尔把它称作一条“尾巴”
Gabriel calls it a "tail."

304
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,390
她没有把她的尾巴给别人看
Her tail just didn't show.

305
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,910
所以你原本想将死刑判决传递给别人？
So were you supposed to pass on a death sentence to someone else?

306
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,270
你是怎么卷入其中的？
How could you get involved in this?

307
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,550
求你了
Please.

308
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,030
无论你是什么
Whatever you are.

309
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,870
离他远点
leave him alone.

310
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,310
七天
Seven days.

311
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,230
朱勒，你做了什么
Jules. What did you do?

312
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,710
我看到了一些东西
I saw something.

313
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,340
那有一间房间，一扇门
There was a room. A door.

314
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,670
- 是的  - 那是加布里埃尔
- Yeah.  - It's Gabriel.

315
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,870
霍尔特，听着，我给你找了一件燕尾服
Holt. listen. I've got a tail for you.

316
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,550
这将不再属于我
It's not for me anymore

317
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,740
你应该我知道为什么我不接你的电话吧，对吗？
You know why I wasn't answering your calls. right?

318
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,230
这是为了保护你
It was to protect you from this.

319
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,830
加布里埃尔帮我想了个解决办法
Gabriel had a solution for me.

320
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,830
一切都会好的，我也会好的
It would have been fine. I would have been fine.

321
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,920
那么我也会好的
Then I'll be fine. too.

322
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,630
朱勒！
Jules!

323
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,630
发生了什么？
What happened?

324
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,080
一只鸟
A bird.

325
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,870
刚刚那有只鸟
There was a bird.

326
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,750
朱丽娅
Julia!

327
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,830
看到了吗？我都说了那有只鸟
See? I told you there was a bird.

328
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,670
朱丽娅！
Julia!

329
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,800
但我看到了它
But I saw it.

330
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,190
所以，你看了那卷磁带嘛
So. you watched the tape.

331
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,990
我需要像神话一样祭祀自己吗
And I had dismissed self-sacrifice as popular myth.

332
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,830
霍尔特已经快没有时间了
Holt was running out of time.

333
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,350
这是唯一可以救他的办法了
It was the only way to save him.

334
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,070
每个人都需要完成它
Anyone would have done it.

335
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,350
你知道的，我可以向你展示一些调查
You know. I could show you some research

336
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,470
会显示出相反的结果
that would suggest the opposite.

337
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,870
她已经做了决定
She's marked already.

338
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,710
在第一天
On day one.

339
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,790
但这，这是不同的
And it's... It's different.

340
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,070
直到第五天我也还没决定
I wasn't marked until day five.

341
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,310
加布里埃尔，这一定有着什么含义
Gabriel. this has to mean something.

342
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,350
这一切发生的太快了
It's happening faster.

343
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,550
可能所有一些都变了
Maybe it is all changing.

344
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,910
我相信这卷磁带一定代表了一些事情
I wanted to believe that tape meant a lot of things.

345
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,470
当我们死亡的时候
That our souls are eternal.

346
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,390
我们的灵魂未灭
and when we die.

347
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,950
灵魂在试图寻找一个新的家
the spirit strives to find a new home.

348
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,910
然后我看到了那个图片
Then I saw the picture.

349
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,870
我看到了斯凯的脸
I saw Skye's face.

350
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,990
你也看到了
You saw it. too.

351
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,700
为了活下来，你复制了一份，然后给别人看了
You want to survive. you make a copy and you show someone.

352
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,240
如果不是你，根本不会有人死亡
No one is dying because of me.

353
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,630
我告诉他们这个是怎么回事
I'll tell them how it works.

354
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,910
所以呢？诅咒还是会继续吗
And so what? The cycle just continues?

355
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,590
你觉得怎么样才能活下来
What do you think survival is?

356
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,430
赶快去复印一份
Just make a copy.

357
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,750
我们再决定待会怎么做
We'll decide what to do with it later.

358
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,900
拜托了
Please.

359
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,270
你刚在这里干什么
What did you do here?

360
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,550
她的版本没办法复印
Her version won't copy.

361
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,830
什么叫做“没办法复印”？
What do you mean "it won't copy"?

362
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,030
你的文件比一般的要大
Your file size is larger than the original.

363
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,840
怎么可能呢
How can that be?

364
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,670
擦拭一下她的复印件
Scrub through her copy.

365
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,550
这是什么，快回去
What is that? Go back.

366
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,630
在这里！
Right there!

367
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,990
那只鸟
The bird.

368
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,270
我都告诉你了我在车里见过那只鸟
I told you in the car I saw that bird.

369
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,590
什么？
What?

370
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,030
它不应该在这里
It shouldn't be there.

371
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,190
我需要我的设备
I need my equipment.

372
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,990
好吧，看到了吗，有些奇怪的断口在那些数字编码里
Okay. See. there's these weird gaps in the digital code.

373
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,310
差错，我们在哪里找到的那些灵魂的图像，就像你的鸟
Glitches where we get these ghost images. like your bird.

374
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,230
我的意思是，我们在讨论一个或者两个帧的静止图像
I mean. we're talking one or two frame still images.

375
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,390
但那明明有更多的图像
but there's more.

376
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,710
那有视频数据浓缩在这些静止帧之中
There's video data condensed in the still frames.

377
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,070
有一个视频在这个视频里面？
A video within the video?

378
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,070
嗯哼，你看
Well. there is now.

379
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,310
我不希望你看这个
I don't want you to watch it.

380
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,990
朱勒，我们没有别的办法了
Jules. there's no way.

381
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,790
别再说了，我们一起看这个
We're watching this together. End of discussion.

382
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,430
霍尔特，无论如何，我觉得这是针对朱莉娅一个人的
Holt. whatever it is. I think it's intended for Julia alone.

383
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,040
看着我
Look at me.

384
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,070
我知道，你很不开心，因为我看了这个视频
I know you're upset that I watched it.

385
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,710
但是我们不能任由它徒然地去
But we can't let it be for nothing.

386
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,550
所以，不要回头看，好吗？
So don't look back. okay?

387
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,790
把它放好
Put it on.

388
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,510
朱勒？
Jules?

389
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,430
亲爱的，告诉我们你看到了什么
Baby. tell us what you see.

390
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,510
一个钟
A clock.

391
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,110
一个在洪水之中的十字架
A cross in a flood.

392
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,870
一个女孩
A girl.

393
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,360
朱勒
Jules.

394
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,870
朱勒？
Jules?

395
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,710
我不知道
I don't know.

396
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,710
一具燃烧的尸体
A burning body.

397
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,380
朱勒！
Jules!

398
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,350
对不起，我…
Sorry. I…

399
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,080
那个是什么？
What was it?

400
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,470
只是图片而已，但我无法解释那种感觉
Only images. but I can't explain how it felt.

401
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,910
洪水，火焰，火葬[火化]
Flood. Fire. Cremation.

402
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,990
这些图片从来之前从没有在磁带上出现过
Those are images that have never been on the tape before.

403
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,390
你知道的吧，原始文化相信只有一种方法能让灵魂获得自由
You know. primitive cultures believed that the only way to free a soul

404
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,030
那就是焚烧尸体
is to burn the body.

405
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,070
换而言之，如果你能找到它
That is. if you can find it.

406
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,380
等一下
Wait.

407
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,270
我见过这个
I saw this.

408
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,390
那个地方，是他们焚烧她尸体的地方
That's where they buried her.

409
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,110
那是一座城，叫做圣礼城
I traced it to a town called Sacrament Valley.

410
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,150
离这里有大概四个小时的路程
about four hours from here.

411
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,750
那里就是我们需要去的地方
That's where we need to go.

412
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,670
你在听吗？
Hello?

413
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,840
谢谢你，贾马尔
Thank you. Jamal.

414
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,030
警察正在来的路上
The police are on their way here.

415
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,870
你不愿意跟我们一块走吗？
And you're not even coming with us!

416
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,310
霍尔特，警察想要问我一些问题
The police want to ask me questions. Holt.

417
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,860
- 他们觉得是你杀了斯凯  - 但是你没有
- They think you killed Skye.  - But you didn't.

418
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,230
我真希望你从义务教育中学到过什么
I hope if you learn anything from an education.

419
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,190
那就是，不止一个理论可以是真的
it's that more than one theory can be true.

420
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,600
我没有杀斯凯
I didn't kill Skye.

421
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,990
或者，是我做的
And I did.

422
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,270
但是警察从不接受摸棱两可
But the cops don't deal in such ambiguities.

423
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,590
这是我的我的调查
My research.

424
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,710
所有关于这个磁带的资料都在这
Everything that's known about the tape is in there.

425
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,950
它们比我对你更有用
It'll be more of a help to you than I can be.

426
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,470
一个从没达到过工作标准的男人
A man never quite measures up to his work.

427
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,870
这些在磁带上的图片是她的故事
The images on the tape. they were her story.

428
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,030
她希望这些故事能被知晓
She wanted it to be heard.

429
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,590
萨马拉曾经是一个被遗弃的孤儿
"Samara was found abandoned as a young child.

430
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,510
没有人知道她从哪里来，没人知道她的父母是谁
"No one knew where she came from or who her parents were.

431
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,630
于是大家意识到她是被遗弃的
"She was adopted. and they realized

432
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,030
关于这个女孩的一些事情很反常
"that something was unnatural about this girl.

433
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,230
一些邪恶的事情
"Something evil.

434
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,440
他们试图杀了她
"They tried to kill her.

435
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,190
“但萨马拉在井底幸存了七天”
"but Samara survived for seven days at the bottom of the well.

436
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,470
“他们几年后发现了她的尸体”
"They found her body years later."

437
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,830
他们把她一路带到这个城镇呢？
And they brought her all the way to this town?

438
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,140
为什么？
Why?

439
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,670
我不知道
I don't know.

440
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,430
那个女孩
That girl.

441
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,750
什么女孩？
What girl?

442
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,830
你好！
Hello?

443
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,150
你好！
Hello?

444
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,310
- 我能帮你吗？ - 嘿…
- Can I help you?  - Hey...

445
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,470
快天黑了，请问你们还有空房吗？
There was no light outside. Do you have any vacancies?

446
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,230
两个房间？
Two rooms?

447
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,670
一个
One.

448
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,590
只收现金，在中午结帐
Cash only. Checkout's at noon.

449
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,190
这是非常旧的房间
It's an old house.

450
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,680
墙壁很薄
Walls are thin.

451
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,830
希望你不介意的有猫
Hope you don't mind the cats.

452
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,660
我刚刚在大厅里
I'm just down the hall.

453
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,630
打扰一下，这张照片中的女孩是谁？
Excuse me. Who's the girl in this photo?

454
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,830
中间的那个？
The one in the middle there?

455
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,470
什么？那是我的侄女
Why. that's my niece.

456
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,830
很漂亮，对吧？人们说我们看起来…
Beautiful. isn't she? People say we look just…

457
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,830
不，我很抱歉，我是说拿着小提琴的女孩
No. I'm sorry. I meant the girl with the violin.

458
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,470
那是伊夫林
That's Evelyn.

459
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,270
我想我看到她了
I think I saw her.

460
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,790
在今天早些时候
Earlier today.

461
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,110
这是不可能的
That's not possible.

462
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,550
她三十年前就消失了
She disappeared 30 years ago.

463
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,470
有人知道为什么吗
Does anyone know why?

464
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,270
不知道
No.

465
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,190
我不想谈这个
And I'd rather not talk about it.

466
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,470
女士，教会在哪里？
Ma'am. where's the church?

467
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,350
这里没有教会了
Well. it's not a church anymore.

468
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,790
那是当我撞到石头底部
That's when I hit rock bottom.

469
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,590
我猜最糟糕的部分，是我放弃了我的孩子
I guess the worst part of it for me was that I let down my kids.

470
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,670
放弃了我的丈夫
I let down my husband.

471
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,550
如果生活让你失望，请举起手来
Raise your hand if life ever let you down.

472
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,350
现在去吧，举起你的手
Go ahead now. raise your hand.

473
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,590
然后你发现了这毒品，以为得到了解脱
And then you found the drug that you thought unlocked a secret.

474
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,670
今天就到这吧
One day at a time.

475
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,630
谢谢大家的光临
Thank you all for coming.

476
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,590
下周再见
I'll see you next week.

477
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,310
朱勒，我们最好走吧
Jules. We better go.

478
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,950
所以，我们现在干什么？
So. what do we do now?

479
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,630
刚来这的年轻人，不要让它杀了你
Awful young to be here. Don't let it kill you.

480
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,800
打扰一下，先生！
Excuse me. sir!

481
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,560
关于教会你能告诉我一点点吗？
Could you tell me a little bit more about the church?

482
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,960
什么时候关闭？
When did it close?

483
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,480
已经十三年了
Been 13 years.

484
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,030
在被淹没之前
After the flood.

485
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,150
这个小镇曾经的人口是现在的五倍
Town used to have five times this many people.

486
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,830
从那时到现在
Ever since.

487
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,550
死神的镰刀比降临的生命来得更快
there's more dead than alive around here.

488
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,230
谢谢
Thank you.

489
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,390
- 他说这个教堂以前…  - 这就是曾经他们带她来的地方
- He said the church was…  - That's where they brought her.

490
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,030
这个墓地
The cemetery.

491
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,350
去找她的名字
Look for her name.

492
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,800
拜托，快接电话
Come on. pick up.

493
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,710
这是霍尔特，你知道该做什么
This is Holt. You know what to do.

494
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,510
霍尔特，我是加布里埃尔
Holt. it's Gabriel.

495
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,870
我不知道你是否拿到了这些信息
I don't know if you're getting these messages.

496
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,750
但我已经知道了朱丽亚手上的标记代表着什么
but I figured outBut I can't let you get caught up in this. the mark on Julia's hand.

497
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,510
那个是盲文，我马上过来找你们
It's braille. I'm gonna come find you guys.

498
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,110
觉醒的水会带着他们安全地回到上帝身边
"The waters rose to carry them and brought them back safely to God."

499
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,710
霍尔特！
Holt!

500
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,310
霍尔特！
Holt!

501
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,350
哎，哎，哎
Hey. hey. hey.

502
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,390
她在那
She's in there.

503
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,710
有人动了她
Someone moved her.

504
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,470
朱勒？
Jules?

505
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,040
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

506
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,310
这里有字
There's writing.

507
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,230
霍尔特
Holt.

508
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,070
霍尔特！
Holt!

509
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,390
朱莉娅！
Julia!

510
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,430
嘿，发生什么了？发生什么了？发生什么了？
Hey. what happened? What happened? What happened?

511
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,640
我看见了一些东西
I saw something.

512
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,470
那个井
The well.

513
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,990
- 我们只是在找…  - 我知道你们在找什么
- We were just looking…  - I know who you're looking for.

514
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,140
走吧
Let's go.

515
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,070
- 你找到了什么？ - 两个孩子
- What did you find?  - Two kids.

516
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,510
看到他们从二九四号破门而入
Caught them breaking into 294.

517
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,070
破门而入？
Breaking in?

518
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,400
好吧，真新鲜
Well. that's new.

519
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,230
要不要把他们带到警长办公室？
You want me to take them down to the Sheriff's Office?

520
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,430
不不不不不不，不要麻烦警长了
No. no. no. no. no. don't bother the Sheriff.

521
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,030
我会照顾好这一切
I can take care of this.

522
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,030
我是盖伦·伯克
I'm Galen Burke.

523
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,830
我在这里做看守
I watch over things here.

524
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,950
可以这么说
So to speak.

525
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,230
请进
Please. Come in.

526
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,520
这不算什么
It's not much.

527
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,030
但我不曾期待过陪伴
But I wasn't expecting company.

528
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,950
- 我…我可以…  - 不，不用了，我没事，孩子
- I can... I can take…  - No. no. I'm fine. son.

529
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,550
我对这房子了如指掌
I know every corner of this house.

530
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,070
所以
So.

531
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,830
你在寻找一位女孩
you're looking for the girl.

532
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,190
真有意思
I find it interesting

533
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:49,350
你竟在她的标记移走后还能找到她的坟墓
that you managed to find her grave even after the marker was removed.

534
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,780
我做过一个梦
I had a vision.

535
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,670
梦里有一张坟墓的地图，它想领着我去那
An image of that grave that led me here.

536
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,870
在坟墓的里面
And inside the grave.

537
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,230
我看见了一个井
I saw a vision of a well.

538
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,070
一个幻象
A vision.

539
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:22,080
所以，你想要知道关于萨马拉·摩根的事情
So. you want to know about Samara Morgan.

540
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:28,910
我们的牧师非常积极
Our priest was very active with the community back then.

541
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,630
他听说那个小女孩
He heard that after all the little girl had been through

542
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,230
曾经被长眠之地拒绝过
that she was being denied a resting place.

543
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,510
好吧，谁说的宽容不意味着死亡呢？
Well. who's to say that charity isn't meant for the dead?

544
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,110
那么，为什么她现在不在这里？
So why isn't she there now?

545
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,430
因为我们为这种宽容的行为付清了代价
Well. because we paid mightily for this act of charity.

546
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,860
就好像上帝和大自然本身想让我们摆脱她
It was as if God and nature itself wanted us to be rid of her.

547
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,350
- 那个洪水  - 是的
- The flood.  - Yes.

548
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,670
但是我需要让自己
But I had let myself believe.

549
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,720
像你一样
like you.

550
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,230
相信她试图想告诉我什么
that she was trying to tell me something.

551
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,230
我曾被拉向坟墓
I was pulled to that grave.

552
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,550
她给我看了一些东西
She showed me things.

553
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,710
一些没有人可以想象到的东西
Things that no one should have to imagine.

554
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,030
然后我就失去了理智
And then I went blind.

555
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,520
- 对不起  - 不，不用说对不起
- I'm so sorry.  - No. don't be.

556
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,350
它给我带来了宁静
It brought me peace.

557
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:40,060
那个牧师要求移动她的尸体
The priest requested that her body be moved.

558
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,310
他离开了圣礼城[Sacrament Valley]
He left Sacrament Valley.

559
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,720
她被埋在了城市北边的波特墓园
She was buried in a potter's field just north of town.

560
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,870
被所有人遗忘
to be forgotten by all.

561
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,030
我觉得我们需要出去
I think we should get out of here.

562
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,390
听我说
Listen to me.

563
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,190
那个女孩不值得我们好奇
There is nothing about that girl that's worth being curious about.

564
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,630
我需要了解这一切
I need to see this through.

565
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,990
为什么
Why?

566
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,310
因为你认为被选择是有原因的吗？
Because you think you were chosen for something?

567
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:17,310
你有一个梦境不代表你知道那个梦境代表着什么
Having a vision doesn't mean you know what that vision means.

568
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,150
谢谢你
Thank you.

569
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,390
你手上有什么东西？
What's this on your hand?

570
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,800
为什么你要把这个标记放在手上？
Why did you put this mark on your hand?

571
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,800
你这是什么意思？
What do you mean?

572
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,830
小心
Be careful.

573
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,950
记住了？
You hear me?

574
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,380
所以，现在我们要干什么？
So. what now?

575
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,750
我们需要找到那具尸体
We gotta find the body.

576
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,150
- 啥？ - 你，在这别动
- What?  - Hey. stay right there.

577
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,590
这条路关闭了，刚刚发生了事故
This road's closed. There's been an accident.

578
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,630
- 你们需要掉头  - 好的，警官
- Need you to turn it around.  - Okay. sir.

579
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,280
- 朱丽亚！ - 是那个女孩
- Julia!  - It's that girl.

580
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,670
图中的那个女孩
From the picture.

581
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,470
哎，你想往哪走呢，先生？
Hey! Where do you think you're going. sir?

582
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,190
请你掉头
Excuse me. Turn around.

583
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,590
停下！
Stop!

584
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,310
伊夫林！
Evelyn!

585
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,230
你给我停下！
Stop!

586
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,030
加布里埃尔？
Gabriel?

587
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,670
加布里埃尔
Gabriel.

588
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,350
- 在这里！他需要帮助！ - 哎！
- Over here! He needs help!  - Hey!

589
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,350
加布里埃尔
Gabriel.

590
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,150
这是什么
What is it?

591
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,670
嘿，先生！拜托！
Hey. sir! Please!

592
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,190
加布里埃尔，告诉我
Gabriel. tell me.

593
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,720
你不能下去！
You can't be down there!

594
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,110
朱丽亚！
Julia!

595
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,870
他来这是有理由的
He was coming for a reason.

596
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,150
他想告诉我们一些事情
He wanted to tell us something.

597
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,830
不，是她想要告诉我们一些事情
No. she wanted to tell us something.

598
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,630
这个女孩有一些关于萨马拉的事情
This girl has something to do with Samara.

599
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,440
我们必须回去
We need to go back.

600
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,390
我能感觉到她的痛苦，她的经历
I can feel her pain. her suffering.

601
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,760
我有些心烦意乱，而且感觉越来越糟
I'm sick with it and it's getting worse.

602
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,750
我很累了
I'm so tired.

603
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,190
那你睡吧
Then you sleep.

604
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,430
我准备给咱俩弄些吃的
I'm gonna get us something to eat.

605
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,670
好的
Okay.

606
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,190
看
Look.

607
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,110
我们会想到办法的
We'll figure this out.

608
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,680
我当时就在那里
I was right there.

609
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,660
吃的来了，凯伦
There you go. Karen.

610
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,670
炸鸡，肉排，还有咖啡
Chicken fried steak and coffee.

611
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,910
嘿，菜单？
Hey. Menu?

612
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,510
是的！当然
Yeah. Sure.

613
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,910
嗯，那是什么？鸡肉或者牛排？
So. what is that? Chicken or steak?

614
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,080
你真有意思
You're funny.

615
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,440
听着，我…
Look. I…

616
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,590
我无意冒犯，但是…
I don't mean to be rude. but…

617
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,550
你侄女的朋友，那个消失不见的女生…
The girl who's friends with your niece. the one who disappeared…

618
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,510
你能和我说一点到底发生了什么吗？
Can you tell me a little bit more about what happened?

619
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:00,830
我侄女和她通过教堂的音乐项目互相认识的
My niece and she knew each other through the church music program.

620
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,910
但她是最有天赋的
But she was the most gifted.

621
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,470
人们经常和她开玩笑：“这里是小庙，容不下你”
People used to kid her. "You're too good for this place.

622
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:13,430
“等有一天，当我们醒过来，你就会消失了，嗯，一定会这样的”
"We're gonna wake up one day and you'll be gone. and that'll be that."

623
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,110
我觉得这种玩笑开不得，
I guess there's certain jokes you shouldn't make

624
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,600
因为，它真的会发生的
because it happened.

625
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,830
她真的失踪了
She disappeared.

626
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,590
一件衣服也没有留下，也没有留下什么话
No clothes gone. No note.

627
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,240
就那样凭空消失了
Just vanished.

628
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,910
当时的牧师，
The priest.

629
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,870
他把你关在这里
He kept you down here.

630
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,320
这个孩子！
The child!

631
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,350
三十四周
Thirty-four weeks.

632
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,630
八个半月
Eight and a half months.

633
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,190
你当时怀孕了
You were pregnant.

634
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,550
你是萨马拉的妈妈
You were Samara's mother.

635
01:17:55,080 --> 01:18:00,100
警察调查了六个月，然后就没有消息了
The police investigated for six months. and then we stopped hearing from them.

636
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,950
从那之后，感觉镇子就不太对了
Town never felt quite the same after that.

637
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,880
那个牧师
The priest.

638
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,390
你知道他发生了什么吗？
Do you know what happened to him?

639
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,430
他还住在镇上
He still lives in town.

640
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,960
虽然他早就不是牧师了
Although he isn't a priest anymore.

641
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,710
自从他瞎了之后就不是了
Not since he went blind.

642
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,950
我要走了，不好意思
I have to go. Excuse me.

643
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,910
伯克先生！
Mr. Burke!

644
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,630
是朱丽亚！我必须和你谈一谈！
It's Julia! I have to talk to you!

645
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,070
那个男孩不和你在一起
The boy's not with you.

646
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,910
怎么了？
What's wrong?

647
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,390
我想我理解我看到的了
I think I understand my visions.

648
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,510
她所展示给我的事情
The things she's been showing me.

649
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,310
我需要了解一下那个牧师
I need to know about the priest.

650
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,790
我猜，就像镇里的大多人一样，
I guess. just like most people in the town.

651
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,910
这件事情使他身体被掏空
the event sort of took it out of him.

652
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,470
只是我不能理解为什么
I just don't see why it matters.

653
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,350
三十年前在这里消失的女孩
There was a girl here 30 years ago who disappeared.

654
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,230
我见过她
I've seen her.

655
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,820
伊夫林·伯顿
Evelyn Borden.

656
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,710
你认识她？
You knew her?

657
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,640
大家都认识伊夫林
Everyone knew Evelyn.

658
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,430
她被关在教堂下面
She was kept under the church.

659
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,430
我找到了一个房间，就像监狱一样
I found a room. It was like a prison.

660
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,030
在墙上有天数的标记
There were days marked off on the walls.

661
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,390
九个月
Nine months.

662
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,190
她萨马拉的妈妈
She's Samara's mother.

663
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,750
从她出生起就她就饱受痛苦
She suffered from the day she was born.

664
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,790
并且这种痛苦持续到现在
And she's still suffering now.

665
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,510
我觉得我理解了
I think I understand it.

666
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,790
这是诅咒，这
This curse. This.

667
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,510
除非她自由，否则永远不会结束的
It will never stop until she's free.

668
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,990
是什么声音？
What's that sound?

669
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,910
蝉？
Cicadas.

670
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:42,710
伯克
Burke.

671
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,470
朱勒？
Jules?

672
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,790
朱勒
Jules!

673
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,470
朱丽亚…
Julia...

674
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:00,790
我知道被幻象所带领是什么感觉
I know what it's like to be guided by visions.

675
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,990
准确而言，
To be certain.

676
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,750
我曾确信我将成为
I was certain that I would father

677
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,150
可以改变世界的孩子的父亲
a child that was gonna change the world.

678
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,990
我是对的
And I was right.

679
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,670
你看，朱丽亚
You see. Julia.

680
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,190
她并没有夺取我的视力
she didn't take my sight.

681
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,590
是我自己
I did.

682
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,680
好姑娘
Good girl.

683
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,390
- 你非常的勇敢  - 你是萨马拉的父亲！
- You're very brave.  - You're Samara's father.

684
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,670
你绑架了伊夫林
You kidnapped Evelyn.

685
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,270
我和她睡在一起的那晚
The night that I laid with her.

686
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,950
我听见了它们
I heard them.

687
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,270
蝉鸣
The cicadas.

688
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,960
你移动了她的骨头，并且她依然被你囚禁着
You moved her bones and she's still your prisoner.

689
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,910
彼此彼此
As are you.

690
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,550
你以为你是她哭喊要求放了她的
You think that you're the first Good Samaritan

691
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,200
第一个好心人吗？
that she cried out to. to free her?

692
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,510
你是第十二个，朱丽亚
You're the 12th. Julia.

693
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,320
虽然其他人没有像你这样挖的这么深
Though none of the others got this far.

694
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,990
你觉得你很快就会给她带来平静了
You think that you're so close to bringing her peace.

695
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,390
但是你不知道，你将会被流放到地狱
But you have no idea the hell that you would unleash on the world.

696
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,960
朱丽亚？
Julia?

697
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,870
萨马拉不会伤害我的，因为我看不见她
Samara can't hurt me because I can't see her.

698
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,600
但是你，朱丽亚
But you. Julia.

699
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,190
我可以听见你的每一次呼吸
I can hear your every breath!

700
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,910
你无法
You will

701
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,840
使她得到自由！
not set her free!

702
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,340
朱丽亚
Julia.

703
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,750
你让我想起了伊夫林
you remind me of Evelyn.

704
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,270
我曾经用链条锁住过她的双手
I chained Evelyn's hands

705
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:43,990
因为她曾试图杀掉我们的孩子
because she was trying to kill our child.

706
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,910
我应该让她去的！
I should have let her!

707
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,670
她曾是你的女儿！
She was your daughter!

708
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,710
你想告诉我什么？
What are you trying to show me?

709
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:12,910
不要
No.

710
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,630
萨马拉
Samara.

711
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,470
你在这
You're here.

712
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,230
朱莉娅
Julia?

713
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,670
她在这，萨马拉
Here she is. Samara!

714
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,070
这就是你的救世主！
This is what becomes of your savior!

715
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:50,390
带着圣灵的恩典
With the grace of the Holy Spirit.

716
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,350
请让主将你从罪恶之中
may the Lord who freed you from sin

717
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,500
拯救出来
save you.

718
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,190
带你去天堂
and raise you up!

719
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,070
朱莉娅…
Julia…

720
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,960
别离开我
Don't leave me.

721
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,590
…从罪恶之中！
...from sin!

722
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,830
请让主拯救你！
May the Lord save you!

723
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,750
通过这样圣洁的洗礼…
Through this holy anointing…

724
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,740
谁在那？
Who's there?

725
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,750
萨马拉
Samara.

726
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,510
嘿，没事的
Hey. It's okay.

727
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,680
都结束了
It's over.

728
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,500
都结束了
It's over.

729
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,150
还没
Not yet.

730
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,150
那是一种什么感觉？
What could that have felt like?

731
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,870
对所有应该爱你的人感到畏惧
To be feared by everyone who's supposed to love you.

732
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,550
并不是所有人
Not everyone.

733
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,030
你从没怕过她
You were never afraid of her.

734
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:23,910
你自由了，萨马拉
You're free. Samara.

735
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,390
霍尔特，那是加布里埃尔
Holt. It's Gabriel.

736
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:16,750
我不知道你是否收到过这些信息
I don't know if you're getting these messages.

737
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,560
但是我知道朱莉娅手上的记号代表着什么了
but I figured out the mark on Julia's hand.

738
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,670
那是盲文，我会回来找你们的
It's braille. I'm gonna come find you guys.

739
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,110
我们的灵魂是不朽的
Our souls are eternal.

740
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,270
当我们死去
and when we die.

741
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,870
我们的心灵会去寻找到一个新的归宿
the spirit strives to find a new home.

742
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,740
我要告诉你，她回来了
I'm telling you. she's coming back.

743
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,190
这次是真的
This time for real.

744
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,750
你再也不会害怕她了
You were never afraid of her.

745
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,840
仅仅因为你有过一个梦境
Just because you had a vision

746
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,600
不代表你知道那个梦境代表什么
doesn't mean you know what that vision means.

747
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,830
你根本不知道
You have no idea

748
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:38,310
那个你将会被流放去的地狱
the hell that you would unleash on the world.

749
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,790
对不起
And I'm sorry.

750
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,110
它不会停止的
It won't stop.

751
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,430
不，不要
No. no.

752
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:55,910
什么
What?

753
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,120
不，不要，不要！
No. no. no!

754
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,830
停下！
Stop!

755
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,110
拜托！
Come on!

756
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,200
重生
rebirth

757
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,200
朱莉娅
Julia!
