2
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,940
我认识贝蒂已经有一周了
I had known Betty for a week.

3
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,440
我们每晚都做爱
We screwed every night.

4
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,110
天气预报说有暴风雨
The forecast was for storms.

5
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,080
救到了！
Saved!

6
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,410
是的，现在好好去洗一个澡
Right, time for a nice little shower.

7
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,900
我们初次见面时是在白天
First time we've met in daylight.

8
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,930
你来得太早了
You're much too early.

9
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,230
那又怎么样？我看起来怎么样？
So what? How do I look?

10
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,560
你认为怎么样？
What do you think?

11
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,460
你喜欢吗？
Do you like it?

12
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,560
你自己吃掉那所有的辣椒
Eating all that chilli by yourself?

13
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,530
在如此炎热的天气下？你疯了
In this heat? You're mad.

14
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,560
无论天气怎样炎热我都会吃辣椒，贝蒂
I'll eat chilli no matter how hot it is, Betty.

15
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,060
我也是！我饿死了
Me too, I'm starving.

16
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,050
见到我高兴吗？
Glad to see me?

17
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,550
他们都是混蛋！
They're all bastards.

18
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,690
谁？
Who?

19
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,210
算了，吻我！
Forget it. Kiss me.

20
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,540
全是混蛋！
All bastards!

21
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,170
难怪女孩和他们分手
No wonder a girl ends up splitting.

22
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,680
等等，解释一下，我不明白你的意思
Wait, explain, I don't get you.

23
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,680
你为什么不注意听我说话？
Why don't you ever listen to me?

24
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,040
我听了，我一直在听！
I do listen. I'm listening.

25
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,400
我不只是只想找一个男人和我做爱
I don't just want a guy to screw me.

26
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,040
想像我在那个乱七八糟的地方消磨了一年...
To think I spent a year in that dump...

27
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,030
...抹擦餐桌，躲避醉汉...
...wiping tables and dodging drunks...

28
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,340
...某天早上我感到再无法忍受上司了
...just to get felt up one morning by the boss.

29
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,530
我现在得重新开始 我太累了. 总之, 我离开了
I've got to start all over again now. I'm dead. Anyway, I left.

30
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,900
甚至买不起一张火车票
Can't even buy a train ticket.

31
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,600
她就像是一支有着透明的蕊喙 和紫红色肤浅的中心的花朵
She was like a flower with translucent antennae and a mauve plastic heart.

32
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,390
没有多少女孩能穿得像她一样随便
Not many girls could dress as casually as she did.

33
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,380
我昨天又看见那个女孩子了
I saw that girl again yesterday.

34
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,880
在如此炎热的天气下，有点不对劲
It's not right, in this fucking heat.

35
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,950
我想她正在寻找你
I think she was looking for you.

36
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,380
不能是你吗, 左格?
Was it you, Zorg?

37
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,380
一个女孩穿着一件小围裙,有着一头乌黑秀发.
A girl in a little apron, with black hair.

38
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,470
像这样的女孩吗?
A girl something like that?

39
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,580
天哪! 岂有此理!
Jesus-fucking-Christ!

40
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,310
是的, 老 乔治, 她是正在找我的.
Yes, old George, she was looking for me.

41
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,430
我该主意了, 我也来.
I've changed my mind, I'm coming too.

42
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,540
你真是走桃花运了
You've torn a page out of Playboy.

43
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,530
-你觉得怎么样? -她挺普通的
-What do you think? -She's a bit common.

44
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,220
那让我恢复信心了
That reassures me.

45
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,910
等一下. 就等一会!
Hold on. Hold on a second!

46
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,280
喝光它
Down in one.

47
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,700
喝光它....
Down in one....

48
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,580
我认为我起不来了，我喝醉了
I don't think I'll be able to get up. I'm drunk.

49
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,040
我得去方便一下
I need to take a piss.

50
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,630
不要压我的膀胱
Don't press on my bladder.

51
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,000
跟你在一起我很高兴
I'm happy being with you.

52
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,630
如果可以的话，我愿意和你呆在一起
I'd like to stay with you if I can.

53
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,320
好的, 我认为你能
Well, I think you can.

54
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,450
我没有老婆, 没有孩子
I've got no wife, no kids.

55
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,120
我们有很好的住所
We've got a nice pad.

56
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,120
我有一个很棒的工作，我是修理工
I have an okay job. I do repairs.

57
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,940
我很有信心，我们还很年青
I'm confident. We're still young.

58
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,940
我不需要解释
I didn't want explanations.

59
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,580
我只想吻她，抚摸她的臀部...
I only wanted to kiss her and caress her ass...

60
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,620
...只要她的膀胱支撑得起
...as long as her bladder held out.

61
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,310
那是谁？醒醒！
Who's that? Wake up!

62
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,400
他是谁？请不必客气，就当是自己家
Who is he? Make yourself at home!

63
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,800
等一下, 我一会就回来
Wait, I'll be right back.

64
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,300
你怎么样? 对不起, 你正坐在我裤子上
How are you? Excuse me, you're sitting on my trousers.

65
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,570
我也不穿内衣裤，穿着感觉不舒服
I don't wear underwear either. It's uncomfortable.

66
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,800
我给你倒些咖啡
I'll get you some coffee.

67
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,400
我得先去煮
I have to make it first.

68
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,930
我去煮吧！你先穿衣服
I'll do it. You get dressed.

69
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,790
是不是因为那个女孩...
Is it because of that girl...

70
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,720
...都到上午十时了，你还躺在床上?
...that you're still in the sack at 10 a.m.?

71
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,800
已经十点了吗?
10:00 already?

72
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,090
有趣的家伙. 现在十一点了
Funny guy. It's 11:00.

73
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,920
她没有让你忘掉吧?
She mustn't make you forget, see?

74
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,590
她没有让你忘掉...
She mustn't make you forget...

75
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,450
...你为什么在这, 为什么我给你房子住， 还付给你工资
...why you're here, why I house you and why I pay you.

76
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,790
我得煮点水
I'll boil some water.

77
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,790
混蛋
Shit!

78
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,290
坦白地说，这一点也不是她的错
This isn't her fault at all, honestly.

79
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,090
在冰箱里，咖啡能更好地保持它的味道
Coffee keeps its flavour better in the fridge.

80
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,150
是的, 你是对的
Yes, you're right.

81
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,310
-来一杯吗? -不, 非常感谢
-Want a shot? -No, thanks very much.

82
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,280
首先要弄湿地面
Always moisten the grounds first.

83
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,280
我只要做一个招聘广告...
All I have to do is to run an ad...

84
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,080
...就会有很多人应聘你做的工作, 但我想要公平一些
...to get loads of guys for your job, but I want to be fair.

85
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,640
我已经雇用你很久了 没有人抱怨过你
I've had you a long time and nobody's ever complained about you.

86
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,870
但我不认为们你留那个女孩在这的同时...
But I don't think you can keep that girl here...

87
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,550
...还能做好工作
...and do your job right.

88
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,400
明白我所说的吗?
Know what I mean?

89
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,280
看到它怎样膨胀了吗?
See how it swells up?

90
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,540
-乔治告诉你关于她的事了吗? -你没有藏住她.
-George told you about her? -You didn't exactly hide her.

91
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,360
他该告诉你她在这干了多少事
He could've told you how much she does here.

92
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,270
家务，购物，每件事! 非常多
The housework, shopping, everything! That counts a lot.

93
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,400
我确信
I'm sure.

94
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,900
让我节省了很多时间. 另外...
Saves me lots of time. What's more...

95
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,890
...她免费做这些
...she does it for free.

96
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,530
所以你想要我追究这件事
So you want me to just forget it.

97
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,530
我今天的确睡过了头, 但我会补尝的
I did oversleep today, but I'll make up for it.

98
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,390
特别是在喝完咖啡后. 我来侍候你.
Especially after coffee. Let me serve it.

99
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,060
告诉我什么时侯
Say when.

100
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,060
这些破烂屋子需要再刷点漆
All these shacks need another lick of paint.

101
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,380
他们看起来就像垃圾箱!
They look like hell!

102
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,380
它们一定会更好看的
They sure would look better.

103
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,850
或许有个办法
There may be a way.

104
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,520
你和你的女朋友能做得到吗?
Can you and your girl do it?

105
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,350
你开玩笑? 它需要一个团队来做.
Are you kidding? It'd take a whole company.

106
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,250
我们会一直干到二千年
We'd still be at it in the year 2000.

107
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,370
当你坠入情网时, 还会考虑时间吗? 并且你俩已经组成了一个团队
When you're in love, what's time? And you two already make a company.

108
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,880
好的, 但你给她多少工资?
Okay, but how will you pay her?

109
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,550
真有趣. 你刚刚才要我忘了见到她.
Funny. You just asked me to forget I saw her.

110
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,280
如果我付她工资，那我不就吃亏了?
How can I make ends meet if I pay her?

111
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,730
依照你自己的节奏工作吧
Just do it at your own pace.

112
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,730
我会让你来处理 我会从老乔治那里订购油漆
I'll leave you to it. I'll order the paint from old George.

113
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,000
别担心，努力工作
Don't worry, just plug away.

114
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,600
别忘了弄湿地面
And don't forget to moisten the grounds.

115
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,500
那个胖笨蛋是谁
Who was that fat slob?

116
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,150
物主
The owner.

117
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,030
他想要什么
What did he want?

118
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,530
没有什么， 他只要我们干点刷漆工作
Nothing, he just wants us to do a little paint job.

119
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,720
好极了！我喜欢刷漆
Terrific. I love to paint.

120
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,020
五百间平房，五百前厅
500 bungalows. 500 fronts.

121
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,020
一千五百墙板 数以千计百页窗
1,500 sides. Thousands of shutters.

122
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,000
只是一点刷漆工作!
Just a little paint job!

123
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,720
你们俩重新刷全部的木屋?
Are you two going to repaint all these shacks?

124
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,350
也该重新刷那些人
Should repaint the people too.

125
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,710
闭嘴！乔治
Just shut your mouth, George.

126
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,840
-你向我发脾气吗? -你怎么猜到的?
-Hell, are you mad at me? -How did you guess?

127
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,340
不要在贝蒂面前讨论它. 去吹你的萨克斯管吧
Don't talk about it in front of Betty. Go play your sax.

128
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,510
我只是告识诉这些好人我们要给他们的屋子刷漆
I just told these nice folks we're painting their house.

129
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
我做什么?
What shall I paint?

130
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,310
你刷窗，我来刷剩下的
The shutters. And I'll do the rest.

131
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,910
-什么使你烦恼? -什么也没有.
-What's bugging you? -Nothing.

132
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,700
赢的人帮助其他人
The winner helps the other.

133
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,540
-准备! -希望她不会失败
-Ready! -I hope she doesn't fall.

134
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,010
她不会，她还年轻
She won't. She's young.

135
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,360
我赢了!
I win!

136
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,800
-我开始刷墙吗? -当然.
-Shall I start on the wall? -Sure.

137
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,760
太无聊了
What a drag.

138
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,790
该死!
Shit!

139
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,250
你真是个笨蛋!
You goofed!

140
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,790
有什么错误吗?
What's wrong?

141
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,120
是我的错. 我忘了告识诉你不要越过那个墙角
My fault. I forgot to tell you not to go past the corner.

142
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,790
油漆刷太大
The brush is too big.

143
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,780
现在看来那一面已开始
Now it looks as if that side is started.

144
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,670
但是谁关心?
But who cares?

145
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,280
谁关心?
Who cares?

146
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,670
你不会只刷一边吧,不是吧?
You're not going to paint just one side, are you?

147
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,140
你想为他们刷整间屋子?
You want to do the whole shack for them?

148
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,900
-是的, 当然. -当然?
-Yeah, of course. -Of course?

149
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,870
-你是个油漆房屋冠军. -你期望什么?
-You're a champion house painter. -What do you expect?

150
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,800
干吧，我来抓着桶
Go on, I'll hold the bucket.

151
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,690
又想睡觉吗?
Fallen asleep again?

152
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,600
瞌睡虫.
Sleepy warm slug.

153
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,090
准备好了吗?
Ready?

154
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,430
微笑，把油漆棍举高点
Smile! Hold the roller higher.

155
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,090
让我看看!
Let me see!

156
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,380
这样好极了!
It's terrific!

157
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,080
-我看起来很难看. -你为什么摆出那种表情?
-I look awful. -Why'd you pull that face?

158
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,060
我们厌烦刷漆了，就再刷一间
We're fed up with painting. Just one more.

159
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,750
停下，我们已经刷五十间了，贝蒂
Stop, we've already got 50, Betty.

160
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,220
我们喝啤酒吧
Let's have a beer.

161
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,070
那肥佬又来了
That fat slob again.

162
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,080
你们的确工作很辛苦
You sure are working hard.

163
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,340
你盼望什么?
What do you expect?

164
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,750
你们真是太棒了. 我们来看你们是否能保持这种速度
You're fantastic. We'll see if you can keep up the pace.

165
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,710
他刚才说什么?
What did he just say?

166
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,040
他什么也没说!
He didn't say anything!

167
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,240
你什么意思，“速度”?
What do you mean, "the pace"?

168
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,040
不要担心，亲爱的年轻女士...
Don't worry, my dear young lady...

169
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,570
...我没有要求你们不停地工作, 我不是一个恶魔.
...I'm not asking you to do it nonstop, I'm not a monster.

170
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,540
继续取凉吧. 对你们很合适.
Just keep fanning yourself. Suits you nicely.

171
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,540
不停地做什么?
To do what nonstop?

172
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,710
所有的平房
All the bungalows.

173
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,770
他在开玩笑,是不是?
He's kidding, right?

174
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,230
我像是在开玩笑吗?
Do I look like I am?

175
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,570
我会重新考虑
I'll think it over.

176
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,060
贝蒂！停下！
Betty! Stop!

177
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,530
-你疯了! -你不介意刷你这破木箱!
-You're insane! -I don't mind painting your crate!

178
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,860
让它看起来更时髦!
Makes it look more sporty!

179
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,560
但我不会刷你的木屋!
But I won't paint your shacks!

180
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,820
她疯了!
She's insane!

181
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,060
刷一下就焕然若新!
One wipe and it'll be like new!

182
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,720
她月经来了，这里的风把她吹得有点疯了
She's having her period, and this wind's enough to drive you crazy.

183
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,560
我确信她有歉意
I'm sure she's sorry.

184
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,350
我甚至愿为你刷街灯柱!
I'll even paint the lampposts for you!

185
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,230
电力公司会做那个，你个笨蛋!
The electricity company does that, you jerk!

186
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,880
你好！是我
Hi. It's me.

187
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,040
你跟那笨蛋说了什么?
What did you tell that asshole?

188
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,010
除非你工作，他不让你留在这
Look, he wouldn't let you stay unless you worked.

189
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,870
把所有木屋都刷了，简直就像谋杀
It's murder to paint all those shacks.

190
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,150
在某种程度上，是的
In a way, yes.

191
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,820
在某种程度上？该死，他们全是杂种!
In a way? Shit, they're all bastards!

192
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,310
我们该割断他们的喉咙!
We should cut all their throats!

193
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,510
-那能帮上什么忙? -你毫无自尊心吗?
-How would that help? -Have you no pride?

194
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,100
我愿把整个市镇都刷成粉红色的...
I'll paint the whole town pink...

195
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,640
...只要能和你呆在一起，小猫!
...just to stay with you, kitten!

196
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,510
你疯了! 看看那浑蛋如何对待我们!
You're nuts! Look what shit we're in with that asshole!

197
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,800
你让他诈骗你，为了什么? 告诉我!
You let him screw you, and for what? Tell me!

198
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,130
我们处境相同!
We're all in the same boat!

199
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,330
不要胡说八道!
Stop talking bullshit!

200
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,970
如果我不钦佩你，我怎么会爱你?
How can I love you if I can't admire you?

201
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,860
我们在这只是在学习如何死亡!
We're only learning how to die here!

202
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:52,000
看看外面的风, 吹起报纸碎片?
See the wind outside, blowing bits of newspapers by?

203
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,670
某天来自北方的报纸, 下一次来自南方...
Papers from the North one day, from the South the next...

204
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,340
...都是胡说 我们夹在中间!
...always the same bullshit, and we're in between!

205
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,330
现在, 听着, 我们有舒适的地方做爱...
Now, look, we've got a nice pad to screw in...

206
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,700
...原来你才疯了!
...so it's you who's nuts!

207
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,020
你这懦夫! 你们男人总是有问题! 该死!
You coward! Something's always wrong with you guys! Shit!

208
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,830
你是愚蠢的贱人!
And you're a stupid bitch!

209
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,690
男人总是有问题!
Always something wrong with a guy!

210
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,650
这里太黑了，又散发出臭味！
It's dark in here, your house stinks!

211
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,520
我烦透了，我在这不能呼吸!
I'm fed up! I can't breathe in here!

212
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,690
我要好好改善你房屋的状况，让我能呼吸!
I'm going to fix your house up good so I can breathe!

213
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,680
全是胡说!
Sort your shit out a bit!

214
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,820
我会给你看得!
I'll fucking show you!

215
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,810
-那个不行，贝蒂! -它为什么特殊?
-Not that one, Betty! -Why is it so special?

216
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,350
情感成份.
Sentimental attachment.

217
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,220
-这些都是什么? -希特勒的论文集.
-What's all this? -Hitler's memoirs.

218
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,680
请给我那个盒子!
Give me that box. Please!

219
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,840
-是你写的吗? -是的，很久以前.
-Did you write all this? -Yeah. Ages ago.

220
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,310
你写了这么多?
You filled all these notebooks?

221
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,310
-是的, 但毫无价值, 只是废物! -关于什么的?
-Yeah, but it's nothing, just crap! -About what?

222
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,500
我几乎忘了的东西
Just stuff I'd almost forgotten.

223
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,970
没人能忘记像那样的东西!
No one forgets stuff like that!

224
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,310
难道你现在不想上床吗?
Won't you come to bed now?

225
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,970
不
No.

226
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,900
别动它!
Leave it!

227
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,470
你现在不能开始读它!
You can't start reading that now!

228
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,330
为什么不能?
Why not?

229
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,100
封面上的号码表示顺序?
The numbers on the covers show the order?

230
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,590
是的
That's right.

231
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,260
贝蒂是阅读它的第一个人
Betty was the first one to have read it.

232
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,060
屋中终于寂静
Quiet had returned.

233
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,850
在三十岁，你开始明白...
At 30, you begin to know...

234
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,290
...生命意义，渴望获得机会.
...what life's about, and you enjoy a break.

235
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,760
要咖啡吗?
Want some coffee?

236
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,390
一块或二块糖?
One lump or two?

237
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,970
那么二块吧.
Two lumps, then.

238
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,520
好的, 我现在要出去
Right, well, I'm off.

239
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,990
你喜欢吗?
Do you like it?

240
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,820
是你！你在那做什么?
Oh, it's you. What are you doing there?

241
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,820
刷西斯廷教堂.
Painting the Sistine Chapel.

242
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,820
只有一次工作. 稍后刷屋子里面吗?
Working for once. Will you do the insides afterwards?

243
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,190
是的,把你的家具盖起来.
Yeah, cover up your furniture.

244
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,190
我现在开始 稍后你来看我女朋友.
I'll start now. Come and see my girls afterwards.

245
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,790
是你制造出那些吵闹声吗?
Is that you making all that racket?

246
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,620
我只是在打蚊子.
Just squashing a mosquito.

247
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,460
别鬼混了 这里没蚊子
Quit fooling around, it's too early for mosquitoes.

248
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,620
看 它就在墙上蠕动
Look, you can see it squirming in a puddle of blood.

249
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,790
看来太阳已经晒到你了
Looks like the sun has got to you.

250
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,320
我开始的时候感到有点累，但是现在我进入状态了
I felt tired earlier but now I'm on form.

251
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,280
这就是我的女孩. 她很可爱吧?
Look at my little girl. Isn't she cute?

252
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,110
就是她吗? 她不是童子鸡.
That's your little girl? She's no spring chicken.

253
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,310
你想什么呢?
What do you expect?

254
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,310
这是什么？我的生日？
What's this? Is it my birthday?

255
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,140
不是，宝贝，只是二人晚餐
No, baby, just dinner for two.

256
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,110
-它是什么? -淡水蚌.
-What is it? -Mussels.

257
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,640
坐下. 我来上菜
Sit down. I'll dish up in a while.

258
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,140
看起来很棒
Looks great.

259
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,180
我在作梦
I'm dreaming.

260
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,840
喝酒!
Drink!

261
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,840
喜欢吗?
Like it?

262
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,210
-我知道那个味道. -还没完呢
-I know that smell. -That's not all.

263
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,440
火鸡加粟子，你喜欢吗?
Turkey with chestnuts. Do you like that?

264
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,770
喜欢，尤其是在每年的这个时候.
Love it. Especially at this time of year.

265
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,130
-什么场合? -等一下，让我看看你.
-What's the occasion? -Wait, let me look at you.

266
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,130
我想起你写的那些.
When I think you wrote that.

267
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,470
我生平从未读过这类文章
I've never read anything like it.

268
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,830
你没有认识到.
You don't realise.

269
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,130
我现在知道你为何来到这个地方. 写这些东西.
Now I see why you came to this hole. To write that.

270
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,460
想到你刷木屋，就让我很疯狂
To think you paint shacks drives me crazy.

271
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,960
这世界不是为我创造的

-You're insane! Call the manager! -What's wrong?

540
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,930
整个晚上服务糟极 了!
The service was rotten all evening!

541
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,330
现在这小蠢人不愿为我拿大衣!
And now this little fool won't get my coat!

542
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:06,460
-我会付他们账单. -回去端盘子
-I'll pay their bill. -Go back to your dishes!

543
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,930
你疯了!
You're crazy!

544
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,960
你应该把她锁起来!
You should have her locked up!

545
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,950
把他们赶出去, 埃迪!
Throw them out, Eddy!

546
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,400
冷静点! 够了!
Calm down! Enough!

547
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:38,020
出什么事了?
What's the matter?

548
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:39,890
没什么, 她会没事的.
Nothing, she'll be okay.

549
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:44,040
-该死, 告诉我发生什么事了! -让我和她单独在一起
-Shit, tell me what happened! -Leave me alone with her.

550
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,240
往她脸上洒些水
Put water on her face.

551
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,040
-我去取水 -离开, 埃迪! 该死!
-I'll get some. -Beat it, Eddy! Shit!

552
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:59,010
我现在在这, 亲爱的.
I'm here now, sweetheart.

553
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,120
现在都结束了
It's over now.

554
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,890
她在睡觉吗?
Is she sleeping?

555
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,720
她当然在睡觉
Of course she's sleeping.

556
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,590
怎么了? 她患病了吗?
What was it? Is she sick?

557
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,280
你从不发怒吗?
Look, don't you ever get mad?

558
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,820
发怒, 不错，但发怒使我害怕
Mad, yes, but that scared me.

559
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:21,890
-别在意 -别说不要紧
-It's nothing. -Don't say it was nothing.

560
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,220
她几乎杀了那个女人
She almost killed that woman.

561
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,510
胡说
Bullshit.

562
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,150
关于你的版税....
With your royalties....

563
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,650
该死，不要用我的书烦扰我!
Shit, stop bugging me about my books!

564
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:41,150
我一生只写了一部书.
I've only written one in all my life.

565
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:46,680
我怀疑能否再写一部 至于版税....
And I doubt I could write another one. As for royalties....

566
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,270
-我认为-- -我认为什么？
-I thought-- -You thought what?

567
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,810
她是如此告识你的吗?
She told you that?

568
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,980
她发现一部手稿，以为我是天才
She found a manuscript and thinks I'm a genius.

569
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,980
一直等待出版商的答复
Keeps waiting for publishers to reply.

570
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,170
那快让她疯了
That drives her nuts.

571
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,380
她或许正确
She may be right.

572
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,070
关于什么?
About what?

573
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,600
你是天才
That you're a genius.

574
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:15,670
当然，读下这个,宝贝儿
You bet. Read this, toots.

575
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,670
联合出版社

576
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,870
"很遗憾, 不. 有趣, 但是你的风格无法忍受
"Sorry, no. Amusing, but your style is unbearable.

577
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,470
你故意写一本内容无价值的书."
You deliberately wrote a non-book."

578
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,870
这奇怪的人是谁?
Who is this queer?

579
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,790
快藏起那个
Hide that, quick.

580
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,260
你今天怎样?
How are you, boys?

581
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:49,260
-他有什么问题? -有些事他十分不服气
-What's wrong with him? -Something he can't swallow.

582
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,630
我明白了. 好的,我感觉很好
I see. Well, I feel great.

583
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:59,750
-有信件吗? -我没有去看
-Any mail yet? -I didn't look.

584
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:21,250
贝蒂就像被切断腿筋的野马...
Betty was a wild horse that had cut her hamstrings...

585
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:24,750
...跳过一堵墙，挣扎地起来.
...jumping over a wall and was trying to get up.

586
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:26,540
她认为是草原的地方...
What she thought was a meadow...

587
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:29,010
...实际上是家畜栏.
...was a gloomy pen.

588
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:31,770
她不能忍受静止不动
She couldn't bear immobility.

589
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,600
她不适合那个
She was not made for that.

590
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:42,100
"我已经读了很多书, 但没有一部像这个手稿...
"I've read a lot of books, but nothing quite like the manuscript...

591
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,830
...你把最没有趣味的寄给我们.
...you had the poor taste to send us.

592
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,880
你的著作充满爱滋病迹象.
Your writing shows all the signs of AlDS.

593
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,880
我把你称为小说却是令人厌恶的花卉退还给你
I return this nauseating flower you call a novel.

594
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,240
相信我出版的判断力
Rely on me for publicity.

595
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:58,380
把它退还给它的原地...
Leave that thing where it belongs...

596
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,540
...在你大脑里的沼泽.
...in the quagmire of your brain.

597
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,760
你真诚的, 托马斯 柯拉斯."
Sincerely yours, Thomas Colas."

598
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:13,440
那只是游戏一部分
That's just part of the game.

599
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:17,140
我们一定会撞见弱智
We're bound to run into morons.

600
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,130
它不会毁掉我们
It won't kill us.

601
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,470
它不重要，亲爱的
It's not important, my love.

602
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:30,320
好吧，不要紧
Okay, it's not important.

603
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,520
-我要去看医生 -有什么问题?
-I'm going to a doctor. -Anything wrong?

604
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,590
不，只是检查我的lUD是不是没有毛病. 和我一起去?
No, just to see if my lUD is okay. Coming with me?

605
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,520
我先化化妆
I'll put some makeup on first.

606
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:46,490
我喜欢翻阅旧杂志, 可消除疑虑.
I love to look at old magazines, it's reassuring.

607
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,850
我看来很傻，给我夹克
I look silly, give me my jacket.

608
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:52,080
我穿了它很漂亮
But I look good in it.

609
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,750
是这个吗？没有标志
Is this it? There's no plaque.

610
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,250
停下，他不是聋子!
Stop it, he's not deaf!

611
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:07,780
-是吗? 我能为你做什么? -我不知道, 我的妻子--
-Yes? What can I do for you? -I don't know, my wife--

612
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,410
-这个是你写的吗? -那个?
-Did you write this? -That?

613
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:15,740
你能认识这个，不是吗? 谁签署的这个?
You recognise this, don't you? Who signed this?

614
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,910
该死的出版商!
Shitty asshole publisher!

615
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,910
是的，我非常愤怒!
Yes, I'm mad as hell!

616
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,570
-我会收拾一切. -别动它, 你这笨蛋!
-I'll clean it all up. -Leave it, you fucker!

617
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,840
告诉他你的意见!
Tell him what you think!

618
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,840
我不会谴责他的信!
I don't give a damn about his letter!

619
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,840
在你的写作和说话中...
In your writing as well as your speech...

620
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,710
...你没有展现出好品味!
...you show no notion of good taste!

621
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,000
你认为自己有品味？
And you think you do?

622
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,800
-滚出去！这是我的家! -不要碰我!
-Get out! This is my home! -Don't touch me!

623
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,800
你疯了!
You're crazy!

624
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:50,900
非常奇怪.
Very queer.

625
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,170
快点, 贝蒂. 快点.
Quick, Betty. Hurry up.

626
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,760
你真的疯了!
You're totally nuts!

627
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:59,130
-你为什么总是屈服? -别理像他一样的傻瓜.
-Why do you always give in? -Forget assholes like him.

628
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:02,270
-天哪, 没有东西碰到你吧. -那不是真的
-Jesus, nothing ever touches you. -That's not true.

629
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,130
好的, 给我证明一下!
Well, prove it!

630
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,260
贵族有世界上最好的橄榄.
Pharistopoli has the world's best olives.

631
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,370
在市场上你能找到的最好的.
The best you'll find anywhere on the market.

632
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:17,820
-不, 谢谢你,我不喝. -只是仙人掌汁.
-No, thank you, I don't drink. -It's only cactus juice.

633
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:20,640
只是因为你. 我的妻子不喜欢我喝.
Just for you. My wife doesn't like me drinking.

634
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:22,990
那是从哪来的?
Where's that from?

635
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:25,750
皱褶橄榄是最好的
Wrinkled olives are the best.

636
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,630
有两种:
There are two kinds:

637
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:29,920
大个的皱褶橄榄是叙利亚橄榄
The big wrinkled one is a Syrian olive.

638
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:31,190
适于做比萨
Good for pizzas.

639
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,820
不, 对比萨, 你最好别用那种.
No, for pizzas, you're better off with that one.

640
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:38,260
它塞满了胡椒粉, 所以它可能不是最好的选择
It's stuffed with pepper, so maybe it's not the best choice.

641
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,930
绿色的品种是去核的 很有趣
The green one is pitted. That's interesting.

642
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,420
我对去核的品种没有兴趣， 对那种有兴趣.
Pitted ones don't interest me. That one does.

643
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:47,920
-那种是为你做的, 埃迪. -试试开罗玫瑰
-That one's for you, Eddy. -Try the Rose of Cairo.

644
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,630
多出来的一个是为了贵族先生
One more for Mr. Pharistopholi.

645
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:52,920
Pharistopoli, 不是Pharistopholi. Pharistopoli.
Pharistopoli, not Pharistopholi. Pharistopoli.

646
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,650
给你. 干杯！
Here you go. Bottoms up.

647
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,980
来吧!
Come on!

648
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,150
不坏. 提供橄榄很好
Not bad. Goes well served with olives.

649

-How much? -Normally, they're 350 a kilo.

-What? 350 a kilo? -Yes, it's a fair price.

651
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,600
尝一个, 左格. 再来一个龙舌兰酒快车.
Take one, Zorg. Another tequila rapido.

652
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:14,480
不, 真的, 我没有喝.
No, really, I don't drink.

653
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:18,240
对不起. 在这你点了六个品种.
Excuse me. You have the six varieties here.

654
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,600
8个品种分成两半, 乘以2是1 6.
Eight varieties in two halves, times two makes 1 6.

655
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:22,910
2乘以8, 1 6.
Two times eight, 1 6.

656
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:25,910
这16份都是每公斤350元?.
Each of the 1 6 varieties for 350 a kilo.

657
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,330
坦白地说.
Honestly.

658
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,710
我会拿那个.
I'll have that one.

659
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,100
你算的正好
You spat on my nose.

660
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,600
我现在想试试紫色玫瑰
I'll try the Purple Rose now.

661
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,640
黑色的. 黑色的是最好的.
The black one. The black one's the best.

662
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,800
你还没有试过这种,龙舌兰酒. 不, 不是它
You haven't tried this one, the tequila. No, that's not it.

663
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,600
我在说什么? 我既不起它是什么.
What am I talking about? I can't remember what it is.

664
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,240
-是橄榄. -我知道, 我是一个橄榄推销员.
-It's an olive. -I know, I'm an olive salesman.

665
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:54,670
它怎么样, 左格? 我们拿. 我们把它们都拿走.
How about it, Zorg? Let's take it. Let's take them all.

666
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,530
-你付不起. -我会付账.
-You can't have the case. -I'll pay for it.

667
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:01,960
你为那个橄榄销售员上演了一个真正的演出.
You put on a real show for that olive seller.

668
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,090
住手! 它是崭新的. 那些东西弄脏了皮革!
Cut it out! It's brand-new. Those things stain leather!

669
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,590
该死, 住手!
Shit, cut it out!

670
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,590
很好, 就在视线内. 该死!
Great, right in the eye. Shit!

671
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,230
放松, 埃迪.
Take it easy, Eddy.

672
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:15,790
给你, 先生. 看看我的车轮.
There you go, sir. Just look at my wheels.

673
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:22,960
不要浪费时间. 她有什么毛病?
Quit messing around. What's wrong with her?

674
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,720
我能解释.
I can explain everything.

675
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,150
这真的不是她的错. 事实上是我的错.
It's not really her fault. It's mine, in fact.

676
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,210
在某种程度上--
In a way--

677
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,940
不要烦恼. 我之前都已经听说了.
Don't bother. I've heard it all before.

678
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:45,720
我记下费用 然后告诉你的朋友.
I noted down the charges and spoke to your friend.

679
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,270
非常漂亮的女孩, 但有点紧张.
Quite a pretty girl, but a bit uptight.

680
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:54,710
他不总是那样. 我怎样放这个?
She's not always like that. How can I put this?

681
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:59,940
她有痉挛症,每个月. 男人很难理解.
She has fits, every month. It's hard for men to understand.

682
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,770
不要说的太远.
Don't push it too far.

683
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,600
不, 当然不.
No, of course not.

684
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,300
因此你写小说,是吗?
So you write novels, do you?

685
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,930
是的, 我试图出版. 它不容易.
Yes, or rather I'm trying to get published. It's not easy.

686
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,430
出版公司里的人都是混蛋.
They're all fucking assholes in those publishing houses.

687
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,100
我该知道
I should know.

688
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:33,930
呆在那, 我想给你看样东西.
Stay there, I want to show you something.

689
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,990
你认为这是什么?
What do you think this is?

690
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,790
手稿
A manuscript.

691
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,790
完全对
Exactly!

692
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:12,080
我开始喜欢你了
I'm getting to like you.

693
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:18,250
不论你信不信我 这些书已被拒27次了.
You won't believe me but I've had 2 7 refusals on this.

694
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:24,070
27! 他们是顶级笨蛋.
Twenty-seven! They're first-class assholes.

695
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,910
被拒27次  非常多
Twenty-seven refusals. That's quite a lot.

696
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:33,250
当我想起我花费在这本书上的那些年.
When I think of all the years that I've put into that book.

697
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:37,410
最好的情况, 最顽强的一个人在坚持.
All the best cases, the toughest ones are in there.

698
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,540
真得太令人震撼了.
It's real dynamite.

699
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:43,080
相信我, 它伤了我的感情. 非常深. 相信我.
Believe me, it hurts. It hurts a lot. Trust me.

700
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,450
我相信你
I trust you.

701
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:50,050
有那么多的笨蛋 他们的劣等论文集卖了上百万.
There are some dumb cops whose shitty memoirs sell millions.

702
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,830
那么为什么所有的出版商都针对我?
So why are the publishers all against me?

703
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,170
什么没法理解他们.
Don't even try to understand them.

704
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,740
出版商都是混蛋.
Publishers are all fucking assholes.

705
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,540
-感觉就像一杯酒,老兄? -当然.
-Feel like a drink, man? -You bet I do.

706
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:17,740
为了将来的成功! 不要让他们令你沮丧!
To future success! Don't let them get you down!

707
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:25,230
当我想到那些混蛋在五分钟内毁了一个人 一年的工作
When I think of those assholes ruining a year's work in five minutes.

708
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,640
我不能说你的朋友是对的...
I can't say your friend's right...

709
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:31,140
...但是她也没有错.
...but she's not wrong, either.

710
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:36,160
一个充满了性的警察故事素材!
A good cop story full of sex!

711
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,590
那是最好的一类.
That's the best kind.

712
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,160
党那个混蛋打电话来, 我想一下, "他会付剩下的钱."
When that asshole called, I thought, "He'll pay for the rest."

713
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,830
我很高兴. 我喝了一杯酒来庆祝.
I was glad. I had a drink to celebrate.

714
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:48,220
她只是抓伤了他. 他会小题大作
She only scratched him. He's making a mountain of a molehill.

715
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,820
8针. 我应该踢他的脑袋
Eight stitches. I'd have kicked his head in.

716
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:55,690
他们认为他们是谁? 临走前的最后一杯酒?
Who do they think they are? Fancy one for the road?

717
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,660
你的书就在这，非常好.
Your book's sitting here nice and warm.

718
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,750
像一架飞机准备起飞.
Like a plane ready to take off.

719
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,890
相信我, 它会出版的.
Believe you me, it'll be published.

720
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,550
-我不这么认为. -它会的, 我确信.
-I don't think so. -It will, I'm sure.

721
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:13,040
贝蒂怎么样? 我们能结束整件事吗?
What about Betty? Can we drop the whole thing?

722
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:19,210
该死. 我能离开这个破旧的办公室.
Shit. I could leave this shitty office.

723
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,080
我能去接她吗?
Can I go and get her?

724
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:27,010
该死  你不明白
Shit, you just don't understand.

725
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:30,380
你难道没看见他对那个家伙所做的事吗?
Can't you see she did all this for guys like you and me?

726
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:33,540
我知道, 但是有指控.
I know, but there's the fucking charges.

727
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,530
来吧, 你是警察. 一定有摆脱困境的办法.
Come on, you're a policeman. There must be some way out of it.

728
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:40,710
不容易. 有记录.
It's not easy. There are records.

729
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:44,070
好的, 我明白了.
Okay, I get it.

730
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,140
不, 等一下.
No, hold on.

731
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,880
可能有个办法
There may be a way.

732
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,200
那么说下去, 忏悔.
Go on then, confess.

733
01:12:55,710 --> 01:13:00,040
那个家伙将不得不决定不提出起诉.
The guy would have to decide not to press charges.

734
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,800
那么简单
It's that simple.

735
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:06,370
-它是谁? -它是为了书展的.
-Who is it? -It's for The Book Show.

736
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,400
正确!
Right!

737
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,690
来杯酒, 甜馅饼? 你有点苍白.
Fancy a drink, sweetie-pie? You're a bit pale.

738
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:24,730
马提尼酒.
Martini.

739
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:28,400
这里.
Here.

740
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:30,870
你在那拥有的很好的位置.
Nice place you've got here.

741
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:37,020
我不是疯狂于书 不是你的错.
I'm not mad about the book. It's not your fault.

742
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:39,690
我不是特别地为你而写.
I didn't particularly write it for you.

743
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:43,690
所以我们会冰释前嫌 它是一个大误会.
So we'll just leave it there. It's one big misunderstanding.

744
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,420
那个女孩使我一生中唯一珍惜的东西.
That girl is the only good thing in my life.

745
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:50,620
除她之外, 什么都无关紧要
Apart from her, there's nothing.

746
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:55,920
所以你不会提起指控.
So you're not going to press charges.

747
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:07,840
记牢一件事: 我没有什么可失去的, 没有
Remember just one thing: I've nothing to lose, nothing.

748
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,480
快点.
Go on.

749
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:19,510
你拨错号码了. 它是电话报时服务.
You got the wrong number. It's the speaking clock.

750
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:23,840
那里. 喝光, 孩子. 喝光
There. Drink up, kiddies. Drink up.

751
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:28,510
给我你的杯子. 喝光.
Give me your glass. Drink up.

752
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,670
-为了什么而祝酒? -星期五!
-What's the toast to? -Friday!

753
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,600
生活真是太棒了!
Life is fucking great!

754
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,470
我不知道为什么, 但是我今晚感觉很棒.
I don't know why, but I feel great tonight.

755
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,830
是家人. 坦白说, 是家人
It's family. Honestly, it's family.

756
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,470
你可以嘲笑, 但它真的是内心的感觉.
You can laugh, but it's a real gut feeling.

757
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,000
只要能看见你坐在这就能温暖我的心.
Just looking at you here warms my heart.

758
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:55,170
听着, 我的内心很温暖
Look, my quiff's a mess, my heart's so warm.

759
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:58,990
给你来个吻
Big kisses to you all.

760
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,500
这是给你的吻
Here's a kiss for you.

761
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:05,820
你也有, 爱人.
And you too, sweetheart.

762
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:08,660
吻你的英雄, 他应得的
Kiss your hero, he deserves it.

763
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,990
暂停! 暂停!
Break! Break!

764
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,230
我有个主意
I've an idea.

765
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:45,450
来这,我孤零零地!
Come here, I'm all alone!

766
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:47,490
我就来, 宝贝!
I'm coming, baby!

767
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:02,580
它是镝！它是钠! 它是微粒！它是炸药！
It's dy! It's na! It's mite! It's dynamite!

768
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:11,680
多棒的舞女!
What a dancer!

769
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:18,010
酱汁!
The sauce!

770
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,940
我本愿做一个摇滚歌手！
I would've loved to be a rocker!

771
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:25,140
该死,他真地是是个摇滚歌手!
Shit, he's a real rocker!

772
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,830
快来帮帮我!
Come and help me!

773
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:41,230
我不用低价酒调制, 但是用香槟!
I'm not making it with cheap wine, but with champagne!

774
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,130
斯特龙博利比萨!
Pizza Stromboli!

775
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,660
有什么问题,  埃迪?
What's wrong, Eddy?

776
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:17,990
我母亲要死了
My mother's dead.

777
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:20,790
我母亲要死了
My mother's dead!

778
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,660
我很难过!
I feel awful!

779
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,450
这是你唯一的黑领带吗?
Is this your only black tie?

780
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,420
我必须到场
I have to be there.

781
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,120
她明天下葬
She's being buried tomorrow.

782
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:50,920
你现在应该休息片刻  亲爱的
You should get a little rest now, darling.

783
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:57,270
-我得换衣服 -你看起来很好
-I have to change. -You're fine.

784
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:59,280
给我我的夹克
Give me my jacket.

785
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,830
不 你先小睡片刻，稍后我替你叫计程车
No, sleep, and I'll call you a cab later.

786
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:11,210
560里，如果我现在启程 我会及时到达
560 miles. If I leave now, I'll make it.

787
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:17,430
你疯了  你不会单独完成 我们不会让你单独去.
You're nuts, you'll never make it in one piece. We won't let you go alone.

788
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:20,600
你有所不知，我母亲要死了
You don't realise. My mother's dead.

789
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:25,800
帮帮他
Help him.

790
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:46,760
它不好笑. 住手 它不好笑
It's not funny. Cut it out, it's not funny.

791
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:15,750
等一下,它就在那
Hold on, it's just there.

792
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,080
它在那. 看到那边的商店了吗?
There it is. See the shop over there?

793
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:22,680
那里. 开车穿过广场.
There. Drive across the square.

794
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,310
来吧!
Come on!

795
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,750
就是它
This is it.

796
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:42,570
-你...? -不, 她卖钢琴
-Are you...? -No, she sold pianos.

797
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,570
-卖了很多吗? -那不是很好
-Did she sell a lot? -That's not nice.

798
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,120
好的, 我们要进去吗?
Well, are we going in?

799
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:24,590
是的
It's all right.

800
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:51,020
那此喧闹声是什么？这不是基督行为
What's all this noise? It's not Christian!

801
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:54,310
-算了, 伯父. -你可怜的母亲在楼上
-Forget it, Uncle. -Your poor mother's upstairs!

802
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:57,890
足够多的耶稣基督行为 他们是我朋友
It's Christian enough. They're my friends.

803
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,340
我不知到你会弹
I didn't know you could play.

804
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,350
我不会，只懂一点
I can't. Just two or three things.

805
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:08,720
你是个奇怪有趣的女孩
You're a funny girl.

806
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:13,440
我等待找到生命意义已很久了
I waited ages for a meaning in life.

807
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,670
你是我遇到的最好的事
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.

808
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:21,670
你只是因为疲倦才这样说
You're only saying that because you're tired.

809
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:26,300
如果我写了那本书 我生命便有意义
If I'd written that book, I'd have a meaning in life.

810
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:29,340
它只会给我们带来麻烦.
It's only bringing us trouble.

811
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:34,300
不是因们你写了它 你是个作家
It's not because you wrote it. You are a writer.

812
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,940
那么我为何不能再继续创作?
Then why can't I write any more now?

813
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,500
因们你是个笨蛋
Because you're a damn fool.

814
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,700
那很好
That's nice.

815
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:50,330
你似乎很疲乏
You look tired.

816
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:52,370
我没事
I'm okay.

817
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,400
你看到那些星星了吗?
You see all those stars?

818
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,830
-有什么问题？ -没事, 我很好
-What's wrong? -Nothing, I'm fine.

819
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,930
你很兴奋
You're feverish.

820
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:18,920
-你在哪里? 别动. -我在这  有什么问题?
-Where are you? Stay. -I'm here. What's wrong?

821
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:21,930
我不想离开你 要支香烟吗?
I won't leave you. Do you want a cigarette?

822
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:24,150
不, 每件事都很好, 只是很好
No, everything's fine, just fine.

823
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:36,490
你看到那边的星星了吗?
Have you seen all those stars out there?

824
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:38,980
因为这个夜晚很明亮
It's because it's a clear night.

825
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:17,280
-递给我诺克曼. -什么?
-Pass me the Nuoc Man. -The what?

826
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,300
酱汁, 诺克曼 N-U-O-C M-A-N.
The sauce, Nuoc Man. N-U-O-C M-A-N.

827
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,640
一点也没有
None left.

828
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:28,000
至少是个好天气
At least it was a nice day.

829
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,290
有时, 我希望我是条狗
Sometimes, I wish I were a dog.

830
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:00,450
生命没有大意义
A life isn't much.

831
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:04,320
只是四张照片
Just four photos.

832
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:28,620
-喜欢这地方吗? -它全不相同
-Like it here? -It's different.

833
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:35,480
我想向你和贝蒂提出个邀请
I want to make you and Betty an offer.

834
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,120
留在这里管理钢琴店铺
Stay here and run the piano store.

835
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:43,620
看到了吗? 我能通灵!
See? I'm psychic!

836
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:48,890
我去问贝蒂好吗?
Shall I go ask Betty?

837
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,040
告诉我,你喜欢这主意吗?
Tell me, do you like the idea?

838
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,150
是的 我喜欢
Yes, I do.

839
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,970
太棒了！
Fantastic!

840
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,970
只是有一件事
Just one thing.

841
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:17,930
不时带些花到她坟墓
Take her flowers now and then.

842
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,430
-谁？ -我母亲
-Who? -My mother.

843
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:28,260
他的确赠给我们很好的礼物
He sure gave us a nice present.

844
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:35,870
不，我办不到 我不能睡在已死女人的床上
No, I just can't do it. I can't sleep in a dead woman's bed.

845
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:40,530
我知道它不好玩 不要去想它便是
I know it's no fun, but just don't think about it.

846
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:42,590
不，我不想这么做
No, I don't want to.

847
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:44,790
该死!
Shit!

848
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:46,760
我不能相信
I don't believe it.

849
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:54,260
你知时间已多么晚了吗？
Do you know how late it is?

850
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,590
我们可睡这折叠床
We'll just use this foldaway.

851
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:05,080
让我来做  它是力气活 呆在那
Let me, it's a mechanical thing. Stay there.

852
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,620
愚蠢的东西！
Stupid thing!

853
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:14,910
你想做它!
You wanted to do it!

854
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,120
这是什么?
What is this?

855
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:23,270
你不能做，老兄?
Can't you do it, man?

856
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,340
一堆垃圾
Pile of crap.

857
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,910
冷静些，用踏板
Calm down. Use the pedal!

858
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:37,410
踏板被卡住了, 贝蒂.
The pedal is stuck, Betty.

859
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:40,240
那么我去取工具
I'll go get the tools, then.

860
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,650
该死, 不要在夜晚的这个时候
Shit, not at this time of night.

861
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:55,710
我并非有意干的
I didn't do it on purpose.

862
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:02,060
停下！只会搞得更糟
Let's stop, it'll only get worse.

863
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,300
更安全
It's safer.

864
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,900
睡觉吧
Sleep away the foldaway way.

865
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:11,330
你搞什么鬼?
What are you up to?

866
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:15,230
它发出振动声 你当然不会感觉到
It gives off bad vibes. You don't feel them, of course.

867
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:24,760
现在振动已经消失了
The bad vibes are gone now!

868
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:35,820
我喜欢那地方
I liked that place.

869
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:38,750
我确定会是个好天气
I was sure it'd be a fine day.

870
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:43,260
如果他们把引擎全部开动
And it was, if they'd all had their motors tuned.

871
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:14,720
我希望没有打扰到你
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

872
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:18,810
垃圾箱旁边的是你的床垫吗?
Is that your mattress near the bins?

873
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,680
是的.有什么问题?
Yes. What's wrong?

874
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:24,210
好的, 我们没有处理过像那样的东西
Well, we don't handle stuff like that.

875
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:26,680
我们不想让它发生任何事
We want nothing to do with it.

876
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:31,370
我能做什么? 切碎它每天早晨吃一片?
What can I do? Cut it up and eat a piece every morning?

877
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:36,210
-我不知道. 它是你的床垫 -是的, 它是, 在某种程度上
-I don't know. It's your mattress. -Yes, it is, in a way.

878
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,470
他激怒你了吗? 好的，是吗?
Is he pissing you off? Well, is he?

879
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,170
这该死的床垫是他的吗?
Is the fucking mattress his?

880
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:51,030
-因为可怜的理由, 博比. -混蛋!
-For pity's sake, Bobby. -Bastard!

881
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,130
不要失去自制力.
Don't get carried away.

882
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:56,030
废物! 废物!
Filth! Filth!

883
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:00,030
混蛋! 混蛋!
Bastard! Bastard!

884
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:16,020
有一天他像那样把一个床垫扔到卡车上
One day he threw one like that in the back of the truck.

885
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,580
机器切断了他的手
It took his hand off.

886
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,260
现在, 他忍受不了床垫
Now, he can't stand mattresses.

887
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:38,120
好吧, 博比. 我们该去了.
All right, Bobby. It's time we were going.

888
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,780
他会没事吧?
Will he be okay?

889
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,510
你抽烟了吗?
Have you got a smoke?

890
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:46,050
一根烟? 当然
A smoke? Sure.

891
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:52,520
-它们是同性恋香烟. -当然.
-They're homo cigarettes. -Sure.

892
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,080
再见.
See you.

893
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,670
该死, 你一直工作很努力
Shit, you've been working hard.

894
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:57,830
-我打扫了整个屋子. -看起来很棒.
-I've cleaned the whole house. -It's looking great.

895
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:01,270
老人已经死了 你要干什么?
The old woman died a second time. What were you up to?

896
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:03,430
到镇上观光
Looking around town.

897
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:08,910
这可是个非常大的地方 我想我们得找辆车
It's a pretty big place. I guess we'll need a car.

898
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,060
当然，我们也需要钱
Sure, we'll need money too.

899
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:13,070
-给你的礼物 -黄油?
-Present for you. -Buttered?

900
01:33:13,290 --> 01:33:15,720
当然 那也值钱
Of course. And that costs money too.

901
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,810
早餐时间. 酒吧开门了
Breakfast time. The bar's open.

902
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:24,210
隔壁的养乳牛者是个白化病者并且有一头红发
The dairyman next door is an albino and a redhead.

903
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:29,480
红发的白化病者穿着白色的外套...
A redhead albino in a white coat...

904
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:32,960
...每只手都拿着一瓶牛奶 你能想象吗?
...with a bottle of milk in each hand. Can you imagine that?

905
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:35,250
它会让我感到毛骨悚然
It would give me the creeps.

906
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:40,290
它会让你感到毛骨悚然 那就是我的感觉
It would give you the creeps. That's exactly how I felt.

907
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,850
递一下糖
Pass the sugar.

908
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,810
白化病者. 奇怪的人.
Albino. Weirdo.

909
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:53,780
我们应该在这附近找点工作
We should do some work around here. It's not exactly modern.

910
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:57,900
天哪!  有些人太大胆了! 过来看
Jesus, some people have got a nerve! Come and see.

911
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:02,080
快点! 看那个!
Hurry up! Look at that!

912
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,780
-有什么问题? -人行道上的轿车
-What's wrong? -The car on the sidewalk.

913
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:06,660
他鼓起勇气
He's got some nerve.

914
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,250
你是说他是个混蛋 我会证明给他看
You mean he's a fucking bastard. I'll show him.

915
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:11,430
什么勇气. 黄色的
What nerve. A yellow one too.

916
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:16,310
真漂亮 看看这光滑的车壳
It's a real beauty. Look at the finish on it.

917
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,720
我肯定留下了钥匙
I bet the shithead left the keys.

918
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:22,820
-你疯了? -我们去兜风
-Have you gone mad? -Let's go for a drive.

919
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:25,650
-不  你疯了 -贝蒂 下来
-No, you're crazy. -Come down, Betty.

920
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:28,520
快点
Come on.

921
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:35,280
-你在干什么? -快点，上来
-What are you doing? -Come on, get in.

922
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:37,350
你疯了
You're nuts.

923
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:48,620
看看: 皮革座椅,桃花心木 仪表板, 晶体管收音机
Look at this: leather seats, mahogany dashboard, transistor radio.

924
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:51,950
-听到那嗡嗡声了吗? -当然. 听着, 你真地疯了.
-Hear that hum? -Sure. Look, you're totally nuts.

925
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,620
不要担心. 他肯定是同性恋才有这样的车
Don't worry. He has to be a homo to have a car like this.

926
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:58,220
他可能是同性恋，但是你疯了
He may be a homo, but you're nuts.

927
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,320
冷静点
Calm down.

928
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:04,720
停下
Stop here.

929
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:07,490
就在这
Right here.

930
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,460
-等一下 -这里，现在
-Hold on. -Here. Now.

931
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:12,810
我们已开到路的尽头, 无论如何
We've run out of road, in any case.

932
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,020
开到那里
Drive up there.

933
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:23,980
我们到这来看风景，不是吗? 太棒了
We're up here for the view, are we? It's great.

934
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:27,520
你疯了. 你想什么?
You're crazy. What's got into you?

935
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:31,660
在一辆像这样的车上 你可能会变成同性恋
In a car like this, you might have turned homo.

936
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:46,280
用完一箱汽油
Guys freak out over a full tank of gas.

937
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:51,490
大型汽车是我们文明的最后曙光
Big cars are the last flash of our civilisation.

938
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:58,350
我们身无一文
I thought we were broke.

939
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,690
我们现在确身无分文
We are now.

940
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:03,880
我把文明的最后曙光放在你的脚边
I lay the last flash of a civilisation at your feet.

941
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:06,690
你疯了
You're crazy.

942
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,660
-你们俩没事吧? -很好
-Are you two okay? -Fine.

943
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:13,050
我们一直在清理家具
We've been cleaning and shifting furniture.

944
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:14,580
太棒了
That's great.

945
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:24,780
这些地板有点阴暗
These naked floorboards are a bit gloomy.

946
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:27,580
-蓝色怎么样? -为什么?
-How about blue? -Why?

947
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:29,840
我认为蓝色很好, 暖颜色.
I think blue's a nice, calm colour.

948
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:32,180
好的, 给它们刷蓝颜色
All right, paint them blue.

949
01:36:32,430 --> 01:36:35,250
我烦你已很久了
I've bored you long enough now.

950
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:37,190
你不烦我
You're not boring me.

951
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:39,080
等一下, 贝蒂 想要--
Wait, Betty wants--

952
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,080
我几乎忘了.
I almost forgot.

953
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:49,250
贝蒂要拆毁那两堵墙
Betty wants to knock out two walls.

954
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:52,050
埃迪? 你能听到我吗?
Eddy? Can you hear me?

955
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,760
没事, 只是两堵小墙
It's nothing, just two thin little walls.

956
01:36:57,090 --> 01:37:00,350
你什么意思, "没事"? 你们俩都疯了.
What do you mean, "nothing"? You're both nuts.

957
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:02,450
等一下, 想象那堵墙...
Wait, imagine that wall...

958
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:08,310
...是我们和阳光普照的草原间的障碍物
...as a barrier between us and a sunny meadow.

959
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:11,840
我们受小小屏障所烦扰不是对我们 的侮辱吗?
Isn't it an insult to let a silly little barrier bug us?

960
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:16,420
好的, 但是要从容不迫，现在
Okay, but go easy, now.

961
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:19,570
不用担心 我们没有疯
Don't worry, we're not crazy.

962
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,250
好的，再见!
All right, bye!

963
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:49,080
我看起来像洛基电影中的史泰龙吗?
Do I look like Stallone in Rocky IV, baby?

964
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,920
不 像是你在写的你的书
No, like you're writing your book.

965
01:37:57,250 --> 01:38:00,740
我不明白拆毁和写书有何关系
I don't see what demolition has to do with writing.

966
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:06,080
我不惊讶.
I'm not surprised.

967
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,450
想和我一起去购物吗?
Want to go shopping with me?

968
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:47,480
你想去吗?
Do you want to?

969
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:50,620
好的,我会去, 那么.
Okay, I'll go, then.

970
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:09,180
你在那干什么？
What are you doing there?

971
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:11,080
我正在晒我的臀部
I'm warming my ass.

972
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:14,180
我给你买了爆米花
I bought you some popcorn.

973
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:16,710
给我钥匙，我来开车
Give me the keys. I'll drive.

974
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,710
该死的变速箱!
Fucking gearbox!

975
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:27,410
当然, 它是变速箱
Sure, it's the gearbox.

976
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:39,120
再努力一点, 我们将创造一项当地的事故纪录
Try a bit harder, we'll set a new local accident record.

977
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:45,910
我不会再进那辆破汽车.
I won't get in that shitty crate again.

978
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,040
你今天糟透了!
You're acting like shit today!

979
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:22,570
你精神不正常!
You're out of your mind!

980
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:27,410
冷静点！让我看看
Calm down! Let me see.

981
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:29,480
停下!
Stop!

982
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:55,380
该死  贝蒂，停下
Shit, Betty, stop!

983
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:58,970
你真的激怒了我!
You're really pissing me off!

984
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,210
够了!
Enough!

985
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,340
贝蒂, 求你了!
Betty, please!

986
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:27,880
结束了,好吗?
It's over, okay?

987
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,330
-怎么回事? -没事
-What's going on here? -Nothing.

988
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:11,280
她感觉不好,所以我打了她
She didn't feel well, so I slapped her.

989
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:14,840
我恐怕她会大发脾气
I was afraid she'd have a fit.

990
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:18,970
-我知道这很难理解. -为何说难理解?
-I know that's hard to believe. -Why is that hard to believe?

991
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:21,330
我们只是在慢跑
We'd just been jogging.

992
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:24,170
-慢跑有帮助吗? -许多，是的.
-Does jogging help? -A lot, yeah.

993
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:26,500
那个年轻女士现在怎么样?
And how is the little lady now?

994
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:32,010
理查德, 我跟你说别拿枪指着我
Richard, I told you not to point that at me!

995
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:34,010
我瞄准的是他，不是你
I'm aiming at him, not you!

996
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:36,270
把那东西放下!
Put that thing down!

997
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,030
看看他的鞋
Look at his shoes.

998
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,910
某天我们也看到过一个绿发的家伙
We saw a guy with green hair one day too.

999
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:47,480
世界就像这样. 不应停留在细节上
The world's like that. Don't go by details.

1000
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,100
-只是意外 -你看到了?
-It's only an accident. -You see?

1001
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:53,600
如果我们某天把事情弄砸了 那就是你的错
If we screw up one day, it'll be your fault.

1002
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:57,910
你抓伤了他? 不 你想是带着一把枪!
Did you search him? No. You just like to carry a pistol!

1003
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:00,270
不要疯了. 看看他们
Don't get mad. Look at them.

1004
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:03,270
我在他动之前会打爆他的头
I'd smack his head before he could move.

1005
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,270
你有四十年经验
I've had 40 years' experience.

1006
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:08,210
那么自己做, 我退出.
Then work it out alone, count me out.

1007
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:17,070
你什么态度!
You've got a fucking attitude!

1008
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:23,910
开始! 住手! 我给你两秒钟!
Open up! Cut it out! I'll give you two seconds!

1009
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:27,270
好的, 我会停!
Okay, I'll stop!

1010
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,600
下次,我会开枪!
Next time, I'll shoot!

1011
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:33,590
我们的新兵有良好的训练...
Our recruits get good training...

1012
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:37,590
...但是这打击了他们的勇气!
...but it wrecks their nerves!

1013
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:40,500
对不起, 是我的错.
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

1014
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:44,740
你们是过路的吗?
Are you just passing through?

1015
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:47,470
不, 我们经营钢琴商店.
No, we run the piano store.

1016
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:52,270
你是埃迪的朋友?
You're friends of Eddy's?

1017
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:56,600
你应该早说! 我们一起回去.
You should've said so! We'll drive you back.

1018
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,830
来吧, 贝蒂.
Come on, Betty.

1019
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:16,180
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

1020
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:50,270
-今天卖了一架钢琴? -当然, 尽量笑吧
-Selling a piano today? -Sure, laugh all you like.

1021
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:57,100
-哦, 混蛋! -对不起.
-Oh, fuck! -Sorry.

1022
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:03,000
你等一下.
Just you wait.

1023
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:15,060
-鲍勃, 有时间吗? -当然.
-Bob, got a minute? -Sure.

1024
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:19,030
你通常用来写在窗户上的东西, 我能拿一些吗?
That stuff you use to write on the window, can I have some?

1025
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:25,970
-白粉. -是的, 白粉.
-Whitening. -Yeah, whitening.

1026
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:44,590
好的, 你怎么看? 不坏, 是吧?
Well, what do you think? Not bad, huh?

1027
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:48,590
"成本价格的钢琴, 一生仅有一次的的廉价出售."
"Pianos at cost price, once-in-a-lifetime sale."

1028
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:52,560
商业第一法则: 让自己引人注意
Rule number one in business: Get yourself noticed.

1029
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:56,970
第二法则: 廉价销售
Rule number 2: Have a great sales pitch.

1030
01:46:57,970 --> 01:46:59,960
一生仅有一次的的廉价出售!
Once-in-a-lifetime sale!

1031
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:03,970
好的. 我去清洗 然后准备午餐.
Right. I'll go and wash, then get lunch ready.

1032
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:20,760
它看起来更好了, 不是吗?
It already looks better, huh?

1033
01:47:26,770 --> 01:47:28,430
又增加了几斤!
I've put on another kilo!

1034
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:32,970
深呼吸. 合着的钢琴就像死了一样
Breathe in. A closed piano is a dead piano.

1035
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:38,090
我卖活钢琴 活钢琴!
I sell live pianos, guys. Live ones!

1036
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:42,700
看你的小牙齿 闪闪发光.
Look at all your little teeth sparkling away.

1037
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,470
你得活跃起来...
You have to come alive...

1038
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:49,410
...每一天. 做吧, 为了我
...today of all days. Do it, for my sake.

1039
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,900
我确信你将会组成一个伟大的队伍
I'm sure you'll make a great team.

1040
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:54,760
准备好了!你过来吗?
It's ready! Are you coming up?

1041
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:58,260
是的, 我正在来. 我依赖你.
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm counting on you.

1042
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:05,970
今天不要让她打扰我们
And let's not let her distract us today.

1043
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:09,330
再见
See you later.

1044
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:15,870
你知道, 亲爱的, 我们可以在厨房吃
You know, sweetheart, we could eat in the kitchen.

1045
01:48:21,770 --> 01:48:23,430
节食
Diet.

1046
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:30,070
尝起来挺好
It tastes better like that.

1047
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:33,900
-咖啡? -不, 我不能多喝.
-Coffee? -No, I mustn't overdo it.

1048
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:37,550
我心满意足 我们会卖完钢琴
I'm on top of the world. We're going to sell out of pianos.

1049
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:40,090
你似乎很自信
You seem pretty sure of that.

1050
01:48:40,970 --> 01:48:43,370
我不知道为什么. 只是有感觉
I can't explain why. It's a mind thing.

1051
01:48:44,770 --> 01:48:49,000
我不想被拒绝, 但今天是个散步的好日子
I don't want to be negative, but it's a nice day for a walk.

1052
01:48:50,270 --> 01:48:52,400
这个月我们已经赚了足够多的钱
We've got enough money for the month.

1053
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,570
不是钱. 我想检验一个理论
It's not the money. I want to check on a theory.

1054
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:58,260
所以我会花整个下午在收银台
So I'll spend the afternoon at the cash desk.

1055
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:00,090
好的,我自己出去
Fine, I'll go out alone.

1056
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:03,760
当然, 亲爱的, 不要烦恼. 太阳只是为你而散发光芒
Sure, honey, don't fret. The sun's shining just for you.

1057
01:49:17,970 --> 01:49:21,090
该死, 你浪费的时间对生命没有意义
Shit, the time you waste doing nothing with your life.

1058
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,090
他们能把这做成个马戏表演
They could make a circus act out of this.

1059
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:29,090
一个卖不出钢琴的钢琴推销员.
A piano seller who doesn't sell pianos.

1060
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,720
这个世界以苦恼和荒谬为食
The world is fed on anguish and absurdity.

1061
01:49:32,970 --> 01:49:35,260
亲爱的, 你在和自己说话?
Sweetheart, are you talking to yourself?

1062
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:38,000
我在浪费时间
I was messing around.

1063
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:42,760
-我要出去. 一起来? -不，我不能离开钢琴.
-I'm going out. Coming? -No, I can't leave the pianos.

1064
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:46,550
当我去卖香烟时，你能照看店铺吗？
Can you look after the shop while I run for some cigarettes?

1065
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:50,460
-当然，我会照看 -你真是个天使
-Sure, I'll keep an eye on things. -You're an angel.

1066
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:06,960
-生意怎么样 -糟糕，有点不景气
-How's business? -Bad. There's a recession on.

1067
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:09,900
是的，但是没有新的
That's true, but there's nothing new about that.

1068
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:13,400
给我来两个
Give me a couple of those.

1069
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:17,520
我不相信 我只离开10分钟
I don't believe it. I only went out for 1 0 minutes!

1070
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:21,190
对一个天才女店员足够了 记得戴贝雷帽的那个家伙吗？
Enough for a gifted salesgirl. Remember the guy in the beret?

1071
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:25,060
戴贝雷帽的那个家伙，天哪！ 如今你不能相信任何人
The guy in the beret. Jesus! You can't trust anyone nowadays.

1072
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,520
我不是卖它的人
I wasn't the one who sold it.

1073
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:29,850
你是，由于你它被卖出了
You were. It was sold thanks to you.

1074
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:31,900
是的，但仍然
Yeah, but still....

1075

我要打你一顿，该死！
I'll tan your hide, damn it!

1079
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:56,200
我真地烦了 他把自己锁在浴室里
I'm really fed up! He locked himself in the bathroom.

1080
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,890
那个窗口太高了
And that window is so high!

1081
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,760
我们为什么没有孩子？
Why do we ever have children?

1082
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:07,090
-有什么问题？ -我有点晕，我做不了
-What's wrong? -I'm dizzy, I can't do it.

小心
Be careful.

1085
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:20,580
好的，继续，但要小心
Okay, go on, but watch out.

1086
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,230
鲍勃!快点，来吧！

1087

来吧，你自己 让我头晕
Come on, yourself! Makes me dizzy!

1088
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:33,580
你为什么做这个？
Archie! Why do you do this?

1089
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:35,820
你父亲对你很愤怒
Your dad's mad at you.

1090
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:40,590
鲍勃.他没事

你留在这里直到干燥为止
I'll leave you here till you dry!

1093

那是为了珍珠港 昨天...
That's for Pearl Harbour! Yesterday...

1094
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:53,400
...他把自己关进电冰箱 把自己想象成为一个北极探险者
...he shut himself in the fridge. Fancied himself an Arctic explorer!

1095
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:55,080
你个笨蛋！
You little moron!

1096

他真的努力了

他们非常坚硬，他们都受伤了
They're so hard, they almost hurt.

1104
01:52:39,090 --> 01:52:40,820
摸一下，你会明白
Touch and you'll see.

1105

有什么可吃的吗？
Got anything to snack on?

1112

对不起，对不起
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1119
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:06,690
我不是使你兴奋？
I don't turn you on?

1120
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:09,820
不是那个 有时我抵制我的欲望...

1121
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:11,850
...为了感到我是自由的

自从我离开门诊部

1125

等这么长时间正常吗？

一切会很顺利

...从后面进入...

1130

我们去喝酒
Let's go have that drink.

1132

1133
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:14,350
他们的是别的东西
That Pineau of theirs is something else.

1134
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,510
太棒了，不是吗？
It's great, isn't it?

1135

我们开业的那天 我们成功的卖出一架钢琴

我没有！你不认为卖出一架不是很棒吗？
No, I'm not! Don't you think it's great to sell one?

1139
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:37,020
当然，但是你谈论它，好像有什么事发生在我们身上
Sure, but you talk about it as if something had happened to us.

1140
01:55:37,190 --> 01:55:39,020
有，我们卖了一架钢琴

混蛋

在我看到我的名字印在书上之前，我会已经50岁了
I'll be 50 before I see my name in print.

1145
01:56:27,190 --> 01:56:29,020
他们都是混蛋！

我该把这些手稿送给你吗？
Shall I send the manuscript down to you?

1148

没门，想想它惹的麻烦
No way. Think of the trouble it would cause.

1149

我已经很快了
I am hurrying.

1155
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:37,320
这就是尼压住并强奸我的地方?

1159
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:59,480
从湖边伸延过来的
The one that starts at the lake.

1160
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:01,660
那个大岩石，看到了吗？

都是为你的，所有的！
It's all for you. All of it!

1168
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:35,380
从墙开始，一直伸展到岩石外
It starts at the wall and goes beyond the rock.

1169
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:39,080
房子在中间
And the house is in the middle.

1170
01:58:41,450 --> 01:58:43,440
不仅如此
And that's not all.

1171

看起来不可能
It doesn't seem possible.

1175
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:58,080
听着，贝蒂，不要担心 仍何事都是可能的
Look, Betty, don't worry. All the papers are in order.

Sure, but that's how it is. Everything you see here is yours.

挂在树上的日落也是我的？
That sunset hanging in the trees is mine as well?

1180

卖这个的家伙一定疯了

这是我曾经得到过得最好的礼物

我梦到你的书出版了
I dreamed your book was published.

1191
02:01:42,450 --> 02:01:45,140
你为什么不想想其它的事？

四片
Four.

1204
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:33,600
-鲍勃, 我陷入了困境
-Bob, I'm in the shit. -And I'm in the ham.

1205
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:37,260
我必须送钢琴但送货工人没有来
I have a piano and my delivery men didn't show up.

1206
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:40,100
钢琴必须送交
It has to be delivered.

1207
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:43,600
你姊妹的丈夫有一辆卡车，是吗？
Your brother-in-law's got a truck, hasn't he?

1208
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:46,740
太大了，是伐木卡车
It's too big, it's a logging truck.

1209
02:03:46,950 --> 02:03:50,400
我会应付，我有办法
I'll manage. I can drive those things.

1210
02:03:50,620 --> 02:03:52,600
所以没问题

1211
02:03:55,450 --> 02:03:57,270
安妮,来这

1212
02:03:59,620 --> 02:04:01,940
等一会，我打个电话
One second. I have a call to make.

1213
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:07,410
告诉他我一会回来

1214

1215

嘿, 安妮,你怎么样？
Hi, Annie, how are you?

1216
02:04:24,710 --> 02:04:26,800
鲍勃近况好转吗?
Have things improved with Bob?

1217
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:30,400
一点
A little.

1218
02:04:32,010 --> 02:04:33,770
为什么？
Why?

1219
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:39,590
-你有什么心事? -思考使我精疲力尽
-You thinking of something? -Thinking exhausts me at the moment.

1220
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,710
你真的是...
You really are...

1221
02:04:43,950 --> 02:04:45,030
...有趣的人
...a funny guy.

1222
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:48,600
我怀疑
I doubt that.

1223
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:54,670
25吨，它行吗？
Twenty-five tonnes. Think it'll do?

1224
02:04:57,010 --> 02:04:59,500
这东西一定值钱
This thing must be worth a bit.

1225
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:15,300
富人才会买
Got to be rich to buy one of these.

1226
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:18,830
别说了 知道怎么操作它吗？
Spare me your comments. Know how to work this?

1227

我能按吗？

1229
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:33,710
哦，该死，混蛋
Oh, shit! Asshole!

1230
02:05:35,010 --> 02:05:38,670
那是油擎，试按其他擎
That's the oil release, of course. It's the other one.

1231
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:41,830
现在，小心
Now, watch.

1232
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:51,300
-有说明书吗？ -是的，有

你在玩什么？
What are you playing at?

1238
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:16,320
你个混蛋！ 你知道它值多少钱吗？
You asshole! You know what this is worth?

1239
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:18,500
你没有告诉我
You wouldn't tell me!

1240
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:22,640
-混蛋！ -你认为我增加重量了？
-Fucking hell! -Do you think I've put on weight?

1241
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:24,970
现在，你在我看来很好。

1243
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:29,670
你们在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1244
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:33,800
打电话给女伯爵，告诉她我们上路了，快点！
Call the countess to tell her we're on our way. Hurry up!

1245
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:36,490
见鬼!
For chrissakes!

1246
02:06:41,180 --> 02:06:44,160
-左格,你来了吗？ -我正赶来

1252
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:03,910
那是什么？
What's that?

1253
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:07,500
亚特兰蒂斯的灰尘
Dust from Atlantis?

1254
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:12,000
验孕检测
It's a pregnancy test.

1255
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:15,910
-它说什么？ -它说是
-And what does it say? -It says yes.

1256
02:07:17,010 --> 02:07:19,970
你用IUD怎会有孕？
But how, with your lUD?

1257
02:07:20,170 --> 02:07:21,830
有时发生
Happens sometimes.

1258
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:25,200
不是真的
It can't be true.

1259
02:07:29,830 --> 02:07:31,700
坐下
Sit down.

1260
02:07:32,830 --> 02:07:36,790
我将回来照顾你，很棒，不是吗？
I'll be right back to look after you. It's great, huh?

1261
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:44,770
有什么问题？你看起来很苍白
What's wrong? You look pale.

1262
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:47,530
有什么问题？你看起来很苍白
What's wrong? You look pale.

1263
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:50,060
我们来得非常迟
We're late as hell.

1264
02:07:52,410 --> 02:07:55,830
从没看到过如此多的童车
Never saw so many baby carriages.

1265
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,700
我们几乎做少了一个
That one nearly had it.

1266
02:07:58,910 --> 02:08:01,830
慢驶！卡车是全新的
Not so fast! The truck's brand-new!

1267
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:04,670
我没开很快，它是滑轮引擎
I'm not going fast. Anyway, it's a turbo.

1268
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:06,530
什么？你开玩笑？
What? Are you kidding?

1269
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:12,530
仅仅25mph
I'm only doing 25 mph.

1270
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:15,520
25？你开到了50
25? You're doing 50!

1271
02:08:15,770 --> 02:08:18,100
50，那不算快
50? That's not fast!

1272
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:23,200
你确信你有驾照？
Are you sure you've got your licence?

1273
02:08:23,410 --> 02:08:25,170
我怀疑
I doubt it.

1274
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:33,060
你怎么样？记得我吗？
How are you? Remember me?

1275
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:37,100
在限速45mph的公路上，15吨车辆限速15mph...
Doing 60 with a truck limited to 45 mph...

1276
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:43,030
...驾驶卡车速度超过60mph
...on a road limited to 1 5-tonne vehicles and to 30 mph.

1277
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:46,000
不错，不错
Good start. Good start.

1278
02:08:46,470 --> 02:08:49,910
你的证件 彻底检查报告
Your papers. Full inspection, the whole lot.

1279
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:52,200
对不起，我在做梦
Sorry, I was dreaming.

1280
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:56,590
如果你没通过酒精检验，你会很快清醒
If you flunk the alcohol test, you'll wake up fast.

1281
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:01,130
我方才发觉我将成为父亲

父亲是最后的伟大冒险
Fathers are the last great adventurers.

1285
02:09:18,410 --> 02:09:22,700
你会明白，有欢乐，但也有悲伤，悲伤
You'll see, there's joy, but sorrow too, sorrow.

1286
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:25,370
浮岛，像沙漠中绿洲
A floating island, like a desert island.

1287
02:10:25,530 --> 02:10:27,900

我去小便
I'm going for a pee.

1292

父亲真地是最后的伟大冒险？
Are fathers really the last great adventurers?

1293
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:54,200
我看起来像是个冒险家吗？
And did I look like an adventurer?

1294
02:11:06,590 --> 02:11:10,630
对不起，我一直注意着你

我有些东西，你可能有兴趣

02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:12,530
冲浪运动员 只记得一件事：
Here, Mr. Surfer. Just remember one thing:

太美了，但不是真的

1312

血到处溅出

1313

你为什么说那个？你疯了？

1314
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:31,900
哪些人为什么用光让我眼花缭乱？
Why were all those guys dazzling me with their lights?

-你没有开灯 -我真的喜欢蓝色，它太棒了
-You didn't have any lights on. -I really like blue. It's just great.

1316
02:12:36,830 --> 02:12:40,280
我没有开灯？ 天哪！一定是那些人搞错 了
I didn't have any lights on? Jesus, people can be really mean.

1317
02:12:46,030 --> 02:12:48,400
香槟酒通常让我清醒
Champagne usually wakes me up.

1318
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:52,890
现在不要对我做那个 今晚不行

你的包很难看
Your bag is ugly.

1325
02:16:16,690 --> 02:16:18,520
-那个小孩是谁？ -什么小孩？

1326
02:16:18,690 --> 02:16:21,520
-楼下的 -那是小尼古拉斯
-Downstairs. -That's little Nicolas.

1327
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:30,820
他是个天才，但是他没有钢琴 这些都是什么？
He's a genius, but he hasn't got a piano. What's all this?

1328
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:37,390
香殡！每人一瓶 还有西番莲果冰淇凌
Champagne! One bottle each. Petits fours and passion-fruit ice cream.

1329
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:41,460
这是你的
And this is for you.

1330

你绝不知道
You never know.

1331
02:17:00,130 --> 02:17:02,890
那些东西从不收缩
And those things never shrink.

1332
02:17:16,390 --> 02:17:18,250
我爱你
I love you.

1333
02:17:46,550 --> 02:17:49,180
它感觉像什么？
What does it feel like?

1334
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:52,880
我不知道 我想再做一次检验来确定
I don't know. I want another test to be sure.

1335
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:56,780
你喜欢这个主意吗？
Do you like the idea?

1336
02:17:57,630 --> 02:17:59,480
我还没想过
I haven't thought about it.

1337
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:03,580
但我说它不坏
But I'd say it's not so bad.

1338
02:18:05,660 --> 02:18:07,550
作为给你的礼物
As a present to you.

1339
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:40,420
我们做爱
We made love.

1340
02:18:41,490 --> 02:18:43,310
我有的飘飘若仙的感觉
I had a dizzy sensation.

1341
02:18:46,550 --> 02:18:51,890
当我们做爱时，她的IUD就像门一样被风撞破
While we screwed, her IUD was like a broken door banging in the wind.

1342
02:19:24,490 --> 02:19:29,150
验孕测试： 阴性
PREGNANC Y DlAGNOSlS: NEGATlVE.

1343
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:52,740
她可能会一时想不开
Mine is in heat, yours is going bananas.

1344
02:19:56,650 --> 02:19:58,510
不要说那个
Don't ever say that.

1345
02:20:05,250 --> 02:20:07,120
对不起
Sorry.

1346
02:21:54,810 --> 02:21:56,830
你看到埃迪和利萨难道不高兴吗？
Aren't you glad to see Eddy and Lisa again?

1347
02:21:57,010 --> 02:21:58,480
还有秃头？
And Rusty?

1348
02:22:02,390 --> 02:22:04,840
即使你是秃顶，我也爱你
I'd love you even if you were bald.

1349
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:10,170
我命运坎坷
Life's got it in for me.

1350
02:22:10,750 --> 02:22:14,380
一旦我想要某些东西，我总不能获取
As soon as I want something, I realise I can't have it.

1351
02:22:14,550 --> 02:22:16,740
我甚至不能有个孩子
I can't even have a baby.

1352
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:46,150
有什么问题？
What's wrong?

1353
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:52,140
你的头发看起来很好
Your hair looks good like this.

1354
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:57,270
你应该游会泳，水不热不冷
You should swim a bit. The water's lovely.

1355
02:22:57,450 --> 02:22:59,240
怎么样，亲爱的？
How about it, honey?

1356
02:23:03,340 --> 02:23:05,680
你疯了
You're crazy!

1357
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:36,600
我看着鱼杆
Watch the float, and that's all there is to it.

1358
02:23:37,450 --> 02:23:39,300
我不会做爱
I don't give a fuck.

1359
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:46,270
我不想激怒你，但是你看到贝蒂的状况了吗？
I don't want to piss you off, but have you seen the state Betty's in?

1360
02:23:46,450 --> 02:23:48,300
她一脸死灰
She's lost all her colour.

1361
02:23:49,010 --> 02:23:52,140
她一直咬嘴唇，看星星
She keeps on biting her lips and looking at the stars.

1362
02:23:55,650 --> 02:23:58,300
你比鱼还不如
Fuck, you're worse than a fish.

1363
02:24:01,310 --> 02:24:04,300
我能做些事来帮助他们吗？
Can I do anything to help you guys out?

1364
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:06,770
她认为她怀孕了
She thought she was pregnant.

1365
02:24:07,150 --> 02:24:10,800
不是每次都有效，试一下
Well, it can't work every time. Try again.

1366
02:24:11,480 --> 02:24:15,970
我有感觉，贝蒂想要不存在的东西
I get the feeling that Betty wants something that doesn't exist.

1367
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:20,800
这个世界对她来说太小了
The world's too fucking small for her.

1368
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:25,770
你不会像那样帮助她
You won't help her like that.

1369
02:24:25,980 --> 02:24:28,440
该死，埃迪，我得救她
Fuck, Eddy, I've got to save her.

1370
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:03,830
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

1371
02:25:13,310 --> 02:25:15,640
我的贝蒂，回来
My Betty. Come back.

1372
02:25:20,310 --> 02:25:22,000
是我
It's me.

1373
02:25:24,150 --> 02:25:26,000
我听到声音
I hear voices.

1374
02:25:30,150 --> 02:25:32,370
不，那是风
No, that's the wind.

1375
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:37,430
一些怪人总是在早上3点打开收音机，等待第三次世界大战
And some nut always has a radio on at 3 a.m., waiting for World War lll.

1376
02:25:37,650 --> 02:25:41,300
我在我的脑袋里听到这声音
I hear the voices in my head.

1377
02:25:42,310 --> 02:25:44,170
我要疯了
I'm going insane.

1378
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:48,670
在我的脑袋里
In my head.

1379
02:25:54,470 --> 02:25:56,330
现在都结束了
It's all over now.

1380
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:05,100
"当加恩斯把钉子钉进西维的身体...
"Whenever Josiane dug her nails into Sylvie's body...

1381
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:09,760
...捏她的胸部...
...kneaded her breasts or greedily tongued her hairy pussy...

1382
02:27:09,970 --> 02:27:11,300
...他回想起罗杰
...she'd think of Roger.

1383
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:15,300
她想要他带走她 残酷的刺穿她的内心
She wanted him to take her, brutally penetrate her core.

1384
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:19,260
她考虑刺穿那个该死的地方
She'd think of his stiff pole pounding into her gaping pussy.

1385
02:27:19,470 --> 02:27:21,460
'天呀，真有趣!"'
'Jesus, Jesus, the joy of it!"'

1386
02:27:28,140 --> 02:27:30,130
我不想尝试任何事
I won't try anything.

1387
02:27:31,170 --> 02:27:33,730
我不想受伤
I don't want to get hurt.

1388
02:27:33,910 --> 02:27:36,370
不要太紧张
Don't be so uptight.

1389
02:27:38,470 --> 02:27:42,800
你得鼓起勇气试这个
Oh, wow! You've got one hell of a nerve trying this.

1390
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:46,500
我钦羡你
I admire you.

1391
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:53,460
如果你想要，我有个热水瓶 你自便
I have a thermos flask if you want. Help yourself.

1392
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:02,500
你的名字是什么？
What's your name?

1393
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:07,290
我只想知道你的名字 我发誓不会告诉其他人
I just want to know your name. I swear I won't tell anyone.

1394
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:13,590
如果你解开我，我会帮助你
If you untie me, I can help you.

1395
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:16,960
我会把枪对准那混蛋们 我不喜欢这工作
I could turn a gun on the bastards. I hate this job.

1396
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:20,640
你为什么不告诉我你的名字？相信我
Why won't you tell me your name? Trust me.

1397
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:24,460
小心那个胖家伙  乔治
Watch out for the fat one, Georges-Alain.

1398
02:28:25,140 --> 02:28:27,600
小心，他是个卑鄙的人
Be careful, he's a real shit.

1399
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:32,240
他会不发警告就开枪 他以前杀死过旅客，我会杀了他
He'll fire without warning. He's shot passersby before now. I'd kill him.

1400
02:28:34,470 --> 02:28:36,330
他会找到你
He'll get you.

1401
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:39,100
我愿意看你
I'd like to watch you.

1402
02:28:39,740 --> 02:28:42,530
拿我做人质 我们会像邦妮和克莱德
Take me hostage. We'll be like Bonnie and Clyde.

1403
02:29:10,370 --> 02:29:12,730
你全错了
You've got it all wrong, shithead.

1404
02:29:13,030 --> 02:29:16,330
当你的妻子晚上头疼时 你想和她做爱...
When your wife has a headache the night you want to screw her...

1405
02:29:16,530 --> 02:29:19,090
...告诉她你不是在寻找她的灵魂
...tell her it's not her head you're after!

1406
02:29:22,870 --> 02:29:24,990
你不了解我的妻子
You don't know my wife.

1407
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:27,500
她就像其它的女人
She's like any other woman.

1408
02:29:27,740 --> 02:29:30,850
他们都是一样的 都是婊子，每个
They're all the same, all bitches, every last one.

1409
02:29:31,140 --> 02:29:34,370
听着，当你月底把工资带回家...
Look, when you bring your pay home at the end of the month...

1410
02:29:34,530 --> 02:29:36,790
...那么她不想要阿斯匹林

1411
02:29:39,970 --> 02:29:42,090
拿着钱
Take the money.

1412
02:29:59,370 --> 02:30:01,020
你个婊子

,当我抓住你 我会让你亲我的XX
When I catch up with you, I'll make you suck my dick!

1414
02:31:51,470 --> 02:31:53,660
你在那做什么，贝蒂？
What are you doing here, Betty?

1415
02:31:55,330 --> 02:31:58,990
你在做什么？ 我一直在找你
What are you doing? I've been looking all over for you.

1416

亲爱的
Sweetheart.

1417

Anything you want, Betty.

1422
02:32:48,370 --> 02:32:50,260
一个岛
An island.

1423
02:32:52,430 --> 02:32:54,290
你疯了
You're crazy.

1424
02:33:09,530 --> 02:33:11,850

Yes. I even screwed a beautiful brunette.

1429
02:34:02,290 --> 02:34:05,260
漂亮，真的漂亮
Beautiful. Really beautiful.

1430

我们明天去海边
We'll go to the seaside tomorrow.

1431
02:34:32,460 --> 02:34:34,320
好吗？
Is it good?

1432
02:34:36,290 --> 02:34:38,340
是个好主意，是吗？
This was a good idea, huh?

1433
02:34:44,790 --> 02:34:47,130
我会为你买艘船，好吗？
I'll buy you a boat, okay?

1434
02:34:52,130 --> 02:34:54,280
该死，太困难了，不是吗？
Shit, it's been tough, huh?

1435
02:34:55,130 --> 02:34:58,580
某个地方一定有你和我的天堂
There must be a paradise somewhere for you and me.

1436
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:10,120

我现在会去
I'll go and get it now or we'll be here ages.

1438
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:38,520
那个和你在一起的女孩 抢走了我的孩子
Hey, that girl who was with you has gone off with my little boy.

1439
02:35:38,730 --> 02:35:42,920
那个和你在一起的女孩 穿着短衣的人
That girl who was with you. The one in the short dress.

1440

I want a piano. I want a piano for my wife and kid.

For fuck's sake, that customer is my wife! Where is she?

In the tepee. She doesn't want to be disturbed. She paid, sir.

1476
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:17,710
亲戚？
A relative?

1477
02:42:18,710 --> 02:42:21,200
不，我只是其他人
No, I'm all the rest.

1478
02:42:23,380 --> 02:42:26,540
我们生活在一起 所以我能填出那些东西
We live together, so I can fill those things out.

1479

-我到底在哪填？ -这

-你别过于悲伤 -是的

1487
02:43:10,210 --> 02:43:12,570
对不起，这是10号房间吗？
Excuse me, is this room 1 0?

1488
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:17,330
刺自己眼睛的女孩？ 她很稳定，但需要休息
The girl who poked her eye out? She's stable but needs rest.

来吧
Come on.

1493
02:44:52,180 --> 02:44:54,000
呆在这也没用
There's no point in staying.

1494

我只想再呆点时间

1495

明天下午之前，她不会醒

她服镇静剂了

1499
02:45:19,410 --> 02:45:23,640
-我受够了 -你对其他人没有尊重
-I've had enough! -You have no respect for others.

1500
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:26,840
你能谈论尊重！ ...当你送货给
You can talk about respect! What do you get up to...

1501

...顾客时，你做了什么？
...when you deliver to your lonely customers?

1502

-你个混蛋，你在利用我！ -不要破坏我的墙
-You bastard, you're using me! -Stop busting my balls!

1503
02:45:34,540 --> 02:45:36,470
胡扯!
Shithead!

1504
02:45:36,710 --> 02:45:40,540
你疯了
You're totally crazy to get this wound up over nothing.

1505
02:45:40,980 --> 02:45:45,030
没事，你对我不忠 你称那为没事？
Nothing? You cheat on me and you call that nothing?

你对我不忠，不让我走 至少让我走
You cheat on me and don't fuck me! At least fuck me!

你不知道你在说什么！
You don't know what you're saying!

1508
02:45:52,540 --> 02:45:54,130
我对吵架感到烦了
I've had enough of this row.

1509
02:45:54,380 --> 02:45:58,700
这不是吵架
This isn't a row. You have to be in love for a row.

1510
02:47:36,210 --> 02:47:38,060
是的，说
Yes, speaking.

它还没来
It hasn't come yet.

1515

...but I can't explain. Just stuff that pops into mind.

贝蒂，我们成功了 书会出版了
Betty, we did it! The book's going to be published!

What have they done to you?

1523
02:49:46,570 --> 02:49:48,690
混蛋
The bastards!

1524
02:50:18,030 --> 02:50:20,090
我们会成功的，亲爱的

-What did you do to her? -You're crazy! Get out!

1537
02:51:11,370 --> 02:51:15,760
严肃地说 我们预测不了结果
It is serious. We can't predict the outcome.

1538
02:51:16,530 --> 02:51:20,870
我们不能保证她会痊愈
We can't guarantee that she'll ever recover.

1539

是你的药把她弄疯的

最糟糕的是，寂静...
Worst of all, the silence...

1552
02:54:18,870 --> 02:54:21,020
...话语突然出现：
...and words that just pop up:

1553
02:54:25,350 --> 02:54:27,840
"我找不到该死的糖!"
"I can't find the fucking sugar!"

1554
02:54:30,730 --> 02:54:32,580
"你开玩笑."

1555

尽最后努力
Make one last effort.

1559
02:55:33,400 --> 02:55:35,880
我们是天作之合
We were meant for each other.

1560
02:55:36,590 --> 02:55:40,080
没人能分开我们，没有人
No one can ever separate us, no one, ever.

1561
03:00:51,510 --> 03:00:53,600
你在写吗？
Are you writing?

1562
03:00:54,850 --> 03:00:56,910
不，我只是在想
No, I was just thinking.
