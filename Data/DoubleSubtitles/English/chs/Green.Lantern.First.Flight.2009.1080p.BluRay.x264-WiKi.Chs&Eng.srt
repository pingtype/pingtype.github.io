感谢原字幕制作者

2
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,750
卡罗尔 听我说 这风景不错 碧海蓝天 星光闪烁
I'll tell you, Carol, it's quite a sight up here. All those stars, the blue water.

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,000
这我想起在卡波岛的那晚 还记得吗
Reminds me of that night in Cabo.Remember?

4
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,330
哈尔 继续飞行
Hal, stay on the flight.

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,960
那晚喝了好多桑格利亚汽酒
A lot of sangria that night.

6
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,300
哇 你能回想起来吗 哈尔
Boy, could you put it away. Hal.

7
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,470
我都不知道那晚我们怎么回到旅馆的 哈尔 你正处于九万一千四百米的高度
I don't know how we made it to the hotel... Hal, you're at 91,400 feet.

8
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,470
再高十米窗户就碎了 你也会粉身碎骨
Ten feet higher, the window cracks and you're tapioca.

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,640
再推高一点点 也许我们可以为公司刷新记录
Just pushing it a little. Maybe we'll set a record for the company.

10
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,310
哈尔 别这样 这是你的第一次 正常发挥就好了
Please, Hal. For once in your life, no stunts, no surprises.

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,520
不准逞强
No surprises.

12
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,110
找到他
Find him.

13
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,870
乔丹先生 安全着陆我们的飞行就完美了
Make this landing and we'll have a perfect flight, Mr. Jordan.

14
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,700
这意味着我可以得金奖 或仅仅是一次超常模拟
So does this mean I get a gold star, or just an incredible simulation?

15
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,310
怎么没电了
What happened to the power?

16
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,230
有人么
Hello?

17
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,900
卡罗尔 有人吗
Carol? Anybody?

18
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,900
如果再让我驾驶这鬼东西的话
If I have to fly this freaking park ride again...

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,250
好吧
Okay.

20
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,890
天啊
My God.

21
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,390
别动
No.

22
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,520
没关系
It's all right.

23
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,520
我的死期已到
My time has come.

24
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,770
你会讲英语
You speak English.

25
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,650
不会
No.

26
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,030
是这个戒指
It's the ring.

27
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,030
它选择了你 戴上它
It has chosen you. Take it.

28
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,940
你现在就是绿灯侠了
You are now a Green Lantern...

29
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,240
宇宙保护者中的一员
...one of the protectors of the universe.

30
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,990
守护者会派人来找你
The Guardians will send for you.

31
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,280
灵活
Use...

32
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,290
使用
...the ring...

33
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,660
这个戒指
...wisely.

34
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,530
见鬼了
What the hell?

35
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,500
绿灯侠
首次飞行

36
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,740
当那道奇异的绿光消失时 模拟器就
...and when that weird glow cleared, the simulator was...

37
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,190
发生地震了吗
Was there an earthquake?

38
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,370
当然没关系了 但是要一个星期
I guess it's okay, but a whole week?

39
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,660
你要去哪
Where are you going?

40
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,040
我也不知道 可能去探探险 观光旅行
I don't know. I thought I'd do some exploring. See some new sights.

41
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,790
反正在设计模型上达成一致前也没什么事
Not much else to do until we get word on the prototype.

42
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,040
幸亏模拟器的损害还不是很严重
Well, at least the simulator wasn't damaged too badly.

43
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,090
卡罗尔 我要走了 有空了再打给你
Hey, Carol, gotta run. I'll call you from... wherever.

44
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,730
看来是真的
So it's true.

45
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,230
阿宾·苏已经死了
Abin Sur really is dead.

46
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,740
他的尸体呢
Where is his body?

47
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,530
问你呢 他的 随同飞船一块儿爆炸了
I said, where is...? It was blown up with the spacecraft.

48
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,740
我要把它拿下来
I want it off.

49
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,040
这个家伙都没有经过训练
The poozer's not even trained.

50
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,840
他已经在练习了
Someone's been practicing.

51
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,430
虽然还没有人指导
And without a manual.

52
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,560
大家都放手 可以吗
Let's all power down for a moment, shall we?

53
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,770
我想我们还没有相互介绍
I don't think we've been properly introduced.

54
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,110
我叫辛尼斯特罗
My name is Sinestro.

55
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,440
这是布迪卡 托玛·莱
This is Boodikka, Tomar Re...

56
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,200
还有我们帅气的基洛沃格
...and you've met our charming Kilowog.

57
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,120
你是 哈尔·乔丹
And you? Hal Jordan.

58
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,950
哈尔·乔丹
Well, Hal Jordan...

59
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,620
我们都是绿灯侠军团的
...we are members of the Green Lantern Corps...

60
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,960
从OA星球来的一股强大的星际间力量
...an elite, intergalactic force from the planet OA.

61
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,920
我们的上级是一群被称为守护者的不死之神
Our superiors are a group of immortals known as the Guardians.

62
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,010
他们应该派人来找我 是的
Yeah. They're supposed to send for me. That's right.

63
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,420
我们就是带你回去谈谈的
We're to bring you back for a little chat.

64
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,300
假如你在犹豫的话
And in case you're wondering...

65
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,550
这可不是请求
...this is not a request.

66
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,560
守护者没决定前这个戒指还不属于你
The ring isn't yours until the Guardians have decided.

67
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,020
好的 非常好
Okay. Very good.

68
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,560
托玛 麻烦你一下
Tomar, would you do the honors?

69
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,840
我们认为在类似地球飞船里 你会更舒服些
We thought the trip might be easier for you in a more earthly construct.

70
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,130
谢谢
Uh, thanks.

71
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,790
你必须要知道 地球人
You must understand, earthling...

72
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,380
绿灯侠军团是一个特许机构
...the Green Lantern Corps is a privileged organization.

73
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,510
并不是任何人都可以加入的
Not just anyone can join.

74
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,680
他们有着巨大的责任
There are tremendous commitments.

75
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,890
每一个成员负责
Each Lantern is responsible...

76
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,390
巡视宇宙三千六百个扇区中的一个
...for patrolling one of 3600 sectors of the universe.

77
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,480
但是 就像一个管辖区配一个警察吗
But... Sort of like one cop per precinct.

78
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,400
是的 我觉得是
Uh, yes. I... I suppose.

79
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
我叔叔曾是警察
My uncle was a cop.

80
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,360
是的 但是 在海滨城市警局工作了三十年
Yes, but... Thirty years on the Coast City police force.

81
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,030
他曾经让我负责开警笛 他人很好
He used to let me turn on the siren. Nice guy.

82
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,120
但这是远远不够的 绿灯侠的戒指是个复杂的工具
But more than that, the Green Lantern ring is a complex tool.

83
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,370
他需要使用者的精神高度集中
It takes someone with fierce concentration.

84
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,910
我想我已经会用了
I think I got the hang of it.

85
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,330
他确实是会用了
He's got the hang of it.

86
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,540
拉那卡
Ranakar.

87
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,840
我们何必对此浪费时间他是人类
Why are we even entertaining this? He's a human.

88
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,420
是啊 很难不考虑这一点
Yes, hard to get past that.

89
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,600
恐怕来自地球的人类在星际间没什么好名声
I'm afraid the human race of Earth does not have the most stellar reputation.

90
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,350
他们粗鲁 卑鄙 害怕并且不值得信任
The fact is humans are crude, base, fearful and untrustworthy.

91
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,690
还有臭味
Then there's the smell.

92
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,780
你不能瞧不起整个物种
You can't condemn an entire species.

93
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,530
甘瑟 这是你的一家之言
You've said it yourself, Ganthet.

94
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,900
但他们能延续这么长时间 也未尝不是一个奇迹
It's a wonder they've lasted this long.

95
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,620
也许你应该听我说说他们的暴行
Maybe you'd like me to list their atrocities.

96
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,450
或许人类真的能帮助我们
Maybe our human can help us.

97
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,620
也许他有他的优点
Maybe he has a few of his own.

98
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,830
听着 伙计 我并没有要求要这个戒指
Listen, buddy, I didn't ask for this ring.

99
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,460
如果你们想要回尽管拿去 我受够了你们的屁话
You want it back, take it, because I've had enough of this crap.

100
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,970
看来我们可以给他们加条罪行 就是无礼
Well, it appears we can add impertinence to their many qualities.

101
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,630
人类也有优点
The human has a point.

102
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,050
如果他像大家所说的那样不值得信任的话
If he were as unworthy as everyone says...

103
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,680
这个星系中没有能量能强迫戒指戴在他手上
...no power in the galaxy could have forced that ring on his finger.

104
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,480
但戒指就在那 与他合为一体
Yet there it is, at one with him.

105
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,820
各位守护者委员 我能说几句吗
Guardian Council, if I may speak.

106
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,820
辛尼斯特罗 请说
Please, Sinestro.

107
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,650
一四一七扇区的绿灯侠 已确认
The Lantern of Sector 1417 is recognized.

108
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,450
谢谢你 阿帕·阿里·阿帕萨
Thank you, Appa Ali Apsa.

109
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,160
我有个提议
I'd like to make a proposal.

110
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,790
请允许我来带这个人类 并考验他
Allow me to take the human under my wing, test him out...

111
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,330
看看他能不能胜任
...see what he's made of.

112
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,120
那是我的工作
That's my job.

113
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,210
只要稍加调教 每个人都会有所成就的
People can surprise you if you give them a little incentive.

114
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,210
辛尼斯特罗 你有更重要的事需要做
You have more important things on your agenda, Sinestro.

115
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,010
我们正面临危机
We have a deepening crisis at hand.

116
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,840
我知道 长官 但我认为这个人类也许可以帮助我们
I understand, sir, but I thought the human could be of assistance.

117
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,890
这有点反常规
It's a bit out of the ordinary...

118
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,520
但我对辛尼斯特罗的提议挺感兴趣
...but I'd be interested in Sinestro's evaluation.

119
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
要不我们来投票决定
Shall we put it to a vote?

120
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,020
大家开始吧
All in favor.

121
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,120
结果出来了 辛尼斯特罗 这个人就由你指挥
So be it. The human falls under your command, Sinestro.

122
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,040
祝好运
Good luck.

123
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,080
我是这的教练
I'm the trainer around here.

124
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,960
我知道 我知道
I know, I know.

125
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,210
现在什么状况 现在你是我的了
So, what now? Now, I own your ass.

126
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,550
我们走
Come on.

127
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,310
他们谈论的危机是指什么
What's the crisis they were talking about?

128
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,810
关乎谁将控制这个宇宙的小事
A small matter of who's gonna control the universe.

129
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,480
不过目前还处在最佳状态
Not that it's in the best hands as it is.

130
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,740
先做重要事情吧
But first things first.

131
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,410
地球人 你现在处的位置就是圣坛
You are on sacred ground, Earth boy.

132
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,410
我们处在宇宙的中心
We're at the center of the universe.

133
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,910
这个提灯包含着驱动所有戒指的能量
This lantern contains the battery that powers all the rings.

134
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,250
它同时储存有这个宇宙的所有已知信息
It also contains all the known information of the cosmos.

135
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,800
类似地图集 记载有宇宙的划分归属
A sort of atlas and who's who of space.

136
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,590
我们将去一二一五号扇区玩玩
We're going to be playing in Sector 1215.

137
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,430
你需要快速掌握这些信息
You need to be brought up to speed.

138
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,770
将你的指环对准光 用力想一二一五 剩下的事提灯电池会帮你完成
Stick your ring in the light, think 1215 and the battery will do the rest.

139
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
不可思议
Unbelievable.

140
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,380
这可不是旅行见闻讲演
This isn't a travelogue.

141
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,990
不错啊 上一个新兵把他的触角都烧没了
Not bad. The last rookie fried his antennas off.

142
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,620
多谢夸奖
Glad I could impress you.

143
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,290
但是你的确不错
But you do.

144
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,000
不像其他人 我喜欢人类
Unlike the others, I like humans.

145
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,130
我欣赏他们的精神 以及他们生来对权贵的蔑视
I admire their spirit and their natural contempt for authority.

146
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,290
这里却循规蹈矩
It's well-founded here.

147
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,670
你是指守护者
You mean the Guardians?

148
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,510
他们曾经极盛一时 不过现在也开始衰败了
They were a power at one time, but now they've grown soft.

149
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,930
他们对前线是什么样毫无概念
They've no idea what it's like on the front line.

150
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,350
不过别担心 地球人
But don't you worry, Earth boy.

151
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,020
他们会留心你的 我只想知道你有没有资质
They'll be taking notice of you. I need to know if you've got the stuff...

152
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,020
- 来处理这些事  - 什么事
- ...for what's ahead.  - What's that?

153
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,770
我们要找到杀阿宾·苏的凶手
We're going to get the butcher who killed Abin Sur.

154
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,530
凯德门岛是这个星球的藏污纳垢之处
Cadmendoh is a pustule of a planet.

155
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,830
这里到处都是犯罪人渣
A breeding ground of criminal scum.

156
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,210
我曾经建议我们用流星雨将这毁灭
One time I suggested we clean it out with a meteor shower.

157
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,080
守护者觉得我在开玩笑
The Guardians thought I was kidding.

158
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,790
我们在找谁 一个叫库驰的乌贼精
Who we after? A squidman named Cuch.

159
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,210
他杀了阿宾·苏吗
He killed Abin Sur?

160
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,380
笑着杀死他的
With a smile.

161
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,640
我提取的文件里没有这个地方
I don't have this place in my files.

162
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,100
这里是拉贝拉巢穴
It's called Labella's.

163
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,390
会经常变换地址
It changes addresses frequently.

164
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,230
他是拉贝拉吗
Is he Labella?

165
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,240
他只不过是个巨人
He's the bouncer.

166
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,240
闭上嘴 跟在我的后边
Watch my back and keep your mouth shut.

167
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
布雷瓦特
Boolywatt.

168
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,420
辛尼斯特罗
Sinestro.

169
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,960
看起来今晚很忙啊
Looks like a busy night.

170
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,750
库驰有没有出现过
Any chance Cuch has shown up?

171
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,250
我不知道 没有库驰这个人
Don't know no Cuch.

172
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,090
布雷 看看你
Booly, Booly, Booly. Look at you.

173
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
像个一无是处的橡胶球
Like a big rubber Booly ball.

174
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,260
信不信我可以将你弹着玩儿
Bet I could bounce you off the wall.

175
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,680
我发誓没见过他 我发誓
L... I haven't seen him. I swear!

176
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,940
你知道见到他时该找谁吧
You know who to come to when you do.

177
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,900
知道
Yeah.

178
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,480
也许我们应该来个“微服私访”
Maybe we should have come undercover.

179
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,730
有什么好玩的
What's the fun in that?

180
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,820
拉贝拉
Labella

181
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,490
辛大人
S-man.

182
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,160
宝贝 你来时应该通知我一声啊
You should've let me know you were coming, baby.

183
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,990
总带给我惊喜
Always surprising me.

184
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,330
为什么总是这样
Why you do that?

185
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,660
本来还可以好好玩一下
Could've made some cozy time.

186
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,080
亲爱的 我赶时间
I'm in a bit of a hurry, my dear.

187
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,830
我在找库驰
I'm looking for Cuch.

188
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,170
库驰
Cuch?

189
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,630
别来问我
Don't ask me.

190
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,090
我又不是他妈妈
I'm not his mother.

191
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,510
我听说他在这
I heard he was in town.

192
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,010
宝贝 库驰与昆虫人一块儿走的
Cuch left with the bug man, baby.

193
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
那已经是很久以前的事了
Long time ago.

194
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,180
从来没有回来过
Never come back to old Labella.

195
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,430
我怎么才能相信你
How come I don't believe you?

196
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,850
这些衣服怎么连拉链都没有
How come these suits got no zippers?

197
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,940
亲爱的 你大驾光临不会想跟我玩月光球吧
Aw, honey, you're not gonna slam Labella for a little moon ball.

198
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,740
我也不能控制所有到这的人啊
I can't control all the shank that gets in here.

199
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,360
拿着 什么
Take it. What?

200
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,700
一点刺激
A little incentive.

201
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,580
也许可以帮助你回忆
Maybe it will jog your memory.

202
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,410
开始吧
Go ahead.

203
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,970
辛大人 你真坏
You're a bad boy, S-man.

204
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,390
库驰呢
What about Cuch?

205
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,720
我告诉过你
I told you.

206
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,890
不
No.

207
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,810
再来一次
One more.

208
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,400
辛尼斯特罗 不要
Sinestro, come on.

209
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,030
他在哪 我不知道
Where is he? I don't know.

210
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,030
亲爱的 求求你了
Honey, I beg you...

211
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,410
库驰在哪
Where's Cuch?

212
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,000
我真的不知道
I don't know.

213
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,210
算了吧
End this.

214
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,430
我知道我在做什么
I know what I'm doing.

215
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,930
他做完一件事后总会回来找你的
He always comes back to you after a job.

216
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,260
求求你
Please...

217
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,390
他在这 就在附近 是不是
And he's here. He's close, isn't he?

218
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,650
告诉我吧 拉贝拉
Just tell me, Labella.

219
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,450
你什么意思 她在哪
What do you mean? Where is she?

220
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,620
拉贝拉
Labella!

221
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,040
攻击
Shoot.

222
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,350
我去追他
I'm going up.

223
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,620
是定时炸弹
Aah!

224
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,480
我运气好
I got lucky.

225
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,650
你敢违抗我
You defied me.

226
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,780
你差点杀死她
You could've killed her.

227
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,570
我告诉你 朋友
Let me tell you, friend.

228
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,950
控制局面的唯一方式就是制造恐惧
The only way to operate out here is by fear.

229
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,580
他们攻击 我就强势还击
They hit, I hit harder.

230
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,790
他们侵袭 我就摧毁他们
They attack, I annihilate.

231
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,460
对于暴乱 我坚决给与无懈可击的反击
I am the one constant, unassailable force against their chaos...

232
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,460
是你 让他们忽略了的这点
...and you made them forget that.

233
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,000
你以为我喜欢这样
You think I enjoy this?

234
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,420
看看守护者创造的这个宇宙
Look at the universe the Guardians have created.

235
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,760
我们是宇宙中力量最强的 但他们让我们干什么
We have the greatest power in the cosmos and what have they made us?

236
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,390
处理垃圾
Garbage collectors!

237
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,310
我们收拾各种垃圾
We pick up the trash.

238
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,470
小偷 杀手
A thief here, a killer there.

239
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,140
浮渣 尘土 污垢
Scum, dirt, filth!

240
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,440
永无止境 但这些可以被终止
There's no end to it, but there could be.

241
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,360
我的梦想是有一天 消除这一切腐朽
It's my dream that one day all this rot will be wiped away.

242
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,860
建立新秩序 一个可以结束混乱的秩序
A new order will prevail, one that will end the chaos...

243
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,160
但是心软没法解决问题
...but it Won't be built by the faint of heart.

244
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,500
你背着我手下留情了 地球人 这个我无法容忍
You got soft on me back there, Earth boy, and that I will not tolerate.

245
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,710
一切都好吗我们听到阵骚乱
Everything okay? We heard there was a disturbance.

246
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,670
没事
We're fine.

247
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,550
你逮到库驰了
Hey, you got Cuchie.

248
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,210
难得他这么安详
Don't he look peaceful.

249
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,340
我要把他带到最近的分站 你们和我一起来
I'm taking him to the nearest substation. I want everyone with me.

250
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,390
你没事吧 没事
You all right? Yeah.

251
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,730
很好
Swell.

252
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,790
介意我坐这吗
Mind if I join you?

253
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,250
这可能会影响你的声誉
Might hurt your reputation.

254
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,420
给他们点时间适应
Give them time.

255
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,090
你要知道的是
You have to understand...

256
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,970
阿宾·苏深受大家爱戴
...Abin Sur, everyone loved him.

257
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,930
他有家庭 朋友
He had family, friends.

258
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,350
他是不可取代的
He was irreplaceable.

259
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,350
库驰怎么样了
Any news on Cuch?

260
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,350
带去审讯了 谁审问
They took him to interrogation. Who's asking the questions?

261
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,730
你觉得呢
Who do you think?

262
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,200
天哪 我知道 辛尼斯特罗出手很狠
Ouch. I know. Sinestro can be difficult.

263
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,410
这么说吧 他有时很自以为是
All right, he can be pretty damn arrogant.

264
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,120
我们有些人开始担心他 但他压力很大
Some of us are starting to worry about him, but he's under a lot of pressure.

265
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,080
是的 拯救宇宙什么的 没错
Yeah, saving the universe or something. That's right.

266
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,790
库驰只是个小人物
Cuch is just a bit player.

267
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,800
我们真正在追踪的是他的头 坎加·罗
The one we're really after is his boss, Kanjar Ro.

268
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,460
他不过是个战争头子
He's just a warlord.

269
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,670
不再是了
Not anymore.

270
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,470
他找到了黄元素 我该记笔记吗
Not since he found the yellow element. Should I be taking notes?

271
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,720
这个故事可追溯到万物起源之初
This story goes back as far as time itself...

272
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,310
那时守护者是唯一具备感情的生物
...when the only sentient beings were the Guardians.

273
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,560
他们创造了提灯电池
They built the lantern battery...

274
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,810
这远远早于军团的创立
...long before the creation of the Corps.

275
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,900
这块电池可提供给所有戒指能量 依靠的就是绿元素
The battery would power all the rings with the green element...

276
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,320
即宇宙中最强大的能源
...the greatest energy source in the universe.

277
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,950
只有守护者知道它的出处
Where it comes from only the Guardians know.

278
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,160
它被安装那刻起 守护者就以此为杀手锏
But once it was installed, the Guardians had the ultimate weapon...

279
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,330
来维持银河系的和平和公正
...to maintain peace and promote justice in the galaxies.

280
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,500
不幸的是 这块电池 有一个漏洞：即黄元素
Unfortunately, the battery had one vulnerability, the color yellow.

281
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,630
它是光谱的一部分 能够抵制绿元素
It's one part of the light spectrum that can resist the green...

282
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,340
而黄色能量最集中的源头
...and the most concentrated source of yellow energy...

283
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,680
就是黄元素
...is the yellow element.

284
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,970
亿万年来 守护者把它封存在另一空间的地下
For eons, the Guardians had it hidden underground in another dimension...

285
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,430
直到被坎加·罗发现
...until Kanjar Ro found out.

286
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,770
当守护者意识到黄元素被盗
When the Guardians discovered the theft...

287
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,190
他们和高层绿灯侠召开了紧急会议
...they called for an emergency meeting with the senior Lanterns.

288
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,190
阿宾·苏自愿去做卧底
Abin Sur offered to go undercover.

289
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,990
几天后 他潜入了罗的飞船
Within days, he had infiltrated Ra's ship...

290
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,280
但未发现黄元素的踪影
...but there was no sign of the yellow element.

291
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,700
坎加·罗把它藏了起来
Kanjar Ro had taken it somewhere.

292
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:07,080
阿宾·苏正打算向守护者报告 结果被发现了
Abin Sur was about to report back to the Guardians when he was found out.

293
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,750
我听到的就是这样
That's the way I heard it.

294
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,040
阿宾·苏降落在了地球上
From there, Abin Sur made his way to Earth.

295
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,590
现在你代替了他 天啊
And now you're here. Jeez.

296
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,710
你一人抓获了库驰 他告诉你的吗
You captured Cuch by yourself. He tell you that?

297
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,260
不 我能潜入你大脑
No. I was in your head.

298
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,590
有意思
Interesting.

299
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,930
正如你们所知 阿宾·苏逃跑后
As you know, Kanjar Ro was forced to abandon his ship...

300
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,890
坎加·罗被迫遗弃了他的飞船
...after Abin Sur's escape.

301
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,310
现在他又开始行动了
Now he's on the move again.

302
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,850
我刚从库驰那得到消息
I just found out from Cuch...

303
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,980
罗和他的人最迟在一千七百个小时内会在卡典空间会合
...that Ro and his men are meeting at the Kadian Space Terminal at 1700 hours.

304
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,780
就这些总共就这些吗
That's it? That's all you got?

305
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,150
不是说它不重要
Not that it isn't significant.

306
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,080
不是这个意思 知道这个太好了 急需 很必要
No. It's good to know. Needed. Necessary even.

307
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,120
我命令所有人在一千六百个小时内回来
I want everyone back here at 1600 hours.

308
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,620
我们一起出发 有问题吗
We'll leave together. Are there any questions?

309
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,790
如果没有 那么
If not, then...

310
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,300
失陪
Excuse me.

311
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,600
我们已经不只一次谴责过你了 辛尼斯特罗
This is not the first time we've had to reprimand you, Sinestro.

312
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,440
我们守护者是不允许这种酷刑的
This cruelty is hardly the Guardian way.

313
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,640
他不配合
He was resistant.

314
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,270
阻碍了审讯
It made the process difficult.

315
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,820
我尽力而已 你应该通知我们
I did my best. We should have been called.

316
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,780
我们本可以使用通灵术套出真相
We might have been able to use our telepathy to draw him out.

317
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,240
没时间了
Time is running out.

318
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,320
我们正面对一个决意摧毁我们的敌人
And we're facing a foe who is hell-bent on destroying us.

319
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,120
绿灯军团是个典范 辛尼斯特罗
The Green Lantern Corps is an ideal, Sinestro.

320
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,410
你忽略了它的本意就无法维护它
You don't save it by ignoring what it stands for.

321
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,330
不允许同样的事发生在坎加·罗身上
This must not happen to Kanjar Ro.

322
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,590
一旦抓到他 立即送归我们处理
The moment he is captured, he is to be brought to us.

323
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,250
由我们来审讯
We'll do the questioning.

324
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,130
明白了吗
Is that understood?

325
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,800
明白
Yes, sir.

326
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,310
他们会毁了我们所有人
They will doom us all.

327
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,790
我需要有人守护外围 奇普
I'll need someone to watch this outer perimeter. Ch'p?

328
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,250
我总是干这种苦差事
I always get the stink jobs.

329
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,380
让新人来吧 我无所谓
Let the new guy do it. Whatever.

330
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,460
好吧 我们走
Fine. Let's go.

331
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,720
别被行李绊倒
Don't trip over the luggage.

332
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,400
游客们 请注意
Attention, travelers.

333
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,070
我们对服务的中断表示抱歉
We apologize for this interruption in service.

334
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,110
绿灯军团要求对太空站进行一次常规扫描
The Green Lantern Corps has requested a routine scan of the spaceport.

335
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,240
无需担心 活动片刻后恢复正常
There is nothing to be concerned about. Operations will resume momentarily.

336
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,920
那只红脸猪想把我揪出来
That red-faced swine wants to flush me out.

337
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,960
我们该怎么做
What should we do?

338
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,930
出去
Leave.

339
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,600
从这滚出去
The room. Get out.

340
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,980
我准备好了会通知你们
I'll let you know when I'm done.

341
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,120
我在这
I am here.

342
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,290
给我现身
Make yourself present.

343
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,580
辛尼斯特罗 我在呼叫你
Sinestro, I'm calling.

344
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,040
现身
Make your presence known.

345
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,420
我来了
I'm here.

346
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,390
你想玩什么把戏 想找你不容易
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull? You're a hard man to reach.

347
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,260
你想怎么样 每天向你报告
What do you want, a daily briefing?

348
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,930
即使像这样 我们谈话很危险 特别是阿宾·苏死后
It's dangerous to talk, even like this, especially with Abin Sur dead.

349
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,100
罗 交流只有两种方式
Communication, Ro. It goes two ways.

350
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,150
我发誓我不会把你挤出局
I swear I'm not squeezing you out.

351
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,650
黄元素在哪 在武器专家那儿
Where's the yellow element'? With the Weaponers.

352
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,280
武器都准备好了 我们没多少时间了
The weapon is ready for pickup. We don't have long.

353
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,660
在哪 你手下就在周围 你以为我会告诉你吗
Where? I'm gonna tell you surrounded by your pack dogs?

354
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,490
别考验我的忍耐力 罗
Don't try me, Ro.

355
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,830
我为此付出了一切 军团 未来 生命
I've put everything on the line for this: the Corps, the future, my life.

356
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,080
你休想搪塞过去
I am not going to be given the runaround.

357
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,420
这样吧 我们一起去武器专家那 就我们俩
Tell you what, we go to the Weaponers together, just you and me.

358
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,920
你摆脱你的人 我摆脱我的
You get rid of your boys, I'll get rid of mine.

359
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,130
去哪找你 等候室
Where are you? In a waiting room.

360
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,010
半小时后在五十号站点等你 但如果我发现任何一个绿灯侠
I'll meet you at Station 50 in half an hour. But if I see one ring anywhere...

361
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,800
去等着吧
Just be there.

362
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,520
托玛 计划改变
Tomar, we have a change of plans.

363
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,190
快点 我们这就出发
Come on. We're leaving.

364
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,650
但是绿灯军团
But the rings...

365
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,860
用隐身术
Use your faders.

366
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,160
乔丹
Jordan?

367
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,870
是不是抓到他了 还没 你这怎么样
Tell me you got him. Not yet. How are you doing?

368
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,710
到现在为止 我看到了十颗流星 一颗超新星还有一个行李员
So far I've seen 10 shooting stars, one supernova and a baggage handler.

369
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,220
托玛说辛尼斯特罗想把我们中大部分 重新部署到下一个站点
Tomar says Sinestro wants to re-deploy most of us to the next port.

370
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,390
到南区去 托玛在那等我们
Get over to the south perimeter. Tomar is meeting us there.

371
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,180
好吧
Uh-huh.

372
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,190
你没事吧
You Okay?

373
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,150
没事 我被什么东西砸中了
Yeah. Something hit me.

374
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,150
待在这
Stay here.

375
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,520
接招吧 昆虫人
Hold it, bug boy.

376
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,290
乔丹 你在哪
Jordan, where are you?

377
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,330
我在杀虫
Got a little pest-control problem.

378
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,110
坎加·罗在哪
Where is Kanjar Ro?

379
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,440
辛尼斯特罗 他正前往西门
Sinestro. He's heading for the west gates.

380
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,780
不论如何 抓活的
Do whatever it takes. I need him alive.

381
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,080
绿灯军团
Rings!

382
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,450
干的漂亮 哼
Nice move. Hm.

383
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,710
一个接一个
All right, one at a time.

384
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,050
你们在干嘛 罗在哪
What are you doing? Where's Ro?

385
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,970
辛尼斯特罗 这些人 这些人无关紧要
Sinestro, these people... These people are irrelevant.

386
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,640
组织在执行任务 给我记牢了
The Corps is on the line. Get that through your heads.

387
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,310
在抓到坎加·罗之前
None of us, and therefore none of them are safe...

388
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,810
所有人包括他们都没有安全保障
...until we get Kanjar Ro.

389
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,810
即使要把这变成废墟 我也不在乎
I don't care if we have to tear this place apart girder by girder.

390
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,450
是他
It's him.

391
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,290
推
Pushit

392
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,880
你没事吧 没事
You all right? Yeah.

393
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,020
干得好
Good shot.

394
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,890
他们要赶上来了 该减负了
They're going to reach us. Time to lighten the load.

395
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,870
该死
Holy crap!

396
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,000
我们得冲过去
We have to get through.

397
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,550
前头有个裂口 我们可以安全脱离
There's a rift ahead. We can get out home free.

398
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,110
是刚才在机场那家伙
It's that guy from the port.

399
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,240
你还坐在这干嘛
So why are you sitting here?

400
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,810
还剩一个
One bug left.

401
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,430
换做我 我会住手
I'd power down if I were you.

402
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,100
只有我知道武器专家在哪
I'm the only one who knows where the Weaponers are.

403
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,430
没有我 你永远找不到
Without me, you'll never find them.

404
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,360
跟我合伙 我就告诉你 我发誓
Take me in, and I'll implicate you, I swear.

405
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:17,530
拜托 辛尼斯特罗 放下戒指 我们还可以商量
Come on, Sinestro. Put the ring down. We can still work this out.

406
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,750
辛尼斯特罗 我在考虑
Sinestro? I'm thinking.

407
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,410
还想什么
What's there to think about?

408
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,370
B计划 也行得通
Plan B. It could work.

409
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,970
辛尼斯特罗
Sinestro.

410
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,930
是的
Yes.

411
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,940
在这
Down here.

412
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,660
你只身进入了驾驶舱
You entered the pilot's cabin on your own.

413
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,830
是的
Yes, sir.

414
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,170
你没看见坎加·罗 没有
And you did not see Kanjar Ro? No, sir.

415
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,790
你不记得自己杀了他
And you have no recollection of killing him?

416
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,170
我没杀他
I did not kill him.

417
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,840
有人杀了他 是你们中的一个
Someone did, and he wore a Green Lantern ring.

418
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,220
你是第一个到那的
You were the first ones there.

419
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,600
事实上 托玛·莱和布迪卡先到的
Actually, Tomar Re and Boodikka arrived on the scene first...

420
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,350
不过我片刻后也赶到了
...but I was there soon after.

421
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,640
我们分开跟踪飞船的水汽尾迹
We followed the ship's vapor trail separately.

422
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,980
飞船上再没别人了 没有了
And no one else was on the ship? No.

423
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,690
但我可以理解他的行为
But I think it's perfectly understandable what happened.

424
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,150
这个人类受到坎加·罗的攻击
The human was attacked by Kanjar Ro...

425
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,690
在他还剩一丝意识时 进行了反击
...and in his last moments of consciousness, he struck back.

426
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,990
明显属于自卫
A clear case of self-defense.

427
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,620
他不该这么做
He should never have put himself in that situation.

428
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,330
如果不是因为他逞英雄
If he hadn't played hero...

429
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,830
你们或许就能赶上飞船 并活捉坎加·罗
...you might have caught up with the ship and taken Kanjar Ro alive.

430
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,420
现在没人知道黄元素的下落
Now there's no telling into whose hands the yellow element might fall.

431
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,330
或许你有话要说
Perhaps you'd like to say something?

432
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,340
我没杀他
I didn't kill him.

433
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,710
那谁杀的
Then who did?

434
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,800
拿走他能量棒的人 我保证手上没有
Whoever took his Energi-Rod. I sure as hell don't have it.

435
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,430
你轻率的行动
By your brash actions...

436
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:03,600
已经把宇宙搞得动荡混乱
...you have placed the universe in absolute turmoil.

437
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,930
打断一下 是在你们管辖下
Excuse me, but the turmoil began...

438
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,230
黄元素被盗的那刻起 宇宙就开始动荡
...when the yellow element was stolen under your watch.

439
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,060
不要再说了 的确如此
We've heard enough. Indeed.

440
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:17,280
哈尔·乔丹 此次审判中你缺乏纪律性
Hal Jordan, it greatly disappoints me that in the judgment of this tribunal...

441
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,240
已经无法在继续履行绿灯侠的职责
...you have been found of insufficient discipline...

442
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,070
我们对此非常失望
...to carry on the duties of a Green Lantern.

443
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,740
警卫官上前一步
Will the sergeant-at-arms please come forth?

444
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,870
把戒指上交给基洛沃格长官
You shall hand your ring over to Commander Kilowog.

445
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,730
基洛沃格 守护者找到继承者前戒指由你保管
Kilowog, you will keep the ring until the Guardians choose its successor.

446
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,390
黄元素怎么办
And what of the yellow element?

447
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,020
我建议守护者开个特别会议
I suggest we call a special session with our honor guard...

448
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,270
讨论下后续战略
...to devise our next strategy.

449
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,780
我会安排的 长官
I can arrange that, sir.

450
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,450
没什么了的话 本次审判结束
If there is nothing more, this tribunal is over.

451
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,730
你们来送我回家吗
Are you my ride home?

452
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:37,150
我们是志愿来的 基洛沃格有话对你说
We both volunteered. Kilowog has something to say to you.

453
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,070
抱歉之前我对你的评价
I'm sorry I said the things I said about you.

454
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,820
你救了我 你是个勇敢无畏的绿灯侠
You saved my life. You are a brave and bold Green Lantern.

455
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,160
谢谢 基洛沃格
Thanks, Kilowog.

456
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,700
还吃吗 你吃吧
You gonna eat that? Go for it.

457
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,880
难熬的一天 抱歉
Quite a day, huh? I'm sorry.

458
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,510
他是那么平静 你注意到没 谁
Did you notice how calm he was? Who?

459
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,010
辛尼斯特罗 他竟然愚蠢的替我辩护
Sinestro. He even defended me, in a half-assed way.

460
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,430
他一直挺官僚的
He's always been political.

461
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,520
他知道守护者们隐藏黄元素的事情吗
Would he have known where the Guardians hid the yellow element?

462
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,770
他们相信他 他憎恨他们
They trust him. He hates them, you know.

463
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,850
他总爱挑刺
He's critical.

464
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,190
不 不 他受不了他们
Uh-uh. No, no. He can't stand them.

465
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,530
守护者说能量棒可能有用什么意思
What did the Guardian mean when he said the Energi-Rod might be helpful?

466
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:28,950
坎加·罗通过思想控制能量棒 里面也许存留一些心灵感应信息
Kanjar Ro controlled it through his thoughts. It might contain some psionic information.

467
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,910
比如黄元素放在哪里吗
Like where he put the yellow element?

468
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,830
拉那卡啥也不懂
Ranakar doesn't know his butt from his poozer.

469
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,000
即便他有能量棒
Even if you had the rod...

470
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,880
没有坎加·罗的脑电波也没法用
...you can't use it without Kanjar Ra's brainwaves...

471
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,170
信息就会被永远存封
...and that transmitter has been shut off for good.

472
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,680
准备好了吗 我们急着出发吗
Are you ready? Are we in a hurry?

473
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,900
这个就是
This is him.

474
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,430
我知道挺冷的 坎加·罗
I know it's cold, Kanjar Ro.

475
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,890
抱歉
I'm sorry about that.

476
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,350
我在哪
Where. . .?

477
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,560
你在棺材里 你死了
You're in the morgue. You're dead.

478
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,060
死了 我杀了你
Dead? I killed you.

479
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:45,570
我要接通感应体获取些信息 不会太久的
I'm reconnecting synapses for some information. This shouldn't take long.

480
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,900
还记得黄元素吗
You remember the yellow element, right?

481
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,240
黄色
Yellow.

482
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,280
你让武器专家看护着 他们在哪里
You left it with the Weaponers. Where are they?

483
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,580
科沃
Qwar...

484
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,580
再给你次机会
One more time.

485
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,460
科沃
Qwar...

486
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,590
或许我能指给我看 坐起来吧
Perhaps you can show me. Let's sit up, shall we?

487
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,640
开始吧 武器专家在哪里 黄元素在哪里
All right, now. Where are the Weaponers? Where is the yellow element?

488
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:26,190
三二四区 非常好
Sector 324. Very good.

489
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,070
能更准确点吗
Can you be more specific?

490
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:38,410
科沃德
Qward.

491
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,500
最近的披萨店也找到了吗
Can you find the nearest pizza joint too?

492
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,750
真是惊喜啊
Well, well, this is a surprise.

493
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,670
怎么回事 辛尼斯特罗
What's going on, Sinestro?

494
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,340
很明显啊 基洛沃格
It's fairly evident, Kilowog.

495
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:54,430
我在努力找到黄元素
I've been working behind the scenes to find the yellow element.

496
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,350
是你杀了坎加·罗
You killed Kanjar Ro.

497
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,180
帮他逃脱了惩罚
To save his hide.

498
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,020
小心点 你们不想伤到能量棒
Careful now. You don't want to damage the Energi-Rod.

499
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:07,110
我听说这物质很不稳定啊
The core is quite unstable, I've been told.

500
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,690
你对守护者撒谎了
You lied to the Guardians.

501
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,610
我对所有人都撒谎了 我是迫不得已
I've lied to everyone. I've had to.

502
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,240
为什么 好好想想
Why? Think about it.

503
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,780
坎加·罗怎么会知道黄元素在哪里
How did Kanjar Ro know exactly where to find the yellow element?

504
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,370
阿宾·苏怎么会这么快就死了
How was Abin Sur killed so quickly?

505
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,040
你的意思是有内鬼 没错
Are you saying there's a traitor? Of course.

506
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,710
为什么我想跟地球人合作呢
Why do you think I wanted to work with Earth boy?

507
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,880
起码我知道他是清白的
At least I could be sure he was clean.

508
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,880
你该对守护者说实话
You should've told the Guardians.

509
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,210
到时候再说吧
In due time.

510
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,130
先找到黄元素 基洛沃格
Let's get the yellow element first, Kilowog.

511
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,800
到时我们就是英雄了
Then we'll all be heroes.

512
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,140
摘掉你的戒指
Take off your ring.

513
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,140
别开玩笑了 布迪卡
Don't be ridiculous. Boodikka?

514
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:47,150
抱歉 辛尼斯特罗 你说不通这个家伙
Sorry, Sinestro. I don't think you can talk your way out of this one.

515
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:04,870
他还活着
He's still alive.

516
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,330
如果她杀了他 戒指会自动回到守护者那里
If she had killed him, his ring would have flown to the Guardians.

517
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,170
那样可就不太好了
And we'd rather not have that happen just yet.

518
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,800
来这里是乔丹的主意 我以为你已经走了
It was Jordan's idea to come here. I was hoping you'd be gone by now.

519
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,340
我告诉你了他很聪明
I told you he was bright.

520
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,850
你耍我
You played me.

521
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:22,100
我得进入你的思想 确定是否拉你入伙
I needed to get inside your head, see if you should join our club.

522
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,600
但是你很难懂啊
But you're not easy to read.

523
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,100
私下里我们再聊聊
We really need to talk about personal space.

524
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,440
现在还不晚 乔丹
It's not too late, Jordan.

525
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,860
布迪卡相信我 别人也会的
Boodikka believes in my vision. Others will too.

526
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:36,110
我得利用有点骨气的你把事情搞定
But I could use someone like you who has the stones to get things done.

527
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,110
那些矮人放弃了你
While the gnomes banish you...

528
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,700
我给你能力 无法想像的能力
...I offer you power, more power than you can imagine.

529
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,540
只要你能效忠于我
All I ask is for is your loyalty.

530
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,630
我在你手上了 还是回到刚才那段
Now, you see, you had me. Right up until that last part.

531
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,340
我以为人类会不太一样
And I thought humans were different.

532
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,130
收拾他
Take care of him.

533
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,680
把尸体和罗的放在一起 我得走了
You can hide his body with Ra's. I shouldn't be long.

534
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,330
偷袭我 是吧
Knock me out, will you?

535
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,560
人类
Humans.

536
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,260
天哪
Good God.

537
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,420
你就是武器专家吧
You're a Weaponer.

538
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,760
我是来找黄元素的
I'm here for the yellow element.

539
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:48,260
该来的不应该是你
You are not the one.

540
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:50,970
坎加·罗死了 我是他的同伙
Kanjar Ro is dead. I was his partner.

541
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:54,440
他告诉我来科沃德拿武器
He told me to come to Qward to pick the weapon up here.

542
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,980
他为之付出代价 现在是我的
He paid for it and now it's mine.

543
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,990
听好 我现在没有时间
Listen, I don't have time for this. I...

544
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,000
你的朋友
Your friend...

545
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,260
来晚了
...is late.

546
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,430
武器被没收了
The weapon is now in forfeiture.

547
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:31,350
该你来拿走了
It is yours to take.

548
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,050
这是控制戒指
This is your control.

549
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,760
我们的工作完成了
Our work is done.

550
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:55,260
该回自己的世界了
We leave this world to return to our own.

551
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,930
这个武器急具杀伤力
The weapon is a mighty force.

552
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:05,820
是你们的宇宙里最强大 最绝对的
The most powerful and absolute in your universe.

553
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,190
唯有一个例外
With one exception.

554
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,530
一个
One...

555
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,820
小小的
...slight...

556
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:14,030
缺陷
...imperfection.

557
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,280
是什么？
What?

558
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:22,380
每个武器都有的缺陷
The imperfection every weapon has.

559
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,300
就是使用者
Its user.

560
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,490
他们抓到布迪卡
So they got Boodikka.

561
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,450
独自开始 独自结束
I start alone, I end alone.

562
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,830
守护者想要见你
The Guardians want to see you.

563
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,160
我也正想见他们
And I them.

564
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,330
你在做什么啊辛尼斯特罗
What are you doing, Sinestro?

565
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,330
万不得已的事情 托玛
Only what's necessary, Tomar.

566
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,420
别那么郁闷 整个宇宙归矮子管有点太大了
Oh, don't look so glum. The universe has become too big for the gnomes.

567
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,850
新的世纪开启了
There's a new day dawning.

568
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,940
新的太阳升起了
A new sun rising.

569
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:38,200
他曾是我们最优秀的绿灯侠 是大家的榜样
He was our most brilliant Lantern. A paragon of duty and service.

570
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,160
他们中最聪明的一个
The cleverest of them all.

571
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:43,870
也许太聪明了 拉那卡 我们之前该预料到的
Perhaps too clever, Ranakar. We should have seen the signs.

572
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:49,000
辛尼斯特罗向大家解释之前 我还是很怀疑
Until Sinestro gets an opportunity to explain himself, I remain skeptical.

573
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:52,340
有件事可以肯定 你冤枉了好人
One thing's for sure, you took the ring off the wrong guy.

574
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,300
如果是我 应该归还给他
You ask me, you should give it back.

575
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,310
你觉得合适的时候
When you're ready.

576
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,610
没有能量了
It's lost its power.

577
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,410
托玛
Tomar.

578
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,830
他把他们都杀了
He killed them all.

579
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,530
看来是真的
So it is true.

580
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,780
甘瑟 新的政权即将到来
Yes, Ganthet. A new command is at hand.

581
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:03,950
新的政权 你好大的胆子
A new authority. How dare you?

582
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:08,120
- 这是篡权  - 闭嘴 你这个愚蠢的矮子
- It's an affront to...  - Shut your mouth, you stupid little troll!

583
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,050
你们无非就是一群吵死人的矮子 既没用又碍事
You're nothing but a clutch of bickering old biddies, ineffectual and obstructionist.

584
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,970
在星球里高呼秩序却看不到外面的世界
In a galaxy screaming for order, you have cast a deaf ear...

585
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,970
这些现在结束了
...but all that ends now.

586
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,470
你们说的那些守护神
As demigods bound by your word...

587
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,140
你们都要拜倒到我的脚下
...all of you are going to pledge your undying allegiance to me.

588
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,060
去死吧
Like hell!

589
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,900
拉那卡 这次我们同意
For once, Ranakar, we agree.

590
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,830
去死吧 辛尼斯特罗
Give this up, Sinestro.

591
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,510
我知道放弃权利是件难事
It must be difficult to relinquish power.

592
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,310
给你们点刺激吧
Let me give you some incentive.

593
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,950
你们将一无所有 最后命都保不住
You will have nothing. Not even your lives, in the end.

594
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,050
走了
Gotta go, guy

595
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,060
退后
Stand back.

596
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:11,140
谢谢
Good man.

597
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:32,830
怎么回事
What the hell?

598
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,330
开心的坠落吧
Happy landings.

599
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,970
没用了
It's dead.

600
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,920
绿灯侠们
The Lanterns.

601
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,180
没有能量和保护的绿灯侠们
Yes, all the ones in space, with no power and no protection.

602
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:16,140
没有军队的战争是不可能获胜的
You are generals without an army, in a war you cannot win.

603
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,060
还要死多少人
How many more have to die?

604
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,730
够了 辛尼斯特罗 求你了
Enough, Sinestro. Please.

605
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,900
我们遵从你的命令
We will accede to your demands.

606
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,120
拜托 变绿啊
Come on, get green!

607
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,090
他妈的
Oh, son of a...

608
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,330
戒指给我
The rings. Now.

609
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:48,110
说实话 基洛沃格 你不会有好下场的
Frankly, Kilowog, you weren't going to survive this anyway.

610
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:35,490
我会被诅咒的
I'll be damned.

611
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:41,830
你以为我曾是绿灯侠
And you thought I was green before.

612
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,160
乔丹
Jordan.

613
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,690
你看到他了
Do you see him?

614
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,070
看不出来
I can't tell.

615
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,180
这混蛋一定在什么地方
The bastard's here somewhere.

616
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,280
该结束了 辛尼斯特罗
It's over, Sinestro.

617
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:14,250
戒指上还有许多能量呢 足够打败你的
I still have plenty of juice left in this ring. Enough to take yours for insurance.

618
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,300
你还不够强大
You're not strong enough.

619
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:28,640
来点刺激点的吧
Just takes a little incentive.

620
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,400
对不起 笨蛋
Excuse me, poozer.

621
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:11,910
乔丹 能听到我吗
Jordan, can you hear me?

622
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:13,200
快回答 乔丹
Come in, Jordan.

623
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,160
你在哪里啊
Where are you?

624
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:19,160
正在下坠 我忘带降落伞了
Falling. I forgot my chute.

625
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:41,940
很有创意嘛
Very creative.

626
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,770
我也能来点小把戏
Hey, I got a few tricks too.

627
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:54,700
虽然我们要继续悼念
Though we continue to mourn those who have fallen...

628
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,870
在最近发生的背叛事件中逝去的人们
...during the tragic betrayal of recent days...

629
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,960
但是我们还要庆祝恢复原状
...we also celebrate our resiliency.

630
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:05,960
绿灯电池已经修复 戒指再度闪耀
Our battery is repaired, our rings replenished...

631
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:09,420
与黑暗势力斗争亦将继续
...and our battle against the dark forces continues.

632
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:12,800
我们从上一次斗争中学到了
If we have learned anything from our last battle...

633
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:17,930
黑暗势力会滋长于难以预料的角落
...it is that great evil can arise from the most unexpected sources...

634
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:22,730
值得庆幸的是 英雄主义也会胜出
...but, most thankfully, so can great heroism.

635
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:27,440
我邀请甘瑟带领我们发誓
I've asked Ganthet to lead us in our pledge.

636
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,820
如果不介意的话 阿帕·阿里·阿帕萨
If you don't mind, Appa Ali Apsa...

637
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:34,240
我想将此殊荣授予新绿灯侠 哈尔·乔丹
...I'd like to give that privilege to our newest Lantern, Hal Jordan.

638
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,950
好啊 好啊
Hear, hear.

639
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,500
怎么回事啊
What's the matter?

640
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:43,000
我早上才听说的
I just learned the thing this morning.

641
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,840
在最明亮的日子
n brightest day...

642
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,180
在最黑暗的夜里 只要我们在黑暗势力无处可躲
In blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight.

643
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,300
让那些追随邪恶力量的人们
Let those who worship evil's might...

644
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:03,310
感触到我们的力量 绿灯侠
...beware my power, Green Lantern's light!

645
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,480
我要走了
I'm off.

646
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:12,990
你打算去哪里
Where are you going?

647
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:15,660
我要去那边的老板处打卡了
I've gotta go punch a clock with my other boss.

648
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,030
这将会是一个很漫长的旅程
I can see where this is gonna be a long commute.
