离开什么
From whom

17
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:31,211
恶魔 你没看见他们吗
Demons They're everywhere Don't you see them

18
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:43,213
我只看到了你
I see only one.

19
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:54,215
我问你最后一次
I'll ask you one last time.

20
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:57,216
你对我的家人都做了什么
What did you do with my family

21
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:03,727
史蒂文 是我 格洛里亚 我是你的妻子
Steven, it's me, Gloria! I'm your wife.

22
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:05,218
这些都是我们的孩子
These are our children.

23
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,218
你不是我的家人
You're not my family!

24
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:12,219
你杀了他们
You killed them, just like the others.

25
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,479
我要为他们报仇
Now it's your turn.

26
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,221
今晚没有人会死
No one's dying here tonight.

27
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:24,221
你不能这么做
It's not me you should be stopping.

28
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:25,221
他们是怪物
It's them Look at them!

29
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:30,222
你看清楚了吗
Look at them!

30
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,224
他们与我的邻居一样
It's just like the neighbors.

31
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:41,894
去我的小屋你会发现我是对的
Go to my shed You'll see I'm right!

32
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:01,228
你做了什么
What have you done

33
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,900
哥谭市

34
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,233
让我来帮你
Let me help you.

35
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:32,114
这不是我的错
It's not my fault.

36
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:35,234
我生了魔鬼这是魔鬼
I've given birth to the devil It's the devil!

37
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:40,235
你只是累了 把孩子给我
You're tired Give me the baby.

38
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:42,236
你也不想伤害她吧
You don't want to hurt her.

39
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:17,582
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,800
正义大厅

41
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:50,248
犯下这些罪行的是守法公民
These crimes were committed by law-abiding citizens.

42
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,249
他们都说看到了恶魔
They all claim to have seen nightmare visions beforehand.

43
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:54,459
有什么线索吗
Any clue what's causing it

44
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:55,759
没有
No idea.

45
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,250
我就待一星期的班
The one week i fill in for Jordan,

46
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,250
结果就发生了这种事
and it couldn't be some hairy-ass monster

47
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,250
世界各地都有这样的情况
The same pattern is repeating around the world,

48
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:05,251
也许这是一个线索
so there could be an overriding factor.

49
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,251
也许是一个超自然事件
Perhaps a paranormal element.

50
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:10,252
你是说魔法吗
Are you talking about magic

51
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,252
我们以前碰到魔法 蝙蝠侠
We've come up against magic before, Batman.

52
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:14,253
薛西斯 鬼父 浮士德
Xerxes, trigon, Felix faust.

53
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:17,253
甚至连沙赞的力量也是来于魔法
Even shazam's powers are based in magic.

54
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:20,254
你有何高见
With as much as you've seen, can you rule it out

55
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:23,254
魔法只是一个借口
The criminally insane don't need magic as an excuse.

56
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:25,635
我建议我们还是多花点时间巡逻
I recommend spending more time on the streets

57
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:27,255
而不是一飞而过
instead of flying over them.

58
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:32,056
他的态度真友[恶]好[劣]
Hmm He's even friendlier than they say.

59
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,450

61
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,800
拉斯维加斯
五天前

62
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:59,272
谁定的狗屁规矩
Bollocks! In what bloody plane of existence does four of a kind lose

63
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:03,483
哎 康斯坦丁
Too, too bad, constantine.

64
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:10,274
希望你还有足够的赌资
Have you gained weight It looks good on you.

65
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:13,235
杰森 你应该一起玩几把的
What say you let your soul mate play a few hands, Jason

66
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:14,275
也许他你能改变我的运气
Maybe he'd change my luck.

67
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:16,405
他会让你玩的更尽兴点
He'd definitely be less mopey than you.

68
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:21,276
别听约翰·康斯坦丁胡扯
John constantine, the man who perfected the bad idea.

69
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:25,277
我来到这赌场是要找封印怪物
The only reason I came to this dung heap of a casino is to find a relic

70
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,277
的一件物品
to keep that monster locked away forever.

71
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:31,038
让我们一起玩 好了
Boys, boys! You're boring me Let's play, shall we

72
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:52,282
我的运气一直好得不的了
My luck's running as hot as me naughty bits.

73
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:55,282
好了 我们没多少时间了
Oh, but our next group of friends is due to arrive,

74
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:58,283
是时候结束了
so it's time to bust you out.

75
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:02,284
科波菲尔秀
Copperfield's coming Presto changeo!

76
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:05,284
一切尽在掌控
Woman in a box In a box.

77
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,915
说的没错
Yeah, he's classy, unlike you.

78
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:14,287
他们暗示的是不是那个大卫·科波菲尔
Are they implying David Copperfield, television magician, has true power

79
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:17,547
还拥有一堆岛屿还有克劳蒂亚·雪佛
Owns a chain of islands and dated Claudia schiffer What do you think

80
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:23,288
我只接受现金
No cards for me, and...

81
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:27,288
还有你输了 康斯坦丁
Oh, looks like you can't call my bet, constantine.

82
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,289
你输了
By my rules, you lose.

83
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,290
我加码
I raise.

84
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,290
用什么 你的灵魂可不值这么多
With what Your ratty soul ain't worth two bits.

85
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,290
不是廉价之物
Not two bits.

86
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:41,171
我要赌的是神秘房
I'm betting the house, the house of mystery.

87
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,293
我赌上了一切
And since I'm including everything inside,

88
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,293
阿比赞 看来你还有所保留
it looks like you're the one that can't call, abnegazar.

89
00:08:53,294 --> 00:08:55,294
好吧 干不干
Well, what do you say, boys

90
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:57,294
来
I like the action.

91
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:13,297
我跟
I call.

92
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,299
就一个梦石 切
Really A chipped dream stone

93
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:23,299
我可拿出了
I'm out.

94
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,299
我的一切
Broken knick-knacks for the house of mystery and its contents

95
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,430
而你呢
Are you mad

96
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,300
我有灵魂捕手
I've got a working soul catcher.

97
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:35,301
奥兹之眼 还有garazi
That's ogid's eye spiker, eh And the garazi.

98
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:41,303
而且梦石可不是一个廉价物品 虽然他或许没什么用
So even if that very magical dreamstone doesn't work, it's still a big-ass Ruby.

99
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:45,303
看来我只好接受你的不平等条约了
I'd be a poor sport indeed if I didn't accept your fair wager.

100
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:56,305
看来 你输定了
Hell Now, that's a losing hand for the ages.

101
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:59,306
看吧 我…
Now, read them and...

102
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:01,306
什么
What

103
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:04,307
你们地狱是不是没有眼科医生
Do they have an eye doctor in hell

104
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:06,307
如果我是你 我会去就医
I'd make an appointment if I was you.

105
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:07,727
你耍诈
You cheated!

106
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:14,898
从技术上讲 我们都出了千 只不过我更高明
Technically, we both cheated I just did it better.

107
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,899
我要杀了你
I'll rip your bloody heart out!

108
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,899
这我借用下
Sorry, mate, I'm using that.

109
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:39,313
杰森你最好还是召唤你另一面来帮我
Situation here, Jason It's time to call your better half.

110
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:42,314
抱歉 约翰 你自保吧
Sorry, John, you're on your own.

111
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:56,316
康斯坦丁 我要把你烤熟 然后吃掉
Oi, I'm gonna roast your nuts and feed them to you, constantine.

112
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:07,318
人形去
Gone, gone, the form of man.

113
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,319
恶魔伊特莱根 来
Arise the demon, etrigan!

114
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,320
这首押韵的诗
Once more with words of metered rhyme

115
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:21,321
再次召唤伊特莱根
comes etrigan the slayer just in time.

116
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:24,321
我们是一伙的 对吗
Easy now, brother We're on the same side, right

117
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:27,322
我们握手言和吧
Let's use our words.

118
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:30,323
你们在搞笑吗 我们可是一伙的
Are you having a laugh We're the demons three.

119
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,323
杀
Kill everyone!

120
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:44,325
你会付出代价的 康斯坦丁
You will pay, constantine.

121
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:47,326
你的灵魂是我们的
Your soul will be ours.

122
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:48,876
很多白痴都这么说
Get in line, you prats.

123
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:03,329
康斯坦丁
Your ass is grass, constantine.

124
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:06,329
我们会报仇的
And we're the lawnmower.

125
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,330
既然战斗已结束
Since the battle's fought and won,

126
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:13,331
我也该走了
Jason blood with me is done.

127
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,333
五百年来 我都在想办法封印他
For 500 years, I've been bound to etrigan,

128
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,634
甚至摆脱他
fighting to keep him from coming forth,

129
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:31,334
而你强迫我召唤他
and you forced me to summon him.

130
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,334
不是什么都没发生吗
Everything got sorted.

131
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,335
他可能会疯狂杀戮
He could have gone on a killing spree.

132
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:38,675
而你不考虑成这些
You don't think You don't consider the cost.

133
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,336
是的 我没有
Yeah, I did.

134
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,716
但我当时危在旦夕
Weighed it against my being eaten alive and thought, "yeah, totally worth it."

135
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,467
你是一个超级混蛋 约翰
You're a world class bastard, John.

136
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:18,343
最终
And for my finale,

137
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:24,894
我会让这几头大象在我们眼前消失
I will make this terrible trio of terrifying tantors vanish before your eyes.

138
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:54,349
我希望那些大象活了下来
I hope those elephants survived.

139
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,350
你不会想要动物组织来找你的
You don't want peta on your back.

140
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,350
他们又不是真的
You're assuming they were real in the first place.

141
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:02,351
你还好吗 布鲁斯
How are you, Bruce

142
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:05,351
我很好 扎塔纳 就是忙了点
I'm fine, zatanna Busy.

143
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:07,402
你知道我在哪里可以找到约翰·康斯坦丁
You know where I can find John constantine

144
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:09,353
不知道
No.

145
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:11,353
你一定有办法
You must have some idea.

146
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:13,113
我们不保持联系
We don't keep in touch.

147
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:15,353
我知道你们两个有情史 所以我…
I know you two have history, so I...

148
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:22,355
小扎 蝙蝠侠需要约翰
Z, Batman needs to talk with John.

149
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:24,355
肯定是重要的事
You've got to come along, too It's important.

150
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:26,156
是你吗 波士顿
Is that you, Boston

151
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,356
是的
Yeah.

152
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:29,356
一切都是…
Everything is...

153
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:30,356
这家伙的精神真强大
Boy, this guy's mind is tough.

154
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:33,357
我坚持不住了…
Can't hold...

155
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:39,358
这是怎么回事
What is going on

156
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:42,358
去找约翰的路上在详说
I'll tell you on the way to John's.

157
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:45,359
但我要坐前面
Okay, but I call shotgun.

158
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
这地方联一个孩子都坐不下
I don't even think his kid could fit back here.

159
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:54,571
波士顿 你必须适应
Sorry, Boston, but life is for the living.

160
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:57,621
波士顿 就是那个马戏团演员
Boston brand He was a circus performer.

161
00:14:57,622 --> 00:15:02,322
蝙蝠侠听说过我 告诉他我是他的粉丝
Batman's heard of me Sweet Tell him I'm a fan of his, too,

162
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:04,363
你明白怎么说的
but, you know, be cool about it.

163
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,363
是的 就是他
Yeah, that's him.

164
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:11,363
问下他有没有看过我的节目 他有一个受人欢迎的节目
Ask him if he caught one of my shows.He was a trapeze artist who loved being famous,

165
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:13,824
尤其受女性的欢迎
especially with the ladies.

166
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:16,075
男性就不一样了
Husbands, not so much.

167
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,365
你是在损我吗
You're killing me.

168
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:20,365
直到惹了一个不该惹的人
He had a knack for irritating the wrong people.

169
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:23,366
然后 大约五年前 报应来了
Then, about five years ago, Karma caught up with him.

170
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:30,367
在一个满席的周六秀上
It was a weekend show, full house.

171
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:34,368
波士顿被人枪杀了
Boston was in the middle of his death-defying act when...

172
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:04,374
他死了 本应当死了
He died, and that should have been that,

173
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:09,374
到了波士顿身上，事情却不一样了
but with Boston, things tend to get complicated.

174
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:14,675
女神罗摩给了他力量
His spirit was called by the goddess rama kushna.

175
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:18,386
让他得以精神状态存活
She took pity on him and gave him the power to possess the living,

176
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:21,377
这样他就可以行正义之事了
so he could bring his killer and others to justice.

177
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:23,377
嘿 我不想吹嘘 但我的技术真的很好
Hey, I don't wanna brag, but I'm good.

178
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:26,378
为什么他要像个小孩子一样在我墙上乱涂乱画
Why did he feel the need to write on my walls like a child

179
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:28,378
嗯 他很抱歉
Uh, yeah, he's sorry about that.

180
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:32,379
地址在哪里
Where is this address

181
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:35,379
GPS似乎今晚没什么有用
GPS doesn't seem especially useful tonight.

182
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,380
没有地址 神秘屋重来就不是固定的
It's not an address The house of mystery tends to move around.

183
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:43,391
之所以把信号放那
I didn't put the symbols in there for the GPS to find it.

184
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:46,381
是想要房子自己来找我们
I wanted the house to come to us.

185
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,392
她坚持不了多久 做点什么
She can't hold it Do something.

186
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:00,396
那里
There.

187
00:18:07,397 --> 00:18:08,397
快进房子
Into the house!

188
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
小扎 你还好吗
Z, you all right

189
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
是的 只要你别压着我
Yeah, as soon as you get off me.

190
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,530
早知道你们要来这
I should have known you were the reason

191
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:29,401
我就不回伦敦了
I'm not back in London enjoying a pint.

192
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,401
看来房子更喜欢你一点
The house always did like you better.

193
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,402
你们三个在一起还真古怪
Odd trio for a road trip.

194
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:36,742
你们有何贵干
To what do I owe the visit

195
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:39,403
正义联盟认为最近的杀人事件可能是受魔法的影响
The league thinks that a recent spike in homicides may have a magical cause.

196
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,744
我都跟你们说过了
Told you something stinks.

197
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:47,914
现在是某些人有所保留
Now we know someone doesn't want us asking questions.

198
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:50,405
你已经有什么线索了
Looks like you've cracked it wide open, mate.

199
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:52,075
他说了什么
What did he say

200
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:54,405
你们还是自己说吧
Uh-uh I'm not playing telephone between you two.

201
00:18:57,957 --> 00:18:59,407
他看到我了吧
We online

202
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:03,407
希望你的蝙蝠车
Great Sorry about the Batmobile.

203
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,708
购买了保险
I hope your insurance was paid up.

204
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,998
怎么 没有吗
What, is there even a policy for something like that

205
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:09,408
嗯
Mmm.

206
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:14,409
嘿 我告诉过你 不要这么做了 下次从门走进来行吗
Hey, I told you not to do that, orchid Use a bloody door.

207
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,040
我只是担心你
I am glad to see you are well.

208
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:20,501
这是新一任
How new is this one

209
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:23,081
不是
Not what you think.

210
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:25,411
她是这屋子的 灵
It's the magic of the house.

211
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:29,412
它想要跟人一样
Decided it wanted to experience humanity and gave itself a body.

212
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:30,422
它的确需要
It sure did.

213
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:37,413
精神存在 就像我一样
A spirit whose existence is not its own, like myself.

214
00:19:37,414 --> 00:19:39,414
有意思
Interesting.

215
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:44,464
嗯 是的 我们是
Um, yeah, we are that.

216
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:47,415
老兄 你已经死了
Dead smooth you are, mate.

217
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,176
嘿 我有一段时间没
Hey, it's been a while, you know

218
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:57,417
拥有强大的魔法力量 还在生约翰的气
Powerful in true magic Angry at John.

219
00:19:57,418 --> 00:20:00,418
这我知道
This, I understand.

220
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:04,418
但你仍对他有感情
Yet you still have feelings for him.

221
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,419
杀了他 还差不多
I could kill him.

222
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:17,421
你流露出痛苦
You exude pain.

223
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:22,421
你的生活是黑暗的 没有快乐
Your life is a patchwork of blackness with no time for joy.

224
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,422
你是怎么撑下来的
How do you cope with it

225
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:28,423
我有一个管家
I have a Butler.

226
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:33,424
这回答
That was enlightening.

227
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:38,975
嗯 我想我们应该聊正事了
Well, I guess we should have that chinwag about now.

228
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:44,426
- 恶魔  - 别
- Demons!  - It's not me!

229
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:50,427
我生出了魔鬼 我…
I've given birth to the devil. It's the...

230
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:53,637
这打破了命运之间的限制
Rama kushna says this will break down the walls between the planes.

231
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:55,768
甚至连来世也将受到影响
Even the afterlife will be affected.

232
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:59,428
是的 我马上去
Yeah, it's dodgy, all right I'll look into it.

233
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,429
我的意思是说 你们可以走了
Meanwhile, the house will drop you wherever you'd like.

234
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,430
哇 哇 哇 罗摩 你竟然说合作
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Rama says we have to work together.

235
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,430
来吧 这可是一个最牛的队
Come on! It's a dream team.

236
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,430
你 我 扎塔娜 蝙蝠侠 甚至正义联盟
You, me, zatanna, Batman, maybe even the justice league.

237
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:14,431
斗篷和紧身衣 对黑魔法没有作用
The capes and tights crew, useless against dark magic.

238
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:17,432
这就是为什么我们需要你带领我们
That's why we need you You can lead us.

239
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:22,433
波士顿 你要我们组团 而且还要我领导
Boston, do I strike you as a team player Much less a team leader.

240
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:25,433
问题是 就算是神也可能会出错
Point is, even deities can get it wrong.

241
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:29,064
所以我们才会得阑尾 还有 尼安德特人 电视真人秀
It's how we got the appendix, neanderthals and reality TV.

242
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:31,435
小扎 你帮我和他们说
Z, your help I could use.

243
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:34,435
好的 前提是我们成为一个团队
Okay, if we do it as a group.

244
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:39,436
这简直就是群尸玩过界
This is the monkey cage in sumatra all over again.

245
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:42,437
“哦 我们需要拯救这些猴子 ”她说
"Ooh, we need to save the monkeys," she said.

246
00:21:42,437 --> 00:21:44,437
你这个混蛋
You're such an ass.

247
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:47,148
哦 不只是猴子
Oh, not the monkeys.

248
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:50,438
这话出自造成纽卡斯尔事件而且
Says the man who has newcastle and 100 other screw-ups on his resume,

249
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,439
还经常捅娄子的人之口
costing lives and souls.

250
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:54,439
但我至少没害死人
But not monkeys You're still way ahead on dead monkeys.

251
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,029
- 他们的往事  - 嗯
- They used to be a thing  - Mmm.

252
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,440
你只会让事情…
You just have to make things...

253
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
我们在浪费时间…
We're wasting time.

254
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:02,491
他死了 我接受这样的意外
He's dead, and I accept the risks,

255
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:06,651
所以我们能到达 还是你们两个需要时间
so can we get to it, or do you two need a timeout

256
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:13,442
十全十美让我们走在黑暗的一面
Fine and dandy Let's take a walk on the dark side then.

257
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:18,444
来吧 伙伴们
Coming, team

258
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:27,155
你不再是一个孩子 慢下来
Stop being a child and slow down.

259
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:28,446
我们要去哪里
Where are we going

260
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:30,446
里奇家
Ritchie's.

261
00:22:30,446 --> 00:22:32,446
你最近和他说过话吗
Have you talked to him lately

262
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:34,446
我知道他很生气你不用提醒我 亲爱的
I know he's pissed You don't have to remind me, love.

263
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:36,447
这是我的经历 还记得吗
It's on my cv, remember

264
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:39,447
不 真的 他告诉你…
No, really, has he told you...

265
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:44,448
哦 不他快要死了
Oh, no He's dying.

266
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:47,449
约翰康斯坦丁
John constantine,

267
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:53,450
最后的救命稻草
purveyor of the dark arts and lifeline of last resort.

268
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,451
你朋友的灵魂我们一定会拿到手的
No matter Your friend's soul will be collected,

269
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:03,452
而你什么都做不了
and there's nothing you can do to alter that.

270
00:23:03,452 --> 00:23:07,452
你们不如换一个地方玩吧
Why don't you go do something useful, like haunt a house

271
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,453
他在跟谁说话
Who's he talking to now

272
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:12,453
类似无常的东西
Shrouds They deliver souls to hell.

273
00:23:14,454 --> 00:23:16,834
他们被你吸引了
They're drawn to you.

274
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:20,455
也许因为你身上的古龙水 batsy
Maybe it's your Cologne, batsy.

275
00:23:20,455 --> 00:23:24,125
这个家伙从总是死里逃生
This one has cheated us many times.

276
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:26,456
真是令人烦恼
It is vexing.

277
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:31,457
嘘…
Boo.

278
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:35,457
这有点 但你们该走走人了
This has been lovely, but it's time for you lot to bugger off.

279
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:42,459
当时候到了 我一定会收走你的灵魂 康斯坦丁
When the time comes, I'll be the one to collect your soul, constantine.

280
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,460
是 是
Yeah, yeah.

281
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,460
我想我感觉到有一股能量力场
I thought I felt a disturbance in the force.

282
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:53,461
你过的怎样 约翰尼
How you doing, Johnny boy

283
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:58,462
扎塔娜和 蝙蝠侠
Zatanna and Batman

284
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:02,303
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell

285
00:24:02,303 --> 00:24:04,463
进去再说
Tell you everything inside, mate.

286
00:24:12,465 --> 00:24:14,465
可怜的家伙
You poor thing.

287
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:17,806
我上次骗了你
Yeah, I may have lied the last time we talked,

288
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:21,466
关于我的病情的严重程度
about exactly how fast I'm sledding downhill.

289
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:23,467
我很抱歉
I'm sorry about that.

290
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:27,467
重要的是你来了 约翰
But it means a lot you're here, John.

291
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:32,468
嘿 你不需要把说对不起 我原谅你了
And, hey, you don't have to say it You're forgiven.

292
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:35,469
但是 蝙蝠侠来我这做什么
Still wondering what Batman's doing in my living room.

293
00:24:35,469 --> 00:24:37,469
我应该闭嘴是吗
And when is he gonna shut up, right

294
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,640
干嘛
What What's with the face

295
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:46,471
你不是来说对不起的 是吗
You're not here to say you're sorry, are you

296
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:47,931
当然 不是
Of course I am,

297
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:51,472
但我同时也想借卡香缇钥匙
but I was looking to borrow the keshanti key as well.

298
00:24:51,472 --> 00:24:54,272
你…
Unbelievable.

299
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:56,473
我跟他说过了
I tried to tell him on the way.

300
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:58,143
是的 这不是你的错
Yeah, it's not your fault, z.

301
00:24:58,144 --> 00:25:01,474
都是他的错
Just like everything, this is rock star Johnny's fault.

302
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:03,474
它发生的时候只有我和你 里奇
I was with you when it happened, ritchie.

303
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:05,475
我们肩并肩
We were side by side.

304
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:07,475
是的 是的 是的 肩并肩
Yeah, yeah, yeah, side by side.

305
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:12,475
我得了奇怪的魔法癌症 你而却扬名立万
But I got the weird magical cancer while you, you added to your rep.

306
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:14,476
不是吗
Isn't that right

307
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:17,477
听着 这是两码事
Look, me not making proper amends isn't related to the key,

308
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:19,647
而且 你也不需要了
which, truth be told, you're not gonna need, mate.

309
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:21,238
约翰
John!

310
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,479
最近这很频繁啊
Getting that a lot lately.

311
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:32,479
你自便 我不会帮忙的
You can go screw yourself I am not giving you crap.

312
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,480
我理解你的愤怒 但你
Your anger is understandable, but you need to reconsider.

313
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,481
要为大众考虑
Innocent lives are at stake.

314
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:52,483
好吧 医生说乐观的态度可以帮我改善病情
Well, doctors say an upbeat attitude can help,

315
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:57,484
而且重点是 我今天见到了蝙蝠侠
so what I'll focus on today is that I met Batman.

316
00:25:57,485 --> 00:25:59,405
正义的力量
Force of good.

317
00:25:59,405 --> 00:26:02,485
也很高兴见到你 扎塔娜
It was also nice seeing you, zatanna.

318
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:04,486
如果你们 没事了的话…
Now, if you'll excuse me...

319
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:10,487
就走吧
You can show yourselves out.

320
00:26:34,872 --> 00:26:36,492
是他吗
This him

321
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:42,492
年度最佳父亲 现在给我命运之轮
Father of the year I'll need the gear now.

322
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:45,493
这怎么用
How does this work

323
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:47,914
它是一个魔法通道
It's basically a magical shortcut.

324
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:49,624
直接连接平行世界
It lets me access different planes of existence

325
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:52,494
而不用大费周章
without doing 20-odd hours of incantations.

326
00:26:52,495 --> 00:26:57,255
现在 让我们看看 他经历了什么吧
In this case, I'll poke around this poor sod's memories to see how his madness began

327
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:02,496
更重要的是 为什么
and, more importantly, what caused it.

328
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,297
你们在这里做什么 我要去叫保安
What are you doing here I'm calling security.

329
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:13,298
我来确保这美眉不会坏事
I'll make sure the looky-loos stay out of our hair.

330
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:18,499
小扎 如果我这身体受到攻击 别忘了保护我
Z, give me a psychic shout if this body comes under attack.

331
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
我也可能被困在里面
Wouldn't do to be trapped inside, now.

332
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,090
你为什么非要一个人去
Wouldn't do to go in alone, and since I'm right here...

333
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:27,501
不行 太危险了
Too dangerous You're out of practice, love.

334
00:27:27,501 --> 00:27:29,801
你当我来这
Look, you wanted me along I'm here.

335
00:27:29,842 --> 00:27:33,092
是看戏的吗
I'm not waiting in the wings Let's do this.

336
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:01,967
小扎 你没事吧
Z You okay

337
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:03,508
我很好
I'm fine.

338
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:12,509
我不喜欢这里
I've never liked this sort of magic.

339
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,510
我能感觉到有黑暗要吞噬我
I can feel darkness seeping inside me.

340
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,310
我不知道你是怎么做的
How you stand it is beyond me.

341
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:22,511
如果你想出去的话…
It's all about control If you ever need a refresher...

342
00:28:22,512 --> 00:28:25,512
我们讨论过了 我不会放弃的
We've had this conversation I haven't changed my mind.

343
00:28:28,513 --> 00:28:31,513
那好 随你吧
Sure, sit out the war between good and evil.

344
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:35,513
毕竟 比你在马戏团的工作要好
After all, you've got a good thing going being applauded by mindless twits.

345
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:37,514
什么 现在说这个
Really Now

346
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,515
我认为我还是挺会挑时机的
Good a time as ever, I reckon.

347
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:42,855
- 敢顶嘴  - 不
- I'll teach you to talk back  - No!

348
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:46,516
我使用能让人们幸福的魔法
The magic I perform brings people happiness.

349
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,516
喝几杯不就行了
You sure it's not the two drink minimum, love

350
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:50,517
你真是一个悲观主义者
You're such a pessimist.

351
00:28:50,517 --> 00:28:54,517
没错 所以我总是做好最坏的打算
Wrong I expect the worst, so I prepare for the worst,

352
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:56,778
那样我就有所准备了
and when the worst happens, I'm ready.

353
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:00,518
我却无法不改变什么
But my outlook doesn't alter the reality of the world.

354
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,479
“史蒂文 别喝了”
Steven, stop!

355
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,519
“别管我”
Leave me alone!

356
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:05,819
又一个美好时光
Another precious moment.

357
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,520
也有快乐
There was joy, too.

358
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
但他的痛苦把一切都驱散了
His madness swept it away.

359
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:51,528
谁做的好事
Who dropped the bed pan

360
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:28,535
就是现在
This is it This was the morning of his madness.

361
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,535
你认为是什么把他变成那样的
What do you think will set him off

362
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:32,536
我猜是数独
My guess is the sudoku.

363
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:34,536
把他逼疯的
He's got two 9s in the same row.

364
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:36,206
约翰
John.

365
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:49,539
跑 快跑
Run! Run! Run!

366
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:51,539
快跑 离开这里
Run! Let's get out of here!

367
00:30:57,051 --> 00:30:59,541
老兄 你就不能减肥吗
Oh, come on, fellow Eat a piece of fruit, huh

368
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:11,543
该死的
Damn it!

369
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,554
这儿
Here it is.

370
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:19,686
我们必须离开这里
We've got to get out of here.

371
00:32:22,556 --> 00:32:23,556
再等会
One more second.

372
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:28,557
快走 约翰 没时间了
Now, John There's no time.

373
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:36,559
到手
Got it.

374
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:02,564
哦 史上最臭
Oh! Shit's really hit the fan.

375
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,564
你一定要说出来吗 波士顿
You had to go there, Boston.

376
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:07,444
我们离开这里
Let's get the hell out of here.

377
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:14,566
嗯
Hmm.

378
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,567
我不知道这是什么 我也是
I don't recognize it Me, neither.

379
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,567
也许里奇知道
But if there's a person alive who can, it's ritchie.

380
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,568
你忘记了你才刚伤害他
Are you forgetting when you made your friend despise you

381
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,568
无所谓了 这事情太重要了
This is too bloody important for hurt feelings.

382
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,570
康斯坦丁
Constantine.

383
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,570
该死
Bollocks.

384
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:40,571
你是来见证你的…
You've arrived in time to witness my...

385
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:44,571
里奇
Ritchie!

386
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:50,572
回来 你这混蛋
Get back, you bastards!

387
00:33:50,573 --> 00:33:52,373
约翰 先帮里奇
John, help ritchie.

388
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:56,574
看招
Take that! Boom!

389
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,124
没脉搏了
No pulse.

390
00:33:58,124 --> 00:34:00,414
废话 还不想办法
We know! We know! Come on!

391
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:17,577
什么
Why

392
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:25,579
看来你挺有办法的
I see you have a few tricks of your own, eh

393
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,089
又不是所有的事都需要魔法
Not everything requires magic.

394
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,583
他醒了 的话 让他看下
Make sure he sees that right when he wakes up.

395
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,583
如果他醒的了
If he wakes.

396
00:34:50,584 --> 00:34:52,584
我们需要谈谈 你和我
We need to talk, you and I,

397
00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:54,584
要是你敢召唤召唤
but if you try and summon etrigan,

398
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:57,585
我就会在你念第一个词时就把你揍的说不出话
I'll fill your lungs with bile before the first verse is done.

399
00:34:58,586 --> 00:34:59,586
明白吗
Savvy

400
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:09,587
其实情并非你们以为的那样
The situation was not how it seemed.

401
00:35:09,588 --> 00:35:13,588
我到那就是那样的
The apartment was like that when I arrived Richard as well.

402
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:15,588
谁信你的鬼话
Come on! You were all over him.

403
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:17,589
我是在帮忙
I was attempting to help.

404
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:21,049
你们突然出现 我怕你们误会
When you burst in, i knew I'd get blamed, so I ran.

405
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,590
你相信他吗
Do you believe him

406
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,590
我相信他
Jason's not the murdery type.

407
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,590
他满脑子都是些骑士道德什么的
He's chock full of honor, loyalty, and rubbish of that sort.

408
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:30,591
为什么你在那里
Then tell us why you were there.

409
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:35,592
理查德收集的东西杂七杂八
Richard is known as a collector of the arcane and supernatural.

410
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:40,592
我想看看他那里有没有什么东西能带我来这
I wanted to see if he had something that could gain me access to this place.

411
00:35:40,593 --> 00:35:42,433
为什么你要来这
Why would you wanna break in here

412
00:35:43,594 --> 00:35:45,594
为了这个
For this.

413
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:49,594
构成了与邪恶相连的通道
The single most powerful conduit of evil in the history of the world.

414
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:52,595
虽被称为梦幻之石
He named it the dreamstone,

415
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:55,596
实际上却是恶魔之石
but it's really the stuff of nightmares.

416
00:35:58,227 --> 00:36:01,227
那时我只是一个年轻的骑士
I was a young knight,green as grass.

417
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:04,977
对未来充满希望
With visions of battle-won glory dancing in my head.

418
00:36:04,978 --> 00:36:09,598
但一切都变了
Needless to say, these were dispelled thoroughly.

419
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:13,599
他称自己为天命
He called himself destiny,

420
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,600
但梅林告诉我们他之前
but Merlin told us he was a man of science one time,

421
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
只是一个普通人
before he went insane.

422
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:23,601
他用魔法 灵魂铸造了梦石
Destiny forged the dreamstone with black magic and his soul.

423
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:27,601
用它去吸收人们的负面情绪
He used it to subject people to their most terrifying nightmares

424
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,602
壮大他的力量
and then feed off their torment.

425
00:37:41,616 --> 00:37:44,616
那天是恶魔伊特莱根拯救的我们
It was actually the demon etrigan who won the day.

426
00:37:47,617 --> 00:37:49,617
伊特莱根 去战斗
To battle, etrigan.

427
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:52,617
你杀了他 我就还你自由
Should you succeed, i will release you of your bond to me.

428
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:55,618
我答应你
If freedom is what's up for trade,

429
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,619
为了自由而战
then destiny's as good as slayed.

430
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:36,625
梅林 没这么简单就结束
You haven't won, Merlin This isn't over.

431
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:37,626
我发誓
I swear it.

432
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:52,629
梅林 履行你的承诺
Release me, Merlin, from your care.

433
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:56,629
我做了我该做的
My duty's done 'Tis only fair.

434
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,760
恐怕不行 我的朋友
I'm afraid that's not possible, friend demon.

435
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:10,342
我向你们道歉
I apologize to both you and Jason blood,

436
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:14,632
你们今后将共生死
but your future portends a shared destiny.

437
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:21,634
以此凡躯
Caught now, imprisoned in the form of man,

438
00:39:22,635 --> 00:39:25,725
封印恶魔伊特莱根
I fix the demon, etrigan.

439
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:39,638
这同样是我
It was also the beginning

440
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:42,638
与伊特莱根的开始
of my eternal life sentence with etrigan.

441
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,639
没想到你放的这么随便
I didn't think you'd give it up willingly,

442
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,640
虽然它不是完整的
and though this piece is useless without the other half,

443
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
但仍有强大的力量
it's far from powerless.

444
00:39:55,641 --> 00:39:57,641
这里非常安全
Safe enough where it is.

445
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:00,151
就这么随便放
Displayed like a tourist trinket in a Karachi bazaar

446
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:03,642
很神奇 不是吗
Neat, isn't it

447
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:05,642
神秘屋会保护我那些贵重的物品
The house keeps my valuables out of phase,

448
00:40:05,643 --> 00:40:07,643
所以我不用担心
so they don't go wondering off.

449
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:10,643
这石头出现的过于巧合了
But, still, the timing of the stone's appearance and its power indicates

450
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:13,644
它肯定与这些事有关
that it's somehow involved with these crimes.

451
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:17,354
这就是为什么我把它放这了
Which is why it stays here, where only I can get to it.

452
00:40:17,405 --> 00:40:20,985
我想我 我们反正所有人都知道你会把东西放哪
I think me, them, and everyone else who knows you might want it to be somewhere else.

453
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:24,646
他醒了
Your friend is awake.

454
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:29,647
里奇 是谁 是谁干的
Ritchie, who was it Who did this to you

455
00:40:31,448 --> 00:40:33,648
浮士德
Faust.

456
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:35,648
费利克斯 浮士德你确定吗
Felix faust You sure

457
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:51,651
你在这啊 老混蛋
There you are, you old bastard.

458
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:56,651
我会把你揪出来的 菲利克斯浮士德
I give you wizard and asshole extraordinaire, Felix faust.

459
00:40:56,652 --> 00:40:58,162
该死 我早该想到这混蛋
Hell, I should have put it together.

460
00:40:58,163 --> 00:41:00,653
只有他会这么做
Conjuring a whirlwind is just his style.

461
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:04,653
联盟与浮士德斗过
The league had a run-in with faust,

462
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:07,574
但是他的位置并不在我们的数据库中
but his location isn't in our database.

463
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:11,654
恶魔又没有信用卡或社交媒体
Yeah, well, wizards don't make a habit of signing up for credit cards or social media.

464
00:41:11,655 --> 00:41:14,655
当然能躲过你们
His grandly named observatory of the cosmos is hidden

465
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:17,656
却躲不过我
from the likes of you and superman, but not from me.

466
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:22,657
费利克斯 浮士德
Felix faust.

467
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:34,659
怎么回事
What's happening

468
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,659
形象的比喻 就是死机了
If this were a computer, I'd say it's frozen.

469
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,040
没戏
Cheers.

470
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,660
费利克斯 浮士德肯定用了防定位法术
Felix faust would take precautions against locator spells.

471
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:46,661
那就换个办法
There's another way,

472
00:41:46,662 --> 00:41:50,372
但是有要去求人 还是讨厌我的人
but it involves asking a favor of someone that I don't have the best relationship with.

473
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:53,662
看来没人喜欢你 真令人震惊
Someone else dislikes you Shocking.

474
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,663
你朋友撑不了多久了
Your friend slips from the mortal plane.

475
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:57,663
约翰…
John...

476
00:41:57,664 --> 00:41:59,664
那就帮他
Keep him alive and safe Understand

477
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:01,664
这不是我的职责
That is not my purpose.

478
00:42:01,664 --> 00:42:04,664
我才不管这些
I don't give a flying shag what you think your bloody purpose is.

479
00:42:04,665 --> 00:42:07,665
我命令你去帮他 付出你的一切
I order you to help him any and every way you're able.

480
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:12,666
我们走吧
Let's go.

481
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,667
好吧 我想问
All right, I'll ask.

482
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:21,798
为什么我们要来这
Why are we in the middle of a godforsaken swamp

483
00:42:21,798 --> 00:42:25,668
因为亚历克荷兰在这
It's a favorite hidey hole of one Alec Holland,

484
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:29,669
他化身成了这里的植物
whose corpse was taken to be the most recent avatar of the green.

485
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,670
你们正联肯定没有这方面的记载
Bet you won't find that on your bloody cell phone.

486
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:34,010
我们的数据记载
Our data's more factual.

487
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,670
亚历克荷兰是被恐怖分子杀的 没有找到尸体
Alec Holland was murdered by terrorists His body was never recovered.

488
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,671
就这些
End of story.

489
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:39,671
其实没有
Not quite.

490
00:42:43,672 --> 00:42:47,672
走开
Go away!

491
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,975
沼泽怪物
Swamp thing!

492
00:42:59,975 --> 00:43:04,675
你不出来 我就把你烧出来
I know you're seeing this Get out here, or the posies get it!

493
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,678
约翰康斯坦丁
John constantine.

494
00:43:20,939 --> 00:43:24,679
你敢以植物威胁我
You dare threaten the green.

495
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:33,681
老兄 你的社交能力真差劲
Dude, your social skills are horrendous.

496
00:43:33,682 --> 00:43:38,682
别 我们来这 是因为一些重要的事
Please, we aren't here to harm any plants, but our need is urgent.

497
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,682
不要让约翰影响了你的判断
Don't let your feelings for John stop you from doing what's right.

498
00:43:45,684 --> 00:43:48,684
你有一个花园
You have a garden.

499
00:43:48,684 --> 00:43:54,685
是的 我在那放松 还每周浇水
Yes, I find it relaxing, and I water it every week.

500
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:59,355
我们需要找到一个人 他名叫费利克斯浮士德
We need to find a man, a wizard named Felix faust.

501
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:03,686
因你
A single human among your teeming masses.

502
00:44:03,687 --> 00:44:08,687
我放下对约翰·康斯坦丁的仇恨
I only know John constantine because he enrages me.

503
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:15,689
浮士德住在一座无形的天文台
Faust lives in an observatory which is invisible.

504
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:20,449
我们不知道怎么去
It's a place where dark magic would infect the earth below it.

505
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,690
我带你们去那儿
I will take you there so you are no longer here.

506
00:44:38,704 --> 00:44:42,694
到了
The place you seek is there.

507
00:44:54,697 --> 00:44:57,697
那个地方我们进不去
That place is heavily warded.

508
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:05,698
我知道我们有过分歧 但这次你一定要帮我
I know we've had our differences, but we could really use your help.

509
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:09,699
全人类的命运就在我们手中
If we don't get a handle on this rotter, he'll threaten all of humanity.

510
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,700
为什么
What of it

511
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,700
你曾经是人类 就像我一样
You were once human, just like me.

512
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:20,701
那又如何
No longer.

513
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:23,701
也许他要做他所谓正义之事
Perhaps his actions are a kind of justice,

514
00:45:23,702 --> 00:45:28,702
但人类就是正义的吗
for who destroys more of the green than your kind

515
00:45:34,704 --> 00:45:37,704
他走了
And swamp thing has left the building.

516
00:45:37,705 --> 00:45:39,705
有点难办
Guess we do it the hard way.

517
00:45:39,705 --> 00:45:44,665
人身去
Or not Gone, gone, the form of man.

518
00:45:44,706 --> 00:45:47,706
恶魔伊特莱根现身
Arise the demon etrigan!

519
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:11,711
搞什么…
What...

520
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:16,712
竟然敢
Who dares

521
00:46:16,712 --> 00:46:19,882
我要把你
I, etrigan, bring down this house

522
00:46:19,882 --> 00:46:22,712
埋葬 费利克斯浮士德
and build a tomb for Felix faust!

523
00:46:28,714 --> 00:46:30,924
我可不会与恶魔战斗
As if I would stoop to brawling with a demon.

524
00:46:30,925 --> 00:46:33,225
所以你还是与你的恶魔家人玩一玩吧
Fight others of your filthy kind.

525
00:46:44,717 --> 00:46:48,717
我们都来自地狱但他们不是我家人
From hell though we may be, it does not make us family!

526
00:47:09,722 --> 00:47:11,722
你喜欢这个设计吗
Do you like what I've done with the place

527
00:47:11,722 --> 00:47:15,722
没有女人能在我这念咒语
No woman can speak in my sanctum sanctorum.

528
00:47:15,723 --> 00:47:19,563
不，应该是所有人
I conjured it just for you and, of course, men everywhere.

529
00:47:32,776 --> 00:47:35,726
对于一个演员来说 这可不是待客之道
As a fellow showman, this is no way to treat your guests.

530
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,727
给我下来
Now, settle down!

531
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:49,728
别打自己 停下
Stop hitting yourself Stop hitting yourself Stop hitting yourself.

532
00:47:49,729 --> 00:47:52,729
不是所有问题都可以用你的玩具枪解决
Not everything can be solved with your peashooter.

533
00:47:56,731 --> 00:48:02,732
你以为你死了我就拿你没办法了吗
Just because you're dead doesn't mean you're beyond my retribution.

534
00:48:14,734 --> 00:48:17,734
是吗
Is that it

535
00:48:17,734 --> 00:48:20,734
你该束手就擒的
Well, it's off to the old magicians home for you, mate Pudding night is Thursday.

536
00:48:32,737 --> 00:48:36,737
我想看你把自己给烤熟 康斯坦丁
Try that fireball once more, constantine I'd love to see you cook your own goose.

537
00:48:36,738 --> 00:48:37,738
让我
Let me...

538
00:48:58,582 --> 00:49:00,742
收回我之前的话这玩具枪很有用
I take it back That thing is useful.

539
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,210
你在哪 亲爱的扎塔娜
Zatanna, where are you, darling

540
00:49:44,211 --> 00:49:46,751
让我猜猜你在哪
I know you can't speak, but give me a wave.

541
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,631
你是唯一一个对我有威胁的
You're the only one here that's really a threat.

542
00:49:56,753 --> 00:50:00,013
你在这啊
There you are This will sting a bit.

543
00:50:23,758 --> 00:50:28,758
存储魔法 这可不够
Stored magic Really It's the TV dinner of spell casting, dear.

544
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:33,759
见识真正的魔法吧
Here's what real magic looks like.

545
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,767
小扎
Z!

546
00:51:48,774 --> 00:51:50,774
小扎 不
Z, are you daft Stop!

547
00:51:52,945 --> 00:51:54,785
我会杀了你的
I will kill you, woman!

548
00:52:26,781 --> 00:52:28,081
小扎不
Z, don't!

549
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,782
你不能杀他
Don't kill him You can't.

550
00:52:34,782 --> 00:52:36,782
滚开 约翰
Out of my way, John.

551
00:52:36,783 --> 00:52:39,783
你的灵魂还是纯净的
If no blood is spilled, your soul is in the clear.

552
00:52:49,785 --> 00:52:52,785
小扎 平心静气 就像我说的
Get control, z, just like I taught you.

553
00:52:52,786 --> 00:52:56,746
吸气呼气
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy Deep breaths.

554
00:52:56,796 --> 00:52:58,786
放了他 亲爱的
Let it go, love.

555
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:23,791
我为什么不能像你一样释怀
Do you see why i can't do what you do

556
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:27,791
你只是失控了
You lost control is all Happens to the best of us.

557
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:29,792
你见过我失控 对吧
You've seen me in action, right

558
00:53:30,793 --> 00:53:34,793
是的 一两次
Yeah, once or twice.

559
00:53:35,794 --> 00:53:38,794
你们为什么这么对我 我什么
Why are you here I haven't done anything

560
00:53:38,794 --> 00:53:41,794
坏事都没做
to warrant this kind of response.

561
00:53:43,795 --> 00:53:45,795
这是不是你的
This yours

562
00:53:45,796 --> 00:53:48,796
也许吧
I don't know Maybe I have several hundred rings

563
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:51,796
我有几百个这种样式的戒指
of varying design and properties.

564
00:53:51,797 --> 00:53:53,797
不是他
It isn't him.

565
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,797
不是费利克斯 浮士德
Felix faust isn't the one behind the nightmare crimes.

566
00:53:56,798 --> 00:54:00,798
他能召唤强大的恶魔
He summoned our old poker buddies in their more massive forms.

567
00:54:00,798 --> 00:54:02,798
这什么意思
The hell does it all mean

568
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:06,799
意思就是他完全可以
It means Felix faust had access to the artifact whenever he wanted.

569
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
来攻击神秘屋
What artifact

570
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
好吧 一切白搞
Well, we're back to square one, then.

571
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,970
是吗 是你那位老朋友把我们引到这的
Unfortunately, no We were sent here by your friend, remember

572
00:54:15,011 --> 00:54:16,801
里奇快死了
But ritchie's dying.

573
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:18,801
是吗
Is he

574
00:54:42,806 --> 00:54:46,266
差点假戏真做
Boy, oh, boy I think I got closer to death than I planned.

575
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,807
不不不坏女孩
Ah! Nuh-uh-uh Bad girl.

576
00:54:50,808 --> 00:54:55,808
我现在是你的主人
See, now, you were told to do everything to help me by the master of the house,

577
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:57,809
你要对我尊敬
and that does not include punching.

578
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:02,359
带我去我主房间
Bring me to the main room.

579
00:55:07,361 --> 00:55:09,811
就这吧
I'll take it from here, beautiful.

580
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:14,812
但我现在需要你
But I need you out of my hair for now,

581
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:17,812
先去那里面呆会
so why don't you just go for a little walk

582
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:50,818
我们到了
Yeah! That's the stuff.

583
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:01,821
可为什么我们没在里面
Why aren't we inside

584
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:04,821
因为里奇现在控制着房子
Because ritchie's bloody well taken control of the house.

585
00:56:04,822 --> 00:56:06,912
这就是报应
This is what you get for having mates.

586
00:56:06,952 --> 00:56:08,822
波士顿 你能进去吗
Boston, can you get inside

587
00:56:14,823 --> 00:56:17,823
不能
That would be a no.

588
00:56:17,824 --> 00:56:21,244
里奇我不管你要闹咋样
Ritchie, you're gonna listen to me whether you like it or not.

589
00:56:23,825 --> 00:56:25,125
先让我进去
Open the door.

590
00:56:26,826 --> 00:56:27,826
你听到了吗 打开
Do you hear Open it!

591
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:37,827
你来太晚了 小约翰
Too late, Johnny boy.

592
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:55,831
里奇 不要
Ritchie, please!

593
00:56:55,831 --> 00:56:58,831
收手吧 趁你还有良知
Stop while there's still time to save your soul.

594
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,832
这话竟从你口中说出
Says the man who skates away from everything.

595
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:03,832
因为你
Since you got me infected,

596
00:57:03,832 --> 00:57:08,832
我只好满世界寻找解药 但终于被我找到了
I've looked all around the world for a cure and I've finally found it.

597
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:12,833
这块通灵的梦石
A small piece of the dreamstone It's sentient.

598
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:17,834
告诉我怎么把他拼全
It told me how to get the demons three to bring the rest of it to earth.

599
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:20,835
本来很简单的事
It would've been so easy to take it from them.

600
00:57:20,836 --> 00:57:25,836
你却非要插一脚
Of course, rock star Johnny screwed everything sideways.

601
00:57:25,837 --> 00:57:30,837
因此我就出此下策 并把你们的注意力引开
So we had to frame faust and get you to bring me here.

602
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:34,838
现在我成功了
Now I'm immortal and supercharged!

603
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:38,838
你被这块所谓通灵石给耍了
You've been played for a sap The stone isn't sentient.

604
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:42,839
是恶魔天命对你的利诱
What's left of destiny's soul was whispering sweet nothings in your ear,

605
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,840
以便于让他成就大业
getting you to commit atrocities to gain power and make his move.

606
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:49,801
你只是气我赢了
You're just pissed 'cause I won.

607
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:50,841
不是啊
I wish that were the case.

608
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,852
不可能
This can't be right.

609
00:57:56,842 --> 00:57:57,842
不
No!

610
00:58:01,843 --> 00:58:04,843
等等 等等 我们…我们有协议的
Wait! Wait! We.. We had a deal!

611
00:58:06,844 --> 00:58:08,844
我们有协议的
We had a deal!

612
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:21,847
我等了五百年
Five hundred years, I've waited.

613
00:58:23,847 --> 00:58:26,847
计划了五百年
Five hundred years, I've planned.

614
00:58:28,848 --> 00:58:31,848
你看起来没变多少
Really I guess 500 must be the new 300.

615
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:34,849
要不我们喝一杯
What say we share your beauty secrets over a pint, eh

616
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:37,849
我没兴趣
A god does not prattle with mortals.

617
00:58:57,524 --> 00:58:58,854
她还好吗
She gonna be okay

618
00:58:58,854 --> 00:59:01,854
我…我不知道
I.. I don't know.

619
00:59:01,854 --> 00:59:03,854
她的魔力用尽了
The amount of magic she's used,

620
00:59:03,855 --> 00:59:05,855
一时不能恢复
sometimes you don't recover.

621
00:59:11,856 --> 00:59:13,856
我不应该让她过这样的生活
I should have never led her back.

622
00:59:13,857 --> 00:59:15,857
我真是一个自私的混蛋
Selfish bastard, I am.

623
00:59:15,857 --> 00:59:17,857
事已至此
You've done what you can for now,

624
00:59:17,857 --> 00:59:21,197
我们只能去阻止天命
but we have to stop destiny, or everyone's at risk.

625
00:59:21,238 --> 00:59:23,488
他说的没错
He's right.

626
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:26,779
午夜前他就会成神
He'll have this city by midnight, the eastern seaboard by dawn.

627
00:59:26,779 --> 00:59:29,859
到了那时就没有人能阻止他了
Then, what's to stop him He'll be a god.

628
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,860
有我一个混蛋就够了
We don't need another one of those mucking about.

629
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,860
好吧
All right.

630
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:15,868
阻止他们
Get them!

631
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:19,868
怎么阻止 他们无处不在
They're everywhere! Everywhere!

632
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:24,870
我宏愿将成
My will be done.

633
01:00:30,871 --> 01:00:34,381
愚蠢 你怎么可能打败一个神
Fool! How can you hope to defeat a god

634
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,872
我能轻易的蹂躏你 你却连我的护盾都打不破
Not only can I sense you, you cannot defeat my shield.

635
01:00:37,872 --> 01:00:40,872
神什么时候需要一个能量盾
Since when does god need a force shield

636
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:54,875
正义联盟在来的路上
The justice league are on their way.

637
01:00:54,876 --> 01:00:56,876
他们不该来的
Suppose that couldn't be helped,

638
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:59,636
让他们远离他 不然他们
but make sure they stay well away from destiny,

639
01:00:59,636 --> 01:01:01,876
会被影响的
to not be struck mad,

640
01:01:01,877 --> 01:01:04,877
我可不想他们乱上加乱
unless you want a bunch of crazed super blokes ripping apart the city.

641
01:01:07,878 --> 01:01:10,138
说的有点晚了 朋友
A little late for that, my friend.

642
01:01:26,882 --> 01:01:28,882
约翰 你中了魔法
John, listen to me. You've been affected by magic.

643
01:01:31,882 --> 01:01:33,882
现在就飞回太空”
Get away to space now.

644
01:01:47,015 --> 01:01:49,015
杰森 又要你帮忙了
Sorry to have to ask this, Jason.

645
01:01:49,016 --> 01:01:50,886
至少你还咨询了我的意见
At least you're asking.

646
01:01:51,886 --> 01:01:54,886
人形已去
Gone, gone, the form of man.

647
01:01:54,887 --> 01:01:58,887
恶魔起
Rise the demon etrigan!

648
01:01:58,887 --> 01:02:02,887
又是你 康斯坦丁
So constantine calls once more.

649
01:02:02,888 --> 01:02:04,888
你还真是麻烦
Just like a greedy, wanton...

650
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:07,099
等会再说
Save the bloody rhymes, and top that git!

651
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,889
令人扫兴
Killjoy.

652
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:17,440
伊特莱根 好久不见
I've had many years to think about you, etrigan.

653
01:02:28,603 --> 01:02:30,483
称之为诗意的正义
Call this poetic justice.

654
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:46,896
该死
Holy crap.

655
01:02:52,898 --> 01:02:55,898
看来你终于摆脱了诅咒
Looks like you've finally beat the curse, my boy.

656
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:57,898
虽然过程不是很美好
Wish it were under happier circumstances.

657
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:00,899
你在做什么
What are you doing

658
01:03:00,899 --> 01:03:02,899
找人帮忙
Calling for help.

659
01:03:02,899 --> 01:03:05,899
希望他不知道是我召唤的
I just hope he doesn't realize it's me doing the calling.

660
01:03:21,413 --> 01:03:23,903
谁竟敢攻击我
Who dares strike at me

661
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:30,904
植物保护者 沼泽怪物
The defender of the green, swamp thing.

662
01:03:50,908 --> 01:03:51,908
做的好
Perfect.

663
01:04:03,911 --> 01:04:05,911
很高兴你没事 扎塔娜
Glad to see you back on your feet, zatanna.

664
01:04:13,913 --> 01:04:15,913
无论你要做什么 赶快
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

665
01:05:04,922 --> 01:05:06,882
所谓的保护者
The so-called guardian of the green

666
01:05:06,883 --> 01:05:08,923
却是为了人类
who secretly hopes to be human again.

667
01:05:09,923 --> 01:05:12,633
让我矫正你的观念
Let me dispel you of that notion.

668
01:05:28,927 --> 01:05:30,927
让你的心灵净化
Back to the dirt,

669
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:33,927
回到属于你的地方
where you belong.

670
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:48,930
他越来越强大了我们怎么办
He's getting more powerful by the second What the hell are we gonna do

671
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,930
我说我们去和他谈谈
I say we go and talk to a man about a horse.

672
01:05:51,931 --> 01:05:53,931
你脑子坏了 胡说什么
Did you hit your head or something You're babbling.

673
01:05:53,931 --> 01:05:56,141
一个特洛伊木马 波士顿来吧
A trojan horse, Boston Come on!

674
01:05:58,932 --> 01:06:00,932
这里 废物
Over here, you wanker!

675
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:07,933
你这无耻的人类
You are puny and disrespectful.

676
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:09,934
让我看看你有什么本事
Let me see your madness.

677
01:06:16,936 --> 01:06:19,936
看来对我这种人 你也没有什么办法
Well, that's the trouble with someone like me Been there, done that.

678
01:06:19,936 --> 01:06:23,646
我赐你一死
I shall make you beg for death.

679
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:25,937
我可以求你别唧唧歪歪了吗
Can I beg you to stop talking

680
01:06:25,937 --> 01:06:28,937
我的意思是你是个疯子 我才不会听疯子唧唧歪歪
I mean, all wizards are touched, but you, you're a full-blown nutter.

681
01:06:28,938 --> 01:06:32,938
我要撕裂你的灵魂
I will tear your soul apart.

682
01:06:32,939 --> 01:06:35,939
不是不屑和凡人闲聊吗
And what happened to not prattling with mortals, eh

683
01:06:35,939 --> 01:06:37,939
怎么现在比我奶奶还啰嗦
You chatter like my grandma at a book club.

684
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,940
就是现在 波士顿
Now, Boston!

685
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,320
不给糖就捣蛋 怪物
Trick or treat, freak!

686
01:07:02,944 --> 01:07:05,944
你是在跟我打招呼吗 还是你快死了
Is that a sword in your chest, or are you just glad to see me

687
01:07:06,945 --> 01:07:09,945
梅林向你问候
Merlin sends his regards.

688
01:07:09,945 --> 01:07:13,035
哦 顺便说一下 你输了
Oh, and by the way, you lose.

689
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,950
我会让你得逞吗
I don't think so.

690
01:07:54,954 --> 01:07:56,954
约翰 我…
Johnny, I was...

691
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:59,954
你要救我

692
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:03,005
这是你欠我的 你欠我的

693
01:08:03,005 --> 01:08:06,955
抱歉 老兄 天命不可违

694
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:11,956
约翰 救我

695
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:22,338
救我 你这个混蛋

696
01:08:22,339 --> 01:08:25,089
救我

697
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,960
这场面可真让人不愉快
That was unpleasant.

698
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,960
我错过了什么
What the hell did I miss

699
01:08:30,961 --> 01:08:34,381
小扎 你没事了 我还…
Z, you're okay I thought...

700
01:08:34,421 --> 01:08:36,961
我头疼的就像宿醉了
My head feels like the morning after Brixton.

701
01:08:38,962 --> 01:08:39,962
不至于这么糟吧
Surely not that bad.

702
01:08:41,963 --> 01:08:45,963
所以我们自由了
So Merlin's spell hath ended.

703
01:08:45,963 --> 01:08:47,963
没错
It would seem so.

704
01:08:47,964 --> 01:08:50,964
事情要这么美满就好了
thought it's s good news sort of thing

705
01:09:02,967 --> 01:09:05,967
- 怎么了  - 他之前没受伤
- What's going on  - Yeah He wasn't wounded.

706
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:09,967
也许是在他与伊特莱根捆定的那一天受伤的
Unless I miss my guess that happened on the dayhe was bound to etrigan.

707
01:09:11,968 --> 01:09:13,968
现在我
And now that I'm not...

708
01:09:13,969 --> 01:09:16,969
我无能为力 杰森
I'm truly sorry, Jason.

709
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:19,969
这是我希望的结局
Don't be It's a welcome end.

710
01:09:32,972 --> 01:09:36,972
五百年来 我们同为一体
For 500 years, he and I have been bound.

711
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:40,973
我们种族不同
A demon from hell, a knight of renown.

712
01:09:40,974 --> 01:09:44,974
不喜欢彼此
Though we were cursed to be slaves to each other,

713
01:09:44,974 --> 01:09:48,974
离别才知我们心已系
I know of no man I'd want more for a brother.

714
01:09:49,855 --> 01:09:50,975
安息吧
Farewell, mortal.

715
01:10:06,978 --> 01:10:09,978
没有比他出生地更适
You couldn't have picked a better place.

716
01:10:09,979 --> 01:10:11,979
合安葬他的地方了 他家就在不远
The villagewhere he was bornwas over there.was born was over there.

717
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:14,149
处 却只能以这种方式归家
Too bad it took this to get him home.

718
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:18,440
蝙蝠侠邀请我加入正联
Batman asked me to be in the justice league.

719
01:10:19,981 --> 01:10:20,981
所以 你还在考虑
And you're considering it

720
01:10:20,981 --> 01:10:23,981
我几天前去了那
I visited their headquarters a few days ago.

721
01:10:23,982 --> 01:10:26,742
就像你说的那么有趣
It's interesting, and like you said,

722
01:10:26,742 --> 01:10:28,982
也许是时做些改变了
maybe it's time to make a difference.

723
01:10:28,983 --> 01:10:31,983
这你倒听我了
Listening to me now Uh-oh.

724
01:10:31,983 --> 01:10:33,783
他们还邀请你
They want you, too.

725
01:10:35,984 --> 01:10:37,984
是啊 没错
Good one, z Too right, they do.

726
01:10:41,245 --> 01:10:44,985
你一定在开玩笑吧
You have got to be bloody kidding No way.

727
01:10:44,986 --> 01:10:46,986
小蝙蝠侠一定会被我烦死的
Batty would go mental.

728
01:10:46,986 --> 01:10:50,986
他邀请的你 而且你的反应如我所料
He was the one who asked, and I told him that's what you'd say.

729
01:10:53,987 --> 01:10:54,987
保重 约翰
Be safe, John.

730
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:10,990
不 等下 等下
Now, hold on Hold on.

731
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,990
我拒绝的太仓促了
Maybe I've been a bit rash.

732
01:11:12,991 --> 01:11:14,991
要不我们边喝边聊
Could you tell me more over a drink

733
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,991
就当庆祝新居
We could rechristen the house, as it were.

734
01:11:19,992 --> 01:11:20,992
喝一杯
A drink

735
01:11:20,992 --> 01:11:22,992
就一杯
Yeah, a drink.

736
01:11:26,993 --> 01:11:30,993
别认为还会和上次一样
Don't think this is gonna turn into some sort of Manchester weekend.

737
01:11:30,994 --> 01:11:33,994
别想
Get that out of your head.

738
01:11:33,995 --> 01:11:35,995
但可以有一个特尔瑞德周四
We could have a trewhiddle Tuesday.

739
01:11:35,995 --> 01:11:38,995
不可能
No, definitely not.

740
01:11:38,996 --> 01:11:40,996
走的瞧
Well, let's mark that as a maybe.

741
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
亲爱的 这就是享受啊
Now, that's what I call making yourself useful, love.
