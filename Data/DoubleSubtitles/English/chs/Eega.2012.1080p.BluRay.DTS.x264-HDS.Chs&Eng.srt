好吧…
Okay...

22
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,530
在很久很久以前 有一位国王…
Once upon a time in a place, there lived a King...

23
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,770
国王有七个儿子
The King had seven sons

24
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,540
他们出去狩猎 然后带回来七条大鱼
and they went to hunt and brought seven fishes,

25
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,640
这个故事已经讲过很多次了 爸爸！
it's very old story, father!

26
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,970
听都听烦了 爸爸
Got bored hearing it many a times, father.

27
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,310
给我讲个新故事吧 爸爸 给我讲个新故事吧
Tell me some new story. Father, tell me a new story.

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,150
别在我耳边像只小蜜蜂似的
Don't buzz like a bee

29
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,790
嗡嗡吵个不停…
in my ear...

30
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,960
等一下…
wait...

31
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,620
你想听个新故事 是吗？
You want a new story, right?

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,220
很久很久以前
Once upon a time in place,

33
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,830
有一只小苍蝇…
there lived a Fly...

34
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,970
苍蝇！？继续…
Fly!? Carry on...

35
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,660
和小苍蝇住在一起的还有一个坏人…
ln the same place along with the Fly there lived a bad boy...

36
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,440
坏人？他叫什么名字？
Bad boy? What's his name?

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,640
他的名字叫苏迪普！
Sudeep!

38
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,150
这边正开着董事会呢 而你却在这里…
Board meeting is going and you are here...

39
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,940
无聊的会议而已！
Bore meeting!

40
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,110
我已经竭尽全力了！
l tried a lot!

41
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,830
官员并没有按照我们的想法行事
Officer is not coming our way,

42
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,150
我用不用把他干掉？
shall l bump him off?

43
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,390
你为什么总是如此崇尚暴力呢？
Why are you so violent always?

44
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,720
这么说你倒是希望和平解决问题了
And you're an epitome of peace.

45
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,410
你每天都来这里吗？
Do you come here every day?

46
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,620
希望我每天都来吗？
Want me to come?

47
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,560
- 什么时间？ - 一切随你！
- What time?  - Your time!

48
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,680
有什么新的作品吗？
Doing anything new?

49
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,140
过来看看！
Take a look!

50
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,250
不错！那是什么？
Good! What's that?

51
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,050
真的吗？我还想在中间镶嵌一颗心！
What good? l'm trying to unite a heart in it!

52
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,490
但是不管怎样都不令我满意
But l'm not satisfied.

53
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,320
如果我和你哥哥能够团聚的话 你就会满意了
Better try to unite me with your brother, you'll get satisfaction.

54
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,990
我住在这里 而他却住在迪拜！
l'm here and he's in Dubai!

55
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,970
快睡觉吧 都晚上十点了！
Go to bed, it's 10 pm!

56
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,980
嫂子 只有几户人家停电了
Sister-in-law, power is shut only in few homes.

57
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,640
麻烦你给供电局打个电话
Please dial electricity office.

58
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,290
他们竟然给按时交电费的用户断电
They cut the power of those who pay bills on time.

59
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,090
你把这些都倒出来干什么？
Why are you pouring it out?

60
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,360
我在问你话呢 纳尼！
l'm asking you, Nani!

61
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
你在做什么？
What man?

62
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,340
你疯了吗？
Have you gone mad?

63
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,270

73
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,830
你怎么还能笑着面对这一切？
How can you still smile?

74
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,030
到现在为止 你已经为她痴迷整整两年了！
You've been after her madly for 2 years now!

75
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,640
她会在意你的关心么？
Did she care to look back at you?

76
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,560
你煞费苦心地为她照亮房间
You took trouble to light her room,

77
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,110
她连最起码的感谢都没有？
did she at least thank you?

78
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,640
她是因为爱我才拉上窗帘的
She drew the curtains down for the love she has for me.

79
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,370
- 是吗？ - 是的！
- What?  - Yes!

80
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,210
如果她不拉窗帘的话
lf she doesn't,

81
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,710
她就会知道我将站在这离彻夜不眠
she knows l'll keep awake all night here.

82
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,790
黑暗 迷雾 寒冷 她可不忍心看我病倒
Darkness, fog, chill, she can't bear to see me falling sick.

83
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,890
这就是原因 尽管她不希望如此
That's why, though she doesn't like it,

84
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,020
却还是情不自禁拉上窗帘
she closed it against her will.

85
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,580
我们名单上面的客户…
Our guest list...

86
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,610
他拒绝和我们签订合同
He refuses to sign our files

87
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,390
却还来参加我们的派对！

88
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,260
绵薄之意 不成敬意！

89
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,410
感谢您为派对带来活力！

90
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,560
顺便说一句

91
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,880
我的夫人卡拉也来了！

我们一度绞尽脑汁想尽一切办法
We were breaking heads

101
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,890
希望能够搞定他…
how to bring him to our line...

102
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,630
你被他的老婆迷住了吗？
Did you charm his wife?

103
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,070
有哪个女人不会爱上你？
ls there any woman who will not fall for you?

104
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,140
倒是有一个！
There is one!

105
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,140
我的老婆！
My wife!

106
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,280
我对她一见钟情 到手之后却想甩了她
l fell for her at first sight and wanted to leave after having her.

107
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,620
但是后来我看上了她的财富！
But later on my eyes fell on her wealth!

108
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,590
于是我娶了她

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,260
我让她交出财产 她说除非我死了！

120
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,880
我们为了募集善款支出的费用
We're spending more to collect it

121
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,440
比他们捐赠的还要多得多！

122
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,280
这就是我来这里的原因！

Please keep my donation a secret. l hate publicity!

126
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,360
什么？匿名捐赠？
What? Secret donation?

127
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,240
这就是我没有签支票的原因！
That's why l didn't even sign my cheque!

128
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,070
没有签名的支票是无法兑现的

129
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,340
作为捐款人 我想知道

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,180
能麻烦您告诉我吗？
will you please tell me?

132
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,150
你想要银行为你区区十五卢比的捐款
Do you want bank balance sheet

133
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,050
开具存款证明吗？

134
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,060
真应该让她立刻闭上嘴巴！
Must cut her to size immediately!

135
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,360
比起披肩发 你把头发扎起来会更美
You'd look better if you tie your hair instead of letting it down.

136
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,500

440
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:39,210

现实生活中也会的 先生
lt happens in real life too sir.

469
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:46,650
我奶奶说的！
My grandma said!

470
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,760
好像是有条眼镜蛇王报复过我爷爷
lt seems a King Cobra took revenge on my grandpa.

471
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:51,720
不是的 是更小的动物！

472
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,160
更小的蛇也会报复的

473
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,160
- 其它的…  - 再小的蛇也报复人的
- Others...  - Smaller snakes too take revenge.

474

不是蛇！更小的… 像是麻雀啊！
Not snakes! Smaller ones...like sparrow!

475

01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,680
要是蛇能的话 为什么苍蝇不能呢？
lf snakes can, why not flies?

479
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:18,280

我应该和谁探讨一下这个问题呢？
With whom should l share this problem?

481
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,950
我还能告诉谁呢？

490
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,260
只是个小小的推测而已
A small doubt.

491
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,920
苍蝇会特别地针对某个人
Do flies target humans

492
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,900
然后施行报复行为吗？
specifically?

493
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,920
我的意思是
l mean

494
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,040
记住某个人然后有计划地施行报复行为
remember humans and attack with a plan.

495
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,780
您是打算写科幻小说吗 先生？
Planning to write science fiction, sir?

496
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,580
这是真事 不是科幻小说
This is a fact not science fiction.

497
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:45,780
有一只苍蝇不让我吃饭
A fly is not letting me to eat,

498
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,830
不让我睡觉 不让我好好地活着
sleep or live peacefully.

499
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:50,930
这次的车祸也是它的杰作！
This accident too is its handiwork!

500
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:54,030
它在玻璃上写着 我要杀了你
lt wrote 'l will kill you' on the windshield.

501
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,330
这是科幻小说吗？
ls it science fiction?

502
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,200
您说自己整晚没有睡觉
You said you didn't sleep all the night.

503
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,770
您的压力太大了
Already you're highly stressed,

504
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:02,040
然后车祸就自然而然地发生了
accident happened then,

505
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:05,150
同时一只苍蝇扰乱了您的生活
and a fly too disturbed you at the same time.

506
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:09,150
因此您就觉得是那只苍蝇的问题
You'd have imagined fly was responsible for it in that stress.

507
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,380
您需要精神病医生的帮助
You need a psychiatrist's help.

508
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:20,290
你的阳寿还未尽！
You're not yet done with!

509
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:31,900
过来！
Come!

510
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:34,600
走开！
Go away!

511
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,870
为什么现在就到我这儿来了呢？
Why would you come to me now?

512
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,710
保险箱和火柴盒！
Safe locker and match box!

513
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,980
当你的脸被煤烟模糊 你就会来到我这儿了
When your face gets smeared by soot, you'll come to me.

514
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:55,860
你他妈的谁啊？
Who the hell is he?

515
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,140
这是幻觉吗？
ls it imagination?

516
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,680
宾都 来吃饭
Bindu, come for dinner.

517
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:59,320

You know Nani will not come back,

520
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,170
你要活在他的回忆里面多久呢？

521
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:19,080
就像这个坏掉的吊坠一样 忘了他吧

才能入住我们的公寓

672
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:59,620

675
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,060
这是什么鬼话？
What's this nonsense?

676
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,540
难道这次董事会和电视节目

677
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:23,040
要讨论怎么消灭苍蝇和蚊子？

678
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,680
驱蝇剂效果不明显！
Repellent is not effective!

679
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:33,780
我就知道 驱蝇剂根本没什么效果
l know that repellents are not effective on flies.

680
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:35,350
你…
Hey you...

681
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:47,630
你怎么了 先生
You don't feel bad sir.

682
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:02,780
我会自己清理的
l'll clean it myself.

683
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:09,750
打电话给委员
Get me the Commissioner on line.

684
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:15,390
听我说 你们可以立刻搜查这里吗？
l'll give you a tip, can you raid immediately?

685
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:20,230
先生 我们的处境很尴尬
Sir, we're in a soup,

686
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:22,800
米凯什已经给税收专员打电话了
Mukesh has called lncome Tax Commissioner.

687
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:25,130
- 他说要搜查我们这里  - 什么？
- He gave him a tip of raiding us.  - What?

688
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:27,400
所有的钱都在办公室里面
Entire cash is in office.

689
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:53,020
安全锁和火柴盒！
Safe locker and match box!

690
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:57,460
如果烟灰弄脏了你的脸 要记得来找我
When your face gets smeared by soot, you'll come to me.

691
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:26,150
你的话成真了 我现在一无所有了
l lost everything, your words have come true.

692
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:12,390
你在这里埋下了死亡的种子！
Seed for your death was sown here!

693
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:29,910
我就是在这儿杀了纳尼！
l killed Nani here!

694
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,950
纳尼…苍蝇…
Nani...fly...

695
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:37,480
纳尼重生变成了一只苍蝇！
Nani is reborn as fly!

696
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:47,030
离宾都远点儿！否则 我杀了你！
Stay away from Bindu! l'll kill you!

697
01:41:57,710 --> 01:42:00,680
你说得对 纳尼就是那只苍蝇…
You're right, Nani is the fly...

698
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,740
现在我该怎么办？
What should l do now?

699
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:08,390
立刻献上祭品！
Conduct a sacrifice immediately!

700
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:29,520
快看！它被困住了！
Look there! lt's stuck!

701
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:31,570
做点儿什么啊！
Do something man!

702
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:34,810
快点念咒语啊！
Chant some hymns!

703
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:37,650
念咒语啊！把门打开！
Put motifs! Open the door!

704
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:41,190
咒语也没有办法使门打开啊
There are no hymns to open the shut door.

705
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:26,670
离宾都远点儿！否则 我杀了你！
Stay away from Bindu! l'll kill you!

706
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:31,610
我 杀 了你！
l-W-l-L-L-K-l-L-L-Y-O-U!

707
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:30,800
我要是再晚来一分钟 你就死定了
lf l was a minute late, you'd be dead by now.

708
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:36,400
这些巫术是怎么回事？
What's this nonsense with witchcraft?

709
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:38,130
这儿发生什么事了？
What's going on here?

710
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:41,950
那么 那个死人是谁？
Okay, who is that dead man?

711
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,080
密宗！
Tantra!

712
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:46,110
他来这儿干什么？
Why did he come here?

713
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:48,180
消灭那只苍蝇！
To kill the fly!

714
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:49,830
苍蝇…苍蝇…
Fly...fly...

715
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:51,450
你为什么这么在意苍蝇？
what's this madness about flies?

716
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:53,990
你连一只笨苍蝇都怕吗？
Are you scared of a silly fly?

717
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:58,030
什么笨苍蝇？你知道它有多大能耐吗？
What silly fly? Do you know its capacity?

718
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:01,320
你去杀了它！你要是个男人
You kill it! lf you're a man,

719
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:02,670
就去杀了它 我会看着的
kill it, l'll watch it.

720
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:03,890
杀了它！
Kill it!

721
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:07,000
你疯了！
You've lost your mind!

722
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:09,440
我只是实话实说而已
l'm telling you the truth.

723
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:13,710
那只苍蝇就是纳尼 就是我杀死的那家伙
That fly is Nani, the man l killed.

724
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:17,440
就是他！他重生变成了苍蝇
lt's him! He's reborn as fly!

725
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:22,020
它不仅制造了那场车祸 还烧了我们的钱
That fly created that accident and burnt our cash.

726
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:25,590
为了不让它进来 我把房间布置得严防死守
l made foolproof arrangements to keep it out of home.

727
01:49:26,490 --> 01:49:28,820
我连换气孔都没留
l didn't let even a pinhole open for air also to enter,

728
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:31,490
但那只苍蝇还是进来了…
but that fly comes in from somewhere...

729
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:50,940
发生了什么事？
What happened?

730
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:19,170
这只苍蝇居然带了面具和武器…
A mask and weapons for the fly...

731
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,840
宾都松开了螺丝
Bindu is unscrewing it.

732
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:32,120
你说得对！
You were right!

733
01:50:33,090 --> 01:50:34,250
那只苍蝇就是纳尼！
Nani is the fly!

734
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:40,200
老兄 对不起！我刚才还在怀疑你
Sorry buddy! l didn't believe you.

735
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:50,530
我们现在知道宾都和那只苍蝇是一伙儿的！
We know Bindu is an accomplice of the fly!

736
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:52,340
干掉他们并不难办
lt's not big deal to finish them off.

737
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:53,770
我会小心的
l'll take care of it.

738
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:56,810
但是 我们先得阻止那群准备撤资的家伙们
Before that we must stop the investors

739
01:50:56,810 --> 01:50:57,910
他们会毁了我们的
who are hell bent on ruining us.

740
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,020
如果我们明天还不退钱
lf we don't pay by tomorrow,

741
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:01,450
他们就要上法庭起诉我们了
they'll go to the court.

742
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:03,850
先想想这个该怎么办
Think about that first.

743
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,390
要是我们当中有人死了会怎么样？
What if one of our partners dies?

744
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:10,550
那合同就自动失效了
Contract will get cancelled.

745
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:16,260
保险公司还会赔付我们七百亿卢比
Moreover we'll get Rs.700 crores from insurance.

746
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:21,230
你在胡说些什么？你难道会自杀吗？
What are you saying? Will you commit suicide?

747
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:03,120
你在哪儿？
Where are you?

748
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,410
想跟我玩捉迷藏吗？
Playing games with me?

749
01:52:08,990 --> 01:52:09,650
好吧
Okay.

750
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:36,640
你怎么这么惊奇？
Why are you so shocked?

751
01:52:38,150 --> 01:52:40,620
我突然过来 吓到你了吗？
Did l surprize you by coming up?

752
01:52:41,290 --> 01:52:44,950
门开着 又没有人 所以我就自己上来了
Door was open downstairs and nobody was there, so l came up.

753
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:49,350
没关系的 先生
No problem sir.

754
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:54,490
我有点重要的事情想跟你谈谈
l want to discuss important matter with you.

755
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:56,990
请跟我走一趟
Please come with me.

756
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:58,570
我还有工作…
l've work...

757
01:53:06,510 --> 01:53:09,070
跟你说了以后 你该不会觉得我是个疯子吧？
You won't think l'm mad after hearing what l say, right?

758
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:15,010
有只苍蝇要杀我！
A fly is trying to kill me!

759
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:18,050
我为什么不相信？
Don't believe it?

760
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:24,060
我就知道你会相信的
l know you'll believe it.

761
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:31,190
更令人吃惊的是…
More shocking than that is...

762
01:53:32,710 --> 01:53:37,070
那只苍蝇还有帮凶
Someone is helping that fly to kill me.

763
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:41,110
你相信吗？
Do you believe it?

764
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:43,750
如果您这么说的话 我就…
l do if you say so...

765
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:51,220
如果我告诉别人 他们会说我疯了
When l told this to others, they said l'm mad.

766
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:04,230
看看这个！
Look at this!

767
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,300
这是监控录像
lt was caught on CCTV camera.

768
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,310
当我把它放大的时候…
When l zoom it...

769
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:18,110
它居然带了面具和护目镜…看到了吗？
lt has a mask, goggles... did you see?

770
01:54:20,550 --> 01:54:23,740
但是苍蝇应该没办法弄到这些东西的
But a fly can't make it,

771
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:24,490
不是吗？
right?

772
01:54:24,990 --> 01:54:27,420
一定有人在帮它
Somebody must've made it for the fly.

773
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:32,460
不要哭 疯狂的小姑娘
Don't cry, mad girl.

774
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:33,830
我没事的
l'll be fine.

775
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:41,940
只有微雕艺术家才能做出这么微小的东西
Only micro artists can create such minute articles.

776
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:48,710
但是谁会想要杀死我呢 宾都？
But who would want me dead, Bindu?

777
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:55,110
你也是个微雕艺术家
You too are a micro artist.

778
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:58,120
你知道谁想置我于死地吗？
Do you know who wants me dead?

779
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:24,480
以前 我动一动手指就能得到任何女人
l used to get any woman l desire at the snap of a finger,

780
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:30,050
是你逼一个疯狂的男人踩死苍蝇的！
you made a mad man stamping flies!

781
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:36,090
纳尼！你藏哪儿了？出来！
Hey Nani boy! Where are you hiding? Come out!

782
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:39,060
我知道你就在这儿！
l know you're here!

783
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:43,570
你每次都鬼鬼祟祟地溜进来…
Like every time you sneak in stealthily...

784
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,140
直接飞过来 落到我的脚下来！
Come straight and fall at my feet!

785
01:55:51,310 --> 01:55:55,910
不然我就杀了她！
lf not l'll cut her throat!

786
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:57,840
出来 纳尼！
Come out Nani!

787
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:20,100
你知道我上次是怎么杀死他的吗？
You don't know how l killed him in his previous birth, right?

788
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:21,470
把我的鞋脱下来
Take off my shoes.

789
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:29,710
我要亲眼看着你死掉！
l want to feel your life slip away!

790
01:57:07,890 --> 01:57:09,050
抓住宾都！
Catch Bindu!

791
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:17,290
你今天死定了！
You're finished today!

792
01:57:21,430 --> 01:57:23,490
不在这里 窗帘后面再找找
Not here, search behind the curtains.

793
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:20,750
- 剩余的子弹呢？ - 用完了 先生
- Where are the bullets?  - Used everything sir.

794
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:31,760
- 把她给我带过来！ - 那女的不见了
- Drag her to me!  - Madam is missing.

795
02:00:32,930 --> 02:00:33,690
宾都逃跑了吗？
Did Bindu manage to escape?

796
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:35,620
没有 先生 门上锁了 保安都在里面
No sir, door is locked, security men are inside.

797
02:00:35,790 --> 02:00:37,260
后门也上锁了 先生
Back door is also locked, sir.

798
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:38,950
她逃不出去的
There's no way she can escape.

799
02:00:39,260 --> 02:00:42,530
只可能藏在这里面哪里了
She would be hiding somewhere here only.

800
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:44,230
把她给我找出来！
Find her!

801
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:28,180
我抓到它了！我抓到它了！
l got him! l got him!

802
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,550
折磨了我二十多天 突然就抓到它了
After torturing me for 20 long days and suddenly getting caught,

803
02:01:41,490 --> 02:01:43,480
她也在这里！
that too here!

804
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:46,960
真不敢相信！
Do you want me to believe it?

805
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:16,150
纳尼 你死定了！
Nani, you're finished!

806
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:29,670
看 它飞得多漂亮！
See, how nicely it is flying!

807
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,640
还没完呢！
lt's not over yet!

808
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:44,210
拿着！
Hold it!

809
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:49,620
刺它！
Pierce it!

810
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:52,690
- 求您放了它吧 先生  - 刺那里！
- Please leave it sir.  - Pierce there!

811
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:04,500
求您了 先生 放了它吧
l beg you sir, please leave him.

812
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,980
才刚刚开始呢 现在就想让我停下来吗？
Started it just now and you want me to stop it?

813
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:13,280
你们俩玩儿了我这么多天
You both had played with my life for so many days.

814
02:03:13,450 --> 02:03:15,850
我求你们停下来了吗？
Did l ask you to stop it?
