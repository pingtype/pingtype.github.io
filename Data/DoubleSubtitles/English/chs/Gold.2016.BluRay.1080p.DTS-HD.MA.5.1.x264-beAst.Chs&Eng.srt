2
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,360
我们是真正的行业
We were a real business.

3
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,900
你要明白这一点
That's what you got to understand.

4
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,410
我们这种行业
We were goddamn industry...

5
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,670
是这个国家的支柱
the kind that's the backbone of this country.

6
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,750
不用相信我的话
Don't take my word for it.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,500
你亲自去停车场看看
Go in the parking lot and look on the license

8
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,800
你那辆崭新的奔驰四五的牌照
of that brand-new Mercedes 450 of yours.

9
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,550
喂 你看到了吗
Hey. Are you seeing this?

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,010
这位是弗尼斯・克里克
That's Furnace Creek.

11
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,680
这照片有一百年的历史了
This, uh, picture's over 100 years old.

12
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,970
嗯
Hmm.

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,970
看到这个英俊的人了吗
And you see this handsome devil right here?

14
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,560
嗯
Uh-huh.

15
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,220
他是我们威尔斯家的先人
He's a Wells.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,150
好的 我知道你们是矿业公司
Okay, so, um, I know you're a mining company,

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,110
- 嗯  - 但我以为…
- Mm-hmm.  - But I pictured...

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,910
具体我也说不清楚
Well, I don't know what I pictured exactly.

19
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,620
我以为会看到很多小矿车
I guess little... little carts

20
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,830
在铁轨上跑
going down little... little train tracks.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,790
- 对  - 那你们在这儿是做什么的
- Right.  - I mean, what is it that you do here?

22
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,740
我们做的是寻找金属
Wh-what we do is we look for the metals

23
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,040
和矿石
and the minerals, all right?

24
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,910
那是勘探部
There's exploration over there,

25
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,290
那是工程部和生产部
there's engineering and there's production, right?

26
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,760
我们是探矿者
We're prospectors.

27
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,550
还没懂？
Not yet'?

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,050
- 我换个方式解释  - 好吧
- Okay, how about this?  - Yeah...

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,670
我们假设这个
Um... so let's say that this...

30
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,090
就是地球
is the Earth.

31
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,260
我的手提包？
My handbag?

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,930
你的手提包就是大地
Your handbag is Mother Earth

33
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,600
有着埋在深处的奥秘
with all of her deep-filled mysteries

34
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,980
和好东西不愿被人拿走
and goodies on the inside that she does not want to give up.

35
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,690
而我是人类
Me, I'm man,

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,900
对大地深处的东西很好奇
and I'm damn curious about what she's got inside.

37
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,020
于是我就进行钻探
So, I send down what's called an exploratory drill.

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,070
钻到里面找找看
I go down inside and dig around,

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,740
找到了什么
come across something.

40
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,200
我取出来一看是镍
I pull it out. It's nickel.

41
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,740
镍币其实是百分之七十五的铜和百分之二十五的镍
Now, nickel's actually 75% copper and 25% nickel,

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,210
反正世上有很多镍
but there's a whole lot of nickel in the world,

43
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,620
世界需要镍
and the world needs nickels.

44
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
我又回去取出第二份样品
I'm back down there getting my second core sample,

45
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,300
碰巧发现了…
and I happen to pull up, say...

46
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,880
银
silver.

47
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,720
只要样品里有一点点银
Now, the thing is, when you find a little bit of this,

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,430
就意昧着可能有一个大银矿
that means there could be a whole hell of a lot of it.

49
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,970
然后我们开始筹集资金
So we start raising money.

50
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,470
我们筹集足够的钱来开矿
We raise enough money to open a mine

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,260
就像照片中的那个矿
like the one in that picture right here.

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,560
然后
Then...

53
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,770
我们都开采出来
we dig it all up.

54
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,150
有时候 虽然不是经常 但有时候
Now, sometimes... Not that often, but sometimes...

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,270
探矿之神们在天国之门开派对
The prospecting gods are having a party at the Pearly Gates,

56
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,320
而我们又非常幸运的话
and we get real, real, really lucky.

57
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,160
我们在那里挖下去
And we dig down in there,

58
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,160
找到了一种金属 称作
then we find a little metal called...

59
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,330
金
gold.

60
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,380
- 是的  - 肯尼
- Yes.  - Kenny.

61
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,920
喜欢吗
You like it?

62
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,760
我爱你
I love you.

63
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,180
我爱你
I love you.

64
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,180
你爸找你
Old man wants to see you.

65
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,350
下午好 玛丽安
Afternoon, Marianne.

66
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,350
爸 你找我？
Hey, Pop. Heard you want to see me.

67
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,570
是的 肯尼
Yeah, Kenny.

68
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,100
你过来一下
Get your ass in here, would you?

69
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,600
你在跟找讲讲
Would you, uh, run through this

70
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,610
潘兴县的这个开发计划
Pershing County strategy again for me?

71
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,900
好
Right, um...

72
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,360
是关于南部纽蒙特公司的一个矿区
It's about this southern part of this Newmont property,

73
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,780
在这里
right here.

74
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,210
纽蒙特公司只钻了一百四十米深
Now, Newmont just started drilling 140 meters

75
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,120
就发现了大量的菱镁矿
and they're finding a whole lot of magnesite.

76
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,870
如果你记得 我们依然有瑞利夫峡谷的优先选择权
If you remember, we still own the option on Relief Canyon,

77
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,040
跟他们紧邻 却什么也没找到 为什么呢
which is next door. We're not finding squat, why?

78
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,800
因为钻的不够深
We're not drilling deep enough.

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,590
让我们回到那里 钻得更深
Let's get back in there. Drill deeper.

80
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,710
必要的话就钻一百四十米 就能很有机会
Go to 140 if we need to, and we got a damn good chance

81
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,680
在瑞利夫峡谷进行开发
of getting Relief back in production.

82
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,670
杰利特峡谷呢
What about Jerritt Canyon?

83
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,640
那是你的宝贝
Well, that's your baby.

84
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,050
你对它的了解比我多得多
You know a hell of a lot more about it than I do.

85
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,770
但化验结果很乐观
But the assays look promising.

86
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,480
可能是个大矿
Could be fucking huge.

87
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,350
我要你亲自负责这事
I want you to run point on this.

88
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,690
全盘负责
All in.

89
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,860
把它做大
Scale it up.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,830
成为你的业绩
Make it yours.

91
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,450
是
Yes, sir.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
克莱夫・科尔曼也赞成
Clive Coleman's on board.

93
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,700
他们和你一起去
Those boys will ride with you.

94
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,430
我们在这一行业辛苦努力
God, we work hard in this business.

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,390
时常一无所获
Sometimes for nothing.

96
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,560
我每天早上醒来 对自己说
I wake up every morning. I tell myself,

97
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,400
干这一行不是苦差事
"I don't have to do this.

98
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,360
而是我的幸运
I get to do this."

99
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,400
然后就只是蓝天
And then it's just blue skies.

100
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,030
蓝天啊
Blue skies, baby.

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,260
我的父亲
My old man...

102
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,340
是个传奇
a legend.

103
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,250
这是我最后一次见到他
That was the last time I saw him alive.

104
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,260
来杯醒眼酒吗 肯尼
A little eye-opener, Kenny?

105
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,590
上帝保佑你 罗伊
God bless you, Roy.

106
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,630
好了
Here we are.

107
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,130
- 为主矿脉干杯  - 主矿脉
- Boys, to the mother lode.  - Mother lode.

108
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,260
就在今天
Today be the day.

109
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,310
这一地区的地质学报告
The geological reports on this

110
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,470
非常的乐观
are highly encouraging.

111
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,100
我们将开始大规模勘探
We are taking a very aggressive approach.

112
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,180
招股书？当然
Prospectus? Of course.

113
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,060
我可以让秘书马上发给你一份
I can have my secretary send you one right out.

114
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,230
但我要告诉你 这一项目
But I got to tell you, this offering,

115
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,030
己经有太多人认购了
it's already over-subscribed.

116
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,110
但下个项目可以给你留一些
You know, we can always try and get you in on the next one.

117
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,730
没事 我理解
No, no. Yea, I understand.

118
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,080
该死的
Shit.

119
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,950
你看时间 己经十一点一刻了 肯尼
Watching the time? It's 11:15, Kenny.

120
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,450
老天
Oh, Christ.

121
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,250
没有你我可怎么办
Where would I be without you?

122
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,590
威尔斯先生
Mr. Wells?

123
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,430
是我 我是劳埃德・斯坦顿
Yes. Lloyd Stanton.

124
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,270
- 你好 劳埃德  - 嗨
- Hello, Lloyd. Kenny Wells.  - Hi.

125
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,840
这是我的同事亨利・安德鲁斯
This is my colleague, Henry Andrews.

126
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,010
- 很高兴见到你  - 嗨
- Pleased to meet you.  - Hey.

127
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,230
- 到后面谈吧  - 好
- Come on back.  - Absolutely.

128
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,720
谢谢
Thank you.

129
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,990
找我们有什么事
So, what can we do for ya?

130
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,940
我们等克莱夫来了再谈吧
Well, why don't we wait for Clive?

131
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,320
他正开会 分不开身
Oh, uh, Mr. Coleman got tied up in a meeting.

132
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,830
两位别介意
No offense, boys,

133
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,070
我本来是来见克莱夫的
but I'm supposed to be meeting with Clive.

134
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,990
不介意 但如果你够资格
None taken, but if you were supposed to be

135
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,210
就肯定能见到克莱夫
meeting with Clive, you would be meeting with Clive.

136
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,120
好吧情况是这样的
All right. Here is what we have.

137
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,250
我们正在开发一些地方
We are developing some very exciting properties

138
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,130
正符合你们的投资者的需要
that are spot-on for your investor profile.

139
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,980
低价买 进升值潜力巨大
Low buy-in with a sizable upside.

140
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,510
- 嗯嗯  - 而且更好的是
- Mm-hmm.  - And the beautiful part is

141
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,230
只有十二到十八月的资金回笼时间
they are all only 12 to 18 months and cash positive.

142
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,560
- 马尼托巴湖？ - 是的
- Manitoba?  - Yeah.

143
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,480
我们在一个拍卖会上得到的选择权
We picked up an option on a skip claim at an auction.

144
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,140
对 可这是九十天的选择
Right, but it's a 90-day option.

145
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,610
是的窗口期很短
Yes, the window is narrow,

146
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,110
但如果你们看看地质报告
but if you have a look at the Jerritt,

147
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,530
会看到很有潜力的页岩结构
you'll see a very promising shale formation

148
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,870
还被开发过
that hasn't been tapped yet.

149
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,780
威尔斯先生 瓦肖公司的市值
Mr. Wells, Washoe has a practical value

150
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,120
只比O高一点点
hovering just above zero.

151
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,030
你们负债累累
Your debt load is untenable,

152
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,950
而你带来的只是一片原始土地 既没有基础设施
and you bring us, uh, raw land with no infrastructure,

153
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,370
也没有可互换资产 这实在…
no fungible assets. I mean,

154
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,220
我们不可能会认购的
you can't possibly expect us to underwrite this.

155
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,430
这可是价格极低
Yeah. I'm talking about a small offering here.

156
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,220
就像我一开始说的 低价买进
As I said in the beginning, a low buy-in.

157
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,340
如果你们再看看地质报告
Now, if you'll take a second look at the Jerritt,

158
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,510
就能看到我所看到的
you will see what I see.

159
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,060
就是利润
And that's money.

160
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,060
但不是我们的利润
Not our money.

161
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,790
现实是
See, the... the thing is

162
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,180
整体经济不景气
that the whole economy had turned,

163
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,590
尤其是商品经济
particularly for commodities.

164
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,930
当天收盘时
Close of the day,

165
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,400
瓦肖公司的股价是每股四美分
Washoe was trading at four cents a share

166
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,690
依然无人问津
if it was trading at all.

167
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,930
瓦肖矿业公司有个很棒的土地租赁
Washoe Mining. There's this great little land lease.

168
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,400
这是个千载难逢的机会
'Cause this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

169
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,410
对 瓦肖 瓦肖矿业公司
Right. Washoe. Washoe Mining.

170
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,990
我们还在营业
You know, carrying the... carrying on the business.

171
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,580
矿物是肯定有的
You know, there's still minerals out there.

172
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,950
我们只需要找到
We just got to find them, right?

173
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,040
好 好的
Yeah, all right, all right.

174
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,530
谢谢你抽出时间 再见
Thank... thank you for your time. Bye.

175
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,630
我可以…
I could...

176
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,250
十二到十八个月…
12 to 18 months...

177
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,290
现金净流入
cash positive.

178
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,790
一笔交易…
A deal...

179
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,040
我就给你打电话
Goddamn, I am calling you.

180
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,640
不管现在是几点了
Fuck whatever time it is.

181
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,680
瓦肖矿业
Washoe Mining,

182
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,590
这公司是我祖父
the company that my grandfather

183
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,980
在内华达山区白手起家
literally scratched out of the side of a Nevada mountain,

184
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,150
我父亲又一手把公司做大
the company that my father made into a real player,

185
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,320
到我手上却垮了
was almost gone.

186
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,820
几乎垮了
Almost.

187
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,160
我己经失去了我的房子
I'd already, uh, lost my house,

188
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,420
我是住在凯的房子里
and I was, uh... I was living with Kay.

189
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,040
那个房子也快保不住了
And, uh, we-we were about to lose that, too.

190
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,690
我喝半加仑的施格兰金酒
I had a half gallon of Seagram's in me.

191
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,440
换成别人早就喝死了 但我不会
Shit, most people would have been dead, but not me. No.

192
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,310
相反
Instead...

193
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,980
我有一个梦
I had a dream.

194
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,450
是真的做了…
I mean, I mean, I mean, literally, I...

195
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,410
做了个梦
I had a dream.

196
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,210

198
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,600
我五六年前去过印尼
Now, I'd been to Indonesia five or six years earlier.

199
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,560
那时我还有点钱
I still had a little money in my pocket.

200
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,350
印尼也在快速发展
You know, Indonesia was booming,

201
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,800
我去寻找投资的机会
and I was looking for a way to get in.

202
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,900
在那时 如果你想
Back then, if you wanted

203
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,610
在印尼寻找矿产
to put a hole in the ground in Indonesia,

204
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,730
就需要迈克・阿克斯塔告诉你应该在哪儿挖
you wanted Mike Acosta telling you where to dig.

205
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,200
他就是他们所谓的河行者
He's what they called a River Walker.

206
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,990
真正的地质学者
Yeah, a real hands-on geologist.

207
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,110
有真本事
The real deal.

208

父亲是英国人
His dad was English.

211
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,500
现在你看，他刚刚发现了…
Now, you see, he'd just discovered

212
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,160
东南亚最大的铜矿
the largest copper strike in Southeast Asia,

213
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,510
人人都想得到他 包括我
and everybody wanted a piece of him, including me.

214
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,350
纳斯卡板块 太平洋板块
You got the Nazca Plate, the Pacific Plate.

215

阿留申 马里亚纳 汤家
Aleutian, Marianas, Tonga.

217
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,480
这些板块之问互相摩擦
The plates rubbing and grinding up on each other.

218
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,270
六万亿公斤的压力
Six trillion kilobytes of pressure.

219
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,150
一万摄氏度在环太平洋地带
10,000 degrees Celsius kicking up geothermic hot spots

220
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,150
形成了地热圈
all along the Pacific rim.

221
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,400
他称之为火山地震带理论
He called it the, uh, the Ring of Fire theory.

222
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,530
吸引了每个人
And he definitely had everyone's attention.

223
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,160
我就是这么找到铜矿的
That's how I found the copper.

224
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,620
所以我也会找到金矿
And that's why I'll find the gold.

225
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,010
你这么早起了
You're up early.

226
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,760
嗨
Hey.

227
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,560
你昨天想说什么来着
You want to talk about yesterday.

228
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,850
不 我得走了 我有个计划
No. I gotta go right now, babe. I've gotta plan. Gotta plan.

229
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,190
- 等等 肯尼 听着  - 嗯？
- Oh, wait, Kenny, Kenny, listen.  - Hmm?

230
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,190
卡尔有个工作
Carl had an idea.

231
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,610
- 美国之家的卡尔？ - 嗯
- American Home Carl?  - Uh-huh.

232
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,280
他说如果你愿意 你可以在那里
He said he could, uh, get you on for a while,

233
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,160
- 先干一段时间  - 好 好
- if you wanted.  - Right, right, right, right.

234
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,910
我觉得没这个必要 亲爱的
Yeah, I don't think that's going to be necessary, babe.

235
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,700
只是暂时的
Yeah, but it'd just be temporary

236
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,410
等到经济好转
till the market turns.

237
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,630
我们还可以在仓库里胡来
We could fool around in the warehouse.

238
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,120
我告诉你
You know, I tell you...

239
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,260
我先出一趟差
When I get done with this trip, all right?

240
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,550
不会超过一周
Shouldn't take more than a week.

241
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,010
- 好吧  - 什么 你要去哪儿

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,260
- 我去了机场会给你打电话  - 等等
- I'll call you from the airport.  - Wait. Wait, wait.

肯尼
Kenny!

245
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,100
就像我得到了召唤一样
It was like I was being called, you know?

246
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,230
金子的召唤
It was the gold calling.

247
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,100
你可能觉得这很疯狂
That may sound crazy to you,

248
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,150
但如果你体会过这种感觉
but if you... if you knew that feeling,

249
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,400
你就能理解
well, you'd know.

250
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,180
我是肯尼・威尔斯 我就在
Kenny Wells. I'm down here in the, uh,

251
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,780
雅加达皇宫酒店的大堂里
the lobby of the, uh, Jakarta Palace.

252
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,440
听着
Uh... Yeah, listen,

253
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,110
我们肯定抱时间搞混了
we must've got the times mixed up.

254
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,110
让我知道 我在这里
Um... Let me know. I'm down here.

255
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,360
我穿着西装 坐在绿色沙发上
I'm in the brown suit, I'm on the green couch.

256
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,780
是个帅小伙
I'm the good-looking guy, okay?

257
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,280
好 我们会成功的
All right. We'll make it happen, Fuca.

258
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,500
好
All right.

259
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,590
威尔斯？
Wells?

260
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,550
迈克
Mike.

261
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,880
很高兴再次见到你
Good to see you again.

262
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,260
我知道一个地方卖酒的
I know a local place, a bit more color.

263
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,470
这里不卖酒吗
What, they're not pouring here?

264
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,800
好的
Good.

265
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,810
那么
So,

266
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,530
我们在这里谈什么 威尔斯？
what are we talking about here, Wells?

267
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,030
火山地震带 迈克
Ring of Fire, Mike.

268
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,610
火山地震带理论
Ring of Fire.

269
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,700
你在谈我最大的发现
You're playing my greatest hits.

270
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,040
那个火己经灭了
Fire's gone out of that one.

271
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,900
何出此言
Well, what are you talking about?

272
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,880
这是一个很有声望的地质学家的观点
It's the opinion of my fellow esteemed geologists,

273
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,460
我的火山地震带理论用他的话来说
that the whole thing... I'm quoting here...

274
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,580
就是一佗屎
Is a crock of shit.

275
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,750
那也没办法
Well, what the hell, you know?

276
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,630
你搞错了
You called it wrong.

277
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,710
你打算怎么办
What are you going to do?

278
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,510
在这一行 没什么对错
There's no right or wrong in this business.

279
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,930
只有找到和找不到
There's only hits and misses.

280
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,640
这里有金子
There's gold here.

281
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,360
很高兴你这么说 迈克
I'm glad you said that, Mike.

282
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,820
我是真心高兴 因为我
I truly am, 'cause I...

283
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,030
相信你
believe you.

284
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,410
我不想给你泼玲水 但你以为
I hate to dash your hopes, but don't you think

285
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,620
没有别人抱着同样的想法来找过我吗
others have come along before you with the same thought

286
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,540
而且从衣着看 比你更有钱的人
and, from the looks of it, deeper pockets?

287
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,340
火山地震带是真实存在的 迈克
Ring of Fire is real, Mike.

288
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,800
我第一次听说时就相信
I knew it the first time I heard.

289
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,590
我就像受到电击一般
It struck me like a fucking lightning bolt,

290
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,330
从没忘记当时的感觉
and I never forgot it.

291
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,460
你就笑我吧 经常有人嘲笑我
Go ahead, laugh. I get that all the time.

292
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,090
但你听着
But hear this.

293
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,390
我不只是相信
I don't just believe.

294
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,980
我是确定
I know.

295
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,190
- 不会  - 我亲眼见过
- No, you don't.  - I've seen it.

296
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,390
你不懂
You don't understand.

297
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,730
- 没人会资助我  - 我会
- No one will back me.  - I will.

298
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,980
你只要告诉我应该在哪儿钻探
You tell me where you want to dig, Mikey,

299
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,990
费用我全包
and I'll make goddamn sure the bills are paid.

300
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,860
恕我直言威尔斯
No offense, Wells, but...

301
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,700
但看你衣着 恐怕机票钱也是靠打劫凑的
you look like you had to rob someone just to get here, man.

302
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,660
你对我一无所知
You know nothing about me.

303
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,960
你确信这里有金子
You know it's still out there.

304
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,300
这是肯定的
I know that.

305
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,290
从你的眼神能看出来 你仍然相信
I can see it in your eyes. You still believe.

306
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,470
我能理解 我也是生在山脚下
I get it, and I was born on the side of the mountain, too.

307
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,260
我父亲的一切财产
My-my father scratched everything he ever owned

308
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,600
都是他从矿石里一点点挖出来的
out of a fucking rock. All right?

309
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,010
去世时指甲里依然有泥土
Died with dirt under his fingernails,

310
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,680
我也想像他那样
and I intend to do the same.

311
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,560
这一行业
This business...

312
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,310
几年前就把我淘汰了
wrote me off years ago.

313
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,770
而你现在也不是
All right, maybe you're not running the hottest

314
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,020
在事业巅峰
in your career right now either,

315
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,190
让我们证明他们错了
so let's prove them wrong.

316
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,480
你和我
You and me.

317
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,900
让我们证明他们都错了
Let's prove them all fucking wrong.

318
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,150
知道为什么吗
And you know why?

319
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,700
你知道为什么 因为火山地震带理论
You do know why, because the Ring of Fire

320
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,950
是正确的 迈克 你是对的
is right, Mike. You called it.

321
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,820
只是还没有找到它
You just haven't found it yet.

322
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,040
如果你说我疯了
Tell me I'm crazy.

323
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,550
我马上坐飞机回去
I'll be on the next plane.

324
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,590
你疯了
You're crazy.

325
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,810
你有帽子吗 威尔斯？
You have a hat, Wells?

326
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,350
是的 我有帽子
Yeah, I got a hat.

327
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,940
我们要去哪儿吗
Why, we going somewhere?

328
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,700
上游
Up river.

329
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,190
是什么河 迈克
What river is that, Mike?

330
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,030
你迟到了
You're late.

331
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,910
唯一重要的一条河
The only one that matters.

332
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,890
蒂亚克人在这条河上淘金
The Dayak have been panning this river

333
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,490
有五千多年的历史了
for over 5,000 years.

334
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,020
这就是河名的由来
That's how it got its name,

335
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,190
Daya Kensana！
Daya Kensana.

336
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,910
是什么意思
What's it mean?

337
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,820
Daya意思是上游
"Daya" means "upstream."

338
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,780
Kensana意思是金子
"Kensana" means "gold."

339
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,290
你就靠一河名？
You got to be shitting me.

340
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,240
威尔斯
Wells. Wells.

341
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,940
我们到了
We're here.

342
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,230
听着 蒂亚克人是好斗的民族
So, listen, the Dayak are warrior people,

343
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,900
最著名的是蒂亚克
probably best known for Dayak,

344
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,610
即猎取人头
headhunting.

345
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,160
但现在不常有了
But it doesn't happen much anymore.

346
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,150
他们会以为我们是什么商人
They might be thinking we're some traders

347
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,450
或者是某人的岳母
or someone's mother-in-law.

348
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,810
还有多远
How long?

349
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,440
这片丛林会考验你
This jungle will... will test you.

350
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,860
会把你抱起来 搪量你一下
It will hold you up, weigh you,

351
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,730
判断你值多少盎司
and decide your worth within an ounce.

352
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,570
你总是这么说话吗
Do you always talk like this, Mike?

353
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,190
就像录音机一样
Like a book on tape?

354
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,660
可能吧
I suppose I do.

355
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,530
我们去哪？
Where are we going?

356
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,330
向上
Up.

357
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,310
你看
Take a look.

358
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,320
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

359
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,870
这就是我梦里看到的
It's my dream.

360
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,860
多年来一直有人
There have been a few folks up here

361
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,780
在这里勘探
tapping over the years,

362
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,750
但他们只专注于南部的山麓
but have all focused on the foothills far to the south.

363
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,240
但让我感兴趣的是另一个方向
But what interests me is the other way.

364
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,420
那个小凹陷
That small depression,

365
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,260
就像一个巨人留下的脚印一样
like a giant left a footprint walking away.

366
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,880
那里肯定发生了什么 威尔斯
Something happened there, Wells.

367
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,890
非同寻常的事
Something hot and angry.

368
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,600
我们就去那里寻找宝藏
That's where we'll find the tasty bits.

369
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,470
我的梦境
My dream...

370
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,280
金子就在那里
is out there.

371
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,520
这是肯定的
Damn right it is.

372
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,570
如果你考虑的
Look, if it's the big boys

373
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,440
投资我们的是些大户
that you're thinking about investing in us...

374
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,120
比如哈佛基金
You know, the Harvard endowment

375
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,700
或者某个退休基金
or some... some pension fund, right?...

376
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,330
那你不该找我
I am not your guy.

377
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,950
但那些散户
But the little guys, right,

378
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,710
你根没听说过的那些人
guys that you don't even know about,

379
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,500
皮条客小混混
the, uh, the hustlers, the scrappers,

380
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,470
那些能把事情办成的人
the make-it-happen motherfuckers,

381
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,470
就是我要找的人
those are my guys.

382
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,510
我们需要多少钱
How much do we need?

383
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,310
启动资金要七十到七十五万美元
Seven. Seven-fifty to start.

384
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,850
好的
Okay.

385
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,360
但我们需要多少钱？
How much do we need?

386
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,570
不只是租块地这么简单
It isn't just a lease.

387
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,360
我们是在印尼
We're in Indonesia.

388
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,700
这意昧着要拿到许可证贿赔官员
That means getting a permit and lining pockets.

389
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,620
需要设备搞挖掘
Equipment. You don't just do this

390
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,200
不可能只靠铁镐
with a couple of shovels and a pickax.

391
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,960
我会搞到钱的
I'll get the money.

392
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,750
不管需要多少
Whatever it takes.

393
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,300
- 这是什么  - 这是合同
- What's that?  - It's a contract.

394
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,880
你看看
Read it.

395
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,970
然后签字
Sign it.

396
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,950
留着吧
Keep it.

397
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,200
我有强烈的直觉
I could feel it in my bones.

398
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,080
我推销的是我真心相信的东西
I was selling something that I believed in.

399
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,620
最低认购两万股
20-K minimum buy-in, right,

400
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,620
股票正被迅速抢购中
and the shares are fucking flying off the shelf.

401
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,960
有风险才有利润
I mean, no risk, no gain, right?

402
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,460
现在就在发生
No, 'cause it's coming in right now.

403
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,290
不 阿科斯塔 迈克・阿科斯塔
No, Acosta. Michael Acosta.

404
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,640
他发现了史上最大的铜矿
It's the largest copper strike in history,

405
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,100
他就是我们的专家
and that's the guy that we got.

406
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,010
凯 把鞋子擦亮 准备跳舞
Kay, get those shoes shined for dancing, baby.

407
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,260
我们连勘探许可证都还没拿到
We don't even have the exploration permits.

408
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,600
我们的卖点是什么
What are they selling?

409
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,260
我们的卖点？
What are we selling?

410
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,020
我们的卖点就是个故事
Mikey, we're selling the story.

411
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,940
而这个故事就是你
And right now, the story is you.

412
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,270
说到你 你现在干什么呢
Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing right now?

413
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,950
我正在古邦市看一套钻探设备
I'm down in Kupang City looking at coring equipment.

414
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,950
阿科斯塔正在古邦市看一套钻探设备
Acosta's in Kupang City looking at coring equipment.

415
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,620
他现在就在古邦市
He's in Kupang City as we speak.

416
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,580
那是个…
It-it's a fucking...

417
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,450
古邦市 我们正在购买钻探设备
Kupang City. We're getting the coring equipment...

418
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,120
你是传奇 迈克 你就是传奇
You're magic, Mike. You're fucking magic.

419
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,720
你在吗 迈克
You there, Mike?

420
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,260
己经筹集了二十六万
Two hundred and sixty-seven thousand

421
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,390
四百三十四…
four hundred and thirty-four...

422

美元
dollars.

423
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,860
这个数目可不够 威尔斯
That's not exactly the number I had in mind, Wells.

424
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,150
我还可以再借一点
Well, look, I may be able to borrow a little bit

425
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,060
不过呢

426
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,940
说实话 迈克
No, you know what? Truth, Mike?

427
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,320
目前就这么多钱了
Th-that's it for now.

428
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,230
就这么多 你能将就吗
Th-that's it. Can you make it work? Hmm?

429
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,160
多少我都能将就
I can make anything work.

430
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,030
你们在酒吧工作吗 威尔斯？
You work out of a bar, Wells?

431
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,540
省着点花钱 迈克
Keeping a lid on expenses, Mike.

432
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,790
每一分钱都花在刀刃上
Making the dollar holler.

433
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,510
成了
We're in!

434
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,980
点唱机？很有品位
Record player. That's classy.

435
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,690
是花的我的钱吗 迈克
Am I paying for that, Mikey?

436
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,530
六名员工
Six-man crews,

437
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,820
每班次十二小时全天开工

明天就能出来钻探样品了
Tomorrow we'll start looking at our core samples.

439
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,160
然后我们把成色最好的
Then we'll send the most promising

440
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,750
送到下游化验室
down river to the assay lab.

441
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,580
为主矿脉干杯 迈克
The mother lode, Mike.

442
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,000
你就在这里 宝贝
You're out there, baby.

443

445
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,840
更是天

446
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,720
别问我是哪里来的肉
Don't ask where the meat came from. Hmm?

447
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,930
你看过哥伦布的日记吗
Have you ever read Christopher Columbus' journals?

448
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,850
当然没看过
Of course not.

449
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,600
在他对西班牙女王的请愿中
In his petition to the queen of Spain,

450
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,480
他承诺

451
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,400
要让大量的人阪依基督教

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,050
有件事我一直想问你 威尔斯
I've been wanting to ask you something, Wells.

457
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,710
你说吧
Fire away, Mike.

458
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,130
你手臂上的纹身的是什么意思
What's the meaning of the tattoo on your arm?

459
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,880
哦这是一只乌

460
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,220
出自我小时候看过的一首诗
It's from a poem I read when I was a kid.

461

没有脚的乌

462
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,440
在风中睡觉
sleeps in the wind.

463
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,160
化验报告
Assay!

464
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,370

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,720
迈克迈克
Mike, Mike!

466
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,890
这些化验报告一次比一次糟糕
Hey. These things, they look worse every time we get one.

467
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,760
记得我说过要有耐心吗
Do you remember what I told you about patience?

468
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,730
记得 但你记得我说过钱吗
Yeah, you-you remember what I told you about money?

469
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,900
- 是的  - 咦？
- Yeah.  - Huh?

470
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,860
- 你说过钱不成问题  - 嗯 这个…
- You said that it wasn't a problem.  - Well, it...

471
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,400
现在成问题了
it's a fucking problem now!

472
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,450
喂
Hey!

473
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,680

除了这些事
On top of everything else,

481
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,020
我还染上了严重的疟疾
I... I got a bad case of malaria,

482
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,570
每年有上百万人死于疟疾
which kills like something like a million people a year,

483
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,110
听说是这样
something like that.

484
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,280
我突然也成了其中一员
Suddenly, I was on the list.

485
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,800
也许我们对工人太苛刻了
Maybe... maybe we were pushing them too hard.

486
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,920
也许我们该宽松点
Maybe we should just take it easy, you know?

487
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,500
让他们入伙
Cut them in.

488
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,000
给他们一些股份
You know, give them some ownership.

489
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,470
也许他们就会回来
Maybe they'll come back, you know?

490
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,590
让他们知道最后能有收获
Let them know that they got something at the end,

491
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,430
只要找到金矿的话
you know, when it all works out.

492
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,100
给他们一些分成
Give them a piece of the pie, you know?

493
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,320
起来
Get up.

494
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,690
来起来
Come on, get up.

495
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,740
我好冷 迈克
I'm freezing, Mike.

496
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,720
别让我一无所获的死去
Don't let me die and have nothing, okay?

497
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,140
休息一下吧
Get some rest now.

498
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,610
我要终止勘探
I'm pulling the plug.

499
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,320
不
No.

500
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,280
不不
No, no, no, no, no.

501
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,290
别终止勘探 迈克
Don't pull the plug, Mike.

502
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,080
不 你不能这么做 迈克
No, no. You can't do that, Mikey.

503
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,200
我们带你离开这里吧威尔斯
Let's get you out of here, Wells.

504
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,080
你有什么办法 迈克
What's the plan, Mikey?

505
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,000
嗯？
Hmm?

506
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,760
我知道你肯定有办法 迈克
Now, I know you got a plan, Mike, hmm?

507
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,300
我知道你肯定有办法
I know you got a plan.

508
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,260
是什么办法
What's the plan, hmm?

509
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,470
什么办法
What's the plan?

510
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,180
他们需要清洁的水
They need clean water.

511
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,730
如果我们能安装过滤系统
If we get filter systems up here,

512
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,980
我想他们可能会回来
I think they might come back.

513
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,790
我这张维萨卡上还有大约一千八百美元
I got about $1,800 on this Visa right there.

514
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,920
这个俱乐部餐厅卡上有近五百美元
Close to 500 on this Diner's Club.

515

Use it all, hmm?

516
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,980
都用上迈克
Use it all, Mikey.

517
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,970
他去拜访了
Damned if he didn't go

518
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,590
我们每一个工人
to every single place

519
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,090
居住的地方
that every one of our workers lived.

520
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,390
去过所有无名小溪
Streams that had no name.

521
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,440
所有流向kensana河的溪流
All feeding the great Kensana River.

522
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,150
喂喂

工人们都回来了

接下来几周我依然在受着疟疾的折磨
I spent the next few weeks in a malarial haze.

526
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,880
跟死人一样
Should've been dead.

527
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:28,420
一切都是迈克操持的
But Mike kept it all going.

528

533
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,700
化验报告怎么说什么消息
What'd the report say? What's the news?

534
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,740
我们又取出了十七个钻探样品
We pulled 17 more cores.

535

557
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,040
那一刻
That moment...

558
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,550
我无法描述那种感觉
there's no way I could possibly describe the feeling.

559

很奇妙一点点砂金

就能改变一切

There's more food here. Don't drink through lunch.

700
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,550
好吗
All right?

701
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,600
只是吃点东西
Or just eat something as well.

702
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,430
- 喂 凯  - 电话
- Hey, Kay!  - Phone!

703
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,680
- 怎么了  - 电话
- What?  - Phone, please.

704
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,810
- 那一个 谢谢你  - 那部电话要我接吗
- That one. Thank you.  - You want me to answer it?

705
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,690
你好
Hello.

706
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,480
瓦肖矿业公司 你要找谁
Uh, Washoe Mining. How may I direct your call?

707
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,990
- 肯尼・威尔斯  - 请稍等
- Hi. Uh, Kenneth Wells, please.  - Please hold.

708
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:14,030
肯尼 找你的电话
Kenny, you got a call!

709
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,410
- 谢谢你 亲爱的  - 爱你 宝贝
- Thank you, dear.  - Love you, baby.

710
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,400
好的
All right.

711
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,660
我是肯尼・威尔斯
Kenny Wells.

712
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:24,500
我是纽约布朗＆托马斯公司的布莱恩・伍尔夫
This is Brian Woolf at Brown, Thomas in New York.

713
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,620
我是矿业和石油集团的
I'm with the minerals and oil group.

714
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,210
不会吧
No shit.

715
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,000
嗯
Uh-huh.

716
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,590
嗯
Uh-huh.

717
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,510
这很好 布莱恩
Well, that sounds outstanding, Brian.

718
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,100
告诉你
And let me tell you something.

719
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,810
我很期待
I'm looking forward to it.

720
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:44,980
好的
All right.

721
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,900
他们要收购我
They're fucking flying me out.

722
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,400
他们要收购我
They're fucking flying me out.

723
00:45:58,450 --> 00:45:59,940
来吧
Come on!

724
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,830
在我看来
Yeah, the way I see it,

725
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,580
银行是干什么的 谁知道呢
what banks do... who knows?

726
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,960
但建成这个国家的不是那些西装革履的人
But what made this country is not tight asses in suits...

727
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,590
无意冒犯 先消消气
No offense... Taking the easy way down,

728
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,630
而是我和迈克这样的实干家
but guys like me and Mike who jump.

729
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,130
我们现在搞的
What we have

730
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,510
是非公开配售
is a private placement in play here.

731
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,470
己经有超过百分之五十被订购了
Already over 50% subscribed.

732
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,640
如果一切顺利的话
Now, if the numbers keep coming in good,

733
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,480
这是肯定的
which... they're fucking going to,

734
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,190
天空是这件事的极限
the sky is the limit on this thing.

735
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,810
你不必向我们推销 我们做过调查
You don't have to sell us. We've done the math.

736
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,030
我相信你们发现的
We believe you're sitting on

737
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,820
是十年来最大的金矿
the largest gold find of the decade.

738
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:38,280
我可以坦白说吗 威尔斯先生
May I speak plainly, Mr. Wells?

739
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,780
当然 布莱恩 这是唯一的交谈方式
Of course, Brian. That's the only way to speak.

740
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:43,160
我们的客户希望能看到切实可行的计划
Our clients are going to want to see a serious plan

741
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:46,670
能把一个不稳定地区的化验结果
to turn lab results in a volatile region

742
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,210
变成我们愿意押上自己声誉的投资
into an investment we can all stake our reputations on.

743
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,200
这不成问题
It's not going to be a problem.

744
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,620
不这不是问题本身
No, it's not a problem, per se,

745
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,120
但事实是你们两个都没有
but the fact remains that neither of you have taken

746
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,970
把这么大规模的金矿投入生产
a find of this magnitude through production.

747
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,170
等一下 布莱恩
Wait just a minute there, Brian.

748
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,800
我们发现了金矿 我们可以开采
We-we found it, we can dig it up.

749
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,380
没什么复杂的 实际上从历史上看
It's not that complicated. Actually,

750
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,380
这种事有可能极为复杂
historically, we found it could be quite complicated,

751
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:06,130
我们希望有机会
and we'd like the opportunity

752
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:09,270
帮你们制定经营计划
to help you formulate how you present the operation side.

753
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,810
你具体是什么意思
Wh-what-what exactly does that mean?

754
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,440
我希望两位考虑
I'd like you both to consider

755
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:17,100
增加一个战略合作伙伴
bringing on a strategic partner.

756
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,690
噢
Oh.

757
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,570
好
All right.

758
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,410
你们有没有谁
Have any of you ever

759
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,750
穿着你们手工制造的休闲鞋
set one of your... your handmade loafers

760
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,920
亲自下过山洞
down in the hole in the side of a mountain?

761
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,750
- 没有  - 但我们有
- No.  - No. We have.

762
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,340
瓦肖公司有这传统
Washoe has history.

763
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,710
我们对瓦肖公司做过相当详尽的分析
We've done a fairly thorough analysis of Washoe,

764
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,840
威尔斯先生我们觉得你们需要战略帮助
Mr. Wells, and we feel like you need strategic help.

765
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:43,130
不 没门 这是新时代
No. No way. No. This is a new day, all right?

766
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,380
而印尼是完全不同的
And Indonesia is goddamn different.

767
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,730
我们可以帮你把金子运下山
We can help you get off the side of that mountain.

768
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,930
我不需要帮助
I don't need any help

769
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,040
就能把金子运下山
getting off the side of the goddamn mountain.

770
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,850
这事我能摆平
I can land this plane.

771
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:54,070
我能
I can't

772
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,780
威尔斯来找我
Wells came and found me.

773
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,650
我得承认 我当时正处于低谷
I was at a low point, I have to admit.

774
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,400
在这一行是常事 有起有伏
It happens in this business, ups and downs.

775
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,650
但他资助了我用他的晨后一分钱
But he backed me with his last cent,

776
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:09,030
不仅如此他还冒着生命危险
and more than that, he risked his life,

777
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,870
差点搭上自己的命
almost lost it, actually.

778
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,750
有一段时间是挺悬的
It was touch and go there for a bit.

779
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,670
而现在我们抓住了牛角
And now we have the bull by its horns.

780
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,970
那可是很大的牛角
And, boys, they're big fucking horns.

781
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,550
我跟最优秀的人合作过
I've worked with the best,

782
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,000
我可以告诉你们肯尼・威尔斯就是其中一员
and I can tell you Kenny Wells is up there with them.

783
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,130
我们绝不是
We're not by any stretch of the imagination

784
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,510
让你们退居二线
suggesting at this moment that anybody take a backseat.

785
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,930
- 只是考虑一下战略伙伴  - 绝不可能
- Just be open to strategic alliances.  - No fucking...

786
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,240
方法！
way!

787
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,810
这是我的钱
It's a dime out of every one of my dollars,

788
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,690
不是你们的钱
not your dollars!

789
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,150
我刚就己经拒绝了
I said no a second ago.

790
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,690
如果你们想投资 我们有金矿
You want to invest? We got the gold.

791
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,240
我们可以谈
We can talk about it.

792
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,950
并不需要什么伙伴
Don't need a fucking partner. I know that.

793
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,450
关于这种事
You know, there's something about...

794
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,950
找到金矿
finding gold...

795
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,420
其困难程度是无法用语言描述的
that is so difficult to put into words.

796
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,750
非常的难
It's real difficult.

797
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,130
要靠舌头来品尝
Taste of it on your tongue.

798
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,720
靠手指来触摸
The feel of it between your fingers,

799
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,090
电击般的感觉
it's... it's electric.

800
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,310
就像是毒品
It's like a drug,

801
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,770
因为能让你上瘾
'cause it hooks you.

802
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,060
而这正是你们在城市里体验不到的
And it's precisely what you're missing here in the city.

803
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,520
所以我们之间才很难交谈
It's what makes it so hard for us to have this conversation

804
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:22,110
因为你们从未有过这种感觉
because you have never felt it.

805
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,830
我给你们个建议
So I have a proposal for you.

806
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,820
把你们的机构投资者找来
Put together your institutional players,

807
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,320
那些掌管大笔资金的人
the guys who rep the big money.

808
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,500
谁想实地感受一下的话
Whoever needs to kick the tires on this thing.

809
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,790
我会带他们去河上做一次旅行
I will take them on a little trip up the river.

810
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,630
那么 是阿科斯塔
So... it was Acosta

811
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,130
提出的去Kensana的公费旅游？
who proposed the-the junket in Kensana?

812
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,800
还是你们一起商量的办法
Or did you cook that up together?

813
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,470
詹宁斯你不明白
Oh, Jennings, you're... you're not getting it.

814
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,440
我们不觉得需要商量任何办法
Look, we-we didn't feel like we had to cook up anything.

815
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,850
四面八方的人都来主动找我
I mean, I had people coming at me from all sides.

816
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,770
我的邻居哈特・哈伯德
My-my neighbor, Hart Hubbard,

817
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,770
他是草坪护理专业人员
he's a lawn care professional.

818
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,990
平时只担心凯的桑树
Usually only worried about Kay's mulberry tree

819
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,530
伸到他家的院子里来
leaning over the back of his fence,

820
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,900
但现在 他也用起了采矿术语
but now he's dropping mining terms.

821
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,830
喂 肯尼 Kensana河的金矿纯度是多少
"Hey, Kenny, how's the grade purity over there at Kensana?

822
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,620
我听说很高 样品频率是多少
I hear it's great. How about the core frequency?"

823
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:16,160
这是哈特・哈伯德的话一个以修剪草坪为业的人
Hart fucking Hubbard. He mows grass for a living.

824
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,670
- 我们询问过哈伯德先生  - 总之我的意思是
- We interviewed Mr. Hubbard.  - What I'm saying is we didn't

825
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,130
我们不需要想什么办法
think we needed to cook up anything.

826
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,340
谁都想投资
Everybody wanted in.

827
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,300
那么 的确是阿斯科特提出来的银行家旅游？
So it was Acosta who proposed the banker junket?

828
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,560
是的
Yes.

829
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,720
这招很高明
It was a genius move.

830
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,310
出了机场之后
Now, you get outside,

831
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,530
你们要跟紧我 看好自己的饯包
stick close to me and hang on to your wallets.

832
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,860
不坐 不坐
Come on, come on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

833
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,690
走开走开
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.

834
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,410
他来了
There he is.

835
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,750
诸位这是迈克・阿科斯塔
Gentlemen, Mike Acosta.

836

格伦

839
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,380
杰夫・杰克逊
Jeff Jackson.

840
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,590
如果谁想反悔的话
If any one of you wants to turn back,

841
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,080
现在还来得及
this is your chance.

842
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,460
什么
What's that?

843
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:11,510
他吓唬你们呢 欢迎来到印尼
He's just messing with you. Welcome to Indo, boys.

844
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,010
我们发现金矿后
When we got the hit,

845
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,140
以此为中心在四周勘探
we stepped out in a radiating pattern

846
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:19,230
直到我们确定金矿的范围
and we kept going until we had the definitive picture.

847
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,890
我们在描绘地下地质学
We're mapping the underlying geology.

848
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:25,570
样品被切成块 然后粉碎
The cores are cut into sections, and then crushed.

849
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,700
然后包装 密封
They are then bagged and sealed.

850
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:33,690
这笼子全天有人看守
This cage is guarded 24/7.

851
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:36,820
保安把样品护送到下游
Under guard, the samples are sent down river

852
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,320
加里曼丹的独立化验室
to independent labs in Kalimantan.

853
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,580
如果密封受到任何破坏
If a seal is broken or damaged in any way,

854
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,750
根据法律 化验室就必须舍弃整个样品
the lab, by law, has to discard the entire sample.

855
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,710
所有安保措施都己经到位
Every safeguard has been put in place

856
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,800
来确保整个过程的安全
to assure the security of the process.

857
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:52,670
金刚石锯条 碎石机
Diamond-tipped saw blades, rock crushers.

858
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,300
从大地深处取出的样品
Core samples being ripped from the guts of the Earth.

859
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,260
这一切听起来都不错 不过
It all sounds great, but...

860
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,680
你们还是想看看金子
you boys want to see some gold.

861
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:09,570
我竟然在干这种事
No one's going to believe this shit.

862
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,280
你怎么看
So, what do you think?

863
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,940
不确定 你呢
Not sure. What about you?

864
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,740
阿斯科特感觉是个懂行的人
Acosta seems to know what he's talking about,

865
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,700
但另一位就难说了
but, uh, I don't know.

866
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,780
喂喂
Hey. Hey.

867
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,080
过来 过来
Come here, come here.

868
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,750
我好像有所发现
I think I... I think I got something.

869
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,430
看这个
See this?

870
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,690
多一些这种东西
Few more like this,

871
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,020
就足以铺设华尔街的道路
you can pave Wall Street.

872
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,610
当杰克逊淘出那个金块的时候
When Jackson pulled that nugget out,

873
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,950
他们都信服了
we had 'em.

天啊
Oh, my goodness.

888
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,220
你意外吗
You surprised?

889
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,770
是啊
Yeah.

890
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,190
这是你最喜欢的花吧
It's your favorite flower, right?

891
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,890

我想死你了
I have missed you so much.

895
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,120
别提有多想了
You have no idea.

896
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,170
这是不是你睡过的最软的床单
Are these the softest sheets you've ever felt?

897
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,340

两个我在世上最喜欢的人
Two of my favorite people in the world.

911
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,420
他为了去见你 还偷了我的表

915
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:22,420
对 没开玩笑
No, I'm not.

916
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,550
因为不知道时间 我先闪人了

917
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,850
见到你太好了 迈克

918
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,140
- 你肯定很自豪  - 那当然

在这个我们一直密切追踪报道的事件中
In the story we've been following very closely,

925

926
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,590
可能是本年度最佳股票

927
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,930
在纽约证券交易所
On their first day

928
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,930
第一天上市瓦肖矿业

929
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,810

933
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,330
这和钱都是祖传的基因

934

935
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,980
这是真事
True fucking story.

936
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,400
在座的谁想知道
Who at this table wants to know the secret

937
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:02,310
赌球赢钱的秘诀是什么
to winning bets at pro football?

938
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,200
- 什么秘诀  - 每次都押东海岸球队
- What's that?  - Take the east coast team

939
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,680
知道为什么吗
every fucking time. You know why?

940
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:09,410
因为西海岸球队在午夜之后才开球
The west coast team... to them, they're playing after midnight.

941
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,930
- 我是瑞秋・希尔  - 嗯

944
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,810
- 投资者公关  - 嗯
- Investor relations.  - Mm.

945
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,480
布朗＆托马斯公司团队的

946
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,940
不错 你肯定是
Cheers to that. You got to be the best-looking one

947
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,980
团队中最漂亮的一个
on the team, I'll tell you that.

948
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:45,780
就像一只醉酒的浣熊
It's like a drunk raccoon

949
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,280
手上拿着蓝宝石
got a hold of the Hope diamond.

950
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:49,040
不能离它太近了
You don't want to get too close,

951
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,000
但也不能让浣熊跑了
but you're not going to let it get away either.

952
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,910
- 这是你的浣熊  - 嗯
- It's your raccoon.  - Mm.

953
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,380
你让它经营一家数十亿美元的公司？
You let it run a multi-billion-dollar company?

954
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,710
怎么 失去你这个客户
What, and lose you as a client

955
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,380
和我一半的业务？
and half the rest of my business?

956
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,790
怎样都是有风险的
There's risks and there's risks.

957
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,130
但也依然是件好事
Still, it was a good fucking day.

958
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,590
谁想请我喝一杯
Now, who wants to buy me a drink?

959
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,340
三杯杜松子酒
Three double shots of Jack.

960
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:10,420
告诉我赤手空拳
So tell me, to go out into the wilderness

961
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,800
走入荒野
with your bare hands

962
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,350
发现了人人都想要的东西
and discover something that everybody wants...

963
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,400
这是什么感觉
how does that feel?

964
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,860
我来敬杯酒
I, uh... propose a toast.

965
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,850
好
Hear, hear.

966
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:28,280
敬给一种经常被误解的小动物
To a small creature, often misunderstood.

967
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,990
敬给浣熊
To the raccoon.

968
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:49,000
我的天
Well, fuck me.

969
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,020
金河
River of gold.

970
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,520
一不小心
The thing is, if you don't watch it,

971
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,180
就会被金子迷住
gold will grow on you.

972
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,150
- 我现在能明白了  - 嗯
- I can see that now.  - Mm.

973
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,530
- 我不想谈  - 什么…
- I don't want to talk about it.  - What did...

974
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,870
我什么都没干
I wasn't doing anything.

975
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:12,950
我说了不想谈
I said I don't want to talk about it!

976
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,990
我能怎么样
Well, what the fuck should I have done, huh?

977
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,660
还能把她压在桌子上
Just bend her over the table right there

978
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,000
大庭广众之下开始干？
and fucking banged her in front of everybody?

979
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,490
反正你醉酒后也硬不起来
You are too drunk to get it up anyway.

980
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,670
这可不一定 亲爱的
I'll take that challenge, baby.

981
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,790
我不关心你跟那个隆胸女调情
I don't care about you flirting with Miss Pneumatic 1988.

982
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:27,880
你以为我没见过这种事吗
You think I haven't seen that shit before, Kenny?

983
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,380
她的胸部很小
She had tiny little fucking titties.

984
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,760
你觉得不是真的？
You don't think they were real?

985
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:34,100
不 这些事都不是真的
No, none of this is real. None of it.

986
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:35,340
你为什么这么…
Why are you fucking...

987
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,090
我们成功了
We made it!

988
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:40,100
- 倒霉  - 老婆 你干什么
- Shit.  - Baby, what the fuck?!

989
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,560
你知道你的问题所在吗
You know what your problem is, Kay?

990
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,030
- 不知道 你还是告诉我吧  - 你没有见识
- No. Why don't you tell me.  - You've got no vision.

991
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,820
知道吗 没有见识
Right? Fucking vision.

992
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,200
你的见识也就这么高
Your vision starts right here, and it goes to right here.

993
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:57,740
这里是厨房水槽
Right here is the fucking kitchen sink,

994
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,580
而这里就是家具店
and right here's the goddamn parking lot

995
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:01,950
的停车场
at the furniture store.

996
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,580
- 来吧  - 你是指那种
- Come on.  - You mean an actual job

997
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,670
能养家蝴口的工作吗
that would support a person in the place they live?

998
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,170
你是指这种见识吗
You mean that vision?

999
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,550
知道吗 你去死
You know what? Fuck you.

1000
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,970
- 我去死  - 你去死
- Ah, Kay, fuck me.  - Fuck you.

1001
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,390
你去死 怎么
Fuck you. Fuck... Wh-wh-what, what?

1002
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:18,230
你看不懂这里的事吗
Don't you see what's happening here?

1003
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:19,390
好吧
Oh, great. Go... Yeah, yeah.

1004
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,520
收拾你的行李吧 回到你的贫穷生活
Pack your shit, run back to your shitty life, huh?

1005
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,110
- 我还挺喜欢我的贫穷生活  - 哎呀
- You know what? I like my shitty life.  - Christ.

1006
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,350
- 那是我的生活  - 你就省省吧
- It's mine.  - Fucking giving this up.

1007
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:28,980
你一直想要一只断腿的乌
You always wanted a broken bird, didn't you?

1008
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,570
虽然说的好听 但在心里
Said the right things, but in here,

1009
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,860
你一直不相信我是不是
you never fucking believed in me, did you?

1010
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,660
你一直不相信我 是不是
You never believed in me, did you, Kay?

1011
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,460
你喜欢我失败 是不是
Hmm? You like me losing, don't you?

1012
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,580
- 你怎么能说这种话  - 这能让你感到舒服些
- How can you even say that?  - It makes you feel comfortable,

1013
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,200
这让你心理平衡
doesn't it? Does it feel comfortable, Kay?

1014
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:48,750
这些人在利用你
These people are using you.

1015
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,470
- 他们不在乎你  - 我他妈的不…
- They don't care about you.  - I don't fucking...

1016
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,550
更是不相信你
And they certainly don't believe in you.

1017
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,970
- 可我找到了金矿  - 该死的…
- Yeah, but, Kay, I found gold.  - Goddamn...

1018
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,260
现在我们是赢家
Now we're winning, babe.

1019
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,310
你就不能让我成为赢家吗
Would you just let me have the win?

1020
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,480
我们是赢家
We're winning!

1021
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:11,570
你就没想过我心里有数吗
It ever occur to you that I know what I'm doing?

1022
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,860
希望你有数
I hope you do.

1023
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,440
嗯？
Huh?

1024
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,570
我有数
I do.

1025
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:21,910
- 我爱的是你的心  - 嗯
- I love what's in there...  - Mm.

1026
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,830
超出你的想像
More than you'll ever know.

1027
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,380
这些人会玩死你
These guys are going to tear you up.

1028
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,330
嗯
Mm.

1029
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:34,300
我不想眼睁睁看着后面的事情
Don't ask me to watch what happens next.

1030
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:36,550
我心里有数凯
I know what I'm doing, Kay.

1031
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,510
我心里有数
I know what I'm fucking doing.

1032
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,680
你接下来做了什么 威尔斯
What'd you do next, Wells?

1033
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,940
我做了什么？
What did I do?

1034
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:56,270
我顺其自然
I rode it.

1035
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:01,530
我顺其自然 詹宁斯
I rode it, Jennings.

1036
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:21,390
双份的施格兰加冰
Another double. Seagram's on the rocks.

1037
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:23,180
是的
Yes, sir.

1038
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,480
我也要一杯
And I'll have the same.

1039
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,720
天 你不必讨好我
Oh, goddamn. You don't have to impress me.

1040
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:31,730
让我想起我的童年
Reminds me of my childhood.

1041
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,770
迷人的肯尼・威尔斯
So how is everything

1042
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:37,320
一切都好吗
in the very enchanted world of Kenny Wells?

1043
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:39,780
我感觉非常好
I feel like a million bucks,

1044
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:42,240
还要再乘上几百倍
only a few hundred times better.

1045
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,750
那肯定是很棒的感觉
That must be a very nice feeling.

1046
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,000
看来这里的人
Yeah. It looks like there's a...

1047
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,290
也有几个是类似的感觉
a few other people around here with a similar feeling.

1048
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,330
也许吧
Mm, maybe.

1049
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,430
也许不是
Maybe not.

1050
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:03,350
你这种人怎么到了这里
How does someone like yourself end up, uh, here?

1051
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,260
我认识汤姆
I know Tom.

1052
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,640
汤姆是我的朋友
Tom is a friend.

1053
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:08,810
- 那是肯定的  - 是吗？
- Oh, I bet he is.  - Now, now.

1054
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,730
我住在他表弟迪米那里
I stay with his cousin, Timmy, down the lane.

1055
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:15,100
迪米是个很不寻常的人
Timmy's really quite a character,

1056
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,780
只要了解了他的话
if you get to know him.

1057
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,400
我不认识迪米
I don't know Timmy.

1058
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:23,240
我现在不想说话
I don't really feel like talking.

1059
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:26,120
只想感受
Let's just feel things.

1060
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,380
威尔斯
Wells.

1061
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:37,590
- 肯尼・威尔斯？ - 嗯
- Kenny Wells?  - Uh-huh.

1062
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,210
我是马克・汉考克
Mark Hancock.

1063
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:42,380
看来正赶上你不方便的时候 威尔斯先生
Seems I've caught you at a bit of a disadvantage, Mr. Wells.

1064
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,890
这取决于你怎么看了
Depends on how you look at it.

1065
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,010
我是肯尼・威尔斯 马克
Kenny goddamn Wells, Mark.

1066
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:50,180
这是瑞秋
This is Rachel.

1067
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,160
我认识美女瑞秋
Oh, I know the lovely Rachel. You know, this son of a bitch here,

1068
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,310
他控制的金子比世上任何人都多
he controls more gold than anybody on the goddamn planet.

1069
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:59,780
现在可能是例外 韦尔斯先生
With the possible exception now of Mr. Wells.

1070
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,370
成功就是这样的吧
This is how it happens, huh?

1071
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,950
成功就是这样的
This is how it happens.

1072
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:13,540
我的天
Goddamn.

1073
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:30,300
我还能说什么
What can I tell you?

1074
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,140
- 这是个宽厚的条件  - 这是个笑话
- Kenny, it's a generous offer.  - It's a fucking joke!

1075
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,230
这个…
Let's-let's take this...

1076
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,940
这不是协议 布莱恩 这是强奸
This isn't a deal, Brian. This is a goddamn rape.

1077
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:38,280
- 听我说  - 不 这是我的
- Listen... listen to me.  - No, no, this is mine!

1078
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:40,400
是我的 是我找到的
It's mine! I-I found it!

1079
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,490
是我和迈克在现场
Me and Mike. We were the ones up to our ass

1080
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:45,330
忍受着泥泞和疟疾
in the mud and the shit and the malaria.

1081
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,860
这混蛋却只给我少数股权？
And this little prick offers a minority partnership?

1082
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,740
肯尼 你要往好处想
Kenny, let's keep some perspective here, okay?

1083
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,710
任何时候有人给你这么一大笔钱
Whenever anybody offers this amount of money,

1084
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:52,910
都是好交易
it's a good day.

1085
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,410
你可以接受 也可以拒绝
You may say yes, you may say no,

1086
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:56,290
反正没人是故意跟你过不去
but it's not like anybody's trying to offend you.

1087
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,840
这是办不到的
Well, mission goddamn not accomplished.

1088
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,670
汉考克＆纽波特控股公司有这方面的专长
Hancock and Newport Holdings have the expertise

1089
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,510
和经验把金子带回国
and the experience to bring this home.

1090
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,420
- 总有可能发生意外事件的  - 不
- This was always there as a contingency.  - No, no.

1091
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:05,390
- 你是知道的  - 不 不
- You know that.  - No, no, no.

1092
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:07,680
这是瓦肖矿业公司的业务
This is when Washoe Mining becomes a player,

1093
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:09,340
就是我们
right here, right fucking now.

1094
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,890
而不是汉考克＆纽波特控股公司的
Not Mark fucking Hancock and Newport Holdings.

1095
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,520
上面连我的名字都没有 布莱恩
I don't even see our name on here, Brian.

1096
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,180
你们去掉了我的名字
You took our fucking name...

1097
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,640
去掉了我的名字
you took my name off it.

1098
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:22,190
你退一步想
But if we take a step back here,

1099
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,030
急流勇退
wouldn't it not be terrible

1100
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,990
享受你的成功难道不好吗
to sit back and enjoy your success?

1101
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,740
难道不好吗
"Wouldn't it not be terrible"?

1102
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:30,120
那他妈的怎么能说这种话 布莱恩
What the fuck kind of way of talking is that, Brian?

1103
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,710
我这么弯下腰
W-W-Wouldn't it not be terrible

1104
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,030
被你爆菊花
if I bend over and grab my ankles

1105
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,080
难道不好吗
so you could fuck me up the ass?

1106
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,420
你们以为可以买断我 去掉我的名字？
You think you can buy me out and take my name?

1107
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:39,540
把肯尼・威尔斯扔到玉米田里？
Or just throw Kenny Wells to the fucking cornfield?

1108
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,630
去你的吧 布莱恩
Fuck you, Brian.

1109
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,300
如果你能冷静冷静
If we hit pause for a second

1110
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:47,800
不带感情色彩的考虑一下
and consider, without emotion,

1111
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,470
我想你会明白
I think you'll realize

1112
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,300
这是那种少有的时刻
that this is one of those very rare moments

1113
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,810
只要你签个字 你所有家人
where, with a stroke of a pen, no one in your family...

1114
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:57,980
包括你的曾孙一辈
I'm talking your children's grandchildren...

1115
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:01,350
就再也不会缺钱了
Will ever have to worry about money again.

1116
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:28,170
看我这双手 布莱恩
You see these hands, Brian?

1117
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:31,300
这是我父亲的手
These are my father's hands.

1118
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:33,350
我曾用这双手
I have scratched and clawed through the hot earth

1119
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,810
摸爬滚打
with these hands,

1120
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:38,480
也会用这双手打垮你
and I will bury you with these hands.

1121
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:44,980
你去告诉那个阴险小人马克・汉考克
Now, you go tell that silky sable, Mark Hancock...

1122
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,780
他是在肯尼・威尔斯手下做事
he works for Kenny Wells.

1123
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:51,650
这是我的日子
My fucking day.

1124
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:53,400
我的日子
My day!

1125
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:04,750
我几乎有点敬重这家伙了
You know, I almost respect this guy.

1126
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,040
这是个很愚蠢的
That was a pretty foolish

1127
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,540
商业决策是不是
business decision, wasn't it?

1128
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,470
你当时几乎一贫如洗
You're a foot away from living in your car.

1129
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,060
却拒绝了三亿美元？
You turned down $300 million?

1130
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:16,640
只为了冠名权？
Over naming rights?

1131
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,860
是的
Yeah, I did.

1132
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:28,480
因为那样Kensana会成了纽波特公司的金矿
Because Kensana would become a Newport Mine, right?

1133
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:30,860
马克・汉考克会名垂青史
And Mark fucking Hancock's Midas touch continues.

1134
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,330
而我肯尼・威尔斯
Me, Kenny Wells,

1135
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,160
一个幸运的家伙醉酒摔倒了
the-the lucky bastard who fell down drunk

1136
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,660
醒来后躺在一堆现金里不行
and woke up in a pile of cash. No.

1137
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,090
这是我的梦想
It was my dream.

1138
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:46,330
我梦到的
I dreamed it.

1139
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:52,800
如果连梦想都能卖
You sell your dream...

1140
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:55,140
你还能剩下什么
what do you have left?

1141
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,810
早上好 斯泰西 你今天好吗
Good morning, Stacy. How are you today?

1142
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,270
- 很好  - 罗尼也好吗
- Good.  - How's Ronnie? Good?

1143
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,980
- 谢谢你  - 好的 肯尼
- Thank you.  - Okay. Mm. Kenny.

1144
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,190
是迈克快来
Mike's on the line. Come on.

1145
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,020
- 迈克打来电话  - 快点
- Mike, hang on. Kenny... Kenny's here.  - Come on!

1146
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:48,310
- 是迈克 出事了  - 嗯？
- It's Mike. It's a fucking shit-storm.  - Mm.

1147
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:49,940
迈克 怎么了
Mikey, what's up?

1148
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,070
他们正封锁金矿
They're locking us out.

1149
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,610
- 什么  - 他们正封锁金矿
- They're what?  - They're locking us out!

1150
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:53,650
军队来了
The military's here.

1151
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:54,900
他们正在接管金矿
They're taking over the mine.

1152
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,200
你和汉考克开会时发生了什么
What happened at your meeting with Hancock?

1153
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,860
开会时发生了什么 肯尼
What happened at the meeting, Kenny?!

1154
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,660
听着 迈克 他们试图把我们排挤出去
Listen, Mike, they-they were trying to push us out.

1155
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,750
排挤出去 你什么意思
Push us out? Wha-What do you mean, push us out?

1156
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,000
他们去掉了我们的名字 迈克
They took... they took our names off it, Mike.

1157
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:09,460
你我的名字 都被他们去掉了
Mine and yours. They took our fucking names off.

1158
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,010
你这蠢货
Aw, you fucking moron!

1159
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,840
他们不能随便撒销开矿许可证吧
They can't... can't just revoke the-the permit, all right?

1160
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:14,840
不能就这么夺走
They can't just steal it away.

1161
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,220
什么 怎么回事？
Kenny, what? What the fuck is going on?

1162
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:17,680
他们当然能撒销许可证
Of course they can revoke the permit!

1163
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:19,470
苏哈托想怎样就怎样
Suharto can do whatever the fuck he wants!

1164
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,260
喂 喂
Hey! Hey!

1165
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:24,690
- 迈克  - 肯尼 发生了什么
- Mike!  - Kenny, what's going on?

1166
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:26,520
- 发生什么了  - 嘘
- What the fuck is going on?  - Shh!

1167
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,810
- 迈克 迈克  - 肯尼 我们失去了金矿
- Mike. Mike.  - Kenny, we lost the site.

1168
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,190
我跟你说过的
I told you, man.

1169
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,440
你很清楚我们是在跟什么人打交道
You knew exactly who we were dealing with.

1170
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,690
这些人杀人不眨眼
These people are killers.

1171
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,910
尤其是汉考克
Hancock first among them.

1172
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,330
我跟你说过的
I told you, Kenny.

1173
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,670
- 现在金矿没了  - 啊…
- Now it's gone.  - Uh...

1174
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:57,090
后来发现纽波特控股公司
So it turns out that in addition

1175
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,310
不仅和苏哈托
to having, um, longstanding ties

1176
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:00,850
有长期关系
with Suharto...

1177
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:03,560
其公司董事会成员
Newport Holdings actually had on its board

1178
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:06,560
还有一位美国前总统
a certain ex-president of the United States.

1179
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:08,900
他也参加过
Who was also...

1180
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:11,440
苏哈托的一次婚礼
in one of Suharto's weddings...

1181
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:13,020
还是伴郎
as a groomsman.

1182
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,070
他们一方面利诱我
So you see, that whole time they're telling me

1183
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,940
说我的子孙后代不缺钱
how rich my grandkids are gonna be,

1184
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,410
另一方面还有个B计划
they got a backup plan.

1185
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,820
把我兜里的钱都抢走
They're gonna pick my pocket and steal it all away.

1186
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,460
瓦肖矿业在今天开盘后
Washoe stock was off nearly 50 points

1187
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,260
下跌近五十点
at the opening bell this morning

1188
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:43,970
因为有报道称 苏哈托政府废除了
on news of the Suharto government's revocation

1189
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,560
瓦肖公司的开矿权
of Washoe's exploration rights.

1190
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:49,570
公司总栽肯尼・威尔斯…
President and CEO, Kenny Wells, has not...

1191
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:52,150
这些骗子 他们生生的抢走了
All fucking con men. They stole it's what they did.

1192
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,690
他们抢走了
They goddamn stole it.

1193
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,000
嗯
Mm.

1194
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:04,030
你需要回家 肯尼
You're gonna need to go home, Kenny.

1195
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:06,160
再给我倒一杯 罗伊
Just pour me a goddamn drink, Roy.

1196
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,290
回家去吧 肯尼
Go home, Kenny.

1197
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,460
是我们
This is us.

1198
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,960
现在无法接听电话
We can't get to the phone...

1199
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:25,810
打错了
Wrong number.

1200
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:35,230
是我们
This is us.

1201
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,200
现在无法接听电话
We can't get to the phone right now.

1202
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,730
请留言
You know what to do.

1203
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,240
嗨 凯
Hey, hey, Kay.

1204
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:44,780
是我
It's me. Uh...

1205
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,740
你可能不在家
I-I-I-I guess you're not home,

1206
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,040
现在
you know, right now.

1207
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:53,830
我打电话只是
I was... and I was just calling...

1208
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,880
我只是想听到你的声音
Honey, I really... I want to hear your voice.

1209
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:03,130
我办砸了
I s... I-I screwed up, Kay.

1210
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:08,640
我本想做出一番成就
I want... I wanted to build something.

1211
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,440
能永恒的成就
Something real that would last...

1212
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:15,230
能留下你和我
last for you and me and...

1213
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,600
和父亲的名字
for Dad.

1214
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:29,160
这就是我想做的
That's all I wanted to do.

1215
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,880
但你说的对
But you were right, you know?

1216
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:34,870
你说的对
You were right.

1217
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,670
又说中了
Again.

1218
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,220
我爱你 凯
I love you, Kay.

1219
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:46,630
我不再骚扰你了
Mm, I'm gonna... I'm gonna stop now.

1220
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:48,630
我不会再
I'm-I'm not gonna call...

1221
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:51,180
不会再给你打电话了
I'm not gonna call you anymore.

1222
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,110
天啊 是他吗
Oh, my God, is that him?

1223
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,190
对 是阿科斯塔
Yeah, that's Acosta.

1224
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,980
跟照片上不太一样
He looks different in person.

1225
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,660
他不是在印尼吗
Isn't he supposed to be in Indonesia?

1226
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,240
他在哪里？
Where is he?

1227
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,750
你在这里啊
Here you are.

1228
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:21,300
起来
Get up!

1229
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,420
你不是我的公司老板
You don't own my fucking company just 'cause you...

1230
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:26,170
别踢我了
Quit fucking kicking me.

1231
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:29,220
听这傲慢的口气 我就知道是谁来了
I didn't know who it was till I heard the cocky fucking talk.

1232
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,100
- 啊？ - 你这白痴
- Ah?  - Fucking moron.

1233
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,020
是吗 你要跟我打吗
Oh, yeah? You're gonna fight?

1234
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,890
是吗 你想打架吗
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, you want to fight?

1235
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:36,390
你想打架？
Yeah, you want to fight now?

1236
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:38,190
在我失去了公司之后？
After losing my fucking company?

1237
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,440
你想打架？你想打架？
You want to fight now? Yeah, you want to fight?

1238
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:43,200
是吗是吗
Yeah? Yeah?

1239
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:57,910
你知道别人怎么说你吗
You know what they say?

1240
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:01,290
说你是酒鬼
That you're a drunk.

1241
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:03,510
是小丑
A clown.

1242
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,880
不自量力
Out of your league.

1243
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:12,100
他们去死
Yeah, well, fuck them. Yeah, fuck them.

1244
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:13,560
知道吗 你也去死
You know what? Fuck you, too.

1245
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,980
你以为我想听你这个专家
You think I want to hear from the fucking golden boy

1246
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:17,560
高傲的站在那里
standing there in his golden glow

1247
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:20,320
教训我事情有多糖糕吗
telling me how messed up everything is? Huh?

1248
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:22,110
滚回你在
No, go fucking back to your perch

1249
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,110
雅加达皇宫酒店的住处吧
at the Jakarta Palace, huh?

1250
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,950
你可以用你的直觉
Huh? You can use that instinct of yours

1251
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,990
跟别人去找别的矿
to find some new strike with some new people.

1252
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,490
你是这么想的吗
Is that what you think?

1253
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:34,040
我了解你小子 你是迈克・阿科斯塔
I know you, man. You're Mike fucking Acosta.

1254
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:37,580
混蛋
Prick.

1255
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,410
好吧
Okay.

1256
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,550
我告诉你当时的真相
Let me tell you what really happened.

1257
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:51,590
我们在苏拉威西岛北部
We're in North Sulawesi.

1258
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:54,090
季风季节
Monsoon season.

1259
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:56,090
当时是一九八年
It's 1980.

1260
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,350
是的
Yeah.

1261
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,230
那次著名的铜矿发现
The famous copper strike.

1262
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:03,690
其实我们本来是寻找铝土矿
Only we was looking for bauxite.

1263
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:11,030
在前往钻探地点的路上
On my way to... where I'm planning to drill,

1264
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,120
我们的车陷住了
I get us stuck.

1265
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:17,120
五英尺的泥
Five feet of mud.

1266
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:20,000
我们日复一日的坐在雨中
We're just sitting in the rain day after day,

1267
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:22,130
都等到生锈了
watching the metal rust.

1268
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:28,430
你做了什么
What'd you do?

1269
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,420
根据瞎干总比
Under the theory that it's better

1270
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,640
不干强的理论 我就…
to do something than nothing, I...

1271
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:35,680
报告称 这里就是钻探地点
reported... this was the spot.

1272
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,520
后来这里就出名了
Nowhere became somewhere.

1273
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:46,270
你陷住的地方
The place you got stuck.

1274
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:51,780
我运气好
I got lucky.

1275
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:59,030
我喜欢这个故事
I fucking love that.

1276
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:06,720
你去寻找铝土矿却找到了铜矿
You went looking for bauxite, and you found copper.

1277
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:12,460
我去寻找金矿
I went looking for gold and...

1278
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,680
却找到了一个朋友
found a friend.

1279
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,800
这是我这辈子听过的
That is the single hokiest thing

1280
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:22,310
最肉麻的话了
I've ever heard in my life.

1281
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:27,440
你有什么办法
$0, you got a plan?

1282
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:29,320
你没有吗
Don't you?

1283
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,830
听着
So, get this.

1284
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,250
我们了解到苏哈托有个儿子
Turns out Suharto had a son,

1285
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,500
他的小儿子达尔马迪
his youngest, Darmadi,

1286
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:49,380
又名丹尼
AKA Danny.

1287
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:52,500
不务正业 很让他父亲头疼
Bit of a screw-up, real problem for the old man.

1288
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,880
很显然 我和他有共同语言
Mm, safe to say we understood each other.

1289
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:59,640
苏哈托一直想培养丹尼成业
So, Suharto had been trying to get Danny set up for years,

1290
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:02,300
但丹尼经营的公司都亏损严重
all right, but everything Danny touched turned to shit.

1291
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,180
我想如果我们能拉拢丹尼入伙
Now, I figure if we can bring Danny on board

1292
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,310
也许他能让他爸爸回心转意
as a partner, maybe he could get Daddy

1293
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:10,030
做出对我们有利的安排
to change his mind and swing things back our way.

1294
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,740
这是我们的无奈之举
Now, it was a Hail Mary from our own one-yard line,

1295
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:14,570
但这是我们唯一的办法
but it was all we had.

1296
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,110
还有一点有利的是
But it also didn't hurt

1297
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,990
某位美国前总统
that Danny had been regularly ignored

1298
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,660
一直看不起丹尼
by a certain ex-president of the United States

1299
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:23,040
他是丹尼父亲第三次婚礼中的伴郎
who was a groomsman at his father's third wedding

1300
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:27,250
也是纽波特控股公司的董事会成员
and also happened to sit on the board at Newport Holdings.

1301
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,920
有个人去了卡迪拉克专卖店
So, this guy goes to a Cadillac dealership.

1302
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:31,670
店老板出来问：先生
Right? Dealer comes out and he says, "Sir,

1303
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,260
你是在想买一辆凯迪拉克吗
are you thinking about buying a Cadillac?"

1304
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,250
他说：不 我肯定要买一辆卡迪拉克
He says, "No. I'm definitely buying a Cadillac.

1305
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:37,350
但我心里想的
"What I'm thinking about...

1306
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,270
是女人
is pussy."

1307
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:47,310
女人
Pussy.

1308
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,440
天
Mm. Oh, shit.

1309
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:59,660
凯迪拉克是
Cadillac is...

1310
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,910
女人的最爱
Pussy magnet.

1311
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,830
你也喜欢凯迪拉克？
You like Cadillacs.

1312
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,200
是的
Yeah!

1313
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:12,250
嗨 小心 小心
Hey! Heads up, right there. Oh!

1315
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,210
我要坐副驾驶座
I gotta ride shotgun.

1316
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,560
哈哈
Ha-ha!

1317
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,980

1325
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:43,330

1328

1332
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,230
人之常情啊
Fuck, well, it makes sense, huh?

1333
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:05,800
敬给威尔斯的父亲
To father of Wells.

1334
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:09,110
八五一五分成
85/15 Split,

1335
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:11,060
如果你有胆量的话
if you have the balls.

1336
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:12,890
五五分成我还可以考虑

1337
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:14,740
就这么定了
That's a fucking deal.

1338

You haven't heard?

1355
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,850
威尔斯谈下了生意
Wells cut a deal.

1356
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:56,560
生意？什么生意
A deal? What are you talking about?

1357
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:57,940
谁会跟他做生意
Who cut a deal with him?

1358
01:21:58,070 --> 01:22:01,030
苏哈托 印尼政府
Suharto. The Indonesian government.

1359
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:04,610
- 什么  - 瓦肖公司占有开采金矿的百分之十五
- What?  - Washoe retains 15% of the find.

1360
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:07,610
其它百分之八十五归苏哈托指定的一家公司
The other 85 goes to a company of Suharto's choosing,

1361
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:10,950
而这家公司的老板正是苏哈托的儿子
which just so happens to be owned by his son.

1362
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,740
- 威尔斯让我们前功尽弃  - 汉考克呢
- Wells cut us off at the knees.  - What about Hancock?

1363
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,080
他退出了 这个数目他竞争不过
He's out. Can't compete at that number.

1364
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:17,590
己经敲定了 布莱恩
Deal's done, Brian.

1365
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:20,000
现在威尔斯和阿科斯塔是史上最大金矿
Wells and Acosta are now the only outside partners

1366
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:22,260
唯一的外国合作伙伴
in the biggest gold strike in history.

1367
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:24,130
我们完全没有份
We represent exactly none of it.

1368
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,720
- 百分之十五也太少了  - 少吗
- 15% is a terrible deal.  - Is it?

1369
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:29,810
三百亿美元的百分之十五是多少
What's 15% of $30 billion?

1370
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:32,300
我可以解释 你见过他
I can explain. You met him.

1371

你没事的 布莱恩
You'll be fine, Brian.

1372
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,560
没你什么责任

我以为你回来时 只剩下一堆骨头
I was afraid you'd come home with a bone in your nose

1374
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:48,860
- 或一些狗屎样的东西  - 大家都好吗
- or some such shit.  - How are we doing?

1375

Massive gold strike,

1382
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,750
阻止了纽波特控股公司的收购
fending off a takeover by Newport Holdings.

1383
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:08,470
瓦肖矿业股价飘升
Washoe shares are soaring...

1384
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,170
耶
Oh, yeah!

1385
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:13,050
飘升 飘升
Soaring! Soaring!

1386
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:16,300
肯尼你能过来一下吗
Kenny! Can I see you a minute?

1387
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,310
什么事 克莱夫
What you got, Clive?

1388
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,030
我刚接到一个电话
I just got a call.

1389
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:25,070
全国探矿业协会
The National Association of Prospectors

1390
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,910
将把金镐奖授予你
is gonna honor you with the Golden Pickaxe.

1391
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,610
- 你是开玩笑吗  - 不是
- You shittin' me?  - No, I'm not.

1392
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:37,740
你现在成了世界上最优秀的探矿者了
You are now the best miner in the world.

1393
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,960
相信此刻你父亲在微笑着
And I'm sure somewhere your daddy is smiling.

1394
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:45,800
如果他没笑 我也会替他一起笑了
Well, goddamn, if he's not, I can smile for the both of us.

1395
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:47,340
啊
Ah...

1396
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:51,050
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

1397
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:52,800
去找个人
Got to find someone.

1398
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,170
谁啊
Yeah?

1399
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:14,430
迈克 没想到你真的来了
Mike. I didn't think you could make it.

1400
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,680
好
Okay,

1401
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:23,270
一千只猴子一千匹马
A thousand monkeys, thousand horses...

1402
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,980
呃
uh...

1403
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:27,020
穿过来再绕一圈
and across and around...

1404
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:42,540
我很紧张
I'm nervous.

1405
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:45,710
你没问题的
You're gonna be okay.

1406
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:10,640
我们每一个
"Every last one of us

1407
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:14,400
生活在内华达州的人
"who calls the great state of Nevada home...

1408
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:16,910
当初都是带着梦想
"arrived here...

1409
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,030
来到了这里
"with a dream.

1410
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:25,280
当年我曾祖父乘着马车来到这里
"It was my great granddad who came out here on a wagon.

1411
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:29,550
只有一匹马和两头骡子
"He had a horse and he had two mules...

1412
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,290
他最后停下来
"when they finally stopped moving

1413
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:33,210
说
"and said...

1414
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,420
就是这里了
'This is the place."'

1415
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:43,890
太煽情了？
Too much?

1416
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:47,140
还不错
That's good.

1417
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:52,150
是的
Yeah.

1418
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,610
我们的肯尼・威尔斯
Our own Kenny Wells!

1419
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,690
上台来吧丹尼
Get up here, Kenny!

1420
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:24,430
谢谢
Thank you. Um...

1421
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:31,570
我曾祖父
My great granddad...

1422
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,520
也是个探矿者
was one of us.

1423
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:36,560
他乘着马车来到这里 带着一匹马和两头骡子
He came out here in a wagon with two horses and a mule,

1424
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,990
他一路穿越了六个州
and, you know, he crossed six states

1425
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,530
到这里慢了下来
before he slowed down, and it was it was when he got here

1426
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,800
最后拉着缰绳说
that he finally pulled those reins back and said...

1427
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:50,250
就是这里了
"This is the place."

1428
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:57,090
什么是探矿者
What is a prospector?

1429
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:00,720
别 别
No, no, I'm...

1430
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:02,430
我是认真的
Seriously, what...

1431
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:06,060
什么是探矿者
What is a prospector?

1432
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,560
就是一个相信
It's someone who believes...

1433
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:16,150
金矿存在的人
it's out there.

1434
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,520
他每天早晨醒来
Who wakes up every morning,

1435
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:21,530
一次又一次一次又一次
again and again, again and again...

1436
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,320
都相信金矿的存在
believing it's out there.

1437
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:30,450
但其实不存在
And then it's not.

1438
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:33,540
- 对吗 并没有  - 嗯嗯
- Right? It's not.  - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1439
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,420
他站在荒漠的边绿
And he's standing on the edge of the desert,

1440
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:39,000
凝视着
staring a...

1441
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:42,350
新的一天的日出
new day's sunrise right in the eye, and...

1442
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:44,800
然后听到内心深处
and he hears that little voice,

1443
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:47,310
有个声音说：
a little voice that says...

1444
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,560
前进
"Go ahead.

1445
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:53,940
继续走
Keep walking."

1446
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:56,730
日头越升越高
And the sun gets higher and higher,

1447
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:58,850
照在他身上 他很热
and it's shining down on him, and he's really hot,

1448
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:00,030
而且他没有…
and he doesn't have

1449
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:01,270
任何可喝的水
any water to drink,

1450
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,880
和他一起来的人都想回去
and everybody that came with him wants to turn back,

1451
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,740
最后也都回去了
and eventually, they do turn back,

1452
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:07,740
留下了他
and there he is.

1453
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:09,990
留下他一个人
And he's all alone.

1454
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:22,630
抱着一个信念
With the belief...

1455
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:30,180
金矿是存在的
that it's out there, man.

1456
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:32,260
是存在的
It's out there.

1457
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,270
这就是探矿者
That's a prospector.

1458
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,990
这就是探矿者
That's a prospector.

1459
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:58,340
演讲的太好了 孩子 太好了
Really great speech, son. Just great. Great.

1460
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,060
- 敬给你父亲  - 敬给威尔斯先生
- To your daddy.  - To Mr. Wells!

1461
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,600
嗯
Mm.

1462
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,890
喂
Yeah?

1463
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,690
什么？
What?

1464
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:00,150
你再说一遍
Say-say again?

1465
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,770
我不明白
No, I-I don't understand.

1466
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:03,860
等等
Wait-wait.

1467
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:23,760
肯尼 这是怎么回事
Kenny, what's going on? Kenny... what happened?

1468
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:24,970
我不知道
I don't know.

1469
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:27,170
我会查清楚
I'm going to find out.

1470
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:31,300
我也是一无所知
I don't know any more than...

1471
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,230
你不会逃脱的
You're not gonna get away with this!

1472
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:42,150
走开
Back the fuck off!

1473
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,770
肯尼一定要把这事解决啊
Kenny, please fix this!

1474
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:48,360
怎么回事 怎么回事
What happened, huh? What happened?

1475
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:50,020
独立化验机构
The independent assayer.

1476
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,030
他们无法复制迈克的发现
They couldn't reproduce Mike's findings.

1477
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,540
那里没有金子
There's no gold.

1478
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:59,030
那里没有金子一直都没有
Kenny, there's no goddamn gold. There never was.

1479
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:04,660
这不可能
That's not possible.

1480
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,840
左边的是在瓦肖的样品中
The image on the left is the type of gold

1481
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:10,590
发现的金子 这是河金
found in the Washoe samples. This is river gold.

1482
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,380
注意边绿是圆的
Notice how the edges are rounded,

1483
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,970
被河水侵蚀的光滑
worn smooth by the erosion of water.

1484
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:17,140
本该发现的是片金
What we should have found is flake gold,

1485
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:18,760
就是右边的样品
the sample on the right,

1486
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,860
直接从岩石提取 边绿粗糙有棱角
pulled directly from the rock, rough-edged and angular.

1487
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:25,150
这是被忽略的一个很大的细节
That's a pretty darn big detail to overlook,

1488
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,860
不是吗
wouldn't you say?

1489
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:29,860
的确是个很大的细节 但你要知道
It's a big detail, but... you have to understand,

1490
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:32,940
瓦肖样品的其它方面都没有问题
everything else about the Washoe samples was right.

1491
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,120
可金子是错的
But the gold was wrong.

1492
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:38,160
这叫撒盐 意思就是
It's called salting... It literally means when someone

1493
01:32:38,330 --> 01:32:40,950
把金粉撒入岩石样品中
sprinkles gold dust into a rock sample,

1494
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:43,830
就像在牛排上撒盐那样
like you... salt your steak.

1495
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:46,880
这是很古老的技俩
It is the oldest trick in the book.

1496
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:48,720
很古老的技俩？
Oldest trick in the book?

1497
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,800
然而大矿业公司
And yet major mining corporations,

1498
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:52,630
投资银行审计师
investment banks, the auditors,

1499
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,090
每个人都被骗了
everyone was fooled.

1500
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:56,390
我们不是被骗
We weren't fooled.

1501
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,380
只是没去看
We just didn't look.

1502
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,140
从所有的外表看
By all appearances,

1503
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:01,770
瓦肖公司的保安措施
Washoe's security protocol

1504
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,230
都是无懈可击酌
were ironclad.

1505
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,320
但如果
But... when the person

1506
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,030
负责保安的人搞欺诈
administering the security is fraudulent,

1507
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,860
整个保安系统都形同虚设
the whole system goes down.

1508
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:18,240
对 他说过
Right. Did he say...

1509
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:20,450
他要去哪儿吗
wh-wh-where-where he was going?

1510
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:22,120
他提到雅加达了吗
Did he mention Jakarta?

1511
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:24,200
我等会再联系你
I'll call you back.

1512
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:30,130
纽约证券交易所刚刚暂停了交易
The New York Stock Exchange just suspended trading.

1513
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:33,000
他们把瓦肖矿业停牌了
They've taken Washoe off the board.

1514
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:48,230
你卖了一些吧
You sold some, right?

1515
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,600
是的
Yeah.

1516
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:52,070
当然
Of course.

1517
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,740
鲍勃
Bobby

1518
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:55,860
我以为
I thought...

1519
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,910
股价只会一直攀升
I thought it was just gonna keep going up.

1520
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,530
真是的 鲍勃 我早就告诉你
Damn it, Bobby, I told you from the beginning

1521
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:04,330
卖掉一些股票存点钱以防万一
just put some away, save a little bit just in case.

1522
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:06,330
我跟你说过多少次了
How many times did I tell you that?

1523
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:07,800
肯尼 你早就知道吗
Kenny, did you know?

1524
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,590
你早就知道吗
Did you know, Kenny?

1525
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,550
我早就知道吗
Did I know?

1526
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:15,300
你竟然问我这个问题
I can't believe you would ask me that.

1527
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:17,140
我就问你 你早就知道吗
I'm asking you that. Did you know?

1528
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:18,970
不 我不知道 鲍勃
No, I goddamn didn't know, Bobby.

1529
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,260
肯尼
Kenny.

1530
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:26,850
- 肯尼  - 什么
- Kenny.  - What?

1531
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:28,100
这话不知从何说起
I don't even know how to tell you this.

1532
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:29,100
你自己看吧
Just look.

1533
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,410
阿科斯塔抛售了他的股票
Acosta was dumping stock.

1534
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,070
- 嗯  - 空壳公司
- Mm.  - Shell companies.

1535
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,490
在菲律宾 亚速尔群岛
Banks in the Philippines, the fucking Azores.

1536
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:40,610
和直布罗陀的银行
Gibraltar.

1537
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:42,740
多种机构 都是海外的
Multiple layers, all offshore.

1538
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,460
多少
How much?

1539
01:34:46,590 --> 01:34:49,670
一点六四亿
$164 million.

1540
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:53,500
好的
Okay, uh...

1541
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:55,430
我们怎么办
what are we gonna do?

1542
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:03,560
我真不敢相信
I don't fucking believe this. Hmm?

1543
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:07,890
我们是FBI
This is the FBI!

1544
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:10,310
离开你们的办公桌
Step away from your desks!

1545
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:13,360
离开你们的办公桌两大步
Take two big steps away from your desks!

1546
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:15,450
不要触碰任何东西
Do not touch anything!

1547
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:34,460
在这一诈骗中损失了多少钱
How much money was lost in the fraud,

1548
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:36,420
- 我们所知的  - 数十亿
- that we know of?  - Oh, billions.

1549
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:37,880
光是大机构投资者
Large institutional investors

1550
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:39,920
- 就损失了数十亿美元  - 所以这个…
- lost billions of dollars.  - So one

1551
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:41,550
那么他们一两个人
or maybe both of them,

1552
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:45,960
就把华尔街的人都骗了？
two outsiders, took everybody on Wall Street for a ride?

1553
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:47,520
是这样的
Yeah, it really looks like they did.

1554
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,760
- 是的  - 阿科斯塔己经失踪了？
- Yeah.  - And Acosta has vanished?

1555
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:52,480
带着上亿美元
With hundreds of millions of dollars.

1556
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:55,990
肯尼・威尔斯一直声称自己是无辜的
Kenny Wells has always maintained his innocence,

1557
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,780
和别人一样被骗了
that he was duped along with everyone else.

1558
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:01,620
鉴于这一点 你怎么看待此事
Given that, what do you make of this?

1559
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:07,820
肯尼・威尔斯 傻瓜还是主谋？
Kenny Wells, a fool or a mastermind?

1560
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:12,080
这是个很好的问题 罗杰
It's a very good question, Roger.

1561
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,770
呃
Um...

1562
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:40,400
迈克・阿科斯塔是我的朋友和合伙人
Mike-Mike Acosta was my friend and, uh, my partner.

1563
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:41,910
呃
Um...

1564
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,000
他背叛了我
and he-he betrayed me.

1565
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:49,710
我知道身为瓦肖矿业公司总栽
I-I know as CEO of Washoe Mining

1566
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:51,910
我有责任知道
it's my responsibility to know

1567
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:54,910
发生的一切可我不知道
everything that's going on, and I... I didn't.

1568
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:58,420
这不是借口
It's not an excuse.

1569
01:36:58,510 --> 01:37:00,420
我真诚地向大家道歉
All right? I sincerely apologize

1570
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:04,180
任何在投资中遭受损失的人
to everybody and anybody that lost on their investments.

1571
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:09,940
迈克
Come on, Mike.

1572
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:12,060
快回来吧
Mikey, come on in, man.

1573
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:14,900
好吗
All right?

1574
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:16,640
这是怎么回事
What happened, huh?

1575
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,130
- 霍华德  - 我在电视上看到了你
- Howard.  - I saw you on TV.

1576
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:39,170
- 我能和你谈一会吗  - 抱歉
- Hey, man, can I talk to you for a minute, please?  - No.

1577
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,170
我只想知道我的钱去了哪里
Look, I just want to know where my money went.

1578
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:43,390
- 拜托 我一无所知  - 威尔斯先生
- Come on! Don't know anything about it, okay?  - Mr. Wells,

1579
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:46,220
威尔斯先生 你什么时候退房
Mr. Wells, exactly when will you be departing?

1580
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:49,180
一两天后吧 我会告诉你的
Uh, later. A few days or so. I'll let you know.

1581
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:52,050
- 我只想谈谈你的账单  - 我等会下来
- We just need to talk about your bill, sir.  - I'll be down.

1582
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:53,520
把这事解决
We'll settle it up.

1583
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,840
我需要律师吗
Do I need a lawyer?

1584
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:03,420
你需要吗
Do you need a lawyer?

1585
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,680
这就对了
Right answer.

1586
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,690
你是怎么见到迈克・阿科斯塔的
How'd you meet Michael Acosta?

1587
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:29,230
第一次还是第二次？
The, uh, first time or the second time?

1588
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:31,780
你怎么见到他的 威尔斯
How'd you meet him, Wells?

1589
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:36,660
当时是一九八八年四月
It was April... of '88.

1590
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:40,710
那时我干劲很足
Yeah, I was on the balls of my ass.

1591
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,550
瞎忙活
Scrambling.

1592
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:46,800
虽然对我来说并非未知的领域
Not exactly uncharted waters for me, but...

1593
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:49,300
我陷得很深
I was in deep.

1594
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,020
我想你不大可能
I think it's pretty unlikely

1595
01:39:59,150 --> 01:40:01,140
再次见到你的合伙人了
we'll ever see your partner again.

1596
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:06,150
- 为何这么说  - 很多有权有势的人
- What are you talking about?  - A lot of very powerful people

1597
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,190
都对迈克・阿科斯塔很愤怒
are very angry at Michael Acosta.

1598
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:13,690
发生了什么
Well, what happened?

1599
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:14,870
发生了什么？
What happened?

1600
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,710
一百七十亿美元的价值一夜之间消失
$17 billion of value disappeared overnight.

1601
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:19,080
迈克・阿科斯塔在楼下的舞厅
Mike Acosta waves good-bye to you

1602
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,320
中与你道别乘坐包机
in the ballroom downstairs and goes back to Indonesia

1603
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:23,830
带着瓦肖基金返回了印尼
on a jet chartered with Washoe funds.

1604
01:40:23,970 --> 01:40:26,710
然后他失踪了
And then he does a disappearing act.

1605
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,880
但这事你知道
But this you know.

1606
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:32,390
他先是被内政部长禁止进入
First, he's locked out of the assay lab in Kalimantan

1607
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,930
加里曼丹的化验室
by the minister of the interior.

1608
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:36,850
- 于是他回到雅加达  - 阿科斯塔先生
- So he goes back to Jakarta...  - Mr. Acosta,

1609
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:38,390
请跟我走一趟
please walk with with me.

1610
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,350
他在机场
Where he's immediately detained

1611
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,440
立刻被印尼军方拘留
by the Indonesian military.

1612
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:45,440
他们控制了他
And they hold him

1613
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:47,690
试图重现瓦肖公司声称的
while they try to reproduce for themselves

1614
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:50,110
样品化验结果
the lab results claimed by Washoe.

1615
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:54,620
当然 他们无法做到
Which, of course, they are unable to do.

1616
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:57,360
在这时
Now, at this point,

1617
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:00,490
他要么正被转移到监狱关押
either he's being transferred to an actual prison, or...

1618
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:02,410
要么他贿赂了某个官员
he's bribed one of the officers.

1619
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:03,580
反正
Either way,

1620
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:05,290
他上了一架军用直升机
he's on a military helicopter.

1621
01:41:07,090 --> 01:41:10,180
向北飞行大致沿着Kensana
They fly north, loosely tracking the Kensana River.

1622
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:01,800
一千英尺的高空在Kensana上方
A thousand feet up, over the Kensana...

1623
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:04,480
迈克・阿科斯塔一头摔了下去
Mike Acosta takes a header.

1624
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,820
不可能
No way.

1625
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:20,620
绝不可能
No fucking way.

1626
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:22,540
这要么是他装死
He either faked it,

1627
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:24,780
要么是他花钱请人
or he paid to have this-this bullshit story

1628
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,460
把这件事报道出来
you're telling put out.

1629
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:30,800
一点六四亿美元在印尼能办成很多事情
$164 million goes a long way in Indonesia.

1630
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:33,460
他们发现了一具尸体
They found a body.

1631
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:51,230
手和脸被吃掉了
Hands and face were eaten away,

1632
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:54,280
可能是野猪
probably by wild pigs.

1633
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:56,990
你确定是他吗
Sure this is him?

1634
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,410
我什么都不确定
I'm not sure of anything...

1635
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:04,200
只知道迈克・阿科斯塔用滤水器换取河金
except Mike Acosta traded water filters for river gold.

1636
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:05,960
但现在印尼政府
But now the Indonesian government

1637
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:07,330
对这件事
have gone unusually quiet

1638
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:09,080
异常的保持沉默
on the subject.

1639
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:10,840
做过一次尸体解剖
There was an autopsy

1640
01:43:10,970 --> 01:43:12,960
证实了死者的身份
corroborating the identity of the body.

1641
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:16,840
他们然后封了报告
They then sealed the report...

1642
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,590
火化了遗体
cremated the remains.

1643
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:25,190
有意思的是 你的朋友丹尼・苏哈托
Interestingly, Danny Suharto, your friend...

1644
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:28,180
也抛售了很多股票
dumped a lot of stock as well.

1645
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:31,110
所以现在苏哈托家族更富有了
So the Suhartos are even richer now.

1646
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:34,570
迈克・阿科斯塔表面上己经死了下葬了
Mike Acosta is ostensibly dead and buried, and...

1647
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:36,980
一点六四亿美元依然下落不明
$164 million is still missing.

1648
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:40,480
如今我剩下的
And the only question...

1649
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:42,830
唯一的问题是
I'm left with is...

1650
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,450
这事你是否参与其中
whether or not you were in on it.

1651
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:49,790
我
I...

1652
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,260
- 我不信  - 不信什么
- I can't believe it.  - Can't believe what?

1653
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:56,920
这一行业
No, look, th-this business...

1654
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:59,680
几年前就把迈克淘汰了
had written Mike off years ago, all right?

1655
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:01,180
说他的理论是一佗屎
They called his theories crap.

1656
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:03,220
不过
But...

1657
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:05,180
这不可能
there's no way.

1658
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:07,230
他不可能
He wouldn't, he fucking couldn't

1659
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:09,430
希望身后是这样的名声
let this be the last word on him.

1660
01:44:09,570 --> 01:44:13,150
- 这不可能  - 你指的是阿科斯塔还是你自己
- No fucking way.  - You talking about Acosta or yourself?

1661
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,530
听着 我们当时钱快花光了
All right, look. We-we-we were running out of money, right?

1662
01:44:26,670 --> 01:44:29,160
疟疾也让我奄奄一息了
And I was practically dying from malaria.

1663
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,950
我把我名下最后的钱都给了迈克
I gave Mike the last dollar to my name.

1664
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:34,750
让他对我做个承诺我说：迈克
And I made him promise me something, I said, "Mike...

1665
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,340
别让我一无所获的死去
don't let me die out here for nothing."

1666
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:46,310
几周后我苏醒过来
A few weeks later, I came to, and...

1667
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:48,390
迈克就在旁边
Mike was there.

1668
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:54,110
他说：
He said, "We got...

1669
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:56,360
我们找到了肯尼
"we got a strike, Kenny.

1670
01:44:57,660 --> 01:44:59,990
我们找到了金矿
We got a goddamn gold mine."

1671
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:09,450
他不可能是为了欺骗所有人
And th-there's no way that he set out to swindle anyone.

1672
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:12,200
他只是多需要点时问
He just needed to buy a little more time.

1673
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:19,380
他不想让我失望
And he didn't want to let me down.

1674
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:23,350
- 你撒谎  - 莱文 坐下
- You're fuckin' lyin'.  - Levine, sit down!

1675
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:25,220
你想谈谈真相吗
You want to talk about the truth?

1676
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:26,890
好吧我们谈谈真相
All right, let's talk about the truth.

1677
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:29,180
唯一的真相是 只要能发财
The only truth here is, when everybody's getting rich,

1678
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:32,100
没人在乎真相是什么
nobody gives a shit about the truth.

1679
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:35,270
拜托人们只需要仔细看看
Come the fuck on. All anyone had to do was look,

1680
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,110
睁开眼看看
open their eyes.

1681
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:40,320
样品中的金子是错的金矿储量又过于巨大
Man, the-the gold was wrong, the find was too good.

1682
01:45:40,450 --> 01:45:43,030
有太多的疑点
There were red flags everywhere.

1683
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:44,780
为什么没人仔细看
Why did no one look?

1684
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:46,830
因为没人想知道
'Cause no one wanted to fucking know.

1685
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,820
我们都愿意相信
We all wanted to believe.

1686
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,870
你 我 所有人 为什么呢
Me, you, fucking everybody. Why?

1687
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:55,620
因为我们都能发大财
Because we were all making so much fucking money, man.

1688
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,000
这就是真相
That's the truth.

1689
01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:00,840
千百年来一直如此
That's been going on for fucking centuries!

1690
01:46:02,510 --> 01:46:05,680
天
Oh, fuck...

1691
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:11,310
你知道迈克・阿科斯塔
Were you aware Mike Acosta was salting

1692
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,810
- 在样品中撒金子吗  - 不知道
- the Washoe core samples?  - No.

1693
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:15,350
你不知道
You had no knowledge

1694
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:18,320
迈克・阿科斯塔在搞诈骗？
Mike Acosta was perpetrating a fraud?

1695
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:20,810
- 不知道  - 在Kensana金矿一事上
- No.  - You were not in collusion

1696
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:23,810
你不是迈克・阿科斯塔的同谋？
with Mike Acosta on the Kensana gold strike?

1697
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:27,860
不是 我还以为中了大奖
No, man, I fucking thought I won the lottery.

1698
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:31,370
你从诈骗案中获利了吗
Did you profit from the Kensana fraud?

1699
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:36,120
- 没有  - 你有亲友获利吗
- No.  - Did anyone close to you profit?

1700
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,420
我的朋友们损失了钱
My friends lost money.

1701
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:42,420
我的邻居损失了钱
My neighbors lost money.

1702
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:44,550
而我
Me...

1703
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:47,260
失去了一切
I lost everything.

1704
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:52,600
说实话
You know what the truth of it is?

1705
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:56,180
我在乎的并不是钱
I never really cared about money.

1706
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:59,810
我在乎的是金子
I cared about gold.

1707
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:02,110
这是两码事 詹宁斯
And it's different, Jennings.

1708
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:04,280
完全是两码事
It's fucking different.

1709
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:26,680

1717
01:47:56,630 --> 01:47:58,710
肯尼・威尔斯先生
Mr. Kenny Wells...

1718
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:03,920
你可以走了
you are free to go.

1719

Well, lookee there.

有人相信我
Somebody believes me.

1721
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:14,970
也不要高兴得太早
I wouldn't go overboard.

1722
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:18,560
最好不要出国
In fact, I wouldn't leave the state,

1723
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:21,310
不要开始购物
or start buying new stuff or chartering

1724
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,060
- 或包机  - 我要从前台溜出去
- any more jets.  - I gotta sneak by the guy

1725
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:24,930
因为我没钱支付酒店的帐单
at the front desk 'cause I can't pay the hotel bill.

1726
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:27,810
这些事不能说给我听
I can't be a party to that information.

1729
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:42,090
你下一步怎么办
What are you gonna do now, Wells?

1730
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:04,830
嗨 肯尼
Hey, Kenny.

1731
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,500
我仍然担心桑树
I-I'm still worried about that mulberry

1732
01:50:06,590 --> 01:50:08,960
- 伸到我家院子里  - 我知道 哈特

我做的窗帘
I made curtains.

1740
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:47,050

嗯
Hmm.
