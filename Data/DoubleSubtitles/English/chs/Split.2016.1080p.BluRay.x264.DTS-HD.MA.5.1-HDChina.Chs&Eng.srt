And he's so tall, that the water doesn't even get to his belly.

吃完记得把手套戴上

我们只知道哭喊

我们没伤到他是因为我们不敢让他不高兴
We didn't hurt him because we were afraid to get him upset.

And your 6 months of karate at the King of Prussia Mall can blow me, too.

133
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,560
我听到什么有用的会告诉你们的
I'll let you know when I hear something that makes sense.

134
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,340
我们都不知道现在什么情况
We don't even know what this is yet.

135
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,100
我有了灵感
I was inspired.

136
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,780
不 不…是那张 粉色法尔可前面那张
No, no, that one, before the pink fraco,

137
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,450
那应该是件…像西装外套的衣服
That supposed to be like a.. Like a tailored jacket..

138
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,120
但是我会把她捧上报纸头条的
But I'm gonna himp her with newspaper headlines.

139
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,590
我一般只穿宽松简单的衬衫和裙子 但是这些
Well, I'm a simple blouse and skirt person, but these..

140
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,640
这些很有艺术感 巴里
These are very artistic, Barry.

141
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,160
就是那种 住汉斯顿斯的女人们愿意一万五千美元买来
Just the kinda thing Hamptons' ladies would spend 15000 dollars on

142
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,490
只为在慈善舞会上穿上一次
to wear once at a charity ball.

143
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,610
闭嘴啦 你知道 我待不了太久
Shut up! You know, I can't stay too long.

144
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,270
我就是来看看你
This is just a visit.

145
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,650
好吧 跟我说说发生了些什么
Well, tell me what's going on?

146
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,020
什么 你是说邮件吗
What? You mean the email?

147
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,840
就是一封平常的邮件呀 我就是压力有点大
It's just the usual thing. Just feeling a bit overwhelmed.

148
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,930
看你的邮件感觉有特殊情况 而且时间紧迫
Your email made it sounds specific and time related.

149
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,900
- 你在找什么吗  - 没啊 我就是看看
- Are, are you looking for something?  - No. I'm just admiring.

150
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,880
- 我现在好多了  - 工作怎么样
- I'm better now.  - How's work?

151
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,030
- 很好啊  - 我上次和他们聊的时候
- Great!  - When I last spoke to them,

152
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,890
他们认为你是个模范员工
they believe you were a model employee.

153
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,490
他们觉得你是个一丝不苟 有责任心的人
They found you meticulous and conscientious.

154
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,630
- 你知道的 对吧  - 我知道
- You know this, right?  - I do.

155
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,100
你在那里工作快十年了 你做得很棒 巴里
You've managed there for 10 years. It's functioning very well, Barry.

156
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,830
而且像那样适合你的工作环境很少
And it's a rare and wonderful place for you to work.

157
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,170
是的
Yes it is.

158
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,200
你知道 我这边类似于你这种病人中 只有你在工作方面是最稳定的
You know, of all my other clientswith your disorder, you've been the most consistent at your job.

159
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,010
出什么事情了吗 巴里
Did something happen, Barry?

160
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,640
你多大了？
How old are you?

161
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,610
在网上查到的信息似乎不太准
The internet isn't consistent on this point.

162
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,790
你在想什么呢
Why is that on your mind?

163
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,290
你退休或者去世之后谁来照顾你呢
Who's gonna look after you when you retired or passed on?

164
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,070
你懂得 我们得照顾自己 而且那时人们甚至会无视你的存在
You know, we're gonna have to take care of ourselves and nobody even believes that we exist.

165
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,820
如果我有发生什么不测 我已经做了安排
If ever something would happened to me,

166
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,170
一个巴尔的摩的同事会帮我处理后事
I've made arrangements with a colleague from Baltimore to take over.

167
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,830
嘿 你… 一个人住吗
Hey, you a.. you live alone?

168
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,980
- 你明知道  - 抱歉 我是问多久了
- You know this.  - I'm sorry, I just meant how long?

169
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,090
一直如此
Always.

170
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
那一定很孤单吧
That must be so lonely.

171
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,140
你知道的 我已经好多了 我不应该给你发邮件的
You know what, I'm.. I'm doing much better. I shouldn't have emailed you.

172
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,890
我只是…你也看到了 我太冲动了
I'm just.. Look at me, I'm too impulsive.

173
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,380
对了… 有人在关注我的病情吗 有人关注我们的治疗吗
By the way, is anybody listening? Does anybody care about us?

174
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,620
有的 其实巴黎大学让我去做一个演讲
Yes, the University of Paris asked me to do a lecture, in fact.

175
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,960
我会通过网络电话 就在这里来做演讲
I'm going to be doing it via Skype, from right here.

176
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,850
关注的人越来越多了
People are believing more.

177
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,240
我们下周还是老时间再见吧
Let's meet at our usual time next week.

178
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,810
你先别走 巴里
I'd rather you didn't leave, Barry.

179
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,710
出什么事情了吗
Did something happen?

180
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,740
没事啦 我就是来看看你 我现在好多了
Don't worry, this was just a visit. I'm doing much better.

181
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,830
那你的草图是怎么回事 巴里
And what's with your sketches, Barry?

182
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,900
你一直都很保护它们的
You're usually very protective of them.

183
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,980
是啊 谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

184
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,810
我下周老时间再来找你
I'll see you next week at our usual time.

185
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,150
谢谢你为我们作斗争 弗莱彻医生
Thanks for fighting for us, Dr. Fletcher.

186
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,920
- 谢谢 弗莱彻医生  - 不用谢
- Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.  - You're welcome.

187
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,170
- 我觉得我会搞砸的  - 不会的 一切都会很棒的
- I just think I'm gonna blow it.  - No, it would be great.

188
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,290
- 下周见  - 谢谢
- I'll see you next week.  - Okay, thank you.

189
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,780
我不知道你怎么和那些人相处的
I don't know how you work with those people.

190
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,090
- 和哪些人？ - 你的病人们
- With what people?  - Your patients.

191
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,410
你不能用你的 大拇指去转轮子…蠢货
You can't use your thumbs to spin the wheel, dumb asses!

192
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,010
他们总是用大拇指
They always use their thumbs!

193
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,440
我们看的病人都是受过挫折 被视为异类的不健全人
Well, we look at people who've been shattered and different as less than,

194
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,680
但如果 其实… 他们比我们还健全呢
What if, they are more than us?

195
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,300
什么？
What?

196
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,040
你相信他们吗 你的病人们
You believe them? Your patients?

197
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,730
你懂得啦 就你我之间说说
You know, just between you and me.

198
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,180
是的 我信
Yes, I do.

199
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,140
别停在这 快弹开
Flick it! Flick it!

200
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,240
无意冒犯 但是我不信
I don't believe it. No offense.

201
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,860
那个 我要买那个
That! I need to buy that.

202
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,050
- 他回来了  - 有个女人在外面
- He's back.  - There is a lady outside.

203
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,240

- Dennis, admit what you've done.  - Don't get upset.

204
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,780
放下 我已经吓到了
Take down, I'm getting frightened.

205
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,000
我以为你能控制住
I thought that you had this under control.

206
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,780
- 快告诉我现在还来得及  - 食物正等着呢
- Please tell me it's not too late.  - The food in the waiting.

207
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,090
她在那个房间吗
Is she in that room?

208
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,260
- 我们在这里  - 救命

209
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,520
我们在这里！
We are here!

210
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,530
- 我的天 有几个人  - 不 别进去
- Jesus, how many are they?  - No, no, don't go in there!

211
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,110
别进去
Don't go in there!

212
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,960
不要担心。
Don't worry.

213
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,320
我会和他谈谈的 他听我的话
I'll talk to him. He listens to me.

214
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,220
他状态不好
He's not well.

215
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,350
他知道你们为什么在这儿
He knows what you're here for.

216
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,050
我不会允许他碰你们的
He's not allowed to touch you.

217
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,500
他知道的
He knows that.

218
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,440
- 凯伦  - 乔
- Karen.  - Joe.

219
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,960
他们说 你在全国性会议上有单独的发言时间
They said you can have your own part at the national conference.

220
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,830
他们做出了让步
They conceded, however,

221
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,980
我可以参与心境障碍模式的部分
I can be part of the mood disorder pattern.

222
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,060
- 那不是心境障碍  - 我知道你坚持的观点 凯伦
- It's not a mood disorder.  - I'm aware your beliefs, Karen.

223
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,590
他们这次会公开新证据吗
Well, were they open this time with a new evidence?

224
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,350
你的论点之一是一只狗
One of your arguments is a dog.

225
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,490
你提交了一只狗的视频
You submitted video of a dog

226
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,340
讲的是它在不同时间对你病人的不同反应
acting differently to one of your patients at different time.

227
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,340
事实更加戏剧化
It is more dramatic than that.

228
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,350
每一个人格都坚信自身的存在
They are what they believe they are.

229
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,180
他的大脑学会了捍卫自己
The brain has learned to defend itself.

230
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,380
你这么对待他们 就好像他们有超自然天赋似的
You treated them like they're supernaturally gifted.

231
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,280
好像他们有超能力 还是别的什么
Like they have powers or something.

232
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,000
凯伦 他们是病人 他们经历过创伤
Karen, these are patients. They have been to trauma.

233
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,160
也许他们能做到我们做不到的事情
And perhaps now they're capable of something we're not.

234
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,410
我们现在有脑部扫描
We have brain scans now.

235
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,230
多重人格的病人们 能够随着他们的想法 改变体内的化学反应
DID patients have changed their body chemistry with their thoughts.

236
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,690
他刚刚就是想吓我们
He was just trying to scare us.

237
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,030
他在自言自语说些傻话
He was making a fool conversation with himself.

238
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,670
食物正等着呢 那句话是什么意思
What was that line about the food is waiting?

239
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,090
每个出去的人都会精神失常吗
Does everyone get out whacked?

240
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,260
我们现在就要逃出去
Just listen, we need to get out of here now.

241
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,120
不
Yeah, no, please.

242
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,540
拜托 把你们的地方弄干净 浴室这样我不能接受
Keep your area neat. The bathroom is unacceptable.

243
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,000
我简单说下 我给这些起个代号
I'll make it easy. I, I've called a code of this.

244
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,330
蓝色的瓶子用来擦地板
Use the blue bottle for the floor.

245
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,610
粉色瓶子擦瓷砖
And the pink bottle for ceramic surfaces.

246
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,310
帕特丽夏提醒我
Patricia has reminded me that..

247
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,210
我是来告诉你们
I was sent to get you for a reason.

248
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,150
你们是些受惊了的食物
That you are sacred food.

249
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,290
我保证我不会再来烦你们了
And I promise not to bother you again.

250
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,680
也许他有只狗或者别的什么？
Maybe he has a dog or something.

251
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,490
我觉得他要把我们喂狗
I think he's gonna feed us to his dogs.

252
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,720
凯西
Casey.

253
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,710
凯西
Casey!

254
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,590
我叫海德薇格 我有红袜子
My name is Hedwig. I have red socks.

255
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,400
他要来了
He's on the move.

256
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,290
什么？
What?

257
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,800
他 要 来 了
He's on the move.

258
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,830
- 谁？ - 要抓你们的人呀
- Who?  - Someone who's coming for you.

259
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,780
你们不会喜欢他的
And you're not gonna like it.

260
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,210
你睡着的时候 你的伙伴们闹了一会儿
You guys make noises in your sleep.

261
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,350
- 告诉我们  - 我不应该说的
- Tell us.  - I'm not supposed to say.

262
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,310
但是 他对别人做过很坏的事
Hmm.. But, he's done awful things to people.

263

So you're not the guy that took us?

267
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,480
- 不是  - 你也不是那位女士？

你是瞎了吗
What are you blind?

269
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,280
你不知道他们在想什么吗？
You don't know how they think?

270
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,340
不 他们没有 他们没有告诉我太多事

And that he knew, that they were the ones that he would want.

289
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,420
你不在的时候 丹尼斯和那位女士说过
When you're not around, Dennis and the lady talked about it.

她说 她根本不生我的气
She said, she's not mad at me anymore.

294
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,950
她有时候会唱歌给我听
She sings to me sometimes.

295
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,380
我觉得帕特丽夏夫人还是有点生你的气
I think Mrs. Patricia still a little mad at you.

296
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,420
帕特丽夏夫人认为我 她认为我很笨
Mrs. Patricia thinks I'm.. She thinks I'm stupid.

297

她觉得我总犯低级错误
She thinks I made silly mistakes.

298
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,790
看着我 我们就像你的保姆
Look at me, we're like your babysitters.

我会给你看电视 还要给你做美味的晚餐
I'll let you watch TV and make you a fun diner.

300
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,430
我们都需要离开这里
We all need to get out of here.

301
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,880
你可以告诉我离开的路
You could show us the way out.

302
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,590
那样我们就可以在其他人回来之前离开这里
We can be out before anybody gets back.

303
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,710
我们得快点 海德薇格
But we have to hurry, Hedwig.

304

等等 等一下
Wait, wait a minute.

306
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,700
我花了很大力气才让这个地方这么安全 没人打扰
It took forever to get this place safe without anybody to work here.

307
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,270
你休想从这出去 我花了很大力气才让这个地方这么安全 没人打扰
You can't get out of here! It took forever to get this place safe without anybody to work here.

308
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:35,330
你休想从这出去
You can't get out of here!

309
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,040
- 我要去擤鼻涕了  - 不不 别走 求你了
- I have to blow my nose.  - No, no, please do not go!

310
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,590

他说了一些关于让这个地方变安全的话

这些干板墙全是新的

315
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,990
它并不安全
It wasn't safe.

316
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,620
等等 我们知道他会注意到这个
Wait a minute, we know he'll notice about this?

317
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,900
凯西 你说得对 这里确实有问题
Casey, you're right. There's something in here.

318
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,350
他肯定把出路堵死了 他来了马上告诉我
He must covering up the way out. Tell me if you see him.

319
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,700
凯西 告诉我你看见什么了
Casey, tell us what you see!

320
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,070
他来了
He's here.

321
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,060
不能让他进来 这是我们唯一的机会
You can't let him in, you can't let him in! This is our one chance.

你们这就不好玩了

你们这样做是在给我找麻烦
You're gonna get me in trouble.

332
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,830
小心
Watch out.

333
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,060
我还以为我把你给丢了
I thought I lost you.

334
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,690
你能出来吗
Would you step outside, please?

335
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,760
你喜欢戏弄我们
You like to make fun of us.

336
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,780
可是 我们比你们想象的强大多了

337
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,310
出来
Step outside.

338
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,120
请出来
Please.

339
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,090
你不应该戏弄孩子的
You shouldn't trick children.

340
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,100
这让我看清楚了你是什么样的人
That shows who you are.

341
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,850
看看你的毛衣 全毁了 太脏了
Look at your sweater. It's ruined, it's dirty.

342
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,190
脱下来
Remove it.

343
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,380
我在努力跟你客气
I'm trying to be good.

344
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,860
你们再也不会见到你的朋友了
You'll not see your friend again.

345
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,160
她会被单独关押
She'll be kept separate.

346
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,710
现在 你 还有你 把上衣都脱了
Now, take off your skirt and take off your shirt.

347
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,950
那些尘土把你们全弄脏了
Because you got all dirty from the dust.

348
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:53,950
一个罹患分离性身份识别障碍的患者
One identity in an individual with Dissociative Identity Disorder

349
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,540
他的一个人格会存在高胆固醇的问题 只有一个
Can have high cholesterol. One.

350
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,330
有过这样的案例 一个人格对蜜蜂的叮咬过敏 而另一个人格则不会
There are been cases where one identity is allergic to bee stings. The others are not.

351
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,330
有没有这样的可能 两个人格会同时存在
Are there moments where two identities can co-exist at the same time?

352
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:13,620
很多时候 两个人格 会在同一时间出现 在聚光灯之下
There are times when two identities

353
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,080
或者是有意识
can take the light or the spot, or consciousness at the same time.

354
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,250
一个和我共事的学生身上发生过这种情况
This happened with a student that I was working with.

355
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,190
在同一时间 她的左右手
And her left and right hands were taking notes

356
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,200
会用不同的字体来记笔记 而且是分别记录不同的内容
in different hand-writings about separate things at the same time.

357
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,020
不同人格之间的差异可以说是非常具有戏剧性的
The differences in the identities can be dramatic.

358
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,920
你我之间有多么不同
As much as the difference between you and me,

359
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,120
在场的观众有多不同 那些人格就有多不同
and every person in that auditorium.

360
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,960
不同的人格会有不同的智商
The identities have different IQs.

361
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,030
身体素质也各不相同
They have different physical strengths.

362
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,710
一种人格是俄罗斯举重运动员

363
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,450
能够举起比自己体重沉三倍的东西
and can lift three times of his body weight.

364
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,060
他们精神高度集中
Their ability to hyper-focus and have

365
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,820
和经历不同事情的能力是非常惊人的
different experiences is astounding.

366
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,730
是不是这个群体的人 通过自身的遭遇
Have these individuals through their suffering

367
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,970
开发了人类大脑更大的潜能
unlocked the potential of the brain?

368
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,010
这是不是就是我们
Is this the ultimate doorway

369
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,310
去探索未知事物的终极途径
to all things we called unknown?

370
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,000
这是不是就是很多我们认识到的超自然现象的起因
Is this where our sense of the supernatural comes from?

371
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,130
那关于深度和…
It's about depth and a..

372
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,790
一条曲线 还有…
and curves. And, hey, you see that one?

373
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,300
嘿 你看见那个了吗 就像一件又旧又汗湿的衣服
It's kinda like a senile sweaty dress.

374
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,930
你是谁？
Who are you?

375
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,260
巴里
Barry.

376
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,460
我觉得你不是
I don't think you are.

377
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:09,170
我现在已经练出来 分辨谁在跟我说话 谁没跟我说话的本事了
I've developed a nose for sensing whom I'm talking to and whom I'm not.

378
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,060
我做了什么事吗
Have I done something?

379
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:16,840
你连续两天发邮件…想要在 没有预约的情况下和我见面
You've emailed for an unscheduled appointment two days in a row.

380
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,400
我就是觉得我被其他人格压制住了 我出了一些问题
I just feel overwhelmed, I've gotten some issues.

381
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,520
我认为奥威尔 或者杰德 或者塞缪尔 或者海因里希
I think Orwell, or Jade, or Samuel..

382
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,180
主导了一会儿 给我发了邮件
Or Heinrich had the light for a moment and emailed me.

383
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,860
你却在这里告诉我一切都好
And you're here to tell me everything is okay.

384
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,880
是我给你发的邮件
I emailed you.

385
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
我能不能和他们其中一个说话
May I talk to one of them, please?

386
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,540
那是不可能的
That can't happen.

387
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,100
我告诉过他们 今天你要给我进行治疗
I told them that I wanna spend the session with you today.

388
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:58,540
我再问你一遍 我现在到底在和谁交谈
I'm gonna ask again. To whom am I speaking with now?

389
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,950
弗莱彻博士 我是巴里啊
Dr. Fletcher, it's Barry.

390
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,920
你看起来不是巴里 巴里该是个外向型的领导者
It doesn't seem like Barry. Barry is an extroverted leader.

391
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,190
我当然是这样啊
Of course, I am.

392
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,630
让我这专业人士来猜一猜
I'm gonna take a professional guess.

393
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,630
我是根据巴里告诉我的猜的 他对凯文身体里
Based on the description of all 23 identities that live in Kevin's body,

394
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,700
住着的所有二十三种人格 进行了详细的描述
that I've gotten from Barry.

395
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:28,230
我想我是在和丹尼斯交谈
I think, I'm talking to Dennis.

396
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,920
但是他因为些其他的原因被弄得见不得人了
But he's been banned from the light because among other reasons.

397
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,430
他的癖好是观看年轻姑娘裸体跳舞
He has a proclivity to watch young girls dance naked,

398
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,100
他自己也知道这样不对 他努力克服这个缺点并且小有进步
which he himself knows it's wrong. And he's fought against it with a little success.

399
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,970
我很开心我们终于见面了
I'm encouraged we can finally meet.

400
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,160
我做出这样的猜测是因为你自从来到这里之后就动手 摆了巧克力盘两次
And I guess this because you've adjusted the chocolate dish twice.

401
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,160
而且我知道你患有强迫症
since you came in here and I understand you have OCD.

402
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,680
我明白了 我明白了 真是聪明
Now I see, now I see. That's clever.

403
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:04,200
- 可我不是丹尼斯  - 还有 你和帕特丽夏被禁止出现
- But I'm not Dennis.  - And you and Patricia..

404
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,010
已经有好一阵子了
have been banned from the light for quite a while now.

405
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,450
我们可以说主要是你的信念造成的
Primarily, shall we say because of your beliefs.

406
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,710
帕特丽夏和丹尼斯非常不稳定
Patricia and Dennis are very unstable.

407
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,640
而我不是丹尼斯 你们俩都拿到控制权了吗
I'm not Dennis. Have you both take in charge now?

408
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,340
请相信我 我就是巴里
Please believe me, I'm Barry.

409
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,400
你得原谅我 我的工作就是要挑战你
You must forgive me, my job is to challenge you.

410
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
你现在也必须得知道
And as you must know by now,

411
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,250
我心里有很多关于每个人应该怎么样过好自己生活的意见
I have plenty of opinions about how everyone should live their lives.

412
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,700
问我些关于时尚的问题吧 我能证明自己
Ask me something about fashion, I'll prove it.

413
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,070
或者 要么你…你看看
Or.. Or you..

414
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,110
看看
Look, look, look.

415
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,070
你看 我不是丹尼斯 你还想让我做什么证明
You see, I'm not Dennis. You want me to do something else?

416
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,790
你有冰淇淋吗 反正这件衬衫也是混棉的
You got ice cream? This shirt is cotton blend anyway.

417
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,090
这颜色都是三个季节之前的了 是裸色的 没关系来试吧
The color is from three seasons ago. It's nude, I mean, come on.

418
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,570
杰伊 你总是准备快餐食品真是太没健康意识了 这是你之前买的鸡翅吗
Jay, what health conscious fast food prepare Did you originally buy these chicken wings,

419
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,750
你这么喜欢给它重新加热 简直是慢性自杀
you're so lovingly heated it in minor suicidal gesture?

420
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,100
猫头鹰运动餐厅的 你可以直接扔掉 弗莱彻医生
Hooters. You can't just threw them out, Dr. Fletcher.

421
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,230
这样看好多地方都不对
This is so wrong on so many levels. We finished about 3:15,

422
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,820
我们在三点十五分结束的 在三点十八分附近找一下
so look around 3:18.

423
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,090
中间再放慢点 杰伊
You're getting a little softer on the middle, Jay.

424
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,380
猫头鹰运动餐厅的创始人利用了肥胖人士的需求
The authors of hooters play on that need for fat,

425
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,360
还吸引了那些渴望接近大胸妹的男人们
and men to be in the proximity of augmented breasts.

426
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:52,040
就像是亨利五世开一家连锁快餐店一样
It's like Henry the 5th running a fast food franchise.

427
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,700
- 是个好地方 弗莱彻医生  - 哼哼 对啊
- It's a good place, Dr. Fletcher.  - Hmm.. right.

428
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,250
你是怎么知道垃圾会溢出来的
How did you know the trash will be spilled?

429
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,760
我该怎么说呢 杰伊 你不是非常拘泥小节的那种人
How can I say this, Jay, you're not the most meticulous of people.

430
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,460
这个人走过垃圾堆的时候不是那么利索啊
This guys isn't very neat as he walked right through the trash.

431
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,250
不 杰伊 任何正常的人都会绕过去的
No, Jay. A normal person would've walked around that.

432
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:30,580
那是故意的 你的目的是什么 丹尼斯
That was an act. What are your object, Dennis?

433
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,660
难道是帕特丽夏在支配你吗
Or is it Patricia who deciding things?

434
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,670
我们不会死的
We're not gonna die.

435
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,670
发生过坏事
Bad things happened.

436
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,740
但是不应该是这样的
But not like this.

437
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,830
凯西
Casey.

438
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,760
和我聊聊啊
Talk to me.

439
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,200
我们得找个窗户或者门什么的 是不是啊
We need to get through a window or a door?

440
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,730
猎物…凯西 制胜的关键在于你能不能
The trail. Casey, it's about where you can or can't.

441
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,540
比这动物聪明
You have to outsmart this animal.

442
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,370
你过去可不是很喜欢来这里啊
So you didn't used to like to come out here.

443
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,770
这就像是我们家族的传统一样 是吧
This is like our family tradition, right?

444
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,560
打得好 兄弟
Good shooting, Bro.

445
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,680
我给你拿饭来了 小懒虫
I have your meal, sleepyhead.

446
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,830
吃吧
Eat.

447
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,710
好吃吗 里面放了红辣椒
It's good? It's got paprika in it.

448
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,430
对不起
I'm sorry.

449
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:11,540
我觉得我该在你头发里插上一朵漂亮的花儿
I think I'll put a pretty flower in your hair.

450
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,280
太棒了
Oh, yeah.

451
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,230
这是用来彰显你有多么的重要
This is to show how important you are.

452
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,860
跟我来 我们好好吃一顿吧
Come along. And we'll have a proper meal.

453
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,680
我明白 这一切 你们看起来不是很满意
I understand, these must all seem so unsatisfactory for you.

454
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,580
可是我们正在尽力改善呀
But, we are doing the best we can.

455
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,410
不错吧
Good?

456
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:12,620
- 克莱尔能和我们一起吃吗  - 不能 不 恐怕那样不行
- Can Claire come eat with us?  - No, I'm afraid that can't happen.

457
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,990
她几乎毁掉了 我们盛大的招待仪式
She almost ruined our big reception.

458
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,750
我听说亚洲人的音乐能促进消化
I've heard that Asian people's music helps digestion.

459
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,920
我给你们再做一个三明治
I'll make you a second sandwich.

460

A bug can loose 30% of its weight during mating season chasing those round?

463
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,590
他们俩日夜不停吗
That creep paskula, right?

464
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,380
音乐在日夜不停的播放 对你们有好处的
Means they travel around during dask and dawn. Good for you.

465
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:15,970
切弯了
It's crooked.

466
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,700
请原谅我
Forgive me.

467
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,330
你们知道吗…老虎

只有三十颗牙

00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,700
比狗还少十二颗

470
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,660
我觉得这个小知识挺有意思
I thought that was a fun fact.

471
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:17,620
去你的房间 把门关上 现在就去
Go to your room, shut the door. Do it now.

472
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,000
在阳光下 我们能找到我们的激情
"In the sun, we'll find our passion"

473
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,890
在阳光下 我们能找到我们的目标
"In the sun, we will find our purpose"

474
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,450
你们总是被保护起来 没有真正的遭受过痛苦
You've always been protected, you've never truly suffered.

475
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:18,700
所以我们选择了你 你总是处在睡梦之中
That's why we chose you. You've always been asleep.

你从未有过机会
You've never had a chance.

The dark-haired girl, she's gonna be kept in another closet.

479
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,500
我知道这意味着什么
I might as well know what this point.

480
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,900
怪物 要冲着你们来了
The beast is coming for you. All three of you.

481
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,650
冲着你们三个 你们需要分开关押
You'll gonna be kept separate.

你就…把它脱掉吧
Just.. just take it off.

485
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,780
你说帕特丽夏太太的坏话可不好
It wasn't nice what you said about Mrs. Patricia.

486
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,080
你撒谎了
You lied.

487
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,650
我很抱歉 海德薇格
I'm sorry about that, Hedwig.

488
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,940
你们几个对我撒谎 吓坏了我…
You guys lied to me, made me scare, etc.

489
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,610
丹尼斯说 你会穿许多件衬衫
Mr. Dennis says you wear a lot of shirts.

490
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,010
我喜欢这一件
I like this shirt.

491
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,160
谢谢你
Thank you.

492
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,010
你知道丹尼斯和帕特丽夏太太是谁吗
Do you know who Dennis and Mrs. Patricia are?

493
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,780
不
No.

494
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,190
你看 我们每个人都得坐在椅子上等着
See, everyone of us has to wait in a chair.

495
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:33,150
而巴里 他决心要占据主导
And Barry, he decides to stand in the light.

496
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,180
但是因为我 巴里失去了那个能力
But Barry lost that power because of me.

497
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:44,370
我只是希望自己能够…能够一直 拥有这种特殊能力
I can wish myself in the light anytime I want with a special power.

498
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:49,130
只要我乐意 巴里就只能一直坐在椅子上干等
And Barry just have to keep sitting in his chair, if I wanted to.

499
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,620
所以丹尼斯和帕特丽夏太太说我可以和他们待在一起
That's why Dennis and Mrs. Patricia said I could be with them.

500
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,610
丹尼斯和帕特丽夏太太 他们都相信怪物的存在
Dennis and Mrs. Patricia, they believe

501
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,350
还有它能做到的事
in the beast and what it can do.

502
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,230
你见过他吗
Have you seen him?

503
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,250
那个…怪物
The.. beast?

504
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,750
没有啊 我可以亲你吗
No. Can I kiss you?

505
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,400
我也想过亲另外一个黑头发的女孩 但她现在有点麻烦
I wanted to kiss the other girl with the dark-hair, but she's in trouble.

506
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,340
所以你愿意吧  我其实不太擅长
So you want to? I don't know much about kissing, though.

507
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:25,670
可以的
Yeah.

508
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,360

You might be pregnant now.

512
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,340
- 我很厉害吧  - 是啊

Kanye West is my main man.

516
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:19,410
我们把CD机放在我房间里 就在窗子边上
We got my CD player set up in my room, right next to my window.

517
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,230
就像这样…
I'm like.. Ugh..

518
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:39,440
其实我可以看你跳舞 还可以和你一起听音乐
Maybe I could watch you dance and listen to music with you.

519
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:44,830
- 不行的 我的CD机在我房间里  - 噢 也对
- No, my music is in my room.  - Wow, right.

520
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,970
也许…你可以偷偷带我去啊
Maybe you could sneak me there.

521
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:56,330
你想耍我吗 耍我吗？
Are you trying to trick me, etc?

522
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:58,980
我要告状
I'll tell on you.

523
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,160
- 我要告发你  - 我会告诉你一些秘密
- I'm telling on you!  - I'll tell you something.

524
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:07,300
- 然后你可以判断我有没有说谎  - 就像一场考试 好吗
- And you can tell me if I'm lying or not, okay?  - Like a test, okay?

525
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:17,500
我是故意 在学校惹事的
I get into trouble at school on purpose.

526
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,330
这样我就可以被留堂
So I can get sent to detention.

527
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:32,940
就可以避开所有人
To get away from everyone.

528
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,090
这样我就可以独自一人了
So that I can be alone.

529
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:55,790
好吧 我可以让你看我房间里的东西
Okay, I'll show you something cool in my room.

530
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,840
好的
Okay.

531
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,300
但要等丹尼斯先生准备好仪式
But after Mr. Dennis has finished to getting ready with the ritual.

532
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,920
我得走了 他有个预约
I have to go. He's got an appointment.

533
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:09,160
我睡着的时候 他们还有一个人会坚持做医生嘱咐我们的事
When I fall sleeping, one of the others keep trying to reach what the doctor lady tell on us.

534
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:14,480
那条裤子上有红线 你可以看到它就在里面
That pant, it's got a red lining. You can see it down the side.

535
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:19,400
我们已经聊丝绸和羊毛聊了二十多分钟了
We've been talking about silk and wool blonde for 20 minutes.

536
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,170
你在深夜给我发邮件
Can I guess that you emailed me in the middle of the night,

537
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,820
应该是有要紧的事吧
for an emergency session.

538
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,920
有太多的问题吧？
Due to variety issues...

539
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,570
我已经解决那些事了 我发了邮件给你
Aha! I was down and I emailed you. And I woke up and I feel better.

540
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,870
我现在清醒过来了 感觉好多了
I.. I feel better.

541
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,150
我有个想法
I had a thought.

542
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,840
我想和你聊聊那次意外
I want to talk about the incident at work.

543
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:48,360
这没什么的 巴里 你现在很安全
It's okay, Barry. You're safe.

544
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:53,510
我只是想回顾一下细节 我们只需要聊聊那些细节
I just wanna bring the details back. We're just talk about the details.

545
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,110
新泽西州肯顿市高中的学生
A high school from Camden New Jersey

546
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,430
到你工作的地方做校外旅行
was on a field trip at your place of work.

547
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,940
两位年轻的女士走到你跟前
And two young ladies came up to you.

548
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,950
其中一个抓起你的手 伸进衣服里
And one took your hand and put it under her shirt on her breast.

549
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,240
放到她的胸口上 另外一位女士也做了相同的事
And the second did the same.

550
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,250
然后他们跑开了 和朋友一起放声大笑
And then they just run off, laughing to their friends.

551
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,060
你说他们大概是在玩什么大冒险
You thought that they might be on a dare.

552
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,550
他们都十七八岁的样子
You said they were 17 or 18.

553
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,590
而且这让你生气了好几天
You said it upset you for days.

554
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,410
我现在明白了 那就是年轻人的玩笑
It was just a teenage prank. I get that now.

555
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,640
这就是问题所在
And see, that's my mistake.

556
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,080
我想我把这件事想的太简单了
I believe that I went over this incident with you too fast.

557
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:35,240
尽管你说你没事了
Although you said, you were fine.

558
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:39,470
我聊过的别的人格都告诉我没关系了
And the other identities I met with said, it was fine.

559
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:40,970
但我相信
I believe that this...

560
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:46,610
就是你童年受辱 这件事给你带来了问题
brought up issues from when you were a child and abused.

561
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:49,460
有时候一些被羞辱的事故
Sometimes another incident of abuse

562
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,500
会促使隐藏的人格现身
can cause suppressed personalities to take the light.

563
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,090
丹尼斯 如果这就是你的问题所在
Dennis, if this is you..

564
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,680
我完全能够理解
I completely understand..

565
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:02,670
这就是你为什么觉得你需要出面来保护其他人格的原因
Why you felt the need to take over and protect the others.

566
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,520
哈哈…医生 别再重复这些了
Doctor, not this again.

567
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,030
其他人跟我说过了
The others told me

568
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:11,180
你和帕特丽夏告诉了他们怪物的事
that you and Patricia told the group about this beast.

569
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:16,530
我跟他们说了 那就是丹尼斯和帕特丽夏
And I told them that these are just scary stories that Dennis and Patricia

570
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,830
编的恐怖故事来吓唬他们的
tell the others, to scare them.

571
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,660
那个怪物怎么能爬在墙上
How this beast can crawl on walls,

572
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:26,320
就像最厉害的攀岩手 以最少的摩擦
like the best rock climbers using this lightest friction and in perfections.

573
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,560
和完美的操控 让自己的身躯停留在表面
to hold his body close to seemingly sheer surfaces.

574
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:35,970
你的皮肤怎么会又硬又厚 就跟犀牛一样
How his skin is thick and tough, like rhinoceros.

575
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,530
你真的相信那些怪物的故事吗
Do you really believe the stories about the beast?

576
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,500
如果真的是你 丹尼斯
If this is you, Dennis,

577
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,370
我明白为什么凯文需要你
I understand why Kevin needs you.

578
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:57,310
你强壮 守纪律 一丝不苟
You are strong and disciplined. You are precise.

579
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,090
你不会被利用
And you will not be taken advantage of.

580
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:03,600
你可以信任我
You can trust me.

581
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:08,440
举个例子 我可以利用凯文的全名
For example, I do have the ability to use Kevin's full name

582
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,120
来让他掌控 就像他过去那样
and bring him forth, as he has in the past.

583
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,430
但我不会那么做
But I wouldn't do that.

584
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,360
我知道那会让你们乱套
I know that, that would be chaos for all of you.

585
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,370
每个人都可以主导
Everyone would grab the light.

586
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,110
我不想伤害你们任何一个人
I don't wanna hurt any of you that way.

587
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:28,470
你不需要隐藏
You don't have to hide.

588
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,720
我知道你关心凯文
I know you are someone who cares for Kevin.

589
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,540
你对于我来说不是恶魔
You are not evil to me.

590
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,580
你很重要
You were necessary.

591
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:50,140
丹尼斯 是你吗
Dennis, is that you?

592
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,180
他们一直叫我们“大群”
They keep calling us the horde.

593
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,280
就是别的那些人
The others, you know.

594
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:16,320
帕特丽夏女士和我 我们总是被嘲笑
Mrs. Patricia and I, we're ridiculed.

595
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:19,700
我们是不完美
No, we're not perfect.

596
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,270
但我们也不至于被嘲笑
But, we don't deserve to be ridiculed.

597
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,540
我们一直在抗争 他们必须认识到这一点
We're all struggling. They have to admit that.

598
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,680
很高兴见到你 丹尼斯
I am pleased to meet you, Dennis.

599
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,110
我也是
You, too.

600
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,530
你似乎并不知道是谁 因为紧急事件发邮件给我
I seemed you don't know who emailed me for the emergency session.

601
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,210
是他们中的一个
One of the others.

602
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,710
- 现在是你在掌控吗  - 是我们在掌控
- Are you in charge?  - Yeah, we've taken charge.

603
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,660
只有我们可以保护凯文
We're the only one who can protect Kevin.

604
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,790
我们都在这里保护凯文
We're all here to protect Kevin.

605
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,220
他太软弱了
He's very weak.

606
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:04,680
他不知道我们可以多强大
He doesn't know how powerful we can be.

607
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:08,250
你介意跟我说说 你第一次出现是在什么时候
Would you mind telling me, when you first came into existence?

608
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:15,410
还有你和帕特丽夏 那些其他不受欢迎的人格
And how you and Patricia,

609
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:16,810
是怎么结盟的
the other undesirable identity, became aligned?

610
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:24,250
没关系 你还是有着坚定的信念吗
That's okay. Do you still have strong beliefs?

611
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,380
- 你说什么  - 怪物的故事
- That depends on what.  - The story of the beast.

612
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,750
丹尼斯 如果你感到困惑的话 有件事能让你明白
One thing, Dennis, that may comfort you if you are confused,

613
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:42,890
你已经见过其他人了
is that you've met the other alters.

614
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,560
你们都在一间屋子里 坐在椅子上 是吗
You're all in a room in chairs, right?

615
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,580
是的
Yeah.

616
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,690
但你从来没见到过怪物
But you never met the beast?

617
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:53,340
因为他不和你们同住
Because he doesn't reside with the rest of you?

618
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:56,530
是因为他住在那个火车庭院里 就像故事说的
Because he resides in the train yard, as the story goes.

619
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,850
因为凯文的爸爸留在火车上了
Because Kevin's dad left on the train.

620
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,930
但事实是 你和帕特丽夏从来没见过那个怪物
But the fact is, you and Patricia have never met the beast.

621
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:08,230
- 对吗  - 是的
- Have you?  - No.

622
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,290
这是因为他不是一个人格
That's because he's not an alter.

623
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,710
他不是第二十个人格
He's not the 24th identity.

624
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,950
他是个幻象
He is a fantasy.

625
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,210
快点 我们走
Hurry up! Let's go!

626
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,800
快啊 是时候了
Come on, it's time!

627
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:11,030
- 哇噢  - 我知道
- Wow.  - I know.

628
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,820
- 这是你的CD机吗  - 对啊
- This is your CD player?  - Yeah.

629
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:22,470
你不喜欢？它很旧了
You don't like it? It's not new.

630
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,820
不 不 我只是…
No, no, I'm just a..

631
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,560
我有点困惑 你说你的房间有个窗户
I'm confused. You said it's near a window.

632
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,910
没错 在这
Oh, that's here!

633
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,880
现在它关上了
Now, it's closed.

634
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:40,300
又打开了
Now, it's open.

635
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:42,820
又关上了
Now, it's closed.

636
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:45,820
又打开了
Now, it's open.

637
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,360
你以为这里有个真的窗户吗
Do you think it was a real window?

638
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,570
所以你可以这样离开？
So you could leave, etc?

639
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,400
帮我离开这里吧 海德薇格
Help me get out of here, Hedwig.

640
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,440
只用给我钥匙 让我走出这个门就行
Just give me the keys and let me out the door.

641
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:20,500
求你了 帕特丽夏小姐说过 当怪物来的时候就不会有人愚弄我了
Please. Ms. Patricia said that nobody'll make fun of me anymore when the beast comes.

642
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,130
她说 每个人都会看到我有多棒
She said that everyone must see how amazing I am.

643
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,530
而且我犯过的所有愚蠢错误 他们都不会在意
And that all of my silly mistakes, they won't matter anymore.

644
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,440
- 我觉得你还是快回你的房间吧  - 不
- I think you should go back to your room.  - No!

645
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:31,430
等等 求你了 我还想听你放坎耶·维斯特的专辑
No, wait! Please! I wanna hear your Kanye West albums!

646
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:35,120
接着带我看看你的房间 我们待在这吧 不然我就走了
Show me your room! Let's stay here or I'll still leave!

647
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,240
我不能
I can't.

648
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:38,280
你说要给我看很酷的东西 对吧
You said you wanna show me something cool, right?

649
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,610
- 给我看看  - 我不想
- Show me something!  - I don't want to!

650
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:42,640
拜托
Please!

651
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:45,970
这个
This!

652
01:03:53,620 --> 01:04:00,160
- 哇 真棒  - 这不是个玩具
- Wow! It's nice.  - It's not a toy.

653
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,000
- 这是真的？ - 是的
- Is this real?  - Yes.

654
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,680
这是丹尼斯先生的

He doesn't even know I stole it. Pretty cool, right?

656
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,530
你可以听别人谈话 他们甚至不知道你在听
You can listen people talking and they don't even know you're listening.

657
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:30,030
- 谁会谈话呢  - 别乱动
- Who does this talk to?  - Don't touch that.

658
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:33,000
我就想试试它能不能用

I'm being held in a basement! I've been abducted with two other girls!

668
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,000

Who the hell is this?

669
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:16,690
有人吗
Hello?

671
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,340
贝蒂 是你吗 这可不好玩
Betty, is that you? This isn't fun.

672
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,750
打给警察 我离你很近
Call the police! I must be near you.

673
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,600
我被困在一个类似地下室的地方
I'm being held in a basement or something.

674
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,240
好吧 贝蒂 听着 告诉拉里别闹
Okay, Betty, listen. Tell Larry to get vicious and I...

675
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,510
告诉他 我这里有他的耳机
Tell him I still got his own headphones.

676
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,590
我不知道我在哪
I don't know where I am. There is a man here.

677
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:43,240
这里有个男人 他绑架了我 他马上就要杀了我
He abducted us and he's going to kill me.

678
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:55,060
你还有几个小时
You may have a few hours left.

679
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,540
求你
Please.

680
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:07,230
求求你 救救我们
I'm begging you. Somebody save us.

681
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:12,560
到底是谁 你是怎么得到我们的对讲机的
Who is this? And how did you get one of our walkies?

682
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:23,070
把你的手摆成忏悔的姿势吧
Put your hands together in contrition.

683
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:28,530
在阳光下 我们能找到我们的激情
"In the sun, we will find our passion."

684
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:37,330
在阳光下 我们能找到我们的目标
"In the sun, we will find our purpose."

685
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,880
我是从超市里一张吊唁卡上读来的
I read that on a sympathy card in the supermarket.

686
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:55,210
它本来是为葬礼准备的 但是我觉得这话太美了
It was for funerals, but I saw it was beautiful.

687
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:04,380
丹尼斯 将会解释今晚的意义
Dennis will explain the meaning of this evening.

688
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:42,260
怪物是种嗅觉动物
The beast is a scenting creature,

689
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:46,170
代表了人类进化的最高水平
who represents the highest form of human evolution.

690
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:50,320
他相信普通人类的时代已经结束了
He believes the time of ordinary humanity is over.

691
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,250
我希望这能让你感到镇定
I hope this makes you feel calm.

692
01:07:56,150 --> 01:08:00,850
你将被… 献祭给更好的生物
You will be in the presents of something greater.

693
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:05,450
我本希望叫你脱了最后一件上衣 但我不会
I wish gonna ask you the last shirt, but I won't.

694
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,750
因为今夜是个神圣的夜晚 已经快要结束了
Because tonight is a sacred night. It's almost over.

695
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,590
凯西 过来
Casey, come on!

696
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,810
让我们假装我们是动物
Let's pretend we're animals again!

697
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,440
过来
Come on!

698
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,950
凯西 过来 这是我们的游戏
Casey, come on! This is our game!

699
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:36,240
不然我就跟你爸爸说你不乖
Or I'll tell your dad you're not being nice.

700
01:08:56,510 --> 01:09:00,330
过来 脱掉你的衣服 动物都不穿衣服
Come on! Take off your stuff. Animals don't wear clothes.

701
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:01,680
过来
Come on!

702
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:04,850
过来
Come on!

703
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,840
嘿 凯西熊
Hey, Casey-bear.

704
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:36,350
这可不好玩
This isn't funny.

705
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,250
它上膛了吗
Is it loaded?

706
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,490
凯西
Casey?

707
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:49,450
我是你叔叔
I'm your uncle.

708
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,500
放下 凯西
Stop it, Casey!

709
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,600
把枪放下
Put that gun down!

710
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,290
我要生气了
I'm getting upset!

711
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,360
我会非常生气
I'm about to get very angry!

712
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:11,380
你差点杀了我
You could've killed me.

713
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:45,570
“我们需要你”
"We need you."

714
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:21,770
- 这个地方已经关了  - 不 没关系
- This place is closed.  - No, it's okay.

715
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:22,940
- 你进不去的  - 没事
- You can't get in.  - No, it's okay.

716
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:30,920
你好 丹尼斯
Hello, Dennis.

717
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,420
你们其中一个人刚刚给我发了邮件
One of the others emailed me just now.

718
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:38,690
- 出什么事了吗  - 我们很好
- Is everything okay?  - We're fine.

719
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:43,110
丹尼斯 凯文有你真是太幸运了
Dennis, Kevin is really lucky to have you.

720
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:48,770
你们太特别了 我不想你们受到伤害
You are quite extraordinary. I just don't want you guys get hurt.

721
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,970
你觉得我们特别吗
You think we're extraordinary?

722
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:01,750
我喜欢你丹尼斯 我能进去吗
I like you Dennis. May I come in?

723
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:03,810
我们谈谈好吗
And can we talk?

724
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,990
我知道你想告诉我什么事
I know you wanna tell me something.

725
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,660
为什么不直接告诉我呢
Why don't you just tell me?

726
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:31,490
我们非常相似 你我都是局外的观望人
We're very similar, you and I. Both on the outside look and in.

727
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:33,380
请坐
Please, sit.

728
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:38,500
我没有太多拜访者 我去给你准备点水
I don't get many visitors. I'll get you some water.

729
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:44,660
他们在销售广告上找到一个合适的住处 但是我们早就住在这了
They got a proper on the sales ads, but we're already here.

730
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,830
他们向我承诺是真的 所以我就能拥有它
They promoted me to make this happen, so I can have it.

731
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,130
你要去见谁
Who are you going to meet?

732
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:01,450
我想谈谈…凯文
I want to talk about Kevin

733
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:05,710
他妈妈对他做了什么
and what his mother did to him.

734
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,790
我都记得
I remember the wall.

735
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:12,230
我很开心你突然敞开心扉
I'm happy you're suddenly so open.

736
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,220
凯文的妈妈曾经给这个三岁小孩 读过十一个邪恶的惩罚方式
Kevin's mother had read him 11 evil ways of punishing this 3 year-old.

737
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:19,820
是你主导身体的时候发生的吗
Is that when you arrived in the light?

738
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,000
是的
Yeah.

739
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:26,090
唯一避免吸引她注意的方法是
The one way to avoid her attention

740
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,690
把所有事情都做得完美无瑕
was to keep everything spotless, everything perfect.

741
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:33,620
我知道你是出于好意 丹尼斯
I know you're coming from good intention, Dennis.

742
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,000
但是 肯定还有别的方法可以帮助凯文
But there are other ways to help Kevin now.

743
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:40,220
在这个系统下 我失去了太多病人了
I've lost so many patients into the system.

744
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,030
我想让你知道 丹尼斯 我永远都不会停止为你斗争
I want you to know, Dennis. I will never stop fighting for you.

745
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:48,980
我的病人就是我的家人
My patients have become my family.

746
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,820
对他们 我选择了有别于传统的方式
They, what I've chose instead of a more traditional path.

747
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:56,150
我希望你能对我说实话
I hope you feel you can be truly honest with me.

748
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:59,130
我很想跟你说实话
I actually wanna be honest with you.

749
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:06,120
之前我说谎了 你问我有没有遇到过怪物
I lied before when you asked, if I'd ever met the beast.

750
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:10,690
我说“没有 这并不是真的”
I said "no. That really isn't true.

751
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:16,180
你写过一个德国的女人
You wrote about a woman in Germany,

752
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,660
她已经失明十年了
who'd been blind for 10 years.

753
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,650
然后 她被确诊为 分离性身份识别障碍
And then, it was discovered that she had Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).

754
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,710
她其中三个人格发展出了视力
Then three of her identities developed sight.

755
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:34,020
于是你推断 她的信念 使她的视觉神经再生了
You speculated that her optical nerves regenerated because of her beliefs.

756
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:36,180
所以你想说什么
What are you trying to say?

757
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:38,360
总有一些事情
There are things, Dr. Fletcher,

758
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,790
我们所有人都很难去相信
that all of us would find hard to believe.

759
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,200
你是想告诉我 有第二十种人格存在？
Are you trying to tell me there is a 24th identity?

760
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,210
是你保全了这个人格
You protect the broken.

761
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,370
就在你说这种情况十分不寻常的时候
When you said this situation was extraordinary,

762
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:54,690
- 我想你也许清楚  - 清楚什么
- I knew, you can maybe understand.  - Understand what?

763
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,000
那个怪物
The beast..

764
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:59,200
是真实存在的
is real.

765
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:04,370
他已经诞生了 你全部说对了
He's just emerged. You were right about everything.

766
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,240
他什么样
What does he look like?

767
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:13,710
他比我强大多了 而我 是我们中最强大的
He is much bigger than I am. And I'm the biggest of all of us.

768
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:18,230
他很高大 十分强壮
He's tall, he's very muscular.

769
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:25,710
毛发旺盛 他的手指有我们两倍长
He's got a long man hair and his fingers are twice the length of ours.

770
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,030
他认为我们非同寻常
He believes we're extraordinary.

771
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:34,720
我们不代表错误 而是无穷的潜力
And we don't represent a mistake, but our potential.

772
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:39,450
你说过同样的话
You say the same things.

773
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,170
- 他要来了  - 什么意思
- He's on the move.  - What's that mean?

774
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:51,910
我不明白 他不可能是真的
I don't understand. He can't be real.

775
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:57,110
一个人无论再怎么变化也是有限度的
There must be limits to what a human being can become.

776
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,870
这个故事还有另一部分 是吗
And there's another whole part of the story, isn't there?

777
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:06,010
那个关于吞食不洁的年轻人的部分
About the eating of the impure young?

778
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:09,130
“不洁”是什么意思
What does "impure" even mean?

779
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,930
我们应该好好讨论一下 这样你就可以很好地理解了
We should discuss that, so that you can understand fully.

780
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:17,790
- 理解什么  - 有时候
- Understand what?  - Sometimes..

781
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,820
没有其他的路可走
There's just no other way.

782
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:26,170
你要去见谁
Who are you going to meet?

783
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:29,420
他
Him.

784
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:38,480
你知道吗 我很乐意把这些都记下来
You know what, I would love to take notes on all of this.

785
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:43,220
也许我们应该在明天的见面中好好讨论一下
We should probably discuss this in a proper session tomorrow.

786
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:46,320
真的吗 你没问题吗
Really? You're okay with this?

787
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:50,000
这太美妙了 你这么坦诚
This has been so wonderful, you're being so open.

788
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:54,350
我能看出你的感受 因为怪物的意念更强大了
I can see that you feel very empowered by the philosophy of the beast.

789
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:56,260
我准备离开了
I'm going to go now.

790
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:58,900
我知道你会理解的 明天见
I knew you'd understand. I'll see ya.

791
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:14,470
你介不介意
Would you mind..

792
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:18,930
我用一下你的卫生间
If I use your bathroom?

793
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:27,090
不 就在楼下大厅 在你左手边的楼梯边上
No. It's down the hall, near the stairs on your left.

794
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:35,100
- 我在这等你  - 好的
- I'll wait you.  - Okay.

795
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:16,390
你是谁
Who are you?

796
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:23,060
你是谁 救救我
Who is it? Help me.

797
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:27,450
救救我 有谁在这儿吗
Help me. Is someone there?

798
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,000
- 噢 我的天  - 救救我 求你了
- Oh, my God.  - Please, help me!

799
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,490
他们永远不会发挥他们的潜力的
They will never reach their potential.

800
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,030
他们不重要
They don't really matter.

801
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:40,060
听我说 丹尼斯
Listen to me, Dennis.

802
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:43,210
我本该更用心倾听你
I should've listened better.

803
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:47,910
我早该意识到你多会 假装自己很强大了
I should've understood what you can bluffed how powerful you are.

804
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,410
帕特丽夏说只要按着你的方法做
Patricia says with your ways of working,

805
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,830
- 大家就会明白  - 丹尼斯

806
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:56,910
这都是错的
This is wrong.

807
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:02,180
这些年轻姑娘在受苦 这是犯罪
These young women are suffering. This is a crime.

808
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,400
我不能让你关着她们
I can't let you keep them here.

809
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:08,540
我们必须阻止他 这个人格太可怕了
We've got to stop this. This identity is monstrous.

810
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:10,540
你这样想我很难过
I'm really sad you feel this way.

811
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:15,320
你还没看出来吗 是因为你在这里的所作所为 这个人格才会诞生
Can't you see? He is formed because of your time in this place?

812
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,110
这里有一个女人
There was a lady.

813
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,800
有人在这里
Someone's here!

814
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,580
我们要从这里出去
We need to get out of these rooms!

815
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:55,470
这里有什么东西吗 任何我们能用的
Is there anything in the room? Anything that we could use?

816
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:05,720
这里什么都没有
There's nothing in here.

817
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:09,970
这里有一个挂钩
There is a hanger.

818
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:35,150
谢谢你 丹尼斯
Thank you, Dennis.

819
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,470
请拿好 先生
Here you go, Sir.

820
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,800
我们门外 好像是滑动螺栓
It sounded like there were slide bolts on the outside of our doors.

821
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:03,670
看看你能不能通过门缝移动锁
See if you can move the lock through the crack in the door.

822
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,890
“无法连接到网络”
"Unable to connect to the internet"

823
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:14,770
别慌 我们一定能出去的
Stay calm, we're getting out of here.

824
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,620
我们会救出凯西的
We're gonna get Casey.

825
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:20,930
你可以的 玛西亚
You can do this, Marcia.

826
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:00,160
没错 可以认为查哈曼打败了穆罕默德
It's regarded to Chahamanas defeated Muhammad, of course.

827
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:02,810
这场战争从一一九二年持续到一二〇〇年
The conquests between 1192-1200.

828
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:07,150
我喜欢默罕默德对普里特维拉贾的
I would like Muhammad to present ultimatum,

829
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:10,690
最后通牒“要么投降要么抵抗”
that Prithviraj "either positize or fight".

830
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,240
普里特维拉贾选择了抵抗
Prithviraj's defines..

831
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:21,640
我们要勇敢面对大军来袭 对他们的恐吓战术
We should stand up to the horde's advances and face up their scared tactic.

832
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,260
我们应该
We should shook..

833
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,320
我讨厌注射胰岛素
I hate my insulin shots.

834
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:31,680
其他人都没这事 为什么就我有糖尿病
No one else around here has to take them. Why do I have diabetes?

835
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:35,010
所有的医生 包括弗莱彻医生
All the doctors, besides Dr. Fletcher,

836
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:40,100
都说我们是同一个人 只是不同的人格
say that we're the same person, just personalities.

837
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:43,990
那你们怎么解释我为什么需要这玩意儿 操
How do you explain I'm the one who need this? You motherfuck..

838
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:51,950
在九十年代 我穿着多袋裤
I'm wearing cargo pants in the 90s.

839
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:58,910
再戴一条围巾 要不是里面穿了瓦维托斯的T恤
And a scarf. If it wasn't for the Varvatos t-shirt underneath,

840
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,910
那可会是一团糟
that'd be a mess.

841
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:06,210
我突然意识到了一些事情
I got notice of something right now.

842
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:10,120
我很难过 我觉得我耽误了不少时间
I'm worried sick. I have a very bad feeling that I'm losing time.

843
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:17,110
我能决定谁能主导 对吗 我觉得有人趁我不注意的时候 偷取我的主导权
I decide who gets the light, right? I think someone is stealing the light from me when I'm not aware.

844
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:22,210
“大群”总是迷恋那些“没有受苦的人”
The horde keep obsessing about the "ones who haven't suffered"..

845
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:24,860
我不知道他们要做什么
I don't know where they're going with this,

846
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:26,860
但这让我很害怕
but it scares me.

847
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:30,250
想象你穿着那件你最喜欢的丑毛衣
Think of yourself in a couple hours at home.

848
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:35,820
躺在家里的沙发上 呆上几个小时
on the couch in that ugly sweater that you love.

849
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:52,290
只是个动物 一有郊狼之类的动物 它就会这么叫
It's an animal. He barks like this when there's a coyote or something.

850
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,290
凯文 凯文
Kev.. Kev.. Kev..

851

凯文…
Kev.. Kev..

854
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:17,080
哦对了 我应该告诉弗莱彻医生这个 但是
And yes, I should tell Dr. Fletcher about this, but..

855
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:21,150
她会担心的 她是一位很好的女士
She'll worry. She is such a sweet woman.

856
01:29:23,410 --> 01:29:26,650
我想 我要出去走走
I believe, I will go for a nice walk.

857
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,700
集体思考一番 就像…
And think this through organization, like..

858
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:38,220
这是我的周一日记
That's my journal for Monday.

859
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:39,340
再见
Ciao.

我有没有伤害到你
Did I hurt you?

876

Is this still September 18, 2014, right?

881
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:17,760
那里有我买的猎枪

882
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,850
它就放在存杂物的储物柜里
It's in the bottom cabin that hidden behind things?

883
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:24,940
子弹就放在外面我的员工衣柜里
The shots are in my uniform closet, out in the service wall.

他接受不来现实
He can't handle reality.

888
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,620
我是贾德 弗莱彻医生收到我们的邮件了吧

我们必须这么做 我们得…
This is what we have to do. We..

890

我们在一〇〇八年
Us in 1008.

891
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,030
当安纳达帕拉受难 我们目睹他最崩溃的失败
When Anandapala suffered to show his most crushing defeat

892
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:00,620
马哈茂德统治着整个旁遮普
and Mahmud overrun the entire of Punjab,

893
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:03,400
接管着坎格拉的法门寺
where he's in taking the fame Temple of Kangra.

894
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,500
我们一直都被这个联盟误导了
We have been wronged by this alliance, this horde of

895
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:09,560
帕特丽夏 丹尼斯 还有那个小男孩的这群人
Patricia, Dennis and the boy.

896
01:36:09,650 --> 01:36:12,700
他们的所作所为不能代表我们
Their actions do not represent us!

897
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:14,610
大家都…
Every..

大家都先冷静一下…
Everybody just take a minute!

899
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,490
噢 宝贝姑娘
Oooh.. Baby girl..

900
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,580
他们一直想把主导权从我身上夺走
They've been stealing control of the light from me,

901
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:25,330
不过他们这群乌合之众得好好想想办法了
but their group are gonna work through this.

902
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:27,620
亲爱的 我是巴里
Honey, my name is Barry.

903
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,510
你真不应该用对讲机的

我们差点被抓了

905
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:48,640
停下 海德薇格
Stop it, Hedwig!

906

你从来就没做对过 看看你自己 你在摇篮中发抖
You never right. Look at you! You're so afraid in the bud.

907
01:36:55,570 --> 01:36:58,950
就是因为我 丹尼斯和帕特丽夏才会掌管这一切
Dennis and Mrs. Patricia are in charge because of me!

908
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:01,870
我要把主导权交给他们了
I'm gonna give the light to them now.

从今以后再没人敢嘲笑我

- Everything's fine now.  - Kevin Wendell Crumb.

01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:34,890
凯文睡着了 我们让他一直沉睡着吧
Kevin is asleep. We've made him sleep far away.

913
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:37,690
你可以一整晚都叫他的名字 亲爱的
You can call his name all your night, dear bird,

914
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:40,260
只可惜他听不见了
but he's not going to hear you.

915
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:47,330
怪物就在我们中间 他梦想着能有 一个更大的群体才能约束住他
The beast has shed with us his dreams of a larger group to sustain him.

916
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:52,760
下次会有十到十二个毫无价值的年轻人
Ten to twelve unworthy young next time.

917
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,850
这只不过是开始
This is just the start!

918
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:58,790
放手
Let go!

919
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:19,900
不
