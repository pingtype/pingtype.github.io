除了佣人及死者的以外
...and the deceased's.

142
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,290
金波夫人头颅破裂  造成脑部严重受损

00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,820
出了什么事?
What's the problem?

149
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,530
他...
He's...

150
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,840
在这儿  还在屋内
He's still in the house.

151
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,740
我没听错吧
Did I hear you right?

152
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,570
有陌生人闯入
Someone's in your house?

153
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,440
他想杀死我
He's trying to kill me.

154
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,550
复述一次好吗
Could you repeat that, please?

155
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,280
这位女士
Ma'am?

156
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,380
他想杀死我
He's trying to kill me.

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,490
暴徒还在屋内

女士
Lady

160
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,560

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,910
金波先生
Mr. Kimble...

165
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,250
在考虑过本案的各种因素后
having considered all the factors and aggravation and mitigation in this case

166
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,920
认为你行凶之意图与手法  极尽残暴之能事
...and found the offense was brutal and indicative of wanton cruelty...

167
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,670
本庭因而判定将你
it's judgment of this court, you will be remanded to

168
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,570
送往州立监狱  注射毒剂处死

169
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,770

...on a date to be set forth by the Attorney General of the State.

170
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,610

174
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,910

175
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,110

放轻松
Come on, make yourselves comfortable.

186
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,870
各位  规矩都知道了吧
You know the routine, gentlemen.

187
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,130
我好累
I'm tired.

188
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,200
到米纳镇路程约20英里
20 miles from Menard.

189
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,670
40分钟内可以抵达
We'll be there in about 40 minutes.

190
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,480
早到早放心  让典狱长去照料
I'll be glad to get rid of this load. Let McKenzie take care of them.

191
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,980
那边的伙食不错  我饿扁了
Always got some good eating there. I'm starving.

192
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,390

Me, too.

193
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,850
牢饭吃够了
Had enough prison chow.

194
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,860
艾德才不管呢  反正他在节食
Old Ed, he don't care. His old lady's got him on a diet.

195
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,990
对吧  艾德
Right, Ed?

196
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,910
快过来  快
Somebody get in here, quick!

197
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,350
他病了  赶快
He's getting sick! Let's go move! Move!

198
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,210
-口吐白沫  -快到了
-He's foaming at the mouth. -We're almost at the prison.

199
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,480
他喘不过气了...
He's choking!

200
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,490
等等
Wait!

201
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,310
天呀  妈的
Oh, shit!

202
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,850
金波  快来  你是医生  快帮忙
Kimble, get over here. You're a doctor, do something!

203
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,310
手铐打开
Unlock me!

204
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,660
手铐打开
Unlock me!

205
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,750
接住
Catch

206
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,600
撑住你不会有事的
You'll be okay.

207
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,930
什么声音
What the hell is that?

208
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,170
妈的
Shit!

209
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,710
-帮我一把  -去你的
-Help me! -The hell with you.

210
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,650
帮个忙
Help me with this man!

211
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,790
去你的  医生
Fuck your doctor

212
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,420
听好...
Now you listen.

213
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,430
我不管你往哪个方向逃
I don't give a damn which way you go.

214
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,830
别跟着我  懂吗
Just don't follow me. You got that?

215
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,330
是的
Yes

216
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,530
卡普兰
Kaplan

217
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,700
保重
Be good.

218
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,640
我的老天
My, my, my.

219
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,380
乱得一塌糊涂
What a mess.

220
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,110
比马戏团还乱
It's a circus.

221
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,160
我的袋子在你那儿吗?
You got my bag?

222
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,760
这儿被火车撞个正着
Point of impact right here.

223
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,100
车头分解  其余车厢出轨
The first engine uncoupled, and the train jumped the track.

224
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,660
出轨后又滑行了约100码
About 100 yards?

225
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,400
是的
Yes

226
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,700
该买双新靴子
You must get new boots.

227
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,170
早说过  不要穿高跟鞋
I told you not to wear the heels.

228
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,800
穿两件外套
Wear two coats.

229
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,170
下次吧
Next train wreck.

230
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,610
干嘛呵护她
Why do we always mother her?

231
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,240
因为她爱我们
Because she loves us.

232
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,710
-你想当火车司机吗? -他大概表现得很神勇
-How'd you like to be the driver? -I bet he did a Casey Jones.

233
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,040
慢点  先生
Hold it, sir.

234
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,850
这里谁负责
Hi. Who's in charge?

235
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,860
罗林斯警长
Sheriff Rollins.

236
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,090
在电视台记者那边
Just follow the TV lights.

237
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,190
罗吉斯警长
Sheriff Rogers.

238
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,660
他叫罗林斯
Rollins!

239
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,960
去出事现场看看
Look down there and take Newman.

240
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,600
好
Ok

241
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,630
该上工了
Come on. Time to go to work.

242
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,740
巴士翻滚了好几次才停住
The bus rolled over several times before settling down at the bottom of the hill.

243
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,210
我不晓得是否昏过去...
I don't know if I passed out or what...

244
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,350
但火车突然山崩似的压过来
...but when I looked up, the train was bearing down on us. Fast.

245
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,120
我也搞不清楚  想不起来
I don't know how. It's still kind of hazy.

246
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,620
我抓住他  把他推出车外
Somehow I grabbed him and pushed him out of the bus.

247
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,150
-你很勇敢  没弄好的话会送命  -我了解
-You're brave, you could've been killed. -I know.

248
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,160
他是我的好友  义不容辞
He's my partner. He would have done the same for me.

249
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,560
打扰了  我是联邦副司法官吉拉  想跟你谈一谈
Excuse me, I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, I'd like to...

250
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,560
你稍等一下
I'll be with you in just a minute.

251
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,470
可以
sure

252
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,570
再核对一次笔录
One more time, just for the record...

253
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,740
-这3位死亡了? -是的
-these three are dead. -Yes

254
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,910
这一位呢?
And this one?

255
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,280
事情发生太快...
Everything happened so fast.

256
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,220
他大概未及脱逃
I don't think he made it.

257
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,760
你白跑一趟了
You came a long way for nothing.

258
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,790
尊敬的警长  我想我该建议
With all due respect, Sheriff Rollins...

259
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,420
在15英里范围内实施路检
...I'd like to recommend checkpoints on a 15-mile radius...

260
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,030
包括57及24号公路  这条路也要查...
...at I-57, I-24 and over here on Route 13...

261
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,460
等等  犯人都死了
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.

262
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,190
路检只会让许多人发疯
Checkpoints will get a lot of people frantic

263
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,490
我办公室电话会响个不停
and they'll flood my office with calls.

264
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,540
我不想这种事发生  那么...
Well, shit, I'd hate to see that happen...

265
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,440
案子由我接管好了
...so I'll take over your investigation.

266
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,580
谁授权的?
On what authority?

267
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,980
伊利诺州州长...
The governor...

268
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,280
及联邦司法官办事处
...the U.S. Marshal's Office...

269
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,510
伊利诺州第5分局
...5th District, Northern Illinois.

270
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,020
好吧  这个烂摊子都交给你了
All right, you want jurisdiction over this mess. You got it.

271
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,490
各位  集合一下
Okay, boys, gather around and listen up.

272
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,820
我们收队  "西部大警长"来了
We're shutting it down. Wyatt Earp is here to mop up...

273
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,760
寻我开心  "西部大警长"
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.

274
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,100
山姆
Sam.

275
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,370
瞧这个
Look here!

276
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,440
我们很好奇  脚链上的脚不见了
We're always fascinated when we find leg irons with no legs in them.

277
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,040
钥匙是谁保管的?
Who held the key, sir?

278
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,140
你在问我吗?
Me.

279
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,910
钥匙呢?
Where're those keys at?

280
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,180
不晓得
I don't know.

00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,010
-这儿没有出口往上走  -往上
-There's no way out of here! -We must go up.

422
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,450
不对...
No

423
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:43,220
爬楼梯  动作快  快出去会合!
Go up the stairs! Up, up!

424
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,290
把水关掉  过来
Have that water turned off. Come over here.

425
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,660
在桥下部署两辆车4个人
Put two patrol cars on that bridge down there, four patrolmen.

426
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,430
沿着河边上下搜索
Have them glass this river upstream and down.

427
00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:00,470
直升机在河面上100尺搜寻  要小心电线
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this river. Make him aware of these wires.

428
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,800
你疯了  他死了!
Are you out of your mind? He's dead!

429
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,810
那就更容易逮到他了
That'll make him easy to catch.

430
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,180
在河岸两边布置警犬...
I want hounds on both banks of this river for two miles...

431
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,580
上下游两英里内都要
...upstream and downstream.

432
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,480
-有搜救队吗? -有
-You've got a search and rescue team? -yes we do

433
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,990
叫他们打捞泄洪道
Get them down here and drag the bottom of this spillway.

434
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:23,460
-为何水还没关掉!  -在进行了
-Why isn't the water turned off? -Somebody from County's working on it.

435
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,930
叫直升机前来支援
Bring in the helicopters now.

436
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,840
我们离开这里
We're out of here!

437
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,930
大概找不出什么东西
I don't think there's anything to find.

438
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,710
还是找找看吧  反正设备都有
Find it anyway. You've got lights and generators coming tonight.

439
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:40,160
-我不干预你的工作  -直升机停在桥上
-I won't tell you how to do your job... -Put the helicopter on the bridge!

440
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:43,110
他存活机会很渺茫
but only one person in a million could survive that fall.

441
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,140
可能葬身鱼腹了
The guy is fish food!

442
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,640
那就拿根杆子去捕鱼吧
Get a cane pole. Go catch the fish that ate him.

443
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,450
通知史帝芬  我们要回总部了
Get Stevens. Tell him we're on the way in.

444
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,980
他害得我好惨
That man took everything from me!

445
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,490
我们找不到那家伙
We can't find the guy.

446
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,630
你快去抓他!
You find that man!

447
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,470
你们快去抓他...
You find that man!

448
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,520
发电机及探照灯都装好了
The generators and searchlights are there now.

449
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,690
他们将会彻夜地搜索
They'll continue the search into the night.

450
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,290
很好  打电话谢谢肯塔基警方  以警犬支援我们
Good. Call Kentucky and thank them for the dogs.

451
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,360
记住这出戏还没落幕
Remember, opera ain't over until the Big Dog howls.

452
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,600
要搭便车吗?
Need a ride?

453
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:43,580
再说一次  要确定无误
Check it again.

454
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,090
发现逃犯踪迹了  他跟一个吸毒的女人住一起
All right, we got him. He shacked up with some babe over in Whiting.

455
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,710
她下班后带他回家
She left work tonight and took him home.

456
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,630
两个小时之前  她老板说的
About two hours ago, her boss said.

457
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,930
在她的住处外发现她的车子
They spotted her car outside her house.

458
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,760
她有跟任何人鬼混吗?
Does she run with anyone?

459
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,320
没有  她也没有家庭
No one we could find. No family either.

460
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,390
叫他们别打草惊蛇
Tell the police not to move till we get there.

461
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:05,440
我们一早就行动
We'll go first thing in the morning.

462
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,240
你表弟那部卡车还在吧
Your cousin still got his truck?

463
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,300
跟他借用一下
Call him. Tell him we need it.

464
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,630
-装醉  纽曼  -是
-Be drunk, Newman. -Ok

465
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,160
靠近一点
Stay close.

466
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,930
我跟在你屁股后面  老哥
Right on your ass, buddy.

467
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,010
别跟丢了  贴在我身边
I don't want you getting lost. You stick with me.

468
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,270
好
Ok

469
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,550
联邦司法官  全部趴下
U.S. marshals! Everybody down!

470
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:12,900
别乱动  手伸出来  手举高
Hold it right there! Show me those hands!

471
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,900
举高一点
Keep them up!

472
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,850
滚到那边去
Get your ass in there.

473
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,610
你的人落在我手里  听到了吗
I got your man! I got your man, you hear me?

474
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,230
拜托  别伤到他
Please do not hurt him

475
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,810
我要离开这里
I want out of here!

476
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,690
你们的人落在我手里了
I got your man!

477
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,890
他落在我手里了
I got your man!

478
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,630
我一枪打死他  我要出去
I'm going to blow his brains out! I want out of here!

479
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,160
听到了吧  臭条子
Do you hear me, Cops?

480
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,300
听到了吧
Do you hear me?

481
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:45,930
我要出去
I want out of here!

482
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:50,180
-听好  我们商量一下  -我们可以
-Listen! We can work this out! -Yes, we can.

483
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:53,580
闭嘴...
Shut up! Shut up!

484
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,450
听到了吧
Do you hear me?

485
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,050
我提出我的条件
Listen, and I'll tell you what I want.

486
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,050
我要求一部车子
I just want a car out front.

487
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:06,390
别开枪
Don't shoot.

488
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,930
别开枪  没事了
It's over.

489
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,280
闭嘴
Shut up!

490
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,380
我几乎听不见了
I can't hear anything. My ear is...

491
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,630
真不相信你下得了手
I can't believe you did that.

492
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,590
你是说  我该跟他谈条件
You think I should've bargained with that guy.

493
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,360
是啊
Yeah.

494
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,500
我是这么认为
I do.

495
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,760
你可能会失手
You could have missed.

496
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,610
害我送命
You could have killed me.

497
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,500
耳朵伤势如何?
How bad is that ear?

498
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,370
很严重  可能会变成聋子
Terrible. I'll have permanent damage.

499
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:35,750
我瞧瞧
Let me see it.

500
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,440
过来
Come here.

501
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,610
听得到我说的话吗?
Can you hear what I'm saying now?

502
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:41,810
可以
Yeah.

503
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,390
我绝不...
I don't...

504
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,290
跟人谈条件
...bargain.

505
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,120
听清楚了?
You hear that?

506
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,190
是的
Yeah.

507
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:54,860
那就好
Good.

508
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,270
华特  我是理查
Walter, this is Richard.

509
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:44,190
老天  你为什么要逃  现在更难洗刷清白了
Richard, Jesus! Why did you run? Running only makes you look guilty.

510
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,450
这个我不担心
I wasn't worried about appearances, Walter.

511
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,170
你人在哪儿  我陪你去自首
Tell me where you are, so I can meet you and you can surrender.

512
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,750
我不自首  我要向你借点钱
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

513
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,220
理查
Richard

514
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,140
你要我协助一个重刑犯
You're asking me to harbor and aid a convicted felon.

515
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,580
这个我办不到
I can't help you that way.

516
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:02,910
身为你的好友跟律师  我劝你去自首
My advice both as your friend and legal counselor is to give yourself up.

517
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,870
告诉我  你人在那儿
Now tell me, where are you?

518
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:06,900
圣路易市
St. Louis.

519
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,270
地址呢? 我马上赶去
Give me an address. I'll get there as soon as I can.

520
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,840
卡普兰是个恶棍  想杀我的部下
Mr. Copeland was a bad man. He was going to kill one of my kids.

521
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,980
那就怪我吧  是我干掉他的
Well, sir, you can blame me. I'm the one that shot him.

522
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,550
我劝你去自首  告诉我  你人在哪儿
Give yourself up. Now tell me, where are you?

523
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,200
圣路易市
St. Louis.

524
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:41,300
他根本没死  这是你们的教训
So he's not dead. Let that be a lesson to you.

525
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:45,570
别跟上司争辩  上司永远是对的
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog. Big Dog is always right.

526
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,580
你以前也没错
Yeah, you been right before.

527
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,640
华特  我是理查
Walter, this is Richard.

528
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:56,140
老天  你为什么要逃  现在更难洗刷清白了
Why did you run? It only makes you look guilty.

529
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,760
这个我不担心
I wasn't worried about appearances.

530
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:02,660
你人在哪儿  我陪你去自首
Tell me where you are, so I can meet you and you can surrender.

531
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,730
我不自首  我需要钱
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

532
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,770
听起来像火车行驶在高架铁路
I might be crazy, but that train sounds like an El.

533
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,600
圣路易没有高架铁路
St. Louis doesn't have one.

534
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,300
你怎么知道是高架铁路?
How do you know it's an elevated train?

535
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,240
我在高架铁路下住了廿年
I lived under an El for 20 years.

536
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:19,080
那你解释一下  高架铁路跟地面铁路声音有何不同
Explain the difference between the sound of an El and a train on the ground.

537
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,440
你的耳朵一定很敏锐
You must have ears like an eagle.

538
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,850
再播一次  我要听火车声音
Play that back. I want to hear the sound of an El.

539
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,830
哪些城市有高架铁路  纽约
What cities have Els? New York has got an El.

540
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,780
-费城  -我们芝加哥也有...
-Philly. -We do.Milwaukee has got an El.

541
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,830
停住好像有铃声
Hold it! Where the lawyer says he's guilty. There's a bell in the background.

542
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:37,060
有男声广播的声音  能把其他杂音去掉吗?
There's a guy on a P.A. Can you drop everything but him?

543
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,560
我试试看
I'll try. Hold on.

544
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,840
华特  我是理查...
Walter I'm Richard

545
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,000
就是这里
Right there.

546
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,200
列车长在说什么?
What's he saying?

547
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:51,020
听起来像是  下一站  再放一次
Sounds like, "Next stop." Do that again!

548
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,770
"下一站是..."
"Next stop..."

549
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,970
"商品市场"
"Merchandise Mart."

550
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,510
狗东西  他回来了
Son of a bitch! Our boy came home.

551
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:04,070
那铃声是在华尔街桥  6条街之隔
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge, six blocks away.

552
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:05,780
我早知道是高架铁路
I knew it was an El.

553
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,090
上司永远是对的
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.

554
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,640
-我通知芝加哥警局  -这是他的档案
-I'll call the C.P.D. -This is his Chicago file.

555
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:12,720
出发了

走吧  狄瑞斯可
Let's go, Driscoll.

839
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:48,100
会面时间5分钟
You've got five minutes.

840
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:50,360
你是哪位?
Who the hell are you?

841
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:54,210
对不起  我弄错了
Look, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

842
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,970
都叫我出来了
You got me down here...

843
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:56,710
好歹也要聊两句
...might as well talk.

844
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:02,720
牢里闷得很  又没闭路电视
Down here you got no entertainment. Ain't no cable here.

845
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:07,730
我不能跟你多聊  抱歉
Listen, pal, I wish I could, but I can't. Sorry.

847
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:05,340
警察先生  穿蓝色外衣的人拿着一把枪对一个女人大吼
There is a man in a blue coat waving a gun and screaming...at a woman.

848
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:06,040
拦住他
Stop that man!

849
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:12,150
他是司法官  放开他
He's a U.S. marshal! Let him go! Let him go!

850
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,950
门关上
Close the gates!

851
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,560
站住
Hold it!

852
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,490
门打开
Open the doors!

853
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,640
我们在屋顶
We're on the roof.

854
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,310
找几个人  看看那边
Take some men! Look down there!

855
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:07,100
他进入广场了
Jesus, he's in the plaza, Sam!

856
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,150
朝东边逃逸
He's heading east!

857
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:13,810
朝东走正接近毕加索的雕像
He's going east toward the Picasso!

858
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,160
庆祝"圣・帕特里克"节日
Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.

859
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:03,280
吉拉先生  你认为金波医生回来的目的是什么?
Deputy Gerard, why do you feel that Dr. Kimble came back to Chicago?

860
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:04,130
我不知道
I have no idea.

861
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,900
你的属下今天曾前往医院
We understand your deputies were at the hospital today.

862
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:09,550
金波去过那儿吗?
Was Dr. Kimble at the hospital?

863
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:11,340
无可奉告
I don't have any comment on that one.

864
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,280
我把案发经过再重复一遍
Let me get the chronology straight.

865
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,680
他被审判  定罪  入狱...
The subject was tried, convicted, incarcerated...

866
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,360
脱逃  一度被假设死亡
...escaped, presumed dead,

867
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,010
现在又返回芝加哥  对吧?
and is now at large in Chicago. Is that correct, sir?

868
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,890
我们未曾假设他死亡
Except for being presumed dead.

869
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:26,990
他持械逃亡  是个危险人物?
Do you believe that Kimble's armed and dangerous?

870
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,160
我认为他是危险人物
I believe he's dangerous, yes.

871
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,140
他既然冒险返回本市
He's taking chances, coming back.

872
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:34,090
你会认为他是清白的吗?
Do you feel that perhaps he might be innocent?

873
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:37,940
他不是清白的  他被法院判刑
No, he's not innocent. He was convicted in a court of law. He's guilty.

874
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:40,430
他有罪  你准备怎么样抓他?
How will you try to catch him?

875
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,850
恕不奉告了  各位
We have no further comments for now.

Pina coladas.

889
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,640
那我们是不是得向你们买药?
What must the hospital buy? What's the catch?

890
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:19,640
放心度假钓鱼去吧
Sailfish.

891
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,440
制药厂没有别的意思
No, there are no strings attached.

892
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,870
你意下如何  你意下如何...
So what do you say? So what do you say?

893
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:31,850
这个人连毛细孔都流血了
This guy is bleeding from every needle puncture.

894
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,860
蓝兹的病人  他服了那种奇迹的药?
Lentz sent this guy in? Is he on that wonder drug?

895
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:38,190
是的  他在试用RDU-90  万能之药
Yes, he's on the RDU -90 protocol, Provasic.

896
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:39,700
未来世界的药物
Drug of the future, boys.

898

"Parade Master of Ceremonies Ed O'Flaherty said...

"金波是个不得了的小伙子"

902
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:02,650
-"小伙子? "  -他是这么说的
-"Lad? " -Yeah, "lad."

903
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:07,290
也许他是个小矮人  我是照报纸上说的
Maybe he's a leprechaun. I'm quoting this guy.

904
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,620

Some guy on line three claims he's Richard Kimble.

905

I remember it was noisy.

914

915

你妻子不是你杀的

把罪名推给一个装义肢的  他想陷害我吗?
Keep blaming somebody with a prosthetic limb. Is he coming after me?

960
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,730
他有理由这样做吗?
Does he have reason to do so?

961
01:33:37,830 --> 01:33:41,290
我装了义肢  那一定是我干的喽
I have a prosthetic arm! I must've done it!

962

Do you have any idea why Kimble would be interested in these photographs?

972
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:12,800
不知道
No.

973

Do you mind if I look around to see if anything's missing?

980
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,730

如果你是金波的话

01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:18,870
还没结束
It's not over yet.

1071
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:41,620
怎么回事?
What's going on?

1072
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:42,990

-你看到什么? -正常人体组织
-What do you think? -Cold normal.

1080
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,630
显然不是原来的组织样本
Clearly not the same tissue.

1081
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:45,780
不但都是正常的肝脏
And not only did they all come from healthy livers...

1082
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:48,010
而且是同一片肝脏切下来的
...they all came from the same liver.

1083
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,950
干得好
Kath, you beauty.

1084
01:41:58,730 --> 01:41:59,960
打扰

Need some information about a Dr. Lentz who was on staff here.

蓝兹认识金波医生吗?
I want to know if he knew or have had any contact with a Dr. Richard Kimble?

1089
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,450
我没见过金波医生
I haven't seen Dr. Kimble.

1090
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:20,050
你答非所问
I didn't ask that.

1091
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:22,620
我反正不晓得
I wouldn't know.

1092
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:26,690
失陪了  我还有急事要处理
If you'll excuse me, I have prior obligations to attend to.

1093

-罗斯福先生  -请说
-Mr. Roosevelt -please say

1094
01:42:29,630 --> 01:42:31,400
你在撒谎
I think you're lying to us.

1095
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:34,970
蓝兹是元凶?
You think Lentz is the bad guy?

1096
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:37,510
为何不是呢
Yeah, why not?

1097
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:42,610
他有RDU-90的专利权
He was one of the original patent boys in RDU-90.

1098
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:45,870
我正要把检验样本送出去
I was sending in my tissue samples...

1099
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:50,220
他用正常的样本加以调包后  再签发合格报告书
...he was replacing them with healthy samples, issuing the path reports...

1100
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:52,600
我的样本被他丢了
...shit -canning my stuff. Easy.

1101
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:53,960
等等
Wait a minute.

1102
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:56,800
蓝兹死于8月21日
Lentz died August 21st.

1103
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:04,720
有一半的合格书...  是在这一天签署的
Half the samples he approved were signed the day he died.

1104
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:05,970
你没开玩笑?
You're kidding.

1105
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:10,540
一定还有其他人在搞鬼
Someone else must have been manipulating this.

1106
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:12,750
内部的人搞的
Someone with access.

1107
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:25,800
多谢了
Thanks, Kath.

1108
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:27,570
你上哪儿?
Where're you going?

1109
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:30,380
去拜访一位好友
To see a friend.

1110
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:37,650
这个案子令我头痛
This is giving me a headache.

1111
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:41,860
很怪  罗斯福说金波去哪里?
That's surprising. Where did Roosevelt say Kimble was going?

1112
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:44,050
他说不知道
He says he doesn't know.

1113
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,360
-你相信他的话  -是的
-Do you believe him? -Yes, I do.

1114
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:48,990
他说金波去找组织样本
He says he was here to pick up some tissue samples...

1115

听听这个
But listen, get this.

1117
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:55,770
样本是经过尼可斯批准的
The release was approved by Dr. Charles Nichols.

1118
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:59,170
尼可斯也认识蓝兹
Nichols also knew Lentz.

1119
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,240
他是蓝兹的上司
He was Lentz's boss.

1120
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:02,940
他一定隐瞒了有关金波的事
He was covering for Kimble.

1121
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:05,220
快通知芝加哥警方去医院
Send the C.P.D. over there right now.

1122
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:07,830
我们将派许多警察过去
We're going to send a bunch of cops.

1123
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:09,740
让他们彻底搜查一番
Make sure they turn that place inside out.

1124
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:13,710
别让他们说你的辫子  你干得漂亮
Don't let them give you shit about your ponytail either. Well done.

1125
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:14,800
是我的荣幸
My pleasure, Sam.

1126

亨利
Henry

1127
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,740
尼可斯医生骗我
Dr. Nichols lied to me.

1128
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:21,840
-去找他  -我马上去
-Go find him. -I'm on it.

1129
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:31,280
他走了
He's gone by now.

1130
01:44:31,450 --> 01:44:34,890
我四处找遍了  没找到他
I looked every place you told me to look and I didn't see him.

1131
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:36,420
我打电话给你
I'm telling you.

1132
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:39,430
如果他在医院  我一定找得到
If he was in the hospital, I would have found him.

1133
01:44:39,730 --> 01:44:41,220
你要我怎么做?
So what do you want me to do?

1134
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:44,500
等一下
Hold on. Wait a minute.

1135
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:46,870
我发现他了
I marked him. I got him now.

1136
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:18,510
蓝兹医生
Dr. Alexander Lentz.

1137

"...into the barriers that separate the Drive from Lake Michigan."

1141
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,690
这个令人难以相信
Sam, you're not going to believe this.

1142
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:40,150
塞克斯在这两年来  未曾打电话给金波
Sykes' records for the past two years show no calls to Kimble.

1143
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:41,070
想必如此
It was a thought.

1144
01:45:41,110 --> 01:45:45,020
不过  金波的电话纪录上  却打过一通给塞克斯
But when I cross -checked Kimble's phone records, one came up.

叫警卫来
Call Security.

1241
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:26,860
都是你干的
Did you?

他伪造研究报告
