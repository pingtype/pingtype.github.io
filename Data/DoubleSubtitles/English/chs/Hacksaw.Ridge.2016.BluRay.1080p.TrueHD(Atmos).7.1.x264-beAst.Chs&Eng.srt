我把它借给出车祸的男生

没它我的裤子系不好

152
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,710
呃，我可没有你的皮带
Well I dont' have your belt.

153
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,210
不，我知女士，它仍在男生那儿

有人接你吗

尚未知但将知
Well not yet but about to.

186
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,360
你有说过话吗？跟女人

除了这个尚未成家者

跟她说过

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,990
你以前献过血吗

196
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,130
是的女士我有

你，皮带男
You the belt man.

198
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,200
德斯蒙德，就是我

199
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,350
好吧，德斯蒙德，我们不能连续两天采你的血
Well Desmond we can't take your blood two days in a row.

200
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,280
那就好，可否拿回我的

我的血，我想要回它

203
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,110
那不行，不能把它还你
It dont work like that. We can't just give it back to you.

204
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,770
好吧，你必需还
Well you got to.

205
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,720
自从你用针扎了我，我就心跳加速
Ever since you stuck me with that needle my heart is beating up fast.

206
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,880
每次想到你则会跳得更快
Everytime I think about you beat faster still.

207
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,090
我以前从未听过这话
I never heard that one before.

208
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,640
好老土
It's pretty corny.

209
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
是土
It is.

210
00:15:59,190 --> 00:15:59,690
对啊
Yeah.

211
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,190
这是个耻辱，我练了一整夜
That's a shame. I've been practicing that all night.

212
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
不好吗
No good?

213
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,660
我没那样说
I didn't say that.

214
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,900
有何差异？动脉跟静脉
What's the difference between an artery and a vein?

215
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,760
你说啥

流血
Bleed.

220

我觉得你得多练习男生跟

女生的约会对白，在你出门前

223
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,580
我给你本书，若你那样有兴趣

224
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,130
约会时

229
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,100
没，我只觉得你是我见过的最漂亮的
No, I just think you're the prettiest thing I ever seen.

230
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,460
那是因为我四周黑麻麻地
That's cause I'm sitting in the dark.

231
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:26,910
不
No.

232
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,310
你确实美丽

00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,110
让路
Out of the way!

你得看好路再走

235

对不起，我没想到你会介意

你没问过

我想你可能会喜欢

你来吗
You coming?

240
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
死开
Shit!

241
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,100
你为何对我们只字不提
Why didn't you say anything to us?

242
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,200
因为你会试着让我说出来，亦知我做得对

249
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,770

不要，汤姆
Don't Tom.

什么

256
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,660
我只是说哈尔穿起制服看着如何时髦
I'm just saying how snappy Hal looks in his uniform.

257
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,810
而所有的女孩似乎都这么认为
All you girls certainly seems to think so.

258

他使她们涌向他，他得意之极
He had them flocking to him. He was most proud.

259
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,120
我只希望哈尔中枪时，是穿过夹克前面
I just hope that when Hal get shot it's through the front of his jacket.

把他的大部分内脏跟肠子从前面炸出落得到处都是
 It blew most of his guts and intestines out his front off for everywhere.

263
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,630
彻底毁掉他的制服
Wrecked his uniform entirely.

264
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,030
好彩他死了，所以他从不知他的制服看上去有多糟
It was lucky he was dead so he never knew how awful his uniform looked.

265
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,880
离开我的视线
Get out of my sight.

266

亲一个

这纯粹是敲诈
That is pure blackmail.

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,410
是的，女士，但那仍是我的条件

你不会打我？是吗

279
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,490
因我可能会带着你跟我掉下去
Cause I'll fall off I'm gonna take you with me.

280
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,150
吻我即知
Kiss me and find out.

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,920
我指我是去救人而非杀人
I figure I'll be saving people not killing.

289
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,510
我得上班了，不想迟到
I have to go to work and don't want to be late.

290
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,490
多萝西，别这样
Dorothy. Don't.

291
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,880
多萝西，多萝西
Dorothy. Dorothy.

292
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,910
那么你想求我嫁给你还是别的
So are you gonna ask me to marry you or what?

293
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,600
我不知你会否还讨厌我
I don't know you still gonna hate me?

294
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,150
我也不知，你可没问
I wouldn't know you haven't ask.

295
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,870
那我来问你
Well I'm asking you

296
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,360
全心全意地，你愿意嫁给我吗
With all my heart. Will you marry me?

297
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
那当然
Then yes.

298
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,070
是的，我愿意
Yes I will.

299
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,690
何时
When?

300
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,780
待到你首次出征时
Soon as you get your first leave.

301
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,690
但我此刻仍不喜欢你
But I still don't like you at this moment.

302
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,450
对啊
Yeah.

303
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
好吧
Okay.

304
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,810
我爱你
I love you.

305
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,930
嘘…
Shhhh.

306
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,450
妈妈说在这儿能见到你
Mama say come see you here.

307
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,490
这三位是我最好的朋友
These three were my bestfriends.

308
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,600
我们一起长大
I grew up with them.

309
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,170
一起惹麻烦，一起追女生
Got into trouble with them. Chase girls with them.

310
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,400
我们一起参军
I enlisted with them.

311
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,530
然后吾友们长眠于此
Then my friends are there.

312
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,440
泥草覆身，虫蛆啃噬
Covered in dirt and grass eaten by worms.

313
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,540
我不想探望我崽于此
I don't want to have to visit my sons here.

314
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,090
爸爸我已签约
Daddy I signed up already.

315
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,070
我别无选择除了入伍
I couldn't do otherwise pop.

316
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,650
- 人人都这样  - 你并非人人
- Everybody else is doing it.  - You ain't everybody else.

317
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,300
人人忙做事
Everybody else jumps in does thing quick

318
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,730
不加思索有如我们这种该死的蠢货
without thinking like damn idiot fools we were.

319
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,040
你可知活着的士兵所以活着，只因他们能思考，你不能
You know that soldiers who live they live cause they can do that. You can't!

320
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,100
你得坐下思考，凡事祷告
You got to sit and think and pray about everything.

321
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,230
看看你，你现在就想想
Look at you. You're doing it right now.

322
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,880
你无法靠自己活着，如果你去
You won't be able to live with yourself if you go.

323
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,980
不，我无法靠自己活着，假如我不去
No, I won't be able to live with myself if I don't.

324
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,190
我要当个军医
I'm going to be a medic.

325
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,910
那将是我服役的方式
That's going to be my way to serve.

326
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,990
那你就去把它想清楚
There you go thinking it all out.

327
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,950
你以为这场战争会让你称心如意
What you figure this war is going to fit in with you?

328
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,070
如你所愿
Your ideas?

329
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,800
我只晓得我不怀疑这会很难
What I know I don't doubt it's going to be hard.

330
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,610
不是难，是不可能
It won't be hard. It will be impossible.

331
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,840
无论如何
You know whatever.

332
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,360
如今你那疯狂脑子里的信仰
beliefs you had in your crazy head now.

333
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,200
它们永不发生，不起作用
They don't ever play out it don't work that way.

334
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,070
如有某些我所不知的奇遇
And if by certain I don't know miracle chance

335
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,780
你活下来
you survive

336
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,140
你不会把感谢给上帝
you won't be giving no thanks to God.

337
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,170
休息下，休息下，我们都需要一些空气
Break. Break. We all need some air.

338
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,210
来吧伙计们，迈迈腿，我理解你得跟老妈说再见
C'mon fellas shake a leg. I'd understand you got to say goodbye to mama.

339
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,550
来吧
C'mon.

340
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,420
女士们，拜托！远离公共汽车
Ladies please! Step away from the bus.

341
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,390
我差点忘了
I almost forgot.

342
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,390
我非得找根撬棍吗？
Do I need a crowbar?

343
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,430
拿着
Here.

344
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,530
我要你带上这个
I want you to have this.

345
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,890
它是我的
It's mine.

346
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,430
你把它放在这儿
You keep it right here.

347
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
我就在那儿
Where I'll be.

348
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
我爱你
I love you.

349
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,590
回到我身边，德斯蒙德·多斯，我爱你
Come Back To Me, Desmond Doss I Love You.

350
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:39,460
杰克逊堡
FORT JACKSON

351
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,020
我非得盯着你的畸形吗？每次我走到床上
Do I have to gaze at your deformity everytime I walk to my bed.

352
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,140
眼红吧，我的朋友
Gaze upon it in envy my friend.

353
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,750
你还好吗
You okay there?

354
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,290
你好象迷了路
You look lost.

355
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,930
要不你就坐这儿
Or you can sit right here.

356
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
不错的选择
Nice choice.

357
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,270
那儿能从高山看到大湖
It got views to the mountain down to lake.

358
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,490
兰德尔·富勒
Randall Fuller.

359
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
德斯蒙德·多斯
Desmond Doss.

360
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,380
叫他“教授”
Call him 'Teach'.

361
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,240
你听不懂他说的每个字
You won't understand a word he says.

362
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,330
因为这儿没人懂
That because no one else here can read.

363
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,630
那对睾丸的主人自称“好莱坞”
But testicles there belong to a man calling himself 'Hollywood'.

364
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,690
它们看起来更像是属于小家伙
They look like they belong to a smaller guy.

365
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,990
你懂睾丸
You know testicles.

366
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,370
哦嘿
Oh hey.

368
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,260
嘿呀

370
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,070
- 维吉尼亚  - 威尔·比利哈
- Virginia.  - Will Billy huh?

371
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,980
你娶了你第一个表妹
You marry your first cousin?

372
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,350
哈哈开个玩笑
Haha just joking.

373
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,180
哇
Woah!

374
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,960
那边的史密提跟科恩斯基臭味相投
That Smitty over there with Kirzinski's ass.

375
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,580
好象你更牛？杂烩脑
Like you were doing any better, chowder head.

376
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,260
嘿，我可不想使你丢脸
Hey, I didn't want to embarassed you.

377
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,090

Wal Kirzinski. Nice to meet you.

378
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,430
嘿！乒乓

379
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,740
你说你名字是啥？
What you say your name was?

380
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,670
德斯蒙德·多斯
Desmond Doss.

381
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,810
边上那位是德克萨斯·刘易斯
That Texas Lewis over there.

382
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,180
当他是某类牛仔
Thinks he some kind of cowboy.

383
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
还有维托·雷诺利
And Vito Rinnelli.

384
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,670
他也许个小，但他可是斗牛犬
Now he maybe small but he is a bulldog.

385
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,960
- 嗨，你好吗？ - 德斯蒙德
- Hi how you doing?  - Desmond.

386
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,960
这位帅哥是幸运的福特
This handsome guy right here is Lucky Ford.

387
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,430
嘿！
Hey.

388
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,740
那边是沃克和平尼克，他们自诩为洗牌手
That's Walker and Pinnick over there. Pretending they're card shufflers.

389
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,970
安静，格雷斯，好吗
Pipe down Grease alright.

390
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,380
除非你想被钱塞住嘴
Unless you want to put money where your mouth is.

391
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,600
噢嘿
Oh hey.

392
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,030
好书，对吧
Good Book right?

393
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,370
- 对的  - 我觉得是
- Right.  - I think ahh

394
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,130
我觉得“幸运”也有本好书，是吗？“幸运”
I think Lucky's got a good book, right Lucky?

395
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:31,900
这书好看
It's a good read.

396
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,590
立正！
Attention!

397
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,730
啊！
Ow!

398
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,200
列队，行动
Line up. Move it.

399
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,130
一起来，行动，行动
Let's go. Move it. Move it.

400
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,730
你看起来很怪，你不介意我这样说吧？列兵
You're a strange looking individual if you don't mind me saying so Private?

401
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,540

403
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,520
你死多久了？孩子

404
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,810
长官
Sir?

405
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
我不是长官
I am not "Sir".

406
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,610
我是豪厄尔中士或军士
I am Sergeant Howell or Sarge.

407
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,920
“长官”是叫没用的人
"Sir " you say for useless people.

408
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,570
你的名字是“食尸鬼”你知
The name is Ghoul you see.

409
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,440
沃克

410
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,520
中士

是

是的，中士
Yes, Sergeant.

413
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,790
你的表演有失常态，列兵
There's something off with your presentation Private.

414
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,690
很难说
Can't place it.

415
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,890
是你的头发
Is it your hair?

416
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,270
还是你裤子上的皱纹
Is it the wrinkle in your trousers?

417
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,170
我脚上插着刀，中士
I have a knife in my foot Sergeant.

418
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,190
噢，是的，当然，是这把刀
Oh yes. Of course. That's it the knife.

419
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,150
你叫什么名字？士兵

史密提·瑞克

421
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,430
不，你的名字是“列兵白痴”
No. Your name is Private Idiot.

422
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,580
你可知为何
You know why?

423
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,620
因为我脚上插着刀
Cause I have a knife in my foot.

424
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,670
谁会把刀插在哪儿？列兵
Who place the knife there Private?

425
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,480
这是个意外，中士，我在练拉伸
It was an accident Sergeant. I was playing stretch.

426
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,830
据我所知你不是有意插在那儿

567
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,790
他是个“CO”，长官
He's a CO sir.

568
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,440
你是个“拒服兵役者”
You're a "Conscientious Objector".

569
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,520
- 而你参了军  - 不，先生
- And you joined the army.  - Well no sir.

570
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,820
我是个“良心合作者”
I'm a Conscientious Cooperator.

571
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,830
- 你在愚弄我？多斯  - 不，不，先生，我自愿
- You just screwing with me Doss.  - No. No sir. I volunteered.

572
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,530
我穿制服没问题，向国旗行礼，尽我的义务
I got no problem with wearing my uniform. Saluting the flag and doing my duty.

573
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,440
只是不可以拿枪杀人
It's just carrying a gun and taking a human life.

574
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,760
你不杀人？就这些
You don't kill. That's all.

575
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,100
是的，先生，就这些
Yes sir. That's all.

576
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,420
你知战争中杀戮确实很多
You know quite a bit of killing does occur in a war.

577
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,160
是，长官
Yes, sir.

578
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,640
我是说，战争的本质
I mean that is the essential nature of war.

579
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,700
是，长官
Yes sir.

580
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,820
好吧
Alright.

581
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,860
你对美军还有任何其它要求吗
You have any other requirements for the United States army.

582
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,080
还有什么我们可以做，以确保
Is there anything else that we can do to ensure that

583
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,840
你会满意地跟我们一起呆这儿
you're comfortable with your stay here with us?

584
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,500
他不想在周六工作，长官
He doesn't wanna work on Saturday, sir.

585
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:11,840
嗯周六是…我是“基督复临安息日”者，因此
Well Saturday is... I'm a Seventh-Day Adventist so.

586
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,130
周六是我的安息日，那就不允许我工作
Saturday is my sabbath so I'm not allowed to work then.

587
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,540
我不认为这会带来问题，你呢？中士
I don't think that poses a problem. Do you sergeant?

588
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,380
我们应要求敌人别在安息日进攻
We should simply ask the enemy not to invade on a Sabbath

589
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,020
因为列兵多斯在此祈祷
cause Private Doss here is a prayer.

590
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,700
好吧，现在我们搞清楚了
Alright. Now we got that clear.

591
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,240
现在让我告诉你我的要求，它们不像
Now let me tell you my requirements. They're not as

592
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,460
你的那么复杂，它们极简单
complicated as yours. They are very simple.

593
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,240
只要你一直呆在这个连队里
As long as you're in this company

594
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,480
由我指挥
under my command

595
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,680
你就得服从我的命令，句号
You're gonna obey my orders Period.

596
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,880
你若在此做不到，我不信你在战斗能做到
If you can't do it here. I can't trust you to do it in the battle.

597
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,950
[美军二战条例第八条，判断军人精神方面是否适合服役]
我会把你视为符合“第八条例”
I'm putting you in for "Section 8".

598
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,720
[美军二战条例第八条，判断军人精神方面是否适合服役]
我会让你免役
So I get your discharge.

599
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,050
解散
Dismiss.

600
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,670
先生们
Gentlemen.

601
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,590
我想让你们见见列兵德斯蒙德·多斯
I want you to meet Private Desmond Doss.

602
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,820
显然地
Apparently.

603
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,600
列兵多斯不相信暴力
Private Doss does not believe in violence.

604
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,520
他不愿实施暴力
He does not practice violence.

605
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,890
他甚至不屑摸枪
He will not even deign to touch a weapon.

606
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,650
要知道列兵多斯
You see Private Doss

607
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,260
是一个“拒服兵役者”
is a Conscientious Objector.

608
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,350
所以我恳请你们
So I plead with you.

609
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,620
别指望他在战场上拯救你
Do not look to him to save you on a battlefield.

610
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,960
因为他无疑会
Because he will undoubtedly

611
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,470
太忙于跟他的良心搏斗
 be too busy wrestling with his conscience

612
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,360
去协助
to assist.

613
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,070
- 中士，那不是真的，中士  - 列兵
- Sarge, that's not true, sarge.  - Private

614
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,150
原地不动！
as you were.

615
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,260
我意识到你们中有些人对此有着强烈感受
I realize some of you might have strong feelings about this.

616
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,160
那就是男人为何而战
It is what we men fight for.

617
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,540
为了捍卫权利
To defend our rights.

618
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,820
为了保护妇女和儿童
To protect our women and children.

619
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,860
即使列兵多斯的信念
Even if Private Doss's belief

620
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,430
可能会导致妇女和儿童死亡
might cause women and children to die.

621
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,400
所以我希望本连队的每个人
So I will expect every one in this company

622
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:57,250
给予列兵多斯，充分尊重他应有的尊重
to give Private Doss the full measure of respect he is due.

623
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,110
因为短时间内，他将与我们同在
For the short time he will be with us.

624
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,310
清楚了吗
Am I clear?

625
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,170
是的，中士
Yes, sergeant.

626
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,990
你拿的是啥，戴茜
What you got here Daisy?

627
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,100
- 你知道那是什么吗？ - 像是袖珍版
- You know what that is?  - Just seems kind of small.

628
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,050
这是半大男的半大圣经
It's half-the-Bible for half-the-man.

629
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,390
[彼得：耶稣十二使徒之首]
看彼得份上，史密提，把圣经还给他
Pete's sake, Smitty give him back his Bible.

630
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,260
[彼得：耶稣十二使徒之首]
我不记得是在跟你说
I don't remember speaking with you.

631
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,030
你为何不打架
So how come you don't fight?

632
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,250
你自以为优于我们
Do you think you better than us?

633
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,050
不
 No.

634
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,120
那么，如果你被攻击，怎么办
Well, what if you're attacked.

635
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,480
哇
Woah.

636
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,010
喜欢吗
Did you like that?

637
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:48,000
圣经说，你要转过另一边脸
Bible says to turn your other cheekbone.

638
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,770
看见没？跟信仰无关，伙计们
You see I don't think this is a question of religion, fellas.

639
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,680
我认为是懦弱
I think this is cowardice.

640
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,590
显而易见
Plain and simple.

641
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,010
你没事吧？多斯
You alright Doss?

642
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,840
你娘炮？是吗
You chicken shit, that it?

643
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,850
继续
Go on.

644
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,750
打过来
Take a poke.

645
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,340
那好，我不还手
Okay I'm gonna give a free shot.

646
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:10,950
就是那儿
Right there.

647
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,380
打我多斯
Hit me Doss.

648
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,700
继续
Go on.

649
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,860
啥毛病
What a matter?

650
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,680
上啊
Go ahead.

651
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:17,990
不打
No?

652
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,650
娘炮
Chicken shit!

653
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,920
- 这是什么？ - 把它给我
- What is this?  - Give me that.

654
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,410
这娘们好看
This is fine looking broad.

655
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
- 哇  - 漂亮
- Wooooh.  - Nice.

656
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,460
如今这种娘们
Now this would be the kind of broad

657
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,110
真正的男人才配得上
That deserve a real man.

658
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,660
把它还给我
Give me that back.

659
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,610
请
Please.

660
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,310
请
Please.

661
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,980
请把它归还，史密提
Please give it back, Smitty.

662

请把它归还，史密提
Please give it back, Smitty.

663
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,180
你听得到声音？德斯蒙德
Do you hear voices Desmond?

664
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
不，长官
No, Sir.

665
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,690
我理解为上帝在跟你说话？是那样吗
I understand that God talks to you. Is that right?

666
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,760
长官，我没疯
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.

667
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,480
那你觉得大多数人怎么看你
Then how you feel most people regard you

668
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,330
疯子
Crazy person.

669
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,690
我不同别人我知道，只是
I'm different I know that. But

670
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,540
我不愿弄虚作假
I'm not gonna pretend to be something I'm not.

671
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,570
我就是我
I am what I am.

672
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,060
听起来很孤独
Sounds lonely.

673
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,300
你孤独吗
You lonely?

674
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,020
那么你听不到声音
So you don't hear voices.

675
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
不，长官
No, sir.

676
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
我向上帝祷告，我还
I pray to God and I

677
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,860
觉得他能听见，只是那并非交谈
like to think He hears me but it ain't a conversation.

678
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,970
就像此刻我绝不会假装我们得谈谈
Like how I won't gonna pretend we have right now.

679
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,390
假装？列兵
Pretending, Private?

680
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,120
是，长官，我知道你的打算干嘛
Yes, sir. I know what you really wanna do is

681
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,990
说我是“第八条例者”，把我撵出部队，只是
is give me “a Section 8” draw me out of the army. But

682
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,310
我不是
I'm not.

683
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,630
神明在上
Up above.

684
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,910
我只是信我所信
I just simply believe what I believe.

685
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,140
好吧我尽量去理解
Well I'm trying to understand.

686
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:05,280
好吗？是上帝叫你别拿枪
Alright? Was it God who told you not to pick up a rifle?

687
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,580
上帝说勿杀人
God says not to kill.

688
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,910
那是他的最重要的戒律之一
That one of His most important commandments.

689
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:13,490
大多数人把此理解为别谋杀
Most people take that to only don't commit murder.

690
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,120
战争是完全不同的情况
War is completely different set of circumstances.

691
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:20,670
耶稣说，我把一个新的命令给你们
Jesus said a new commandment I give them to you.

692
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,730
即你爱别人
That you love one another.

693
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,060
有如我爱你
Just as I love you.

694
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,900
我们正在跟撒旦作战，肯定是
This is satan himself we're fighting. Sure as

695
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,790
虔诚的基督徒，你看得出来
good Christian you can see that.

696
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,460
我看得出，长官，这也是我参军的原因
I can see that sir and that is why I joined up.

697
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,820
但是很抱歉，我不能带武器
But I'm sorry I will not bear arms.

698
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,260
他的宗教观确实独一无二，但这些
His religious view is certainly unique but they

699
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,370
不违反第八条例的免役范畴
do not constitute ground for Section 8 discharge.

700
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,850
我该如何让这样的人听命于我
How am I suppose to maintain discipline with a man like that in my unit?

701
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,980
我不知道
I don't know.

702
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,690
但他是一个合法的“拒服兵役者”
But he is a legitimate Conscientious Objector.

703
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:55,420
他必须被允许作为“军医”提供
He must be allowed to work as Combat Medic provided

704
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,090
他有资格在所有其它区域进行训练
he qualifies in all other areas in his training.

705
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,180
也许我们可帮助缓和他的想法
Perhaps we could help make alleviant his idea.

706
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,190
[K.P：清洗打扫整理等繁、重、脏的工作]
好，你把他关在兵营去K.P
Yeah you restrict him to barracks in K.P

707
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,900
[K.P：清洗打扫整理等繁、重、脏的工作]
他扔上帝给你，你扔地狱砸他
He throws God at you. You throw hell right at him.

708
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,020
我要他消失
I want him gone.

709
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:16,000
禁止洗衣，浴室禁止穿鞋
Scrubbing Clothes NOT ALLOWED, NO SHOES ALLOWED in shower room

710
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,900
多斯，你是个耻辱
Doss your area is in disgrace.

711
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,700
这是个猪圈
It's a pig stock.

712
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,570
- 有何可笑，瑞克？ - 不，中士
- Something funny Riker?  - No sarge.

713
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,420
- 你脑子进大粪了？ - 不，中士
- You got some shit on your mind?  - No sarge.

714
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,760
你们没意识到的
What you men fail to recognize

715
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,410
就是一只队伍并不会比它的最弱者更强
is a unit is no better than its weakest member.

716
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,330
我希望你们记住这教训
I hope you learned that lesson.

717
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,800
本周末不准休息
There will be no passes this weekend.

718
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,720
全部去K.P

00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:55,080
现在全体全速徒步二十英里
Right now everybody on full gear for 20-mile hike.

720
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,350

721
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,660
一起去
Let's go.

722
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,060
保持头脑清醒
Get your heads right.

723
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,970
不要自怜
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.

724
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,960
你们的自怜样叫我恶心
Makes me sick seeing you feel sorry for yourself.

725
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,360
你们这些狗不知累为何物
You dogs don't know what tired is.

726
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,610
我们会继续跑直到我倒下
We gonna keep going till I drop.

727
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,540
来吧，伙计们
Come on guys.

728
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,250
嘿住手！别打了
Hey knock it. Knock it off.

729
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,840
去睡觉
Trying to sleep here.

730
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,100
放开我，放开
Get off me. Get off.

731
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,970
为什么你还在这里
Why the hell you still here?

732
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,280
- 注意！ - 原地别动
- Heed hut.  - As you were.

733
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,230
多斯在哪儿
Where's Doss?

734
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,120
这对你不好，伙计
This isn't good for you buddy.

735
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,610
当然，我参军不是想这样
Sure ain't what I joined up for.

736
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,670
这跟你为何参军无关
It's not about what you joined up for.

737
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,950
有关在此诸位的生活
About the lives of every men in here.

738
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,730
及你的，孩子
And yours son.

739
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:42,480
是时候退出了
It's time you quit this.

740
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,130
穿好衣服，我送你
Finish getting dress and I'll walk you down.

741
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,400
好了，多斯
It's okay Doss.

742
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,650
别为此羞愧
There's no shame in this.

743
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,960
我们走吧
Let's go.

744
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:21,150
我有额外的执勤，今天，上午我得去K.P，所以
I got an extra guard duty. Today and I'm on KP this morning. So

745
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,080
我不能
I can't.

746
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,390
好吧，多斯
Alright Doss.

747
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,170
列兵多斯
Private Doss.

748
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,770
你能认出打你的人吗
Can you identify the men that beat you?

749
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,190
不，中士
No sarge.

750
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,910
你是说你不知道是谁打了你
Are you saying that you don't know who attack you?

751
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:53,550
我从未说过我被打了，中士
I never said I was attacked sarge.

752
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,020
你究竟在说啥？多斯
What the hell are you saying Doss?

753
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,890
你伤得难以入睡
You bruised half your body sleeping.

754
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,710
我睡得很沉
I sleep pretty hard.

755
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:13,330
本周计划湿训，确保你戴上帽子
Planning on getting wet this week make sure you put on a hat.

756
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,370
我不希望任何人回来尿在奶油里
I don't want anyone back piss in cream.

757
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,050
你不是想要咖啡吗？中士
What you don't want to offer your coffee Sarge.

758
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,460
给你颗枪子儿如何？史密提
How about a shot right now Smitty?

759
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,770
讲讲经验，中士
Speaking from experience Sarge.

760
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,990
你得问你娘，老油条
You have to ask your mom about that Greaseball.

761
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,730
稍息
At ease.

762
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,530
列兵多斯
Private Doss.

763
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,460
恐怕我不能准你的假
I'm afraid I can't authorize your pass.

764
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,500
假期只给通过基本训练的人
This is a furlough for men who had pass the basic training.

765
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,110
尊敬的长官，我过了
Respectfully sir I have.

766
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,940
我申请了此假，三周前
I put in for this furlough three weeks ago.

767
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,320
我要结婚，今天下午
I'm getting married this afternoon.

768
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,990
你步枪不合格
It says you're not rifle-qualified.

769
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,530
我不需要携带步枪，长官
Well I'm not required to carry a rifle, sir.

770
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,770
上校施特尔策，他，他…
Colonel Colonel Stelzer he he...

771
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,310
上校施特尔策规定：
Colonel Stelzer stipulation was

772
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,400
特许多斯作为军医服役
Doss must be allowed to work as a combat medic.

773
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,940
准予他有资格在任何其它区域完成训练
Provided he qualifies in all other areas of his training.

774
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,050
而你在枪械上无资格，列兵
And you have not qualified on the rifle range, Private.

775
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,050
很清楚
Pretty clear.

776
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,820
给我演示下你会拿枪
Show me you know how to handle a rifle.

777
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,260
我就准假
And I'll sign your furlough.

778
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:27,490
下士坎农
Corporal Cannon.

779
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,170
给列兵多斯你的枪
Hand Private Doss your firearm.

780
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,050
我不会碰步枪，长官
I won't touch a rifle, sir.

781
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,260
我不是要求你，列兵
I'm not asking you Private.

782
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,000
这是个部队指挥官的直接命令
That is a direct order from a company commander.

783
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,770
看上帝份上，多斯
For God's sake Doss.

784
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:53,320
别再废话，退出
You stop this nonsense and quit.

785
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:55,180
拒绝
Refuse.

786
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,960
我则没有追索权，只能送你去军事法庭
And I will have no recourse but to court-martial you.

787
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,690
你将在军事监狱度过战争期
And you will spend the duration of the war in military prison.

788
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,640
我不能，长官
I can't, sir.

789
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,920
你愿意等多久，多萝西
How much longer would you like to wait, Dorothy?

790
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
我想得足够久
I think it's been long enough.

791
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:27,960
这真是太遗憾了
I'm so very sorry.

792
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,040
有时男人会临阵退缩
Sometimes men just get cold feet.

793
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:34,740
有的男人会
Some men might.

794
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,250
但我的德斯蒙德不会
Not my Desmond.

795
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,480
你可能觉得我真是婊子养的
You probably thinking I'm a really son of a bitch.

796
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,880
只在乎规定不关心自己人
Who cares only about regulations and not his men.

797
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,420
可以吗
May I?

798
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,020
我跟任何人一样信任此书
I believe in this Book as much as any men.

799
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,420
跟任何人一样
Just like any men.

800
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:32,920
我会被良心困扰
I wrestled with my conscience.

801
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,270
但你会怎做，当世上你珍视的一切皆受攻击
But what do you do when everything you value in this world is under attacked.

802
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,960
我不知道，长官
I don't know, sir.

803
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:43,420
我没法回答那种大问题
I ain't got answer to question that big.

804
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:47,470
但我感同我珍视的正受攻击
But I also feel like my values are under attacked.

805
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,110
我不知何故
I don't know why.

806
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,880
我不关心你的原则，因为日本人不
I don't give a rat-ass about your principles because the Japs don't.

807
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,970
如果他们有人攻击你和受伤的士兵，你怎么办
If one of them attacks you and some wounded soldiers. What are you gonna do?

808
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,370
用你的圣经揍他
Hit him with your Bible?

809
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,130
我已准备好为大家牺牲
I'm prepare to give my life for my men.

810
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,980
你无法赢得战争即使你牺牲
You don't win wars by giving up your life.

811
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:06,890
看吧
Look.

812
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,280
我只身到此，因我不愿看到你烂在牢房
I'm only here because I don't wanna see you rotting in a prison cell.

813
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
认罪
Plead guilty.

814
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,390
为自己争取法庭怜悯，也许他们会让你回家祈祷
Put yourself at the mercy of the court. Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.

815
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,890
让勇士们去赢得战争
Let the brave men out there go and win this war.

816
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,420
如果我不能说服你，也许她可以
If I can't convince you, maybe she can.

817
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,420
他们不准我打电话你
They wouldn't let me call you.

818
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,320
我知道不是你不打
I know it wasn't your making.

819
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,430
他们对你做了些啥
What did they done to you?

820
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,380
没关系我很好
It's okay I'm alright.

821
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,680
只是打了几下墙还有些失落
Just a couple of rounds with a wall and lost.

822
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,750
他们说你会入狱，德斯蒙德
They're saying you could go to prison Desmond.

823
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,250
甚至更糟
Leaven worth.

824
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,840
一定有别的办法
There must be some other way.

825
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,030
我不知将会怎样
I don't know what that could be.

826
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,420
我做了他们要求的每件事，除了这件事
I done everything they'd asked me except this one thing.

827
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:07,140
他们一直待我如罪犯，只因我不愿杀敌
They've been treating me like a criminal just cause I won't kill.

828
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,160
你尽了力
You tried.

829
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,480
没人否认
Nobody can say you didn't.

830
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,550
但你在狱中能救谁
But who you gonna save in prison?

831
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,710
可能没人
Probably nobody.

832
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,350
那你为何不拿起笨枪，四处挥挥
Then why can't you just pick up the stupid gun and wave it around.

833
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,920
你不必用枪，只需带枪
You don't have to use it. Just made it half-way.

834
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,110
我不能那样做
I can't do that.

835
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,670
是的，你能，这只是骄傲
Yes, you can. It's just pride.

836
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:27,490
骄傲跟倔强
Pride and stubborness.

837
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,390
别把你的意志跟上帝的混同
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.

838
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,210
我一直很骄傲
I've been proudful.

839
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,690
也许我真的很骄傲
Maybe I'm proudful.

840
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:57,370
但我不知，我怎能独自活着，若不忠于我之所信
But I don't know how I'm gonna live with myself if I don't stay true to what I believe.

841
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,700
看着我们你怎能跟我一起活下去
Watching us how you could live with me.

842
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,050
我想做个男人，如你所见
I wanna be a man and I wanna be in your eyes.

843
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,010
我爱上你
I fell in love with you.

844
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,300
因你不象其他人
Because you weren't like anyone else.

845
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,520
你也不会想那样
And you didn't try to be.

846
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,540
任何时刻都别认为你会让我失望
Do not think for one moment that you'll disappoint me.

847
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:31,740
我将爱你
I will love you.

848
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,070
无论怎样
No matter what.

849
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:48,520
我不知他要做啥
I don't know what he's gonna do.

850
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,420
他输定了，无论如何
He loses no matter what.

851
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:54,640
他们想让他认罪，但这会让他开除军籍
They want him to plead guilty but then it'll get him dishonorable discharge.

852
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,980
否则他就是违抗他们，他必会入狱
Otherwise he fights them he will for sure go to prison.

853
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,270
无论怎样，他们会叫他懦夫，我看不出他怎能那样活着
Either way they'll call him a coward and I don't see how he can live with that.

854
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,510
谢谢你多萝西
Thank you Dorothy.

855
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,590
如果你能跟他谈谈
If you get to talk to him.

856
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:13,830
告诉他我们爱他，会为他祈祷，会为你们祈祷
Tell him that we love him and that we'll pray for him and we'll pray for both of you.

857
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:14,890
我会的
I will.

858
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,390
拜拜
Bye-bye.

859
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,950
我当然失去了理智
Of course I'm out of my mind.

860
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,210
你以为我是谁，我疯了
What do you think I am. I'm out of my mind.

861
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,050
请你离开这屋
Will you leave this room.

862
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,070
不要，汤姆，把它放下
Don't Tom. Put it down.

863
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,810
放开我，婆娘
Get away from me woman.

864
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,880
美利坚合众国之印
SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

865
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,110
有何贵干，先生
May I help you sir?

866
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,900
我想找准将穆斯格罗夫
I wish to speak to Brigadier General Musgrove.

867
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:19,650
没有预约可不行，那样绝无可能
Not without an appointment you can't. That would be quite impossible.

868
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,600
如能劳你告诉他：下士托马斯多斯将感激一个简短的面谈
If you would kinda tell him Corporal Thomas Doss would've appreciate a brief word.

869
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,610
他在开非常重要的会
He is in a very important meeting.

870
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,530
我跟他在法国贝洛伍德打过仗，他是我队长
I fought with him in France at Belleau Wood. He was my Captain.

871
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,610
求您女士，此事至关重要
Please maam. It's most vital.

872
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:03,660
仅需一分钟
Be over in a minute.

873
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,140
你将安全到家，就跟没事一样
You'll be home safe and sound like nothing ever happened.

874
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,470
这是列兵多斯的听证会
This is a hearing in the matter of Private Doss.

875
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:06,220
指控是他违反了其指挥官的一系列直接命令
The charge is disobeying a series of direct orders from his commanding officer.

876
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:07,830
被告怎么说
How says the defendant?

877
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:14,130
列兵多斯希望进行无罪答辩
Private Doss wishes to enter a not guilty plea.

878
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,610
是这样吗，列兵？我以为已同意过
Is that so Private? I thought this was agreed.

879
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,970
你想进行某种讨价还价的答辩？
You want to enter some sort of plea bargain.

880
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:23,460
- 是的，长官，但我改变了主意  - 就这样
- Yes, sir. But I changed my mind.  - Just like that?

881
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,860
你希望进行军事诉讼
You wish to proceed to a court martial.

882
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

883
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,590
那你如愿了列兵
Your on your head then Private.

884
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,730
开始
Proceed.

885
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,960
法官大人
Your honor.

886
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,640
列兵多斯
Private Doss.

887
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,310
挥舞其道德观，有如某种荣誉的徽章
Wave his morality like it's some kind of badge of honor.

888
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,920
他炫耀他的蔑视
He flaunts his contempt.

889
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,320
靠直接违反其指挥官的一系列直接命令
By directly disobeying a series of direct order from his commanding officer.

890
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:51,790
当这些最优秀的年轻人牺牲自己性命抵御邪恶时
When the very best of our young men are sacrificing their lives against evil.

891
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,200
- 你没事吧？ - 是的
- You okay?  - Yes.

892
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,060
- 他们还在审议？ - 是的，先生
- They still deliberating?  - Yes, sir.

893
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,290
好吧，你把这个拿进去
Okay you go take this in there.

894
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,420
我不能，必须是军人
I can't. It's strictly military personnel.

895
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,930
那你让他们中某个带进去
Well you get one of them to take it in.

896
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,260
他们不会帮忙，他们就等着埋了他
They ain't no help. They're fixing to burying him.

897
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,980
任何军事法院只需问被告一个问题：
There's only one question that any military court need ask of the accused.

898
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:16,370
你否认违反上校萨斯顿的直接命令
Do you deny disobeying Colonel Sangston's direct orders?

899
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,920
那么，你否认吗？列兵
Well. Do you private?

900
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,800
不，长官，我不否认
No, sir. I don't.

901
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,630
那你为何要质疑它呢
Why are you contesting it, then?

902
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,570
这对你为何如此重要，使你拒绝去
Why is it so important to you, given your refusal to even

903
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:35,350
触摸武器，即使是在部队中服役
touch a weapon to serve in a combat unit?

904
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:39,700
因为当日本偷袭珍珠港之时，我视为针对我个人
Because when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, I took it personal.

905
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,340
我认识的每个人都愤然参军，包括我
Everyone I knew was on fire to join up, including me.

906
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,830
有两个人在我们镇上
There were two men in my hometown

907
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,280
[4-F：二战服役有关的物理，心理，或道德标准]
被判4F不合格，他们就自杀了，因为不能服役
Declared 4-F unfit, they killed themselves cause they couldn't serve.

908
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,250
为何？我在国防工厂有份工作
Why, I had a job in a defense plant.

909
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:04,040
我可以续约，但那样不对
I could've taken a deferment, but that ain't right.

910
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:09,660
这样不对：别人就该去战斗去牺牲
It isn't right that other men should fight and die

911
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:13,820
而我只是安全的呆坐屋里，我需要服役，长官
that I would just be sitting at home safe. I need this, sir.

912
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,930
我有能力有激情作为军医服役
I got the energy and the passion to serve as a medic,

913
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,610
应当在其他伙伴当中，毫无危害，只是…
right in the middle with the other guys. No less danger, just...

914
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:30,130
当每个人都在取命，我是去救命
while everybody else is taking life, I'm going to be saving it.

915
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,570
既然这世界已把自己搞得四分五裂
With the world so set on tearing itself apart,

916
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,490
这对我不算是太糟糕的事
it doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me

917
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:39,230
去把那些碎片重聚一块儿
to wanna put a little bit of it back together.

918
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,100
抱歉先生，无人准进
Sorry sir, nobody is allowed.

919
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,660
不，你不知，我儿就是被告
No. You don't understand. My son is the defendant.

920
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,040
- 我理解，先生，但是无人准进  - 我有封信
- I understand sir but nobody is allowed  - I have information.

921
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,640
好吧，表达的情感值得称赞
Well, the sentiments expressed are laudable.

922
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,670
指控的事实无可争辩
The facts of the charge seem incontestable so

923
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,870
那边所为何事
What the hell is going on out there?

924
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,800
让他进来
Let him go.

925
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,820
那是一战制服
That's the Great War uniform.

926
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,390
是的，长官
It is, sir.

927
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,210
长官，我得请您过目此信
Sir, I need to show you this.

928
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,650
恕我直言，先生
With respect, sir.

929
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,990
您不再是军人
You are no longer a member of the military.

930
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,020
你不能参加此审议，我很遗憾
You unable to attend this meeting. I'm sorry.

931
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,620
这么说真是这样的了
Is that truly the way it works?

932
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,610
你为国而战
You fight for your country

933
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,960
你失去了无数挚爱，然后你就没用了
You lose so much ever dear to you. And then you're done with?

934
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,640
仅剩制服，无权发声
Uniform's forgotten. You have no voice?

935
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,340
你参战了
You were enlist?

936
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,420
是的，长官，在贝洛伍德
I was sir Belleau Wood.

937
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,250
两次授勋，我看到的，先生
Twice decorated. I see it sir.

938
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:44,140
我想你是被告之父
I take it you're the father.

939
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,830
我是，长官，托马斯·多斯
I am, sir. Thomas Doss.

940
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,970
那么作为前军人，你知这儿有法律
Then as former military man. You know there are laws here.

941
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,590
长官，我清楚法律，我是，我知我儿受这些法律保护
Sir, I know the law. I am. I know my son is protected by those laws.

942
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,370
它们受宪法约束
They are framed in our constitution.

943
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,510
我相信它们，像他那样
And I believe in them as he does.

944
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:00,340
那就是为何我曾为捍卫它们而战
That's why I went and fought to protect them.

945
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,740
这就是我所思所为，因为如果不是为此
It's what I thought I was doing because if it wasn't for that

946
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,770
我就不知我到底去那里干了啥，长官
then I have no idea what the hell I was doing there, sir.

947
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,280
谢谢你，下士多斯
Thank you Corporal Doss.

948
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:15,480
让我看看这信
Let me have the letter.

949
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,250
你得离开
You must go.

950
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:44,030
被告作为一个“拒服兵役者”的权利，受国会一项法案的保护
The defendant's rights as a Conscientious Objector are protected by an Act of Congress.

951
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,880
他不能被迫放弃这些权利
And he cannot be compelled to waive those rights.

952
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:52,880
权利包括本案述及之违抗携带武器命令
That includes in this case his disobeying orders to bear arm.

953
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:57,200
签署，准将穆斯格罗夫，战争服务指挥官，华盛顿特区
Signed Brigadier General Musgrove. War Services Commander, Washington DC.

954
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,710
上校
Colonel.

955
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,280
我撤销控诉
I withdraw the charges.

956
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:07,230
那么本案驳回
Then this case is dismissed.

957
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,760
列兵多斯，你可自由的投入战斗的地狱烈火
Private Doss you are free to run into the hell fire of battle

958
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,890
无需任何武器保护自己
without a single weapon to protect yourself.

959
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,920
你可恢复原职责
You may resume your duties.

960
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:19,010
作为军医开始训练
Begin training as a combat medic.

961
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,740
- 他去哪儿了？ - 走了
- Where is he?  - Gone.

962
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:30,170
出来就走，我请求他留下，说他同样想留下
Straight after. I begged him to stay. I told him he want the same.

963
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,870
你回家后告诉他：我爱他
When you get home you tell him that I love him.

964
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,890
好的
Okay.

965
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:17,570
你要好好的回到我身边
You better come home to me.

966
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:28,110
冲绳岛，三月 1945
OKINAWA, MAY 1945

967

- He'll be dead before we get 'em down.  - You don't know that.

1097
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,400
送他下去

I'll sent them a weapon's team to flank them.

你没伤着头没事的

1164
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:58,590

很称职汉子们

01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,440
就此过夜，我们守住本地
Take it for the night. We hold this spot.

1168
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,540
我们明天消灭剩下的山脊

1169
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,800
好了男孩们

1170
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:15,260
给自己找个舒适安全窝儿
Find yourself a nice safe hole.

1171
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:16,460
角落或靠近掩体

1172
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:18,270
我们每两小时换次岗

1173
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:19,710
我们不知那边是些啥
We don't know what's out there.

1174
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:21,630
死忠，愚蠢

1175
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,400
不说英语的全毙了

1176
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:24,450
包括“老油条”？中士
That includes Grease Sarge?

1177
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:25,800
尤其是他
Particularly him.

1178
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,440
我不关心他是否需要尿尿或大号
I don't care if he needed to take a piss or a dump.

1179
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:30,380
单独去那边可不安全
It ain't safe to go out there alone.

1180
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:33,960
你到底要去哪儿？多斯
Where the hell you going Doss?

1181
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,090
那边还有很多伤员，中士
Still more wounded out there Sarge.

1182
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:38,790
我和他一起去
I'll go with him.

1183
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,370
聪明点，耳朵放低些
Be smart keep your ears down.

1184
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:45,100
好了，大家找个地儿

01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:55,290
亨利在首轮十五分钟就挂了

1186
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:56,530
直接挂掉

1187
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,030
是直接挂掉
It's straight off.

1188
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,540
彼得森
Peterson.

1189
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:02,570
大力水手
Popeye.

1190
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:04,960
斯坦福和墨菲
Stanford and Murphy.

1191
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,880
和平年代子葬父

1192
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:17,750
战争时期父葬子

1193
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:22,670
别说丧气话好吗
Wanna stop spouting that crap out?

1194
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,700
这帮不了任何人
It don't help none.

1195
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,160
是啊
Yeah.

1196
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:30,200
是的，你说得对
Yeah, you got that right.

1197
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:31,890
在此无用
Not here.

1198
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:35,180
嘿
Hey.

1199
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:37,190
给我那个
Give me that.

1200
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:44,940
嘿
Hey!

1201
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:45,340
嘿
Hey!

1202
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:47,630
我们找到个腹部伤员
We got an abdominal wound.

1203
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,330
- 小伙子需要血浆  - 明白了，他和我们一起
- This lad is gonna need some plasma.  - You got it. He'll be with us.

1204
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:53,110
我们救了你
We got you.

1205
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:03,560
我们找个窝呆呆
Should we find a hole and dig in?

1206
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:05,670
我觉得行
Sounds good to me.

1207
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:07,950
戴上头盔
Put your helmet on.

1208
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:19,530
你要吃那些
You gonna eat them?

1209
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:23,450
我不吃肉
I don't eat meat.

1210
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:24,700
自取
Help yourself.

1211
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:27,680
当然了，你不吃
Of course you don't.

1212
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,650
她是个不错的女子
That's one heck of a dame.

1213
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:43,030
你知道你有她让我们很受打击，是吗？
You know you find that you whack us with her don't you?

1214
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:51,910
是的，我知道
Yes, I do.

1215
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,260
别告诉她这些
Don't tell her that.

1216
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:57,910
她不会太喜欢我这样的男人
She won't be much happy with a man like me anyway.

1217
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:59,690
是啊，直到她了解你
Yeah until she got to know you.

1218
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:03,350
我是个混蛋，有时
I'm an asshole sometimes.

1219
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:05,240
有时
Sometimes?

1220
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,270
你是对的
You're alright.

1221
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:38,320
这些日本人很卑鄙
These Japs are sneaky.

1222
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:42,840
我值头班，现在你眯会儿
I take first watch. Now you get some shut eye.

1223
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,710
地狱之梦
Hell of a dream?

1224
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:49,610
我梦见自己被杀
I dreamed I got myself killed.

1225
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:52,100
我毫无办法
I can't do nothing.

1226
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:54,750
只需步枪
Rifles just do.

1227
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:01,010
它不会咬人
It won't bite.

1228
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,640
对，那么
Yeah, well.

1229
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:07,040
看看你周围
Look around you.

1230
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,950
经历了我们这些遭遇
After what we've been through.

1231
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,870
任何理智的人都会尖叫着找寻武器
Any sane man would be screaming for a weapon.

1232
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,780
我从未声称自己理智
I never claimed to be sane.

1233
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:21,520
我爸是酒鬼
My daddy's a drunk.

1234
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:28,010
他屡戒屡犯多年，酒瘾缠身，酒后失态
He fought it for years but it kinda got a hold of him hard and made him mean.

1235
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:30,440
至少你知道何时我曾与十人中的任何一位同在
At least you know when mine could've been with any one of the ten guys

1236
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:32,380
而他们没有一个人该死
And none of them would worth a damn.

1237
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:36,160
所以你妈妈养大了你
So your momma raise you?

1238
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:37,030
我记得她
I knew her.

1239
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:39,350
但她把我丢给孤儿院，在我五岁时
But she gave me to an orphanage when I was five.

1240
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:40,910
再没见过她
Never saw her again.

1241
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,590
我知如何快速行动
I know how to act quick.

1242
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,310
但现在我识人更快，我则确实看错了你
But now I judge people quicker and I got you very wrong.

1243
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:00,950
我爸只是经常打我跟我哥
My dad used to beat me and my brother just

1244
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:04,420
因为日升又因为日落而打我们
cause the sun rose and whip us cause it sets.

1245
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:08,050
我能忍受那样
I could take that.

1246
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:12,950
但当他打妈妈时
But when he would do it to our momma.

1247
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:24,060
够了！不再
That's enough. No more.

1248
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:25,820
听清楚没
Do you hear me?

1249
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,490
扣下那该死的扳机
Pull that damn trigger.

1250
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,880
不要，德斯蒙德，住手
Don't Desmond. Stop!

1251
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:38,480
但你并没杀他
But you didn't kill him.

1252
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:42,510
在心里，我杀了
In my heart I did.

1253
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:09,200

Can you walk?

1395
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:33,780
我不知
I don't know.

1396
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:35,940
- 因为我们得离开这儿  - 好的
- Cause we gotta get out of here.  - Okay.

1397
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:52,350
好了，我们接住你了

我们接住你了

1399
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:08,220
嗨，你

医好你
Fix you up.

1402
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:16,370
你准备离开这儿，我肯定
You ready to get out here. I'm sure am.

1403
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:33,260
恳请上帝
Please Lord.

1404
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:35,920
让我再救一个
Help me get one more.

1405
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:38,260
让我再救一个
Help me get one more.

1406
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:08,780
请让我再救一个

1407

1411
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:51,760
再一个

1412
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:54,520
来了
Coming through.

1413
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:59,380
这些家伙到底哪来的
Where the hell these guys coming from?

1414
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:00,400
钢锯
Hacksaw.

1415
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:01,610
我以为他们已撤完了
I thought they pulled out.

1416
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:03,080
并非所有
Not all of them.

1417
01:52:03,330 --> 01:52:05,650
某疯子在那里把伤员从顶上放下来
Some nuts out there drive the wounded from the top.

1418
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,310
甚至放下了几个日本佬

1419
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:10,260
他们没能挺得住

1420
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,440
回头直接带给你
Get back with you directly.

1421
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,960
轻点，轻点

1422
01:52:15,170 --> 01:52:16,370
满了，出发
All set. Move out.

1423
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:19,690
我们走
Let's go.

1424
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:48,970
到这儿来
Get in here.

1425
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:50,620
到处都是日本人
There's Nips everywhere.

1426
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:53,600
婊崽子
Son of a bitch.

1427
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:55,110
列兵“玉米秆”
Private Cornstock.

1428
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:58,030
你一无是处如果不是满带惊喜
You're nothing if not full of surprises.

1429
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:00,260
- 你想要些吗啡？ - 想得很
- You want some morphine.  - Hell yes.

1430
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:01,350
那条或两条
That or both.

1431
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:02,370
好吧
Okay.

1432
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:04,260
来了
There.

1433
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:05,740
给你
There you go.

1434
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,280
好吧
Alright.

1435
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:11,650
放松，让我看看
Easy. Let me see.

1436
01:53:12,490 --> 01:53:15,200
这样如何？好吧，不坏
How's this? Okay. Not bad.

1437
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:18,340
让我看看
Let me see.

1438
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:20,810
我会做得比这还要糟
I'll make much much than this.

1439
01:53:20,830 --> 01:53:22,770
但女孩们还是不会吻你
But girls still won't kiss you.

1440
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:25,310
中士
Sarge.

1441
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:27,650
你在此呆一会儿可好？
You okay here for a while?

1442
01:53:27,690 --> 01:53:28,690
好的，我还好
Yeah I'm fine.

1443
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:29,800
尽管离开
Get outta here.

1444
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:30,980
我会回来
I'm coming back.

1445
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:32,660
你准备好了？我们走
You ready? Let's go.

1446
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:33,940
你跟我，来吧
You and me. C'mon.

1447
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,280
上尉，有事你得瞧瞧
Captain. Something you gotta see.

1448
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:16,320
整个夜里我们的人被一个个的放下来
Our guys have been coming down in droves all night.

1449
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:17,440
而“好莱坞”在此
And Hollywood's here.

1450
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:18,730
我从没想过还能再见此人
I never thought I'd see that guy again.

1451
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,240
来吧跟我来，他在这儿
Come on follow me. He's right here.

1452
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:25,710
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell is this?

1453
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:27,880
你好，长官
How you doing sir?

1454
01:54:27,980 --> 01:54:28,980
嘿，“帽子”
Hey, Cap.

1455
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:30,220
上尉
Captain.

1456
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,260
很高兴看到你，孩子
It's good to see you kid.

1457
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:35,320
上帝保佑，长官
God bless, sir.

1458
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:37,250
你怎么下来的，孩子
How you get down, son?

1459
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:38,480
是多斯
It's Doss.

1460
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:39,970
豪厄尔仍在那儿
Howell's still out there.

1461
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,170
豪厄尔和多斯做的
Howell and Doss did this?

1462
01:54:43,090 --> 01:54:43,990
不，长官，只是多斯
No, sir. It's just Doss.

1463
01:54:45,190 --> 01:54:46,610
- 只是多斯？ - 只是多斯
- Just Doss?  - Just Doss.

1464
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:49,250
对，多斯，那“懦夫”
Yeah Doss the Coward.

1465
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:06,790
你喜欢鞋上的枪，不是吗
You like gun on a shoe ain't ya.

1466
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:07,820
给我这个
Give me this.

1467
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:12,010
现在打靶太迟了，你不觉得
It's a bit late for target practice now don't you think.

1468
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:16,350
跳上来
Jump on it.

1469
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:17,560
你开玩笑吧
You kidding?

1470
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:19,120
不，我来拖你
No, I'm gonna drag you.

1471
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:25,580
一起干吧
Let's do it.

1472
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:29,340
- 好没？ - 好了
- Ready?  - Yeah

1473
01:56:29,620 --> 01:56:30,620
我们走
Let's go!

1474
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:36,240
我们有追兵
We got company.

1475
01:56:38,170 --> 01:56:39,170
来吧
Come on.

1476
01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:00,360
我们得跳
We're gonna jump.

1477
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:02,950
你在耍我吧？“玉米秆”
You gotta be kidding me, Cornstock?

1478
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:05,350
你是结单套，不是结胸罩
You got a bowline, not building a bra.

1479
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:07,700
来吧
Come on!

1480
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,360

1481
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:13,390
下去
Get off!

1482
01:57:40,550 --> 01:57:42,130
- 放下我！ - 是，中士
- Put me down!  - Yes, Sergeant.

1483
01:57:42,710 --> 01:57:43,620
中士豪厄尔
Sergeant Howell.

1484
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,170
多斯还在那儿
Doss is still up there.

1485
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:47,900
到底咋回事？
What the hell?

1486
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:49,750
他被日本佬尾追
He's got Japs on his tail.

1487
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:22,480
我们接住他了
We got him.

1488
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,200
很好，很好
It's good. It's good.

1489
01:58:31,790 --> 01:58:34,180
喔，好了，好了，多斯
Woah. It's okay. It's okay. Doss.

1490

你安全了
You're safe.

1491
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:38,400
好吧
Okay.

1492
01:58:58,970 --> 01:58:59,970
德斯蒙德
Desmond.

1493
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:04,070
放松
Easy.

1494
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:05,740
这儿，来吧
Here come on.

1495
01:59:05,990 --> 01:59:06,990
坐下
Take a seat.

1496
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:12,170
你受伤了
Are you wounded?

01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:18,080
没有
No.

1498
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:19,260
没有
No.

1499
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:24,400
大家立即送这名士兵去医疗篷
Let's get this soldier to a hospital tent right now.

1500
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:25,620
来吧，现在放轻
Come on easy now.

1501
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:26,970
放松，放松
Easy. Easy.

1502
02:00:16,070 --> 02:00:17,070
伊夫在哪儿
Where's Irv?

1503
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:18,240
伊夫
Irv.

1504
02:00:18,290 --> 02:00:20,100
你是说谢克特军医
You mean Schecter the Medic?

1505
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:21,460
他没能挺住
He didn't make it.

1506
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:22,720
他死于震伤
He died of shocked.

1507
02:00:22,830 --> 02:00:23,830
没有血浆
No plasma.

1508
02:00:25,330 --> 02:00:25,930
抱歉
Sorry.

1509
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,810
我只看到一个瘦小子
All I saw was a skinny kid.

1510
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,640
我不知你是谁
I didn't know who you were.

1511
02:01:10,210 --> 02:01:13,710
你比任何别的男人报效祖国所做的多得多
You done more than any other men could've done in a service to his country.

1512
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:16,940
我此生从未如此看错人
I have never been more wrong about someone in my life.

1513
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:21,180
我希望有天你能原谅我
I hope one day you could forgive me.

1514
02:01:33,570 --> 02:01:35,630
我们明天必须回到上边

1515
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,950
我意识到明天是你的安息日
I realize that tomorrow is your Sabbath.

1516
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,720
这些人大多数不相信你所信仰的方式
Most of these men don't believe the same way you do.

1517
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:53,170
他们如此相信
They believe so much

1518
02:01:54,260 --> 02:01:55,800
你有多坚信
How much you believe.

1519
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:01,590
你在山脊上的所为就是奇迹
What you did on that Ridge is nothing short of miracle.

1520
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:03,490
他们想要一块
They wanna piece of it.

1521
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:08,800
没有你，他们不会去那儿
They're not gonna go up there without you.

1522
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:21,380
你到底拖延什么，上尉
What the hell is your delay, Captain?

1523
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:23,570
你应该在十分钟前开始进攻
You supposed to begin that assault 10 minutes ago.

1524
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,110
我们在等着，长官
We're waiting, sir.

1525
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:26,430
等着啥
Waiting for what?

1526
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:32,040
列兵多斯完成为我们的祈祷，长官
Private Doss to finish praying for us, sir.

1527
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:35,760
- 列兵多斯在为你祈祷？ - 列兵多斯到底是谁
- Private Doss is praying for you.  - Who the hell is Private Doss?

1528
02:02:57,570 --> 02:02:58,700
我们去干活
Let's go to work.

1529
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:52,740
趴下
Down!

1530
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:54,840
趴下！趴在地上
Get down! Get down on the ground!

1531
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:57,330
立即趴在地上
On the ground now!

1532
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:39,270
躺下！躺下！我有吗啡
Lay down! Lay down! I got the morphine.

1533
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:42,740
我们走！我们走！我们带这个人离开这儿
Let's go! Let's go. Let's get this man outta here.

1534
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:43,760
走！走
Go! Go!

1535
02:05:48,270 --> 02:05:49,270
我的圣经
My Bible.

1536
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:50,630
我的圣经
My Bible.

1537
02:05:52,510 --> 02:05:55,030
停下！停下！停下
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1538
02:05:55,210 --> 02:05:57,570
我的圣经，我的圣经
My Bible. My Bible.

1539
02:05:58,850 --> 02:05:59,850
好吧
Okay.

1540
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:06,450
[一号外科器]

1541
02:07:15,820 --> 02:07:17,350
你回家了，德斯蒙德
You going home Desmond.

1542
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:19,460
我们已拿下钢锯
We've taken the Hacksaw.

1543
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:25,600
等下！等下！德斯蒙德
Hold up! Hold up! Desmond.

1544
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:29,240
德斯蒙德
Desmond.

1545
02:08:43,530 --> 02:08:48,880
德斯蒙德·多斯把 75 名伤员于钢锯岭战役中带至安全地带

1546
02:08:49,830 --> 02:09:00,580
他是第一个拒服兵役但获得美国“战火中的勇气”荣誉勋章者

1547
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:10,770
德斯蒙德和多萝西结婚，直至她在1991去世

1548
02:09:11,930 --> 02:09:16,020
他是自己的英雄，保有特有的谦虚，将所有的功劳归于他的上帝

1549
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:18,440
我一直在祈祷
I was praying the whole time.

1550
02:09:19,530 --> 02:09:23,730
我只是开始祈祷上帝请让我再救一个
I just start praying to the Lord please let me get one more.

1551
02:09:24,770 --> 02:09:28,940
当我救多一个，我说“好吧，上帝请让我再救一个”
When I got this I said "Alright Lord please help me get one more".

1552
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:34,880
他平淡地说“真正的英雄们都埋葬在那里”

1553
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:40,250
我认为任何人都是错的若要去妥协他人的信念
I would say anyone is wrong to try to compromise somebody's conviction.

1554
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:43,210
我不在乎是军队或者是什么
I don't care it's the army or what it is.

1555
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:45,490
当你持有信念
When you're on a conviction

1556
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:47,330
那不是笑话
That is not a joke.

1557
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:50,830
那就是你
That's what you are.

1558
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:52,560
[上尉杰克·格洛弗]

1559
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:56,450
即使我对他说那些关于携带步枪的事
Even though I said those things to him in regard to carrying a rifle.

1560
02:09:56,600 --> 02:10:02,440
然而他永远不会站在我这边，除非他拿了枪
Then he would never be on my damn side at all unless he had a rifle.

1561
02:10:03,050 --> 02:10:05,410
但是从长远来看
But then in the long run.

1562
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:09,900
发现他是一个活着的最勇敢的人
Finding out that he was one of the bravest person alive.

1563
02:10:10,770 --> 02:10:15,910
而让他停止挽救我的生命则会是对整件事的讽刺
And then to have him ended up saving my life was the irony of the whole thing.

1564
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:20,980
血顺着这家伙的脸跟眼流下
Blood it ran down through this fellow's face and eyes.

1565
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:25,510
那是当他开始呼喊军医的时候
It was when that he go in and called for medic.

1566
02:10:27,490 --> 02:10:31,290
我从水壶取水，拿出绷带
I took the water from my canteen and got some bandages.

1567
02:10:31,580 --> 02:10:33,440
我冲洗他的脸
And I wash his face.

1568
02:10:34,690 --> 02:10:36,220
当我擦拭
And when I wipe

1569
02:10:36,910 --> 02:10:39,180
冲洗他的双眼，眼睛睁开了
Washed up his eyes. Eyes came out

1570
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:42,170
伙计，他顿时亮了
Man, he just lit up.

1571
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:46,570
他说，我以为我瞎了
He says I thought I was blind.

1572
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:52,960
如我没有任何东西多于他给我的微笑
And if I hadn't got anything more to what that smile he gave me.

1573
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:55,880
我不会得到很好的回报
I wouldn't have been well repaid.

1574
02:10:57,600 --> 02:11:05,100
德斯蒙德·多斯于二〇〇六年三月去世，享年八十七岁

1575
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:10,000
导演
梅尔•吉布森
代表作《勇敢的心》
