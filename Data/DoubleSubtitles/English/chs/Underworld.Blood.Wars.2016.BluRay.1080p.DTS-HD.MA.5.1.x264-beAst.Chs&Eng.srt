2
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,630
我曾是吸血鬼军队的一名精英战士
I was an elite soldier in the vampire army.

3
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,420
一个死亡行者
A Death Dealer.

4
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,630
而且我还干的不错
And I was good at it.

5
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,680
但我却背叛了
But I was betrayed.

6
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,640
维克多，我们的长老和最强的吸血鬼…
Viktor, our leader and the most powerful vampire...

7
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,690
我曾相信他是我们的救世主
was not the savior he had led me to believe.

8
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,070
突然之间，自己人变成了敌人
Suddenly, allies turned enemies.

9
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,450
我曾效忠的吸血鬼的长老却希望我死
The vampire Elders I had once protected wanted me dead.

10
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,950
在我遇到麦可柯文后
Then I found Michael Corvin.

11
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,120
不是吸血鬼也不是狼人，麦可变成了一个混血
Neither vampire nor Lycan, Michael became a hybrid.

12
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,630
我们进行反抗，并杀死了长老
We retaliated, killed the Elders.

13
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,590
但是后来一切都变了
But then everything changed.

14
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,680
我被抓住了，不知道的是我当时已经怀上了麦可的孩子
I was captured, not knowing that I was carrying Michael's child.

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,810
伊芙，我们的女儿，第一个纯血的混血…
Eve, our daughter, the first pure-blood hybrid...

16
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,220
她的血液可以结束这场战争…
whose blood could end the war...

17
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,810
高纯度的血液变成了吸血鬼和狼人都想要的
became highly sought after by both vampires and Lycans alike.

18
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,900
我唯一的选择是让她远离这世界和我自己…
My only choice was to hide her from the world and from myself...

19
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,740
这样他们就不会跟着我找到她
so not even I could lead them to her.

20
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,580
我曾是吸血鬼军队的一名精英战士
I was an elite soldier in the vampire army.

21
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,090
我唯一的选择是让她远离这世界和我自己…
My only choice was to hide her from the world...

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,420
这样他们就不会跟着我找到她
so not even I could lead them to her.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
黑夜传说5

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,990
血战

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,860
我已经存活了很久甚至忘了时间
I have lived beyond my time.

26
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,820
见识了上千个新月…
Another new moon in 1000 years of new moons...

27
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,160
我已不在乎看到它了
and I do not care to see it.

28
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,040
我什么都没有了
I have nothing.

29
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,750
我的柯文…
My coven...

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,790
我的女儿…
my daughter...

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,880
- 我的至爱，都不见了  - 拦住她！
- my love, all gone.  - Cut her off!

32
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,050
也许，很快…
And soon, perhaps...

33
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,380
我也将不存在
my very existence.

34
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,140
- 莎伦娜来了！ - 我正被追杀…
- Selene's coming!  - I am hunted...

35
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,510
被吸血鬼和狼人
by vampires and Lycans.

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,350
现在我是一个无家可归的人，一个被排斥的人
Now I am an outcast, a pariah.

37
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,820
- 放倒她！ - 记住，他要抓活的
- Put her down!  - Remember, he wants her alive.

38
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,030
开枪！
Fire!

39
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,620
现在开火，继续！
Come on, now. Fire!

40
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,970
你可真是让人难以追踪啊
You are an extremely difficult person to keep track of.

41
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,520
我不需要你的帮助
I don't need you.

42
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,310
但是谢谢你
But thank you.

43
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,600
还在找关于麦可的消息？
Any word with Michael?

44
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,900
- 不要跟踪我！ - 我不是跟踪你
- Stop tracking me!  - I'm not tracking you.

45
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,320
我在找伊芙
I'm looking for Eve.

46
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,940
好吧，我是最后能帮你找到我女儿的人
Well, I'm the very last person who could help you find my daughter.

47
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,200
莎伦娜，听我说，狼人又活跃起来了
Selene, listen to me. The Lycans are moving again.

48
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,820
不，这次不一样
No, this is different.

49
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,370
他们是有组织的，他们有一个新的领导人
They're organized. They have a new leader.

50
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,540
- 他叫马略斯  - 我和这场战争无关了
- His name is Marius.  - I'm finished with this war.

51
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,900
好吧，你自己的事并没有结束
Well, it's not finished with you.

52
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,200
他们会杀了你的…
They could have killed you...

53
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,710
但显然他们的任务就是抓活的
but clearly their mission was to capture you.

54
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,710
你女儿的血，它非常的珍贵
Your daughter's blood, it's a prize.

55
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,800
如果他们找到她，如果使用它…
And if they find her, if they use it...

56
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,340
- 马略斯的将会变得无比强大  - 好吧，这样我更希望她仍然隐藏着
- Marius's power will be limitless.  - Well, then I hope she remains lost.

57
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,430
我需要你传递一个信息
I need you to deliver a message.

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,690
理解了就坑一声
Grunt if you understand.

59
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,270
告诉马略斯…
Tell your Marius...

60
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,420
如果他以为从我这里可以得到消息…
if he thinks he can extract information from me...

61
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,150
来找到我的女儿，没用的
to locate my daughter, he can't.

62
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,490
我不知道她在哪里，我也不想知道
I don't know where she is, and I don't want to know.

63
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,240
马略斯会找你的
Marius will find you.

64
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,120
你知道你要怎么说了吗？
Do you understand your message?

65
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,960
这是什么？
What is it?

66
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,340
你以前见过这个吗？
Have you seen this before?

67
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,800
没有…
No...

68
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,470
但是我们需要把它弄出来
but we need to get it out.

69
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,970
我们走
Let's go.

70
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,240
B组一号，OVER，车辆接近中
Bravo one, over. Car approaching.

71
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,750
- 访问完成  - 关闭大门
- Access cleared.  - Close the gates.

72
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,710
开始周边扫描
Commencing perimeter sweep.

73
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,480
欢迎您回家，先生
Privilege to welcome you home at last, sir.

74
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,730
萨米拉在她自己的房间里等您了
Semira awaits you in her private chambers.

75
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,650
萨米拉？
Semira?

76
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,280
卡西乌斯在哪？
Where is Cassius?

77
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,250
当然，整个委员会都在等您的，先生…
The entire council will greet you, of course, sir...

78
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,570
但是萨米拉只是请求见一面
but Semira requests just a few moments.

79
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,280
你叫什么名字？
And your name is?

80
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,870
瓦尔加，先生
Varga, sir.

81
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,080
我将试着记住你
I shall try to remember it.

82
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,560
因为这个悲剧并采取相应行动…
And act accordingly because of this tragic...

83
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,350
下去
Leave us.

84
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,030
亲爱的汤玛士，已经…
Darling Thomas. It has been...

85
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,570
- 多久没见了？ - 几十年
- how long?  - Decades.

86
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,410
恭喜你了
Congratulations.

87
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,050
恭喜你在议会已经有了一席之地
I gather you have a seat on the council.

88
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,530
这没什么可骄傲的
I could not be more proud.

89
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,160
很遗憾，在这种日子不能庆祝你的归来
It's a shame that your return is not under more festive circumstances.

90
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,420
据说西方的议会已经被完全摧毁了
It is said that the Western Coven was utterly destroyed.

91
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,710
是的，确实是
Yes, it was.

92
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,840
很庆幸你还活着
It's a blessing you escaped with your life.

93
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,670
是啊，也有很多不幸的
Well, many did not.

94
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,180
我们的种族已经死伤很多了
There has been too much death among our people.

95
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,350
这些都是布达佩斯议会的骨灰
These urns are all that remain of our Budapest Coven.

96
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,470
好吧，向你表示哀悼
Well, you have my condolences.

97
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,810
汤玛士，我们快要输掉这场战争了
We are losing the war, Thomas.

98
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,270
如果我们继续这样，在五年内我们种族将会灭绝
If we stay as we are, our species will be extinct within five years.

99
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,020
这是卡西乌斯和你说的？
Does Cassius share your view?

100
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,990
狼人在重整旗鼓，发展种族，决心消灭我们
The Lycans have regrouped, replenished, and are resolved to exterminate us.

101
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,070
哦，当然了，你这里很安全的，东方的议会是一个堡垒
Oh, surely, you're safe here. The Eastern Coven is a fortress.

102
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,370
我们已经不是你记忆中的议会了
We are no longer the coven you remember.

103
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,740
我们比以前任何时候都缺少死亡行者
We have fewer Death Dealers than ever before.

104
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,160
你这里好像都是新生的血族
You seem to be surrounded by new cadets.

105
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,540
新生血族，没有经历战争而且并不多…
Raw recruits, neither combat-ready nor numerous enough...

106
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,630
不足以击退狼人的大规模进攻
to repel a large-scale Lycan attack.

107
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,670
从未有过大规模的狼人进攻吧
There has never been a large-scale Lycan attack.

108
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,380
至少这样的从未有过
At least not a coordinated one.

109
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,220
因为从未有过这样的马略斯
There has never been a Marius.

110
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,600
这一点我承认很痛苦，有生以来第一次…
Pains me to admit it, but for the first time in my life...

111
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,270
我真担心我们的未来
I genuinely fear for our future.

112
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,270
所以，你是怎么打算的？
So, what is your plan?

113
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,610
萨米拉，你一直是个有计划的人
Semira, you always have a plan.

114
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,360
你特意安排我们小会面的目的
This little mise-en-scene you're performing has a purpose.

115
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,820
我不会读心术
I am not a mind reader.

116
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,820
请对一个老者礼貌点…
Kindly do an old vampire the courtesy...

117
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,370
告诉他为什么他被邀请到这里
of telling him why he's been invited here.

118
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,080
莎伦娜
Selene.

119
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,750
来吧，我们要继续前进
Come on. We need to keep moving.

120
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,250
有比这更近的安全的地方
There are safe houses far closer than this.

121
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,300
我告诉你，被他们毁了
I told you, they destroyed them.

122
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,220
现在情况不同了，来
It's different now. Come on.

123
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,550
但是你签署了对她进行追杀
But you signed her death warrant.

124
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,810
当然了，我蔑视她
Of course. I despise her.

125
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,680
她杀了维克托，他以前都听我的
She killed Viktor. I was his regent.

126
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,390
直到他遇到了莎伦娜
Until he met Selene.

127
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,650
那你是想让她去杀了马略斯？
So you want her to hunt Marius?

128
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,440
我希望她能训练新生的吸血鬼…
I want her to train our new recruits...

129
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,530
这样我们有百名死亡行者去杀马略斯
so we have 100 Death Dealers hunting Marius.

130
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,110
我怀疑她会同意
I doubt she will agree.

131
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,990
她唯一关心的是她的女儿
Her only concern is for her daughter.

132
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,370
伊芙，纯混血
Eve, the hybrid.

133
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,450
不幸的是，那个可怜的女孩有一半狼人血统
Unfortunately, the poor girl is half Lycan.

134
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,010
吸血鬼的本来相对狼人的来说就弱…
It's a vampire's instinct to condescend to Lycans...

135
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,710
而且狼人不担心进化
but they're not afraid to evolve.

136
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,460
与此同时，我们有一千五百年不曾进化…
Meanwhile, we stagnate from 1500 years...

137
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,800
这该死的“纯血统”真是荒谬
of this damned "species purity" nonsense.

138
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,010
而且讽刺的是莎伦娜…
And the irony is that Selene...

139
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,880
- 她的血液比我们的都要纯净  - 所以谣言是真的吗？
- is probably the purest of us all.  - So the rumor's true?

140
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,430
她的血液融合了柯文纳斯的？
Her blood has elements of the Corvinus strain?

141
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,470
她非常特殊
She is special.

142
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,930
她让我的儿子起死回生了
She brought my son back from the dead.

143
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,270
- 她的血液让他的心脏重新跳动  - 这不可能
- Her blood restarted his heart.  - Impossible.

144
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,440
我亲眼所见，我救了我儿子的命
I witnessed it myself. She saved my son's life.

145
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,610
维克托和艾梅莉亚
Viktor and Amelia.

146
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,120
一起逝去的永恒
Side by side for eternity.

147
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,960
如果我没记错的话，你非常喜欢艾梅莉亚
You were very fond of Amelia, if I remember.

148
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,710
- 我需要你和我结盟  - 她不会冒险来这里的…
- I need you to be my ally on this.  - She won't risk coming here...

149
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,510
除非整个委员议会邀请她
unless she gets an invitation from the whole council.

150
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,760
我根本不可能发出这样的提议
And I could never solicit such a request.

151
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,890
卡西乌斯是保护旧传统的人
Cassius is protective of the old ways.

152
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,220
他甚至不能容忍我在委员议会里
He barely tolerates my seat on the council as it is.

153
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,520
但现在是非常时期，汤玛士
But these are desperate times, Thomas.

154
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,440
这就是为什么必须要你去说服委员议会来邀请她
And that is why you must convince the council to invite her.

155
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,320
他们今晚到达
They arrive tonight.

156
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,650
黎明警报，六十秒后日出
Dawn alert. 60 seconds to sunrise.

157
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,890
马略斯，各地首领都到了…
Marius, the pack leaders have arrived...

158
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,480
我让他们在指挥室等你了
and I told them to wait for you in the war room.

159
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,120
我相信他们一定争吵的很激烈
They're fighting like dogs, no doubt.

160
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,690
- 我来处理，谢谢了  - 好的
- I'll handle it. Thank you.  - All right.

161
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,780
- 继续，继续  - 对，对
- Go on, then.  - Right, right.

162
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,950
来这边，我这边
Come around, come around.

163
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,700
不！听我的
No! Listen to me.

164
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,910
我们从中分开他们，这样做才是对的
We're gonna wedge them in. That's what we do.

165
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,970
从这一边到另一边，我们只要分开他们…
From this side and that side, we just wedge them in...

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
- 然后里应外合  - 从中分开？
- and squeeze them out.  - Wedge them in?

167
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,460
这是你的计划？这一点用也不没有
Is that your plan? It's not going to lead to anything.

168
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,960
- 他要生气了  - 闭嘴！
- He's getting angry.  - Shut up!

169
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,500
停！
Stop!

170
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,470
- 你是个奴隶吗？ - 不
- Are you a slave?  - No.

171
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,220
那就不要像奴隶一样
Then don't behave like one.

172
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,640
看这张地图
Look at this map.

173
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,430
你们看到什么了？
What do you see?

174
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,480
你们看到狼人争夺的区域了吗？
Do you see Lycans fighting over scraps?

175
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,980
我告诉你们我看到了什么
I'll tell you what I see.

176
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,900
沃利尼亚
Volhynia.

177
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,030
诺德格，图林根州
Nordgau. Thuringia.

178
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,280
狼人的胜利
The Lycan victories.

179
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,620
我看到了吸血鬼的死亡
I see vampires dead.

180
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,330
我看到了整个地区歼灭
I see entire regions annihilated.

181
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,870
但是我们继续自我斗争，我们就不会再有进一步的进展
But we will get no further if we fight amongst ourselves.

182
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,210
我们不能停歇…
We must not rest...

183
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,750
直到我们摧毁了他们最后的据点
until we have destroyed their final sanctuary.

184
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,210
团结，我们才会强大
Together, we are strong.

185
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,680
当我们找到那个纯混血女孩时…
And when we have the blood of the hybrid girl...

186
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,640
我们将战无不胜
we will be invincible.

187
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,190
格雷戈尔
Gregor.

188
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,530
就剩你自己了
You have returned alone.

189
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,110
- 我们打的措手不及  - 莎伦娜在哪？
- We were taken by surprise.  - Where is Selene?

190
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,990
- 她放过了我  - 为什么？
- She spared me.  - Why?

191
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,580
她想让我回来传个话
To deliver a message.

192
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,700
她想让你知道她的女儿不知所踪了…
She wants you to know that her daughter is gone forever...

193
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,410
你永远也找不到…
that you can never find her...

194
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,420
因为莎伦娜也不知道她躲藏在哪里
because even Selene doesn't know where she's been hidden.

195
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,710
你相信她说的吗？
Do you believe her?

196
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,420
你能相信她吗？
Do you believe her?

197
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,810
我放了跟踪器在她同伴身上
I put a tracer in her companion.

198
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,850
很好…
Well...

199
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,940
说明你不是完全无能的
that means you're not completely incompetent.

200
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,670
忍着别乱动
Try and stay still.

201
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,170
- 这是什么？ - 某一种子弹
- What is it?  - It's some sort of bullet.

202
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,090
钻入你身体的速度比你自愈的快
It's burrowing through you faster than you can heal.

203
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,550
这是自动推进的
It's self-propelled.

204
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,140
这就是我想和你说的，这些狼人不简单
That's what I was trying to tell you. These Lycans are sophisticated.

205
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,270
我不知道能不能及时取出它
I don't know if I can remove it in time.

206
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,720
好吧，至少你会尝试这让人感到安心点
Well, the least you can do is attempt to sound reassuring.

207
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,860
我要试着别害死你了
I'm going to attempt not to kill you.

208
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,820
那是必须的
That will have to do.

209
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,900
你需要我们给谁提供保护和特赦？
To whom do you want us to offer safe haven and amnesty?

210
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,650
- 给死亡行者莎伦娜  - 那个杀了维克托的莎伦娜？
- To Selene the Death Dealer.  - The same Selene who murdered Viktor?

211
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,780
我不需要提醒，卡西乌斯，她做了什么
I need no reminder, Cassius, of what she has done.

212
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,070
真为你感到丢脸
Shame on you, sir.

213
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,120
我不想再听到她的名字了
I will not hear her name spoken again.

214
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,410
卡西乌斯，我理解你的愤怒
Cassius, I share your outrage.

215
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,330
为何如此垫着？
Whatever has possessed you?

216
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,040
如果我们不采取果断行动…
If we don't act decisively...

217
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,210
两个星期内战争就在打到大门口
the war will be at your gate within a fortnight.

218
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,130
不过大门将依然存在
And that is precisely where it will remain.

219
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,460
没有狼人敢攻击我们的议会
No Lycan pack would dare to attack our coven.

220
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,760
我们的防御系统会为他们开着
Our defenses would rip them apart.

221
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,180
也许一些普通的狼人确实是…
An ordinary Lycan pack, perhaps...

222
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,510
但是马略斯已经聚集了更加强大的力量…
but Marius has gathered a force far more powerful than any...

223
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,970
未经过证实的夸张而已
Unsubstantiated hyperbole.

224
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,980
你需要莎伦娜
You need Selene.

225
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,770
她的实力，她的领导，她和狼人的亲密了解
Her prowess, her leadership, her intimate knowledge of Lycans.

226
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,480
而且她的战斗技能是无人能比的
And her combat skills are second to none.

227
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,150
他说的没错，她是我们最强的死亡行者
He's right, she is the most lethal Death Dealer we've ever had.

228
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,860
但是她杀了自己的族人
But she killed one of her own.

229
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,080
不仅是最强大的而且是受人尊敬的长老…
Not only the most powerful and respected of the Elders...

230
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,670
保护着她，爱她就像爱自己的女儿一样
her protector, who loved her like his own daughter.

231
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,710
不能相信她
She cannot be trusted.

232
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,130
她受到审判了
She has been judged.

233
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,880
也许她也可以挽回
Perhaps she can also be redeemed.

234
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,550
对我来说这样很痛苦，但是汤玛士是对的
It pains me to say it, but Thomas is right.

235
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,680
没人像她一样能在战斗中证明自己
No warrior has proved herself more in battle.

236
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,100
她在我们对抗马略斯时是非常重要的…
She would be invaluable in our fight against Marius...

237
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,310
为确保我们能胜利她非常关键
perhaps even the pivotal element to secure our victory.

238
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,860
如果能找到她…
If she can be found...

239
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,530
并来到这个议会…
and sets foot within this precious coven...

240
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,860
我同意了，萨米拉，由你亲自承担责任…
I will hold you, Semira, personally responsible...

241
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,780
- 控制好她  - 当然
- for controlling her.  - Of course.

242
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,440
入侵警报，入侵警报，入侵警报
Intruder. Intruder. Intruder.

243
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,480
入侵警报，入侵警报
Intruder. Intruder.

244
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,500
谁派你来的？
Who sent you?

245
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,580
放下枪
Drop it.

246
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,380
你们怎么找到这里的？
How'd you find us?

247
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,800
外面只有少数的安全屋了
There are only a handful of safe houses left.

248
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,890
狼人要找也相当容易
The Lycans made it rather easy.

249
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,470
东方议会的长老让我带你回去
The council of the Eastern Coven sent me to bring you in.

250
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,350
- 为了审判？ - 不是
- For trial?  - No.

251
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,480
- 为了您的安全，和大家的  - 你不要指望我相信这事
- For your safety, and ours.  - You cannot expect me to believe that.

252
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,900
他们每个人都签了对我的死亡执行令
Every single one of them signed my death warrant.

253
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,190
- 时代变了  - 吸血鬼不会
- Times change.  - Vampires do not.

254
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,900
这是你父亲给你的
This is from your father.

255
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,320
这信是真的吗？
Is it authentic?

256
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,530
这是他的封印，他的笔记
It's his seal, his handwriting.

257
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,910
委员会特赦了你并且给我们提供了安全的场所
The council has offered you clemency and granted us both safe haven.

258
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,870
- 为什么？ - 马略斯
- Why?  - Marius.

259
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,420
这是委员会诚恳的要求…
It is the council's humble request...

260
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,250
让你训练我们来击败他和他的军队
that you train us to defeat him and his army.

261
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,090
走，快
Move. Come on.

262
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,920
跟踪信号来自这边
The signal's coming from this way.

263
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,970
听着，我知道你很不情愿…
Look, I understand you're reluctant...

264
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,970
但是作为委员会的客人，我们将受到古老规则的保护
but as guests of the council, we will be protected by law.

265
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,310
我父亲不会说谎，他和你并无纠葛
My father wouldn't lie, and he holds no grudge.

266
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,430
- 和维克托更没有关系  - 入侵警报，入侵警报
- He had no love for Viktor, either.  - Intruder. Intruder.

267
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,730
- 是狼人  - 入侵警报
- Lycans.  - Intruder.

268
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,900
- 我们必须离开  - 你应该接受委员会的提议
- We must leave.  - You should accept the council's offer.

269
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,990
- 为了伊芙  - 伊芙不需要我的帮助
- For Eve.  - Eve does not want my help.

270
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,490
我知道你想保护她，如果我们消灭了马略斯…
I know you want to protect her. And if we destroy Marius...

271
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,820
我们就清除了对她安全来说的最大威胁
we destroy the greatest threat to her safety.

272
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,280
快走
Now.

273
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,430
马略斯
Marius.

274
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,140
我们刚才错过了他们
We just missed them.

275
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,850
我不希望再听到“刚才”这个词
I do not wish to hear the word "just" again.

276
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,600
没有她就胜不了
Either we have her or we have nothing.

277
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,820
你明白了吗？
Do you understand?

278
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,070
- 你明白了吗？ - 是的
- Do you understand?  - Yeah.

279
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,590
探戈C组接近中
Tango Charlie approaching.

280
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,130
安全
All clear.

281
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,300
周边安全
Perimeter secure.

282
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,820
- 欢迎光临  - 欢迎我？
- Welcome.  - Am I?

283
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,530
委员会的资源和武器都将给你…
Our coven's resources and weaponry are yours...

284
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,280
来把这些新生血族变成像你一样的死亡行者中精英
to transform these raw recruits into Death Dealers worthy of your name.

285
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,580
瓦尔加将是你的得力助手
Varga will be your right-hand man.

286
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,450
他知道我们所有的优点和缺点
He knows all our strengths and weaknesses.

287
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,210
他也是我们这杀死狼人最多的超过四十个的杀手
He is also our most prolific Lycan killer with over 40 confirmed kills.

288
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,290
- 这是我的荣耀  - 大卫，欢迎你
- It's an honor.  - David, welcome.

289
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,170
- 谢谢  - 为了纪念客人们的安全到来…
- Thank you.  - To mark the safe arrival of our guests...

290
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,510
我已经安排了一个小晚会在冬季花园
I've arranged a little soiree in the Winter Garden.

291
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,510
真的没有必要，谢谢
There's really no need. Thank you.

292
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,430
胡说，大家需要纵情享乐一下
Nonsense. There's always a need to indulge in pleasure.

293
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,660
在这战争的年代…
In times of war...

294
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,660
这个时刻对委员会来说是值得庆祝的
this coven needs moments to celebrate.

295
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,790
汤玛士，大卫和莎伦娜的到来…
The arrival of Thomas, David and Selene...

296
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,920
是非常值得高兴的理由
is reason aplenty to rejoice.

297
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,260
敬所有人
To us all.

298
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,520
萨米拉，你为我们提供了安全的居所，谢谢你
It's good of you to offer us sanctuary, Semira. Thank you.

299
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,150
这是我的荣幸
It will be entirely my pleasure.

300
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,070
告诉我，她的血液让你起死回生是真的？
Tell me, is it true that her blood brought you back to life?

301
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,610
是的，是真的
Yes, it is.

302
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,530
我对她无以回报
I owe her everything.

303
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,120
不过，如果你不介意，我父亲想和我说些什么
But, if you'll excuse me, my father requests my counsel.

304
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,120
汤玛士总是这样的无趣
Thomas was always such a bore.

305
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,260
好了，萨米拉显然对你很感兴趣
Well, Semira's certainly taken an interest in you.

306
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,180
恩，这肯定不是相互的
Well, the interest is certainly not mutual.

307
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,640
我们需要她的帮助
We need her protection.

308
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,430
相反，我觉我才需要保护来远离她
On the contrary, I think I need protection from her.

309
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,270
异生物的战争
The Battle of the Peste.

310
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,350
我们认为这个战争就是结束时…
We thought it would be the one to end the war...

311
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,900
是最后的战斗…
the final conflict...

312
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,900
但是战斗仍然持续
but here we are still.

313
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,740
我希望你看到我们对莎伦娜的仁慈是怎样的
I hope you see my bid for clemency for Selene for what it is.

314
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,780
是的，至少你能提供给她帮助…
Well, clemency is the least you can offer her...

315
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,340
把她女儿交易给狼人
after bartering her daughter to the Lycans.

316
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,990
在这场战争中我失去了很多
I lost so much during this war.

317
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,500
相信我，这所有的失败仍然困扰着我
Believe me, I am haunted still by all those I failed.

318
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,210
好吧，那你必须帮我保护她
Well, then you must help me protect her.

319
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,380
她已失去的甚至超过我们的想象
She has lost even more than we can imagine.

320
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,590
且她对我来说很重要
And she's important to me.

321
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,180
马略斯还在那…
Marius is out there...

322
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,520
满嘴尖牙傲慢的，计划着我们的毁灭
reeking of canine insolence, plotting our downfall.

323
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,190
我们不需要莎伦娜去杀他
We do not need Selene to destroy him.

324
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,740
有我就可以
I am more than capable.

325
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,410
不，瓦尔加，有你还并不足够
No, Varga, you are merely adequate.

326
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,120
幸运的是，我们不是被迫依赖你的能力生存
It's fortunate that we're not forced to rely on your skills for our survival.

327
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,620
我的小甜心…
That, my sweet...

328
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,210
对付无趣的人…
yet unimaginative bedfellow...

329
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,750
是我所擅长的
is my area of expertise.

330
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,680
- 我认为你应该…  - 瓦尔加，不要多想
- I think you should...  - Don't think, Varga.

331
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,590
你会伤到自己的
You'll hurt yourself.

332
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,390
还有其他的方法来证明你的价值
There are other ways to prove your devotion.

333
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,110
一块精致的碎片…
Piece by delicate piece...

334
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,990
这个难题将水到渠成
the puzzle will fall into place.

335
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,950
哦，耶…
Oh, yeah...

336
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,910
耶…
Yeah...

337
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,120
不要瞄准着狼人，要预测
Don't aim where the Lycan is. Anticipate.

338
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,500
切记…
And remember...

339
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,150
狼人在狼的形态时是最脆弱的
a Lycan is never more vulnerable than when he's in wolf form.

340
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,760
- 什么？ - 这没有道理啊
- What?  - That makes no sense.

341
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,150
在狼形态的时候，他们不能使用武器…
In wolf form, they cannot use weapons...

342
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,640
且他们的想法会变得更加原始…
and their thinking becomes much more primitive...

343
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,020
只会杀戮
driven only by bloodlust.

344
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,940
- 你杀了多少？ - 我从不在意这个
- How many have you killed?  - I don't keep track.

345
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,230
我的速度比狼人快百分之二十
I'm increasing Lycan speed by 20 percent.

346
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,400
请继续
Please continue.

347
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,410
我们的人已经在探索了东方议会周边的弱点了…
My pack has probed the Eastern Coven's perimeter for weaknesses...

348
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,580
然而未发现
and there are none.

349
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,780
有任何的直接攻击就会触发警戒…
And any direct assault would trigger the lockdown...

350
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,390
使得议会牢不可破
which makes the coven impregnable.

351
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,260
即使我们在损失了大部分力量打进去后…
Even if we could break inside without losing 90 percent of our force...

352
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,020
- 他们也有战略撤退…  - 这
- they have fallback positions...  - This.

353
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,800
- 那也是…  - 能使用了吗？
- That can be...  - Is this ready?

354
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,630
是的
Yeah.

355
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,260
当我们有混种血液的时候…
When we have the hybrid's blood...

356
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,180
我们就发起对他们的进攻
we launch against the Eastern.

357
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,640
找到莎伦娜，然后找到她的女儿
Find Selene, and we find her daughter.

358
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,440
我自己的发明
My own invention.

359
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,420
死亡行者必须学会的第一件事…
One of the first things a Death Dealer must learn...

360
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,960
是如何在一个狭小的空间里战斗
is how to fight in a confined space.

361
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,490
当然，这个训练缺少的是不可预见的
Of course, the one thing this training session lacks is unpredictability.

362
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,240
也许你会赏脸给我和我的学生…
Perhaps you'll indulge me and give my students...

363
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,700
我应该说你的学生，教导我们战斗的不可预见性
I should say your students. A lesson in combat's unpredictability.

364
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,750
这不仅是我们的荣耀，这还是宝贵的训练
It would not only honor us, but it would be invaluable to their training.

365
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,750
- 我没…  - 请
- I don't...  - Please.

366
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,000
好了
That's enough.

367
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,220
集合，我们去学习下…
Gather round. We are going to school you...

368
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,430
狼人的本性
in the true nature of the Lycan warrior.

369
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,640
为了这节课中，我们尊敬的客人莎伦娜…
For the sake of this lesson, our esteemed guest Selene...

370
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,190
将是一名勇敢捍卫我们堡垒的死亡行者…
will play the role of Death Dealer bravely defending our fortress...

371
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,940
而我则是狼人恶棍…
and I will take the role of Lycan villain...

372
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,650
来摧毁这里的
here to destroy it.

373
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,320
女士优先
Ladies first.

374
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,260
佩服
Impressive.

375
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,560
加油
Come on.

376
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,770
加油
Come on.

377
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,350
今晚的学到的是…
Tonight's lesson:

378
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,900
不要相信你的对手和所谓的荣誉
Do not trust your opponent to fight with honor.

379
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,110
他们是狼人，他们什么也没有
They are Lycan. They have none.

380
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,660
别动
Don't move.

381
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,790
茄属植物(有毒)
Nightshade.

382
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,380
毒素渗入到吸血鬼的血液里，通常是致命的
Leeches into vampire cells, usually fatal.

383
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,800
但对于一个有她这样力量的，只有痛苦…
But for one with her strength, there will only be pain...

384
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,180
接着是肌肉麻痹
followed by paralysis.

385
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,890
我要杀了你
I'll kill you.

386
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,220
紫外线子弹
UV bullets.

387
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,360
你真的以为我会原谅你杀死了维克托？
Did you honestly think I would forgive you for killing Viktor?

388
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,400
瓦尔加，你知道你要做什么
Varga, you have orders.

389
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,200
瓦尔加！
Varga!

390
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,980
你不需要你来训练死亡行者
I don't need you to train Death Dealers.

391
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,060
我有瓦尔加就够了
I have Varga for that.

392
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,900
我只需重整这个议会就可以了…
All that I need to rule this coven...

393
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,820
结束这长远和狼人的战争只需要你的血液
and end the march of the Lycans is your blood.

394
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,330
尸体怎么办？
What about the bodies?

395
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,170
发出警报
Sound the alarm.

396
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,960
让委员会发现尸体
Have the council find them.

397
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:34,380
莎伦娜犯下暴行的确凿证据
Conclusive evidence of the atrocity committed by Selene.

398
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,020
有人突破了
There's been a breach.

399
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,770
我们需要找到莎伦娜
We need to find Selene.

400
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,400
- 封锁现场了，萨米拉的命令  - 站一边去
- Cordoned off. Semira's orders.  - Step aside.

401
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,110
大卫
David.

402
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,530
走吧
Come.

403
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,240
有不止一种方法来穿行于这议会
There's more than one way to move around this coven.

404
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,290
艾梅莉亚在几世纪前留下了这些通道
Amelia created these passageways centuries ago.

405
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,420
这通到哪里？
Where does this lead?

406
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,210
通向私人的地方，包括萨米拉的
To the private chambers, including Semira's.

407
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,740
他们到底对她做了什么？
What the hell have they done to her?

408
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,040
机抽干血[拉丁语]
Machinasanguinemexhauri

409
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,710
放血
Bloodletting.

410
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,340
萨米拉要莎伦娜身上最宝贵的东西
Semira wants Selene's most precious asset.

411
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,420
- 这会杀了她的  - 到最后，是的…
- This is going to kill her.  - Eventually, yes...

412
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,260
但这过程是十分缓慢的
but it will be agonizingly slow.

413
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,770
看
Look.

414
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,440
这是为了尽可能的打开并扩张动脉
This is designed to open the arteries as wide as possible.

415
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,900
如果我们稍有不慎，对她将是弊大于利
If we're not very careful, we will do her more harm than good.

416
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,730
小心
Careful.

417
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,130
这是她的吗？
Is this hers?

418
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
是的
Yes.

419
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,050
莎伦娜只使用这种特殊的武器
Selene uses only this particular weapon.

420
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,800
在城堡里一个我们都知道的叛徒
A known traitor within our walls.

421
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,600
这正是我所担心的…
This is precisely what I foresaw...

422
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,060
你向我保证你会阻止的
and what you assured me you would prevent.

423
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,140
是你害死了他们
Their blood is upon your hands.

424
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,350
- 先生，我尽全力了…  - 不要跟我解释
- Sir, I did everything...  - Do not speak to me.

425
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,730
这真是不可宽恕
There can be no mercy.

426
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,480
就算逃到天涯海角也要抓住她
I want her hunted to the ends of the Earth.

427
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,530
一定完成
It shall be done.

428
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,950
而且我要抓活的
And I want her captured alive.

429
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,830
知道了吗？
Is that understood?

430
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,910
明白
Perfectly.

431
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,630
- 我们快没时间了  - 好吧，带上她
- We're running out of time.  - All right, take her.

432
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,760
你必须向北走，远北地区
You must go north, far north.

433
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,430
去瓦尔道尔
Var Dohr.

434
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,600
别
No.

435
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,730
背叛的父亲和儿子
Father and son united in treason.

436
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,600
带上莎伦娜
Carry on with Selene.

437
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,730
这里交给我了
I'll deal with them.

438
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
加油
Come on.

439
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,840
现在！快走！
Go! Now!

440
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,130
不！
No!

441
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,390
黎明警报，六十秒后日出
Dawn alert. 60 seconds to sunrise.

442
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,270
继续走啊，外面的太阳会把你化为灰烬…
Go ahead. The sun will burn you to ashes out there...

443
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,440
或者你可以在这里体面点死去
or you can die with some grace in here.

444
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,550
他们居然可以在阳光下行走
They can walk in the sun.

445
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,530
你需要进食，你已经失血过多了
You need to feed. You've lost too much blood.

446
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,390
那个孩子…因为他帮助了你的孩子
That child... Because he helped that child of yours.

447
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,970
我的儿子已经死了，死了
My son is dead. Dead.

448
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,220
大卫
David.

449
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,350
带上她
Take her now.

450
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,140
你必须向北走，去瓦尔道尔
You must go north. Var Dohr.

451
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,520
现在！快走！
Go! Now!

452
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,830
谢谢你
Thank you.

453
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,420
我很抱歉你失去了你的父亲
I'm very sorry that you lost your father.

454
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,380
他英勇的战斗到了最后
He put up a valiant fight.

455
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,140
奇怪的是感觉失去一个你好像从未真正了解的人
It's strange to lose someone you feel like you never really knew.

456
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,220
我对我母亲有同样的感觉，但是…
I feel the same about my mother, but...

457
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,480
我几乎没有她的记忆
I have almost no memory of her.

458
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,230
我和伊芙
And I of Eve.

459
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,320
我不想她
I didn't want her.

460
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,320
我不了解她
I didn't know her.

461
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
我现在也失去她了
And now I've lost her.

462
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,660
你为什么坚持说你已经失去她了？
Why do you insist on saying that you've lost her?

463
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,740
她让我承诺我永远不要去找她…
She made me promise I would never look for her...

464
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,620
就当自己没有个女儿
that I would never consider myself having a daughter.

465
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,620
她是对的
And she was right.

466
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,960
这样对我爱的人没有好处
Nothing good has come to anyone I love.

467
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,880
你的家人，和你就是我剩下的全部
You're family, and you're all I have left.

468
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,300
那么，还真的是麻烦你了
Well, then, you really are in trouble.

469
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,220
你需要休息
You need to rest.

470
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,230
莎伦娜很显然是在与狼人结盟
Selene's clearly in league with the Lycans.

471
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,490
背叛的汤玛士和大卫也是同谋
Thomas and David were complicit in this treachery.

472
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,070
他们能在阳光下行走，这就足够证明他们勾结狼人了
They walked in the sun. This alone is evidence of Lycan collusion.

473
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,200
莎伦娜必须从我们的历史中抹去
Selene must be wiped from the pages of our proud history.

474
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,410
亚历克西娅
Alexia.

475
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,500
- 我们要报仇了  - 拭目以待
- We shall avenge our fallen.  - See to it that you do.

476
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,740
- 你用了多少毒药？ - 我认为最好宁可…
- How much nightshade did you use?  - I thought it best to err on the side...

477
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,320
瓦尔加，我说话的时候你在想什么？
Varga, what have we said about you thinking?

478
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,490
毒药会消融的
The poison will dissipate.

479
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,950
我需要的是纯净的的血，我现在就需要
I need this blood untainted, and I need it now.

480
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,250
这个不能操之过急
It cannot be rushed.

481
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,120
这必须顺其自然
It must run its course.

482
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,250
绝对是这辆车
It's definitely the car.

483
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,840
但是没有他们的踪迹
But no sign of where they went.

484
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,050
扩大范围到整个城市
Spread out across the city.

485
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,800
搜索所有地方
Search everywhere.

486
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,480
本列车将停留在四号站台
The train at platform four terminates at this station.

487
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,870
去北方
Northbound.

488
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,180
我将会更加的强大…
I will be more powerful...

489
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,350
比卡西乌斯还强…
than Cassius...

490
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,690
比这个议会的任何一个都强大
than any vampire in this coven.

491
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,300
- 搜寻的如何了？ - 莎伦娜和大卫他们向北方去了
- What news of the search?  - Selene and David are heading north.

492
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,750
- 他们当然向北了  - 夫人？
- Of course they are.  - Your Grace?

493
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,910
他们会跑到仅存的议会…
They will run to the only remaining coven...

494
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,290
庇护他们的议会：瓦尔道尔，北欧堡垒
to afford them safe haven: Var Dohr, the Nordic fortress.

495
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,210
但是瓦尔道尔只是个传说
But Var Dohr is only a legend.

496
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,920
我不会给它如此高的评价
I would not give it such an elevated status.

497
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,510
那是一个寒冷的，沉闷的前哨，都是可怜的和爱好和平的懦夫
It is a frigid, dreary outpost full of pathetic, peace-loving cowards.

498
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,060
你说的好像你已经去过那里
You speak of it as if you have actually been there.

499
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,520
当维克托陪着莎伦娜浪费时间的时候你认为我在哪里？
Where do you think I was when Viktor wasted years with Selene?

500
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,400
自己做好准备
Prepare yourself.

501
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,360
路途遥远，我需要你单独完成任务
The journey's long, and I need you to take it alone.

502
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,650
我必须确认叛徒在那…
I must be certain the traitor's there...

503
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,740
在我冒着风险从议会派出一整队的死亡行者之前
before I risk sending a full squad of Death Dealers so far from this coven.

504
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,610
你要更小心点
You need to be more careful.

505
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,910
你要再温柔点
You need to be more gentle.

506
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,120
- 你找到莎伦娜了？ - 是的
- Have you found Selene?  - Yes.

507
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,330
她确实前往北欧的议会了
She is headed for the Nordic Coven.

508
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,460
为此我将不惜一切
I risk everything for this.

509
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,590
- 为了你，为了我们  - 亲爱的，我知道
- For you, for us.  - I know, my love.

510
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,050
为了力量萨米拉越来越疯狂了
Semira grows more insane for power with each day.

511
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,850
必须阻止她
She must be stopped.

512
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,020
每一天，我越加害怕如果我们被发现她会怎么办
And every day, I fear more what she will do if we are discovered.

513
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,650
没有纯混血我不能进攻东方议会
I cannot attack the Eastern Coven without the blood of the hybrid.

514
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,690
它太强大了，即使对我种族来说
It's too strong, even for my horde.

515
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,450
莎伦娜…
Selene...

516
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,330
她是狼人和吸血鬼一样关键的未来
She is the key to the futures of Lycans and vampires alike.

517
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,750
你必须拥有她
You shall have her.

518
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,320
瓦尔道尔就在山的那一边
Var Dohr is just beyond that ridge.

519
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,150
人都去哪里了？
Where is everyone?

520
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,610
小心点
Watching.

521
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,620
我们寻求庇护…
We come seeking sanctuary...

522
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,410
不是来争斗的
not to fight.

523
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,870
那么你来对地方了
Then you've come to the right place.

524
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,710
我叫莉娜
My name is Lena.

525
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,720
跟我来
Follow me.

526
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,640
刚才发生什么了？
What was that?

527
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,720
某种小把戏吧
Some kind of trick.

528
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,370
你一定莎伦娜吧
You must be Selene.

529
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,380
伟大的死亡行者真是来寻求和平的吗？
Does the great Death Dealer truly come in peace?

530
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,010
- 是的  - 那这另一位呢？
- I do.  - And what about this one?

531
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,380
这位是大卫，汤玛士儿子
This is David, son of Thomas.

532
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:12,050
一个我很多，很多年未见的人了
Who I haven't seen for many, many years.

533
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,770
请原谅我的失礼
You must excuse the attention.

534
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:20,310
设计之初，我们的议会不能接待这么多的客人
Our coven doesn't receive many guests, by design.

535
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
我们随心所欲…
We do as we wish...

536
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,230
- 而不是像别人那样生活  - 那狼人呢？
- not as others would have us do.  - And what of the Lycans?

537
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,730
离的太遥远了他们没有注意到…
We are too far removed for them to take notice...

538
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,110
即使他们注意到了，这里的气候环境对温血的狼人来说是巨大的障碍
and even if they did, our climate is quite an obstacle to warm-bloods.

539
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,620
如果没有你母亲的恩准…
This coven wouldn't exist...

540
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,370
- 就没有这个议会了  - 你认识我母亲？
- without your mother's grace.  - You knew my mother?

541
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,160
所有吸血鬼都认识她，我的孩子
All vampires do, my boy.

542
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,660
不对，我的母亲出身卑微，她在分娩我后死亡了
No. My mother was low-born. She died giving birth to me.

543
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,170
那是谎言，你会发现，旨在保证真正的血统的安全
A falsehood, you will find, designed to keep your true lineage safe.

544
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,790
- 那她还活着？ - 不
- Is she still alive?  - No.

545
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,300
她的死亡对我们来说是个可怕的打击
And her death was a terrible blow to our kind.

546
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,130
我们举行了整整持续一个月的哀悼仪式
The mourning ceremony we held lasted for an entire month.

547
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,010
这通常是留给一个尊贵血统的荣誉…
Such an honor is usually reserved for a high-born...

548
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,810
- 一个伟大的长老  - 是的
- a Grand Elder.  - Yes.

549
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,020
- 艾梅莉亚  - 是的
- Amelia.  - Yes.

550
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,690
我的母亲怎么会是大长老…
How could a Grand Elder have been my mother...

551
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,060
而且我从未听说？
and I not been told?

552
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,570
我有东西给你
I have something for you.

553
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,880
你的父亲最伟大的作品，纯银打造
Your father's greatest work, infused with silver.

554
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,630
狼人们见到了都会胆怯
The Lycans will cower from the very sight of it.

555
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,340
- 它真漂亮  - 汤玛士知道有一天…
- It's beautiful.  - Thomas knew that one day...

556
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,760
你会被敌我双方的所围堵…
you would be beset by enemies on both sides...

557
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:35,970
他是对的
and he was right.

558
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,520
大卫，这意味着你才是合法的东方议会继承人
David, this means that you are the rightful heir of the Eastern Coven.

559
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,480
你的父亲和母亲花了好几个月…
Your mother and father spent many months...

560
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,770
加强了这里的安全
within the safety of these walls.

561
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,770
维克托起了怀疑
Viktor grew suspicious.

562
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,070
然后你的父亲就把你…
Then your father spirited you away...

563
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,740
在萨米拉和她的军队赶来之前带走了
before Semira arrived with her troops.

564
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,120
- 那我的母亲呢？ - 她回到了东方议会
- And what of my mother?  - She returned to the Eastern Coven.

565
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,450
她当时的眼神…
The light in her eyes...

566
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,500
不要说的好像她特意做出了牺牲一样
Don't try and fabricate some kind of martyrdom for her.

567
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,430
我更喜欢这样诚实地评价她的决定
I prefer a more honest appraisal of her decision.

568
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,920
她为了委员会，放弃了她唯一的儿子
She abandoned her only son for the sake of her precious council.

569
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,460
- 拿回去  - 大卫
- Take it.  - David.

570
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,210
大卫
David.

571
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,930
艾梅莉亚让我把这个给他
Amelia asked me to give him this.

572
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,900
你需要什么吗？
What do you need?

573
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,870
不需要，只想自己静一静
Nothing. I just need to be left alone.

574
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,580
是的，这种感觉我知道
Yes, I know the feeling.

575
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,160
为什么我父亲不告诉我有关母亲的事？
Why didn't my father tell me about my mother?

576
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,210
我不是很了解你的父亲…
I did not know your father well...

577
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,830
但我知道，他很害怕失去你
but I know that his greatest fear was to lose you.

578
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,710
似乎每一个家长都会让孩子失望
It seems it's the curse of every parent to disappoint their child.

579
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,170
- 至少你为了你的孩子在战斗  - 是的，但也失去了
- At least you fought for your child, Selene.  - Yes, and lost.

580
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,840
你有血统继承权的，大卫，你的母亲是位长老
You have pure-blood heritage, David. Your mother was an Elder.

581
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,470
你的父母护你安全是有原因的
Your parents kept you safe for a reason.

582
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,430
他们保护你，希望有一天你能够领导家庭
They protected you so that one day you could lead.

583
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,900
这是你母亲留给你的礼物
Your mother left you a gift.

584
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,750
哦，你真是太好了，但我不需要饰品
Oh, that's very kind of you, but I have no use for jewelry.

585
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,990
这戒指不单单是礼物
The ring is not the gift.

586
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,860
它包含的是一个母亲的爱
It contains the gift: A mother's love.

587
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,030
有一滴她的血液
A single drop of her blood.

588
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,370
也许它可以帮助你做决定
Maybe it'll help you decide.

589
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,160
你来的正好
You're just in time.

590
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,450
- 来  - 这些是什么？
- Come.  - What is this?

591
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,790
- 中间的是艾丽萨  - 她死了吗？
- Valissa, the in-between place.  - Is she dead?

592
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,870
没有
No.

593
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,540
她是…
She is...

594
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,460
一种生华
becoming.

595
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,960
她服下了毒药
She took a poison.

596
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,130
带着她去往神圣的地方
It allows her to visit the Sacred World.

597
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:22,800
当她归来时，她会用新的眼光看待这个世界
When she returns, she will see this world with new eyes.

598
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,810
这么做我不明白
I don't understand what this is.

599
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:28,140
我们早就知道有不只是这个世界
We have long known there is more than just this world.

600
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,020
当我父亲第一次带我下来…
When my father first brought me down here...

601
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,650
就和你现在的感觉一样…
I felt as you do now...

602
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,820
我是我已经往返神圣的世界很多次了
but I have since been to the Sacred World many times.

603
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,900
我的眼睛看到了很多超越表面的事情
My eyes see beyond the surface of so many things.

604
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,580
- 我看到很多关于你的  - 比如？
- I see much about you.  - Such as?

605
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,370
我看到了你和狼人相爱…
I can see you've loved a Lycan...

606
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,660
- 杀死了一个吸血鬼长老，怀孕新生…  - 停
- killed a vampire Elder, and given birth...  - Stop.

607
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,380
我看到你已经失去了你的女儿…
I see you have lost your daughter...

608
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,010
这让你的内心深处非常的痛苦…
and how much pain this gives you deep inside...

609
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,130
并且你一直隐藏着它
where you will always hide it.

610
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,220
她是个特别的孩子
She's a special child.

611
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,680
会经历很多的战争…
Many battles will be fought...

612
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,520
最终失去她
and lost over her.

613
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,770
- 你还看到什么了？ - 黑暗
- What else do you see?  - Darkness.

614
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,690
关于我们所有人的
One that touches us all.

615
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:21,110
如果你想保证她的安全，你需要更进一步…
If you want to keep her safe, you will need to go further...

616
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,240
甚至要比你现在达成的名声更进一步
than even a warrior of your renown has ever ventured before.

617
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:28,160
我见识了这么多的战争…
I have seen so much war...

618
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,410
和这么多的杀戮
so much killing.

619
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,750
我已经无法忍受
I cannot bear more.

620
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,290
你在这里感受到的和平是真实的
The peace you will feel here is real.

621
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,920
它渗入肌肤，安抚你的灵魂
It seeps into your skin and comforts your soul.

622
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,090
告诉我关于这个神圣的地方
Tell me about the Sacred World.

623
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,010
水即是路
The water is the path.

624
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,440
艾梅莉亚！
Amelia!

625
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,830
我的儿子民大卫
I name our son David.

626
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,330
大卫
David.

627
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,540
有一天，你会明白的
One day, you will understand.

628
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,210
我非常的抱歉
I'm so sorry.

629
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,940
有狼人！发出警报！
Lycans! Sound the alarm!

630
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:42,190
关上门！
Close the doors!

631
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,280
快！
Move!

632
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:54,500
就如我说的和平，战争已经跟随着你
Just as I spoke of peace, war has followed you here.

633
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,870
保护好自己
Protect your own.

634
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,750
我必须找到大卫
I must find David.

635
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,890
- 我们不得不让你离开  - 不，是我们把狼人引到这来的
- We have to get you away.  - No. We led the Lycans here.

636
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,390
我们不能让这些人因此而死
We can't let these people die.

637
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,330
快跑！
Run!

638
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,080
这边，伙计们
This way, men.

639
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,960
绕过去
Go around that side.

640
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,580
她在这
There she is.

641
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,480
你这害虫
You parasite.

642
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:27,860
快杀了我
Just do it.

643
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,330
马略斯
Marius.

644
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,630
终于
At last.

645
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,070
在你右边！
On your right!

646
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,070
我对你期望更多
I expected more from you.

647
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,130
告诉我你的女儿在哪里
Tell me where your daughter is.

648
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,510
我不知道
I don't know.

649
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,130
莎伦娜，我想要的只是她的血
Selene, all I want is her blood.

650
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:12,310
只有她才能结束这场战争
Only she can end this war.

651
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,940
我向你保证她不会有生命危险
I give you my word she will not be killed.

652
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:45,930
你到底是什么？
What are you?

653
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,100
告诉他你女儿在哪里…
Tell him where she is...

654
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,520
这样才能结束这无尽的杀戮
and all this butchery will be over forever.

655
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,730
我真不知道
I don't know.

656
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,520
你撒谎
Lies.

657
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:23,820
他们走了
They've gone.

658
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,370
麦可
Michael.

659
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,200
- 我放了你们  - 看这眼睛
- I freed you.  - Look at the eyes.

660
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:32,580
我是谁？你知道我是谁吗？
Who I am? Do you not know who I am?

661
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,670
- 我的女儿  - 我不需要你
- My daughter.  - I don't want you.

662
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,580
不要来找我
Don't look for me.

663
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,550
她说的是实话
She's telling the truth.

664
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,970
她也不知道
She doesn't know.

665
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,640
我的时间结束了
My time is done.

666
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,410
他们在撤退
They are retreating.

667
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,130
我的时间不多了
I'm running out of time.

668
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,630
现在我们必须进攻东方议会
We must strike against the Eastern Coven now.

669
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,920
你知道你必须要做什么
You know what you must do.

670
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:38,150
水即是路
Water is the path.

671
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:11,800
莎伦娜
Selene.

672
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,360
赞美天…
Praise the day...

673
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,570
在结束时
when it ends.

674
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:33,280
赞美冰…
Praise the ice...

675
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:35,080
在冰封时
when it holds.

676
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,080
赞美剑…
Praise the sword...

677
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,710
在杀戮时
when it kills.

678
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,670
赞美生命…
Praise the life...

679
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,550
蕴育永生
that has lived.

680
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,930
是时候了
It's time.

681
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,980
力量
Power.

682
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,650
如此诱惑而简单的东西
Such a seductively simple thing.

683
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:08,280
拥有你就拥有了一切
Either you have it all or you have nothing.

684
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:47,730
多么的迷人
How fascinating.

685
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,570
艾梅莉亚…
Amelia...

686
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,700
水即是路
The water is the path.

687
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:11,090
大卫，你应该留在这儿
You should stay here, David.

688
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,470
这里将是你的家
This can be your home.

689
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,050
马略斯正在向东
Marius is heading east.

690
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:16,760
现在没有什么能阻止他
There's nothing stopping him now.

691
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:20,350
我的子民还在他的围攻之下
And my people are beset with enemies on all sides.

692
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,600
我怎么能在这生活…
How can I stay here and live...

693
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,310
- 让他们死吗？ - 他们需要一个领袖
- while they die?  - They need a leader.

694
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,460
门口安全，检查周边
Gate secure. Perimeter check.

695
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,920
想我吗？
Miss me?

696
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,420
- 东边安全  - 检查西边
- East gate is clear.  - West gate clear.

697
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,380
开始周边扫描
Commencing perimeter sweep.

698
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:55,210
安防系统
确认关闭

699
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,550
授权完成
Access granted.

700
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,180
带了什么消息回来？
What news do you bring?

701
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:05,730
一场屠杀
A massacre.

702
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,270
狼人攻击了瓦尔道尔堡垒
The Lycans attacked the fortress of Var Dohr.

703
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,900
狼人在北方
Lycans in the north.

704
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,320
北欧议会被打的措手不及
The Nordic Coven was taken completely by surprise.

705
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:20,240
- 大量的吸血鬼被杀  - 莎伦娜也死了吗？
- Dozens of vampires have been killed.  - Was Selene amongst them?

706
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:23,790
死了，被马略斯亲手杀死
Dead. Killed by Marius himself.

707
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:26,370
真是莎伦娜去了哪，麻烦就跟到哪啊
Wherever Selene goes, trouble surely follows.

708
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,920
- 大卫呢？ - 我不知道
- What of David?  - I do not know.

709
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,340
我只想早点赶回来，也许可以帮上什么忙
I only wished I had arrived sooner. I might have helped in some way.

710
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,170
恩，你确实帮上很多忙了
Well, you've helped in so many ways.

711
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:39,600
足够了，你所做的就像我希望和计划的
You've done exactly as I hoped and planned, if not more.

712
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,890
你看，信息就是力量
You see, information is power.

713
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,030
我热情地收集它们
And I collect it with a passion.

714
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:05,330
谢谢你带着马略斯去了北欧议会
Thank you for leading Marius to the Nordic Coven.

715
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,080
你的狼人爱人…
Your Lycan lover...

716
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,880
对他一时的成功一定感到高兴
must be delighted with his momentary success.

717
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,260
你以为我不知道
You thought I didn't know.

718
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:20,180
愚蠢的女孩
Foolish girl.

719
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,560
黎明警报，六十秒后日出
Dawn alert. 60 seconds to sunrise.

720
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:39,820
狼人灾难性的摧毁了整个委员会
The Lycan scourge destroyed an entire coven.

721
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:42,120
躲在这些墙后面增加了他们的优势
To hide behind these walls increases their advantage.

722
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,160
我们不能和马略斯开战
We cannot take the war to Marius.

723
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,500
那我们就应该躲在这些安全墙里…
Should we cower in the safety of these walls...

724
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:50,250
- 好让他逐个的干掉我们？ - 注意你阴险的言语，萨米拉
- while he picks us off one by one?  - Curb your insidious comments, Semira.

725
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,960
这个议会已经存在十五个世纪了
This coven has held for 15 centuries.

726
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:56,800
- 它将继续存在  - 我希望你能展示实力…
- It will hold for 15 more.  - I hoped you would show strength...

727
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,550
虽然我也愿意和有能力胜任
though I was willing to settle for competence.

728
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,510
但是我错了
I was wrong.

729
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:10,270
你这是什么意思
What is the meaning of this?

730
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,150
如果这个委员会太弱不能采取行动…
If this council is too weak to take action...

731
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:14,940
那就让我来吧
it is my duty to do so.

732
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:19,990
你被解除了你作为议会长老的职责并立即生效
You are relieved of your duties as council members effective immediately.

733
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:25,450
归来的叛徒
The traitor returns.

734
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:30,000
哦，你是一个在这时候出现的傻瓜
Oh, you are a fool to show your face here.

735
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,790
我会让你为你所做的一切付出代价的，萨米拉
I will make you pay for what you've done, Semira.

736
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:35,370
我们在这交谈的时候马略斯和他的军队正向这边而来
Marius and his army are heading this way as we speak.

737
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:38,800
- 我来拯救我的子民  - 你的子民？
- I come to save my people.  - Your people?

738
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,970
杀了他，杀了他
Kill him. Kill him.

739
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,550
你为了成为你种族的守护者不惜一切代价…
You aspire to be the protector of your bloodline...

740
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,180
然而，你为了追求权力杀了自己的族人
yet you kill your own kind in pursuit of power.

741
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:47,390
现在结束了
It ends now.

742
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:51,640
我是大卫，大长老艾梅莉亚的儿子
I am David, son of the great Elder Amelia.

743
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,060
我是这个议会的合法继承人
And I am the rightful heir to this coven.

744
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,530
艾梅莉亚没有儿子
Amelia had no son.

745
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:01,860
嗯，她有远见…
Well, she had the foresight...

746
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:04,370
知道我说的会受到质疑
to know that my claim would be challenged.

747
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:07,030
给委员会的
For the council.

748
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,640
艾梅莉亚
Amelia.

749
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,440
他说的是真的
His claim is true.

750
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:44,860
大卫是最后的纯净血统
David is the last of the purebloods.

751
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:49,370
无所谓的，你们寡不敌众
Irrelevant. You are outnumbered and outgunned.

752
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,700
瓦尔加，你的命令仍然存在，杀了他
Varga, your orders still remain. Kill him.

753
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,840
- 我说“杀了他”  - 不
- I said, "Kill him."  - No.

754
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,300
你发誓为我效忠
You swore to serve me.

755
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:06,640
我发誓要保护这屋子里的领导人
I swore to protect the leader of this house.

756
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:08,430
异常检测
Breach detected.

757
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,270
- 安全系统激活  - 是狼人，他们来了
- Security system engaged.  - Lycans. They're here.

758
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,180
在议会审判她前锁好她
Lock her away until she can be judged by the council.

759
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:17,940
安全系统激活，异常检测，安全系统…
Security system engaged. Breach detected. Security system...

760
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:23,320
- 她想的战斗来了  - 瓦尔加，我仍然可以原谅你
- She gets her damn war after all.  - Varga, you can still be forgiven.

761
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:24,700
堵住她的嘴
Gag her as well.

762
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,930
快，把卡车开过来，抬走
Come on, move that truck. Move it.

763
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,400
注意你的枪口！
Watch your angles!

764
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,320
出发！
Let's go!

765
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,300
坚守你的位置
Hold your positions.

766
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:15,720
- 在楼梯上！ - 在你后面！
- On the staircase!  - Behind you!

767
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,690
- 撤退！ - 撤退！
- Fall back!  - Retreat!

768
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,290
到栏杆后面！
Behind the balustrades!

769
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:40,330
干掉他们！
Take them out!

770
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,510
- 快走！ - 走，走，走！
- Come on!  - Move, move, move!

771
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:58,390
抬过来！
Move it!

772
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:08,320
该死的
Fuck.

773
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,860
准备瞄准！
Aim at the ready!

774
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:15,490
开火！
Fire!

775
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,980
开火！
Fire!

776
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,080
躲开阳光！
Hide from the light!

777
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,130
跑！
Run!

778
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:10,630
走！
Move!

779
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:14,340
射击，射击！
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

780
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:45,560
这不可能
Impossible.

781
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,730
我看到你死了
I saw you dead.

782
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:48,350
我来了
I'm here.

783
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,060
我起死回生了
I brought backup.

784
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,450
他们太多了
There are too many of them.

785
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:23,740
我已经把你杀了的
I've already killed you.

786
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,330
马略斯！
Marius!

787
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:21,190
- 马略斯  - 别
- Marius.  - Please.

788
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,320
我希望你父亲能活着看到
I wish your father was alive to see this.

789
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:11,280
他可笑的以为你能统治这个议会…
His ridiculous dream of you ruling this coven...

790
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:13,280
这是如何害死你的
will be the very thing that kills you.

791
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,460
没打中
Missed.

792
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:31,800
哦，果然有效
Oh, it worked.

793
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,210
我们是同类
I'm one of you.

794
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,540
不！别！不！
No! No! No!

795
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:19,730
你杀了麦可
You killed Michael.

796
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:25,020
这是他最后留下的东西
This is the last of him.

797
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,490
你的家人，和你就是我剩下的全部
You're family, and you're all I have left.

798
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:14,820
你知道我是谁吗？
Do you not know who I am?

799
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:29,100
你们的首领已经死了
Your leader is dead.

800
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:35,150
带着你们的人，离开
Take your wounded. Leave.

801
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,280
滚！
Leave!

802
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,250
我们在最黑暗的时刻进行了最伟大的战斗
We fought our greatest battle in our darkest hour.

803
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:52,800
吸血鬼和狼人经过几个世纪的战争…
After centuries of war between vampire and Lycan...

804
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,920
这可能是一个和平时代了
this may at last be a time of peace.

805
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,800
我们必须再次照顾我们的伤员…
We must once again tend to our wounded...

806
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,430
和纪念逝者
honor our fallen.

807
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,020
我们最后的两个组织必须寻找力量和团结…
Our final two covens must find strength and unity...

808
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,980
治愈并从灰烬中重生
to heal and rise from the ashes.

809
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:16,820
我的旅程现在也算圆满了
My journey has now come full circle.

810
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:21,240
曾经被遗弃的人，现在我是三大长老之一
Once an outcast, I am now one of three chosen Elders.

811
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,580
从被追杀到最高荣誉
From hunted to the highest honor.

812
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:51,520
我已经活了一千年
I have lived 1000 years.

813
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,110
我可能再多活个一千年…
I may live 1000 more...

814
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:56,610
或者我明天会死去
or I may die tomorrow.

815
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:01,450
但我不再惧怕死亡…
But I no longer fear death...

816
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:04,530
因为我已死过一次了
for I have known it once already.

817
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:08,870
我重生了…
I am reborn...

818
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,000
我用双眼看到了神圣的世界…
and my eyes have been opened to the Sacred World...

819
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:15,000
和对未来的窥视
and to the promise of what is yet to be.

820
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,840
这不是开始
There is no beginning.

821
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:22,130
也不是结束
There is no end.

822
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,680
而是只是过程
There is only becoming.
