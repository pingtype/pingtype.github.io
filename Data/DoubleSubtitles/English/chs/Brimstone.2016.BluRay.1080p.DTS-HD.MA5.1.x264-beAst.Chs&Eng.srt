3
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,210
时光荏苒
As life progresses,

4
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,260
影像迷离
images blur.

5
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,310
独留回忆
All that remains are memories.

6
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,730
真真假假
Some of them true,some of them false.

7
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,610
我清楚地记得她
I remember her well.

8
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,510
至少我觉得是这样
At least I think I do.

9
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,080
她是一名战士
She was a warrior.

10
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,250
在旧时代 你必须
In the old century you had to be,

11
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,020
为生存而战
in order to survive.

12
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:14,000
悍 女

13
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,810
第一章
启示

14
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,920
吸气 呼气 就像她那样
Breathe in and out, the way she does.

15
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,960
现在 用力 快
And now, push. Now!

16
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,070
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

17
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,010
再见
Bye.

18
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,940
你过几天再来 对吗
See you in a couple of days, right?

19
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,130
妈妈
Mama...

20
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,230
走吗
Are you coming?

21
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,670
- 早上好  - 你好 莉兹
- Good morning!  - Hi, Liz!

22
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:35,920
给
Here.

23
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,960
我不准

24
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,630
莉兹 这孩子得学怎么开枪
Liz, the boy's gotta learn how to shoot.

25
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,820
我不允许

26
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,380
他不管怎么样都会学的
Well, he's gonna do it anyway.

27
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,090
在这学总好过偷偷在别处学
Better here than sneaking off somewhere else.

28
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,100
- 你吓到你母亲了  - 她不是我母亲
- You're scaring your mother.  - She ain't my mother.

29
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,070
要防备假先知
Beware of false prophets,

30
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,700
他们到你们这里来 外面披着羊皮
who come to you in sheep's clothing...

31
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,710
里面却是残暴的狼
For inwardly, they are ravening wolves.

32
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,280
耶稣是保护你们和你们家人
Jesus is the Shepherd who protects you

33
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,850
不受那些狼所害的牧羊人
and your family from those wolves.

34
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,520
而我是他的犬
And I am his dog.

35
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,650
让迷途羔羊
The sheepdog that gets the lambs back on track

36
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,390
重回正轨的牧羊犬
when they stray off the path.

37
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,430
你们有些人已经走入歧途了 对吗
And some of you have strayed, haven't you?

38
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,900
你们是怎么想的
What do you people think?

39
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,300
觉得神会同意?
That god is well disposed towards you?

40
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,140
我就直说吧
Let me set things straight.

41
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,240
应当离群的那些去的是地狱
Those who deserve it, go to hell.

42
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,780
我能跟你们讲讲地狱
I could tell you about hell.

43
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,880
讲讲那里的火焰
About its flames.

44
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,450
讲讲那里的痛苦
About the pain.

45
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,020
我肯定你们已经试想过那里的样子
I'm sure you people have tried to imagine what it's like.

46
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,360
实则更糟
It's worse.

47
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,300
惩罚要来临了
Retribution is coming.

48
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,900
现在我们唱歌吧
Now, let us join in singing.

49
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,910
与主同行
Abide with me.

50
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,130
你没事吧
You all right?

51
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,190
谢谢
Thank you.

52
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,660
你好 先生 这是我女儿 珊慕
How're you doing, sir? This is my daughter, Sam.

53
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,070
我儿子 马修 还有…
My boy, Matthew. And, uh...

54
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,500
我妻子
My wife.

55
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,070
你去哪了
Where were you?

56
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,050
那个人不是本地的
That man is a stranger here,

57
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,820
他还不认识这里的人
he doesn't know anybody yet.

58
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,720
我还以为你会有点同情心
I'd have expected a little more compassion from you.

59
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,790
怎么了 怎么了 怎么了
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?

60
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,010
深呼吸 好吗
Just breathe, all right?

61
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,880
呼吸 深呼吸就好
Breathe, just breathe.

62
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,850
大家都出去 我们不需要凑热闹的
Everybody outside.We don't need no busybodies.

63
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,090
出去啊 快出去
Go on, get. Get out!

64
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,190
- 会没事的  - 内森 我觉得你最好也出去
- You'll be all right.  - Nathan, I think you better go outside too.

65
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,000
有些事是男人不该看的
Some things aren't meant for a man's eyes.

66
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,300
会没事的 对吗 莉兹
It's gonna be just fine, right, Liz?

67
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,370
你会照顾好她的 对吧
You're gonna take care of her, right?

68
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,470
保证?
Promise?

69
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,350
我要出去了 好吗 我爱你 我爱你
I'm going to be right outside, okay? I love you. I love you.

70
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,950
你照顾好她
You take care of her.

71
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,290
把你身后的门关上
Close the door behind you.

72
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,180
会没事的 亲爱的
It's gonna be all right, honey.

73
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,630
孩子的头太大了
The baby's head is too big.

74
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,030
什么意思
What's that supposed to say?

75
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,970
我们得在孩子和母亲之间做出选择
We're going to have to choose between the baby and the mother.

76
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
没法同时救两个
Can't save both of them.

77
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,770
必须都救
You have to.

78
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,640
你母亲说一切都会好的
Your mother said everything would be all right.

79
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,120
不要 我想待着 我想帮忙
No, I wanna stay. I wanna help.

80
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,160
嘿 里面怎么样了
Hey... how's it going in there?

81
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,700
一切都好吗
Everything all right?

82
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,050
是吗
Yeah?

83
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,460
用力 阿比 使出全力 加把劲
Push, Abby. Hard as you can now, come on!

84
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,310
好样的
Good girl!

85
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,320
孩子在哪
Where's the baby?

86
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,390
我想看看我的孩子 他在哪
I wanna see my baby. Where is he?

87
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,020
把我的孩子给我
Give me my baby!

88
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,750
这不是你的错
It ain't your fault.

89
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,520
耶和华赐予了 耶和华又拿走了
The lord gives and the lord takes away.

90
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,790
这和耶和华无关

91
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,500
这和牧师有关

92
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,370
牧师？
The reverend?

93
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,540
莉兹
Liz...

94
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,710
牧师是神的代表
The reverend is a man of god.

95
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,280
你所认为的并不是事实
You're seeing things that ain't there.

96
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,640
耶稣死后复活了
If Jesus came back to life after he was dead...

97
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,570
阿比盖尔的孩子不会吗
Couldn't that happen to Abigail's baby, too?

98
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,880
你能给我涂脸吗
Can you face-paint me?

99
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,050
你能帮我一下吗

100
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,570
我忙着呢 看不出吗
I'm doing something. Can't you tell?

101
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,200
我们来看下情况
We've come to see if everything's all right.

102
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,660
一切正常
Everything's just fine.

103
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,700
你们无需浪费时间
No reason for you folks to go wasting your time.

104
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,200
我们想亲眼看下
We'd like to look for ourselves.

105
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,670
最好不要 医生一小时后就到
Rather not. There's a doctor coming in an hour,

106
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,380
他看更好
it's better if he takes a look.

107
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,450
牧师安排的
The reverend arranged it.

108
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,430
你们好
Hello!

109
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,540
- 什么情况  - 莉兹
- What the hell?  - Liz!

110
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,480
莉兹
Liz!

111
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,810
下来 莉兹
You get down here, Liz!

112
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,750
下来
You get down here!

113
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,460
我要看到你的脸
I wanna see your face.

114
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,490
我要看到你的脸
I wanna see your face.

115
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,810
内森 别把气出在我儿子身上
Nathan! Don't take it out on my boy!

116
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,620
我们能好好谈谈
We can talk about this like decent folk!

117
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,920
我跟你没过节 伊莱
I got no quarrel with you, Eli!

118
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,850
我是来找你妻子的
I'm here for your wife.

119
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,420
她得为她的罪行受到惩罚
She's gotta be punished for her sins.

120
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,690
她得在火刑柱上被烧死
She's gotta burn at the stake, Eli!

121
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,430
理智些 内森
Try to be reasonable now, Nathan.

122
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,270
我理解你的悲痛 相信我
I know your sorrow, believe me.

123
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,000
我也失去过心爱之人 记得吗
I lost a loved one too, remember?

124
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,370
我知道你的悲痛让你失去了理智
I know you're out of your mind with grief,

125
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,410
但相信我 你的痛苦会过去的 就和我的一样
but believe me, your pain will pass, just like mine did!

126
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,350
我能很容易地接受你说的
I could accept that real easy,

127
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,420
只要那个没舌头的谋杀犯死在火刑柱上
as long as that tongueless murderess ends up at the stake!

128
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,690
我要她受到惩罚
I demand retribution!

129
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,930
你知道她做了什么吗 伊莱
You know what she did, Eli?

130
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,860
她杀了我的宝贝儿子
She murdered my baby boy.

131
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,000
就在他能受洗之前 她杀了他
Before he could even be baptized, she murdered him.

132
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,940
现在他会怎么样
What's gonna happen to him now?

133
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,620
你觉得他会找到救赎吗
Do you think he's gonna find salvation?

134
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
你知道她怎么做的吗 伊莱
You know how she did it, Eli?

135
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,930
我看过他
I seen him.

136
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,430
他的大脑外露
His brains had leaked out.

137
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
你妻子弄裂了他的头骨
Your wife broke his skull.

138
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,880
她破开了他的头骨
She cracked his skull wide open!

139
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,310
她该为此下地狱
She should go to hell for this!

140
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,490
够了
That will be enough.

141
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,660
你遭受着痛苦…
There has been suffering...

142
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,390
威士忌让你胡言乱语
It is the whiskey talking now.

143
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,530
当下解决不了问题
This is not the moment to solve this.

144
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,970
她该下地狱 牧师
She belongs in hell, reverend.

145
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,670
他伤到你了吗
Did he do you any harm?

146
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,000
不要让牧师进来

147
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,710
他刚刚帮我们脱离了困境
He just helped us out of a real fix.

148
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,610
我也能来一杯吗
Do I get one, too?

149
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,840
你还太年轻
You ain't old enough for that yet.

150
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,980
干嘛对这孩子这么苛刻
Why be so hard on the boy?

151
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,050
他为了保护家人才有所行动
He only acted to protect his family.

152
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,380
他这样做就是成年人了
That makes him an adult.

153
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,390
他母亲不希望他摆弄枪
His mother doesn't want him playing with guns.

154
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,620
年轻人想手持步枪是很自然的事
It's natural for a young man to want to hold a rifle in his hands.

155
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,130
我能把我这杯给马修喝吗
May I offer my glass to Matthew?

156
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,340
我想你该去睡觉了 马修
I think it's about time you went back to bed, Matthew.

157
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,280
- 爸爸  - 快 喝了
- Aw, dad!  - Come on, drink up.

158
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,200
如果那孩子
None of this would have happened

159
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,640
健康完好地被生下 就不会有这种事
if that baby had been born in perfect health.

160
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,270
但莉兹对此无能为力
But Liz couldn't do nothing about that.

161
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,240
她决定了谁生谁死
She decided who was to live and who was to die.

162
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,910
那个决定属于神 也只属于神
That decision belongs to god, and god only.

163
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,780
她为什么不把那个选择给留给他呢
Why did she not leave that choice up to him?

164
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,860
也许我该去把她带来
Maybe I should go fetch her.

165
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,740
我知道你在那里
I know you're there,

166
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,210
我也知道你能听到我说话
and I know you can hear me.

167
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,050
或许你没舌头
You may have no tongue,

168
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,180
但你的耳朵没问题
but there is nothing wrong with your ears.

169
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,450
你心中为什么会起疑
Why do doubts rise in your heart?

170
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,730
你为什么会烦恼
Why are you troubled?

171
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,300
你晚上怎么入睡的
How do you sleep at night?

172
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,770
做谋杀犯是什么感觉
How does it feel to be a murderess?

173
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,820
你知道我为什么来这里吗
Do you know why I'm here?

174
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,890
我是来惩罚你的
I'm here to punish you.

175
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,960
你爱这个家吗
Do you love this family?

176
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,160
我见过你女儿了
I've looked at your daughter.

177
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,400
她就快是个年轻女人了
She's almost a young woman already.

178
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,040
你在这啊
There you are.

179
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,700
我得走了
I must be going.

180
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,750
对内森请不要怀恨在心
Please don't bear a grudge against Nathan in your heart.

181
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,220
失去孩子是最难以承受的事
Losing a child is the worst thing a body can go through.

182
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,760
我刚跟你妻子也这么说了
I was just talking to your wife about that same thing.

183
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,060
你都没感谢他
You didn't even thank him.

184
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,260
实际上 你都没有跟他打招呼
Fact is, you didn't even say hello to him.

185
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,770
我们必须离开这里

186
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,260
莉兹 内森会恢复理智的
Liz, Nathan will come around.

187
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,850
对了 你知道吗
Right, you know what?

188
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,230
给我一两天时间
Give me a couple of days.

189
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,520
我找人来看管羊
I'll get someone to come in for the sheep...

190
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,150
然后我们去我爸那里待一段时间
And then we'll go up to my pa's for a bit.

191
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,090
反正那里就他一个人
He's all alone up there anyway.

192
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,290
爸爸
Dad?

193
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,600
爸爸
Dad?

194
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,750
待在这里

195
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,010
我要去谈谈 这得有个了结
I'm just going to talk. This has got to stop.

196
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,880
先是开枪打我们的窗户 现在又这样
First shootin' our windows up, now this.

197
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,010
驾 走吧
Yah! Come on!

198
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,120
驾 驾
Yah! Yah!

199
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,590
我要你和你母亲待在一起
I want you to stay with your mother.

200
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,860
她不是我母亲
She ain't my mother.

201
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,360
- 马修  - 你会需要我帮忙的
- Matthew!  - You're gonna need my help.

202
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,970
好吧 只要你别惹麻烦
All right, as long as you stay outside.

203
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,000
但我为什么不能进去玩呢
But why can't i just play inside?

204
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,210
我要你在我身旁

205
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:20,850
为什么
Why?

206
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,040
因为我说了算

207
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,200
我为什么不能帮忙
And why can't I help out?

208
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,690
别再问问题了 你待在这里唱唱歌

209
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,560
我觉得现在可以把遮眼布摘掉了
I think we can take that blindfold off, now.

210
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,260
但我保证过
But I promised.

211
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,660
你母亲不会介意
Your mother won't mind.

212
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,100
她有很多事要做
She has a lot to do.

213
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,640
好了 看见没
Here, see?

214
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,210
一切都会好的
Everything will be fine.

215
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,840
妈妈呢
And mama?

216
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,880
她得在谷仓干活
She had to work in the barn.

217
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,650
她不想你过去 记得吗
And she did not want you there, do you remember?

218
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,620
我想和你谈谈你的母亲
I would like to talk to you about your mother.

219
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,390
内森
Nathan!

220
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,330
他们搬走了
They've gone and moved.

221
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,080
莉兹
Liz?

222
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,450
你在哪
Where are you?

223
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,800
他带走了珊慕

224
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:01,190
别 内森离开了 阿比盖尔也是
No, no, Nathan's gone. And Abigail.

225
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,700
收拾好 搬走了
Packed up, moved out.

226
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,050
牧师 他把我锁在谷仓里

227
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,780
你去哪了
Oh! Where'd you get to, huh?

228
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,790
你吓到你母亲了
You scared your mother.

229
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,060
你让她担心死了
Had her worried sick.

230
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,200
要我给你涂脸吗

231
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:56,000
今天下午 你和牧师说了些什么

232
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,950
他说到我了吗

233
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,390
妈妈 你是邪恶的吗
Mama, are you evil?

234
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,260
牧师说你杀了一个人
The reverend said you murdered a man.

235
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,570
他说他是来惩罚你的
He says he's here to punish you.

236
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,740
要把你带回他来的地方
To take you back where he came from.

237
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,880
为什么
Why?

238
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,620
因为她爱你
Because she loves you.

239
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,220
开枪打死我
Shoot me.

240
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,190
在你身后
Behind you.

241
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,010
求你了
Please.

242
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,110
终结我的痛苦
Stop the pain.

243
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,500
带她们去爷爷那
Take them to grandpa.

244
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,050
妈妈 妈妈
Mama? Mama?

245
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,860
是那个牧师 他把我弄醒了
It was the reverend. He woke me up.

246
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,870
驾 驾
Yah! Yah!

247
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:31,880

My name's Joanna.

很高兴认识你
Well, it is a pleasure to meet you.

268
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,350
来 转一圈 让我看看你

- 莎莉  - 什么事
- Sally!  - Yeah.

271
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,490
你能弄杯冰柠水
Would you be so kind as to treat Joanna here

272
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,460
招待下这边的乔安娜吗
to a glass of cold lemonade?

273
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,630
当然可以 来吧 亲爱的

Lookie here! Fresh meat.

277
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,750
一口吞了 小姑娘
Swallow it right on down, girlie.

278
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,190
很快你就要吞别的东西了
Soon you'll be swallowing something else.

279
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,290
- 你叫什么 姑娘  - 乔安娜
- What's your name, girl?  - Joanna.

280
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,230
你爸爸带你来的吗
Did your daddy bring you here?

281
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,300
不是? 你确定吗
No? Are you sure?

282
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,900
难道他不是觉得你漂亮
Didn't he just think you were so good,

283
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,500
他得让这世上的其他人也知道?
he had to let the rest of the world in on it, too?

284
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,620
你以为你能去哪啊
Whoa, there now, where do you think you're going?

285
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,620
他们没带上我就走了
They're leaving without me!

286
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,910
没错 但别担心
Yes, they are, but don't you worry about a thing

287
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,860
因为从现在起 你就住这了 亲爱的
'cause from now on, this is where you live, darling.

Right here.

289
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:46,840

Now, come on now. Let's get you cleaned up.

290
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,580
没错
Yes.

291
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,150
嘘 嘘
Shh, shh.

292
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,980
爽 爽
Yeah, yeah!

293
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,230
所以那就是我们在这做的工作
So that's the work we do around here.

294
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,530
我们只要一直呻吟
And we do all the moaning and groaning

295
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,230
就能确保更快完事
because that makes sure it's over faster.

296
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,640
- 为什么  - 为什么 因为男人喜欢
- Why?  - Why? That's what men like.

297
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,210
那么…你出过血吗
So, um... You ever bled yet?

298
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,710
你两腿之间 亲爱的
'Twixt your legs, honey.

299
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,050
这没什么羞耻的 出过吧?
It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have, haven't you?

300
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:14,290
对吗 好吧 这暂且是
Yeah? Well, then, that's gonna be our little secret

301
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,790
我们的小秘密 好吗
for the time being, okay?

302
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,500
现在 你去睡吧
Now, you go to bed.

303
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,670
你是谁
And who are you?

304
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,410
你叫什么 姑娘
What's your name, girl?

305
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:03,520
乔安娜
Joanna.

306
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,310
弗兰克 跟她上楼什么价
Frank, what's it cost to go upstairs with this one?

307
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,180
拜托 弗雷德 你出不起
Come on now, Fred, you cannot afford her.

308
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,520
我不这么认为
Oh, I don't know about that.

309
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,820
今天我的牌运可他妈好了
I got pretty damn lucky at cards today.

310
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,720
嘿 伊士曼
Hey, eastman.

311
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,960
我欲火焚身 想和你做
I'm horny as hell and I feel like doing you!

312
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,260
给你免费来一炮怎么样
What would you say to a free ride, huh?

313
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,600
这可不是你说了算
That ain't yours to decide.

314
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,070
钱我自己出
I'll pay for it myself.

315
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,500
该死 莎莉 这种事你一直瞒着我 是吗
Damn, Sally, what, you been holding out on me now, huh?

316
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,410
这样可以 但她得看着
I'll go along with that. But then she gets to watch.

317
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,640
- 不行  - 那就算了
- No way.  - Then, it's no deal.

318
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,410
我觉得这是个好主意
Oh, it sounds like a fine idea to me.

319
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,010
我肯定这会很有教育意义
It'll be most educational, I'm sure.

320
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,800
怎么了 你不喜欢吗 宝贝
What's wrong, don't you like it, honeybunch?

321
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:06,460
爽
Oh, yeah.

322
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,380
打我
Hit me.

323
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,220
- 什么  - 打我
- What?  - Hit me!

324
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,010
不行 我不会那么做
No, I ain't gonna do that.

325
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,750
打我啊 该死的
Hit me, god damn it!

326
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,620
这样可不行 伊士曼
I'm not taking this, eastman.

327
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,650
再打我
Hit me again.

328
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,060
再打我
Hit me again!

329
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,800
别 别 别 别 别开枪
No, no, no, no, don't shoot!

330
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,200
别开枪 我没关系 乔安娜
Don't shoot. I don't mind it, Joanna.

331
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,470
这只是场游戏 对吧
It's just a game, right?

332
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,410
再动手我就开枪了
You do that again and I'm going to shoot.

333
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,540
请把枪放下
Please put the gun down.

334
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:48,810
你敢 继续对准我
Don't you ever. Just keep pointing it at me.

335
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,490
你敢放下枪试试
Don't you dare drop that gun on me.

336
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:02,630
这就对了 继续对准我
That's right. Keep pointing it at me.

337
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,660
你敢放下试试
Don't you dare.

338
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:09,000
我要掐死她
I'm gonna strangle the life out of her!

339
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,110
开枪打我啊
Shoot me!

340
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,650
动手啊 乔安娜 开枪打我 该死的
Do it, Joanna. Shoot me, god damn it!

341
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,690
开枪啊 该死 婊子
Shoot, god damn it, bitch!

342
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,010
我能看出你会是个不错的小妓女
You're gonna make a fine little whore, i can see that already.

343
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,920
我打赌你也能把我弄得非常干净
I just bet that you can make me real nice and clean too.

344
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,030
或许全世界把我们美丽的城市毕斯玛司
The whole world may see our fair city of bismuth

345
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,700
看成是索多玛和蛾摩拉
as a place of sodom and gomorrah,

346
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,570
但规矩在这里是管用的
but rules do apply here.

347
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:26,080
不准妓女射杀客人还不受惩罚
A whore cannot be allowed to shoot down her customers with impunity.

348
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,410
我哥哥经营地狱酒馆是为了
My brother runs the inferno as a place

349
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,050
让辛勤工作的矿工们
where hard-working miners

350
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,550
能找到应得的消遣
can find well-deserved recreation.

351
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,290
这必须保持下去
That must remain so,

352
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:36,720
也会保持下去
and so it will.

353
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,070
让此事警示所有人吧
Let this be an example.

354
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,320
别这样…
Come on now...

355
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,870
一个矿镇需要有组织的娱乐
A mining town has a need for organized entertainment.

356
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,310
我得让这里的客人感到安全
And I need to know that customers here feel safe.

357
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,300
所以我把我弟弟齐克带到了毕斯玛司
That's why I brought my brother Zeke to bismuth.

358
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,250
他是个好警长 这个镇配不上他
He's a better sheriff than this town deserves.

359
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,590
地狱酒馆的每个人都知道
Everybody at the inferno knows

360
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,220
一个姑娘哪怕抓伤了客人
that if a girl so much as scratches a customer

361
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,790
她都会受到惩罚
she's gonna be punished.

362
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,130
所以莎莉知道她会面临什么
So Sally knew what she had coming.

363
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,900
可他吊死她了
But he strangled her.

364
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:59,140
是啊…我知道 我也很难过
Yeah... I know, it hurt me too.

365
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,940
该死的 她是跟我最久的员工之一
Damn, she was one of my oldest employees.

366
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,910
但是规矩是规矩
But rules are rules.

367
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,120
你不守规矩 你就有罪
If you don't obey the rules, you're guilty.

368
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,250
你有罪 你就要付出代价
And if you're guilty, you're gonna pay.

369
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:15,590
你明白的 对吗
You understand that, don't you? Hmm?

370
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,290
告诉我你明白
Tell me you understand.

371
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,710
你知道我第一次跟女孩上床是几岁吗
You know how old i was when I first went to bed with a girl?

372
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,780
我二十一岁
I was 21.

373
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:41,810
二十一
Twenty-one.

374
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,980
那时齐克十四岁
While Zeke, he was 14.

375
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,910
而我还得偷看
I got to watch, though.

376
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,090
从窥孔里偷看他
I spied on him through the peephole.

377
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,790
那之前 我一直不理解其中的乐趣
I never did see what all the fuss was about.

378
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,730
也不理解大家所谈论的那些事
You know, what everybody talked about.

379
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,340
我理解不了
I couldn't see it.

380
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,810
你不再是个孩子了
You're not a child anymore.

381
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:16,050
我不是很久了
I haven't been for a long time.

382
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,000
是时候了
The time has come.

383
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,230
我会温柔的
I'm gonna be gentle.

384
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,420
就是这样
That's right.

385
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,530
帅哥 你好棒
Oh, stud, you sure are good.

386
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,460
乔安娜
Joanna!

387
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:07,930
弗兰克要决斗了
Frank is in a gunfight!

388
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:10,200
嘿 搞什么啊 我就快完事了
Hey, what the hell! I'm almost done.

389
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:17,790
你看到没
You see that?

390
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,880
下次让她一起来 你觉得如何
What do you say we have her join us next time?

391
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,010
他来了
Here he is.

392
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,860
这是我和弗兰克之间的事
This is just between me and frank.

393
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,900
我只要一场公平对决
All I want is a fair fight.

394
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,570
那你来这里干嘛
Then what are you doing here?

395
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,670
让他爽进地狱吧
Blow him to hell!

396
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,070
没错
Yeah!

397
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,910
我不是个暴力的人
I'm not a violent man.

398
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,310
我常和数字打交道
I usually work with numbers.

399
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,920
但现在我站在你面前
But now, I'm standing here in front of you

400
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,450
是要开枪打死你 弗兰克
to shoot you dead, frank.

401
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,790
我女儿因你而死
My daughter is dead because of you.

402
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,490
你这样的男人觉得自己的所作所为不会有后果
It's men like you who think their actions have no consequences,

403
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,500
你这样的男人在使这国家变样
who are making the country turn into what it's turning into.

404
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,970
所以为了我的女儿
So, for my daughter's sake,

405
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,940
为了每一个人的女儿
for every daughter's sake,

406
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,940
我不得不杀了你
I have to kill you.

407
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,310
因为我是一位父亲
Because I am a father.

408
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,910
所以你会数数
So you can count.

409
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:33,080
也会讲屁话
And you can sure as shit talk.

410
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,090
但我们都想知道的是
But what we all wanna know is,

411
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,420
你会开枪吗
can you shoot?

412
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,520
我们什么时候私奔
So, when do we elope?

413
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,920
去哪
Where to?

414
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,120
哪都行
Anywhere.

415
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,020
只要是我们能得到自由的地方
Wherever we can be free.

416
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,330
但我们在这也算自由
But we are free here. Sort of.

417
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,160
不算
No, we're not.

418
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,200
你知道的
And you know it.

419
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,370
给我涂脸
Face-paint me.

420
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,460
什么
What?

421
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:33,040
用你的手指涂我的脸
Paint my face with your fingers.

422
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:54,930
你让我想起了我的妻子
You, uh, remind me of my wife.

423
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:58,040
但你衣着更美 闻上去更香 长得更漂亮
But you dress better, you smell better, you look better.

424
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,100
谢谢
Thank you.

425
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,180
不准接吻
No fucking kissing.

426
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,620
我说了 不准接吻
I said, no kissing!

427
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:16,650
不准接吻 该死的
No kissing! God damn it!

428
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,790
你要请我喝酒还怎么
So, are you gonna buy me that drink, or what?

429

01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:30,070
今晚花了我很多钱
This evening has cost me a lot of money.

569
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,240
你的声音有什么问题吗 你不能说话吗
Is there something wrong with your voice? Can't you talk?

570
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,380
我能说话
Yes, I can.

571
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:50,220
你想要我给你跳舞吗
Would you like me to dance for you?

572
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,040
为了找到你 我不得不等待很久
I had to wait a long time to find you.

573
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,620
我非常失望 我想过很多情况 但不是这种
I am very disappointed. I had considered many things, but not this.

574
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,560
这就是你想要的吗
Is this what you wanted?

575
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,790
这就是你所追求的吗
What you looked for?

576
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,700
我已准备好原谅你所有的罪
I am prepared to forgive all your sins.

577
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,810
我也有罪
I have also sinned.

578
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:44,010
我会在地狱中被永远焚烧
I am going to burn in hell forever.

579
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:47,610
我放弃了去天堂的权利
I gave up the right to go to heaven.

580
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,150
但是你让我这么做的
But you made me do it.

581
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,680
只有你能拯救我
And only you can save me.

582
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,470
- 别这样  - 没错
- No.  - Yes.

583
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:11,300
我有罪是因为我们应该先完成仪式
I have sinned because we should have finished the ceremony first.

584
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,730
这是使徒保罗写在哥林多前书里的
Paul, the apostle, wrote it in the first corinthians.

585
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,690
- 帮帮我 乔安娜  - 我帮不了
- Help me, Joanna.  - I can't.

586
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,110
那我们两个都会下地狱
Then we shall both burn in hell.

587
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:21,180
我是来拯救你的 好让你能拯救我
I am here to save you, so that you can save me.

588
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,680
我会让你这么做的 你知道我会的
I will make you do it. You know I will.

589
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:28,620
我不会让你再那么做了
I won't let you do that again.

590
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,050
我会先杀了你
I'll kill you first.

591
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:34,830
我尝试了 你让我别无选择
I tried. You leave me no choice.

592
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:39,400
救命 来人啊
Help! Somebody... ah!

593
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,300
来人救命啊
Somebody, help! Ah!

594
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,670
- 你是我的 这是神的旨意  - 救命
- You are mine! It is god's will!  - Help!

595
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:46,470
救命
Help!

596
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,840
救命 来人啊
Help! Somebody!

597
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,080
出去
Get out!

598
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,680
你个贱人
You whore!

599
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,030
今晚你要跟我走
You're coming with me tonight.

600
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:03,940
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

601
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:08,080
你不会让我惹上麻烦 对吗
You're not gonna get me into trouble, are you?

602
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,320
你确定吗
Are you sure about this?

603
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,850
好了
All right.

604
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,270
我办不到
I can't do this.

605
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,080
你是伊丽莎白·布兰迪吗
Are you Elizabeth brundy?

606
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,060
你确定你要开始这段行程吗
Are you sure you're up to making this trip?

607
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,400
好运
Well, good luck.

608
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:14,670
别让人看到伤口 依然很新
Don't let anyone see that for a while. It's still pretty fresh.

609
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:22,300
第三章
起因

610
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,000
我们在天上的父

611
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,200
愿人都尊你的名为圣

612
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,350
愿你的国降临

613
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:07,850
愿你的旨意行在地上 如同行在天上

614
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,400
我们日用的饮食今日赐给我们

615
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,580
免我们的债
And forgive us our trespasses,

616
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:18,720
如同我们免了人的债
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

617
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,750
不叫我们遇见试探
And lead us not into temptation,

618
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:21,890
但救我们脱离凶恶
but deliver us from evil.

619
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:24,050
因为国度
For thine is the kingdom

620
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,320
权柄 荣耀 全是你的
and the power and the glory,

621
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,960
直到永远 阿门
forever and ever. Amen.

622
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,580
就今晚吧
Tonight.

623
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,190
乔安娜还是在讲荷兰语
Joanna is still speaking Dutch.

624
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:02,690
我要追究你的责任
I hold you responsible for that.

625
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:04,630
我会祈求耶和华的帮助
I'll pray for the lord's assistance.

626
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,500
作为妻子 你有你的职责
As a wife, you have your duties.

627
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:11,870
妻子对自己的身体没有主权
"The wife does not have authority over her own body

628
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:14,840
丈夫才有 请跟我来吧
"but yields it to her husband." Please come with me.

629
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:18,840
今晚不行
Not tonight.

630
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:23,480
你让我别无选择
You leave me no choice.

631
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:59,020
我们知道我们为什么来这里
We know why we came here.

632
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,520
这里是神的国度
This is god's nation.

633
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,690
耶和华给这个美丽的新国家赐予了他的恩典
The lord shed his grace on this beautiful new country.

634
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,460
这是我们的出埃及记
This was our exodus.

635
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,830
在这座丘陵上的城市
In this city on a hill,

636
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:14,500
我们将发展一个更纯粹的基督教
we will develop a purer form of christianity.

637
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:18,200
我们不是都同意
Hadn't we all agreed

638
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,370
抛开旧俗吗
to leave the old language behind?

639
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:24,810
我们不是都发誓要在这里做得更好吗
Hadn't we sworn to do things better over here?

640
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:28,440
新世界会把我们从旧世界的罪中解脱
The new world would free us from the sins of the old.

641
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:33,580
我们是人类的耀眼希望
We are the bright hope of humanity.

642
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,120
这里是应许之地
This is the promised land,

643
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:40,020
来到这里 我们就都成了神选之人
and by coming here, we have become his chosen people.

644
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:42,960
阿加莎
Agatha,

645
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:45,630
你能告诉大家你是怎么领受到召唤的吗
would you tell everyone how you received the calling?

646
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,500
我在家削土豆时
I was at home, peeling potatoes,

647
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,710
出现了巨大白光
when this huge white light appeared.

648
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:59,010
我看见白光中有个英俊的年轻男子
In that light, i saw a beautiful young man

649
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:01,180
有着白色翅膀
with white wings.

650
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,880
我问他是不是天使
I asked if he was an angel,

651
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:07,080
这个年轻男子点点头 露出了微笑
and the young man nodded and smiled.

652
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:11,450
阿里
Arie,

653
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:14,390
你能和我们分享一下你目睹的事吗
would you be so kind to share your story of witness with us?

654
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:21,630
我的差不多一样
For me, it was more or less the same thing,

655
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,370
但出现的不是男的
but it wasn't a man.

656
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:27,640
在我面前出现的是个美丽的年轻女子
It was a beautiful young woman who showed herself to me.

657
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:32,980
看见没 我们都是神选之人
You see? We are the chosen people.

658
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,350
显圣这种事并非在任何人身上
A visitation like that is not something that happens

659
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:37,610
都会发生 你必须争取它
to just anybody. You have to earn it.

660
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:42,220
安娜
Anna,

661
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,920
你能上前来吗
would you please come to the front?

662
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:04,440
你怎么说 安娜
What about you, Anna?

663
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,040
你领受到召唤了吗
Have you received the calling yet?

664
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:11,500
我还没受到这样的祝福
I have not been blessed in such a way.

665
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:17,420
在我们社区  每个成年人都领受到了召唤 而你却没有
In our community, everyone of age has received such a calling, you have not.

666
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,960
安娜 你做了什么让神如此愤怒
What did you do, Anna, to anger god this much?

667
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:28,800
我自己的妻子
My own wife,

668
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,170
没法受到神的青睐
who cannot find the lord's favor.

669
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,840
你让我感到耻辱
I am ashamed of you.

670
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:30,100
天父
Father,

671
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,980
我祈求我妻子对你和对我的爱会增加
I pray that my wife will grow in her love for you,and me.

672
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,830
愿她对我们的爱 注入所有真心
May she love us with all her heart,

673
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:40,200
所有灵魂 所有思想和所有努力
all her soul, all her mind, and all her might.

674
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,700
赐予我力量 引领她通向
Give me the strength to lead her to the salvation

675
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,530
你恩典下的救赎
provided by your grace.

676
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:47,200
以耶稣之名 阿门
In Jesus' name, amen.

677
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,550
亲爱的

678
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,300
我要死了

679
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:20,900
不会的 不会死

680
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:26,100
这很正常 你这岁数的姑娘都会出现这样的情况

681
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:29,850
为什么

682
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:36,580
你现在是女人了 乔安娜

683
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:40,750
你的身体已做好生孩子的准备

684
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,660
你必须洗洗你女儿
You must wash your daughter.

685
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:50,990
她不洁净了
She is unclean.

686
01:28:58,370 --> 01:29:00,770
但他从不帮一点忙
But he never raises a finger to help out.

687
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:05,240
这是女人的命运
It's a woman's fate.

688
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,540
谁说的
Says who?

689
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:08,840
圣经
Says the Bible.

690
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,810
这不公平
It's not fair.

691
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,520
你父亲是一名教士
Your father's a man of the cloth.

692
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,120
他侍奉神 尘世的家务杂活都留给了他的妻子
He serves god and leaves earthly chores to his wife.

693
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:22,360
你想干嘛
What do you want?

694
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,430
让我们单独待会儿 我得和这姑娘谈谈
Leave us alone, i have to talk to the girl.

695
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:40,280
你母亲跟你说了成为女人意味着什么吗
Has your mother told you what it means to be a woman?

696
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,130
说了
Yes.

697
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,680
这血已渗入你的生活
And the blood has penetrated into your life

698
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,170
已驱走你的纯洁
and driven out the innocence.

699
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,750
不用多久 男人们就会开始发现你的魅力
It won't be long before men start to find you attractive.

700
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:58,560
女人 我知道你在偷听
Woman? I know you're listening.

701
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,760
从现在起 你要把乔安娜当女人来对待
From now on, you must treat Joanna like a woman.

702
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:04,000
从今天起 猪就由你来管了
As of today, you will do the hogs.

703
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,210
嘿
Hey.

704
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,210
你好 小姐
Hello, lady.

705
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:03,210
我看到了水泵
I saw the pump.

706
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,230
希望你能
I was hoping you'd be kind enough

707
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:07,960
让我解渴
to let me quench my thirst.

708
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:34,320
请允许我表达我最深切的感谢
Allow me to express my deepest thanks.

709
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,280
你们从哪来
Where are you men from?

710
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:38,530
说来话长
Oh, that's a long story.

711
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,260
以后有机会再说
Maybe some other time.

712
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:44,470
他怎么办
What about him?

713
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:46,870
你照顾好他吧
You take care of him.

714
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:49,140
我猜你是个基督徒
After all, you are a Christian, I assume?

715
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,580
该死的
God damn me.

716
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,440
去马那
Get the horse.

717
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,040
我父母会发现你们两个的
My parents would find you two.

718
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,080
然后把该死的马鞍拿下来
Then get the goddamn saddle.

719
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,190
快走
Go!

720
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:43,060
快走 离开这里 快
Go on, get out of here! Go on!

721
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,470
得把该死的子弹取出来
Damn bullet needs to get taken out.

722
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,180
然后我也需要照顾
And I need taking care of too.

723
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:05,880
我父亲会不高兴的
My father won't like that.

724
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:06,700
是啊…
Yeah...

725
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,120
你知道吗 别他妈告诉他
You know what? Don't fuckin' tell him.

726
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:34,570
要取了
Here it comes.

727
01:33:58,070 --> 01:34:02,470
我想 是时候自我介绍了
I reckon, it's about time i introduced myself.

728
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,740
我叫塞缪尔
I'm Samuel.

729
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,350
很高兴认识你
It's nice to meet you...

730
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:11,520
乔安娜
Joanna.

731
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:13,020
乔安娜
Joanna.

732
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:16,270
谢谢
Thank you.

733
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,500
这姑娘长得真快
The girl is growing fast.

734
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,060
嗨 亲爱的
Hi, sweetie.

735
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:02,280
他在发烧
He's running a fever.

736
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,430
你确定吗
Are you sure?

737
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,640
因为据说测体温的最佳方式
'Cause they say the best way to take someone's temperature

738
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,140
是用嘴唇 是吧
is with the lips, huh?

739
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:29,830
你现在多大了 孩子
How old are you now, child?

740
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:32,100
十三
Thirteen.

741
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:39,030
一个完全成年的女人…
A full-grown woman has...

742
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,070
在生活中有着小女孩不能履行的职责
Has duties in life that a young girl can't fulfill.

743
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:47,340
是我们的主亲自给予的职责
Duties imposed by our lord himself.

744
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:54,280
请跟我来
Come with me, please.

745
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,030
你母亲总不承担
Your mother does not always assume responsibilities

746
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:10,430
她应当承担的职责
the way she should.

747
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:13,400
她不依从她的自然职责
She does not comply with her natural duties.

748
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:16,610
你明白我的意思吗
Do you understand what I mean?

749
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:25,580
神让你这么快成为女人 是有原因的
God has made you a woman so soon for a reason.

750
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,150
你或许觉得这是诅咒
You might believe it to be a curse,

751
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:29,150
但他做的一切都是有原因的
but he has a reason for everything.

752
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:34,160
你就如使徒保罗笔下所写的那样
You have, as the apostle Paul put it,

753
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,820
过了年岁
"passed the flower of your age."

754
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:38,130
这可不对
This is not right.

755
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:41,560
你看到血了
You have seen the blood.

756
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:44,630
她只是个孩子
She's just a child.

757
01:36:47,370 --> 01:36:50,310
我无需回应你 我只回应神
I need not answer to you. Only to god.

758
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:29,510
不用了 谢谢 安娜
No, thank you, Anna.

759
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:31,950
我们的神另有安排
Our god has other plans.

760
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:01,210
不会有事的
It'll be all right.

761
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:04,980
双手拿好
Use both hands.

762
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:09,520
别让爆破吓到你
Don't let the blast scare you.

763
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:12,750
你现在是成年人了 乔安娜
You're a grown woman now, Joanna.

764
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,480
我能和你谈会儿吗
Could I talk to you for a moment?

765
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:26,920
我想道歉
I want to offer my apologies.

766
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:29,620
我不让你行使你的权利
I withheld from you that to which you have a right.

767
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:31,890
这是我的错
That was wrong of me.

768
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:36,260
我接受道歉
Apology accepted.

769
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:37,770
让我来弥补吧
Let me make it up to you.

770
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:40,600
太晚了
It's too late for that.

771
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:43,570
我看到了你看她的样子
I have seen how you look at her.

772
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:47,710
她是你的亲生女儿
She's your own daughter.

773
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:57,620
这是罪
It's a sin.

774
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:59,420
不一定
It does not have to be.

775
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:02,220
若有人以为自己待他的女儿
"If any man thinks that he is behaving himself unseemly

776
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:05,090
不合宜 女儿也过了年岁
"towards his virgin daughter, if she pass the flower of her age,

777
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:08,300
事又当行 他就可随意办理
"and if need so requires, let him do what he will,

778
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:10,530
不算有罪 叫二人成亲就是了
"he is not sinning, let them marry."

779
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:13,950
你这肮脏的猪

780
01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:18,640
我要训教你
You shall be scolded.

781
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:33,720
好姑娘
Good girl.

782
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:06,120
你让人等得真够久的
That sure as hell took long enough.

783
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:11,230
你去哪
Where are you going?

784
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:12,560
我去拉屎
Gonna take a crap.

785
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:16,600
你要我把这个放哪
Where do you want me to put this?

786
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,170
我急需绳子
I need some rope and I need it fast.

787
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:20,240
能帮我弄到吗
Can you get that for me?

788
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:22,640
很好
Good.

789
01:44:32,770 --> 01:44:34,600
我不得不那么做
I had to do that.

790
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:38,740
不然他会趁机杀了我
If I hadn't, he'd have killed me at some point.

791
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:41,380
他死总比我死好
Better him than me, I'd say.

792
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:47,920
我曾听过一个故事
I heard that story once,

793
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,650
有关于忍气吞声
the one about turning the other cheek and all that.

794
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:55,190
说那种话的人
The only person who'd say something like that

795
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:57,860
就是在掌控一切
is someone who's in control.

796
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:02,060
就是不希望你反抗他
Someone who doesn't want you to stand up to him.

797
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:07,400
我看见你母亲了
I've seen your mother.

798
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:11,940
她就是那种忍气吞声的人
She's the kind of person that turns the other cheek.

799
01:45:14,210 --> 01:45:15,310
你和她一样吗
Are you like her?

800
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:39,860
你为什么让他这么做
Why do you let him do this?

801
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:43,330
我绝不会像你这样
I'll never be like you.

802
01:46:44,470 --> 01:46:45,870
绝不会这么活下去
This is no way to live.

803
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:50,170
我宁愿死
I'd rather die first.

804
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:18,530
蛇对女人说
The serpent said to the woman,

805
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:20,470
你不一定死
"you surely will not die!

806
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:22,940
因为神知道 你吃的日子
"For god knows that in the day you eat from it,

807
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:24,310
眼睛就明亮了
"your eyes will be opened,

808
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:28,180
你便如神 能知道善恶
"and you will be like god, knowing good and evil."

809
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:31,050
于是女人见那棵树的果子好作食物
And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food,

810
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:32,550
也悦人的眼目
and was a delight to the eyes,

811
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:36,550
且是可喜爱的 能使人有智慧
and that the tree was desirable to make one wise,

812
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:39,020
就摘下果子来吃了
she took from its fruit and ate.

813
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:43,290
然后耶和华神对女人说
And then the lord god said to the woman,

814
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,560
我必多多加增你怀胎的苦楚
"i will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.

815
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,030
你生产儿女必多受苦楚
"In pain you will bring forth children,

816
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:52,970
你必恋慕你丈夫
"yet your desire will be for your husband.

817
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:55,070
你丈夫必管辖你
"And he will rule over you."

818
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:04,850
这是亵渎
This is an abomination.

819
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:08,480
这是亵渎
This is an abomination!

820
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:10,390
她难道不知道她的身体
Does she not know that her body is

821
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:13,860
是从神那受领的圣灵之殿吗
the temple of the holy spirit, which she received from god?

822
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:16,320
这是一种耻辱
This is a disgrace.

823
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:19,230
她会在地狱受到惩罚
She will be punished in hell.

824
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:22,800
她会被变成一棵荆棘树
She will be transformed into a thorny tree,

825
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,270
在折磨之林中 被鹰身女妖所惩罚
and in a tortured wood, she will be punished by harpies,

826
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:28,870
她们会用利爪挖凿她
who will dig their sharp talons into her,

827
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:31,140
直到她鲜血淋漓
until the blood comes flowing down!

828
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,950
主啊
Oh, lord.

829
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:38,980
原谅我吧
Forgive me.

830
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:40,180
你知道我试图让她
You know I have tried to keep her

831
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,820
坚守在通向悔改的狭窄之路上
on the narrow way to repentance.

832
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:44,290
但就如马太福音所言
But like the gospel of Matthew says,

833
01:48:44,290 --> 01:48:47,020
宽广的路总是通向毁灭
"the way is broad that leads to destruction."

834
01:48:48,590 --> 01:48:49,860
我劝说她
I spoke to her.

835
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:52,590
我责打她
I chastised her.

836
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:56,900
但无济于事
But to no avail.

837
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:00,470
我失败了
I failed.

838
01:49:51,390 --> 01:49:53,620
好了 好了
There, there.

839
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:54,690
没事了
It's all right.

840
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:57,360
没事了
It's all right.

841
01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:12,170
我到年龄了
I'm old enough.

842
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,250
我知道
I know.

843
01:50:59,290 --> 01:51:00,620
神已经原谅了我
God has forgiven me.

844
01:51:01,890 --> 01:51:03,160
我准备好了
I am ready.

845
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:17,670
谢谢你 主 谢谢你 全能的主
Thank you, lord. Thank you, almighty.

846
01:51:17,670 --> 01:51:20,580
你看见并预见一切
You saw, and foresaw all.

847
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:23,480
你看见我妻子没做到你对她所期望的
You saw that my wife did not do what you expected of her.

848
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:27,260
她不爱你 也不爱我 而我女儿会爱的
That she did not love you, or me, as my daughter will.

849
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:31,820
罗得和他的女儿们结婚了 而她们是他的孩子
Lot lay with his daughters and they bore children unto him.

850
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:34,990
乔安娜和我要缔结婚姻关系
Joanna and I shall enter a state of matrimony

851
01:51:34,990 --> 01:51:37,330
她会怀上我的孩子
and she shall bear my children.

852
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:39,630
我们会带给你喜乐与荣耀
We shall be joyous and honor you.

853
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,280
放开我
Let me go!

854
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:43,770
别害怕
Fear not.

855
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:45,610
不要
No!

856
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:47,740
不要
No!

857
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:50,770
这是神的旨意 我们是他的选中之人
It is the will of god. We are his chosen ones.

858
01:51:52,610 --> 01:51:55,610
两个人以神之名许下誓言时
When two people make their vows in the name of the everlasting,

859
01:51:55,610 --> 01:51:59,050
他们会宣称属于彼此 深深相爱
they pronounce their wish to belong to each other fully in love.

860
01:51:59,050 --> 01:52:02,550
他们将一起探寻神想从他们生活中得到什么
Together they shall search for what god wants from their lives.

861
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:04,890
他们将一起履行他们的职责
Together they shall perform their duties

862
01:52:04,890 --> 01:52:06,250
并照顾好他们的家庭
and care for their family.

863
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:34,870
我父亲是彻头彻尾的混蛋
My father was a real bastard.

864
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:39,090
他常拿雪茄烫我手臂 这该死的虐待狂
He used to put cigars out on my arm, the sadistic fuck.

865
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:45,260
他是个变态 就和你一样
And he was a pervert, just like you.

866
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:47,600
我在九岁时杀了他
I killed him when I was nine years old.

867
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:49,680
你是谁
Who are you?

868
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:52,630
你女儿很特别
You have a real special daughter.

869
01:52:53,870 --> 01:52:55,470
她理应得到自由
She deserves to be free.

870
01:53:03,150 --> 01:53:06,310
你觉得你能进来拿走属于我的东西吗
You think you can come in here and take that which belongs to me?

871
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,320
没错 你觉得呢
Yeah. What do you think?

872
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:13,490
神会从天而降来救你?
That god's gonna come down here and save you?

873
01:53:19,630 --> 01:53:20,920
我就如神
I am as god.

874
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:23,460
他也如我
He is as I am.

875
01:53:35,430 --> 01:53:36,430
我会爱你的
I will love you.

876
01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:38,310
你要学会爱我
And you will learn to love me.

877
01:53:38,450 --> 01:53:41,050
- 这是神的旨意  - 我要杀了你
- It is god's will.  - I will kill you.

878
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:42,820
这阻止不了我
That would not stop me.

879
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:44,150
你疯了
You're mad.

880
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:45,690
那个人是谁
Who was that man?

881
01:53:45,690 --> 01:53:47,960
他给你灌输了愚蠢的想法
He put foolish thoughts in your mind.

882
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,260
他帮助了我 我爱他
He helped me. I love him.

883
01:53:52,590 --> 01:53:54,560
不是 那不是爱
No, you do not.

884
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:56,460
那是淫欲
It is lust.

885
01:53:59,070 --> 01:53:59,710
是爱
Yes.

886
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:07,610
我要打得你不再像你母亲那样
I will beat your mother out of you.

887
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:36,940
是时候了
The time has come.

888
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:38,210
我会温柔的
I will be gentle.

889
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:19,680
第四章
惩罚

890
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:09,920
他不会罢休的 对吗
He ain't never gonna stop, is he?

891
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:34,700
我不会有事的
I'll be fine.

892
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:49,180
我们到了吗
Are we there yet?

893
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:53,000
快回去睡觉

894
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,670
什么情况
What was that?

895
02:01:17,670 --> 02:01:19,910
放手 放开我
No, let me go!

896
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:21,980
- 待在那  - 马修
- Stay there!  - Matthew!

897
02:01:21,980 --> 02:01:24,380
珊慕 不管有什么事都别出来
Stay there, Sam. Whatever happens!

898
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:25,650
马修
Matthew!

899
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:32,950
妈妈
Mama!

900
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:37,020
马修
Matthew!

901
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:36,370
莉兹
Oh, Liz...

902
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:41,920
我一直希望这地方有朝一日会属于伊莱
I'd always hoped this place would be Eli's someday.

903
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:45,890
我意思是…
I mean...

904
02:03:45,890 --> 02:03:47,150
他可以…
He could've...

905
02:03:48,390 --> 02:03:50,060
怎么说呢
I don't know...

906
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:51,890
弄个伐木场什么的…
A sawmill or something...

907
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:19,050
你确定吗
Are you sure?

908
02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:21,120
你以前开过枪吗
Have you ever fired one of those things before?

909
02:04:22,670 --> 02:04:23,880
这是我的战斗

910
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:28,000
拿枪的应该是我
I should be the one holding the gun.

911
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:31,380
我要你留下陪珊慕

912
02:05:03,670 --> 02:05:06,200
那么远开枪毫无用处
There's no use shooting from that distance.

913
02:05:17,810 --> 02:05:19,280
这比你料想的更难
It's more difficult than you think,

914
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,380
尤其用这样的枪
especially with a gun like that.

915
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:39,000
在毕斯玛司时 我真的准备好原谅你了
I was truly prepared to forgive you, back in bismuth.

916
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:41,530
我爱你
I loved you.

917
02:05:42,700 --> 02:05:43,970
你应该知道
You should have seen that.

918
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:49,910
可你却违抗我
You've turned against me,

919
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:52,610
就像你母亲那样
just like your mother.

920
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:57,580
但我再次被给予了另一个选择
But again, I have been provided with an alternative.

921
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:02,520
没错 乔安娜
That's right, Joanna.

922
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:06,590
你女儿会为你的所作所为受苦
Your daughter shall suffer for your actions.

923
02:06:08,230 --> 02:06:12,000
我责打她时 我会让你看着
And I will make you watch as I chastise her.

924
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,270
之后 你会目睹我是如何让她变成女人的
And after that, you will witness how i make her a woman.

925
02:06:18,170 --> 02:06:20,040
你觉得她在里面是安全的?
You believe she's safe in there?

926
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,080
我接近不了她?
That I cannot get to her?

927
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:26,480
你把她单独留下了 乔安娜
You left her alone, Joanna.

928
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:29,710
永远不要把你的心爱之人单独留下
Never leave your loved ones alone.

929
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:31,620
你现在应该懂了
You should know that by now.

930
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:39,390
我能对你做的最坏的事是什么呢 乔安娜
What is the worst thing i could do to you, Joanna?

931
02:06:41,230 --> 02:06:43,230
幸好她睡着了
Lucky for her, she was asleep.

932
02:06:43,970 --> 02:06:45,430
她什么都没看见
She did not see a thing.

933
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:02,280
怎么了
Huh, what...

934
02:07:24,710 --> 02:07:27,980
要防备假先知
Beware of false prophets

935
02:07:29,140 --> 02:07:32,180
他们到你们这里来 外面披着羊皮
who come to you in sheep's clothing...

936
02:07:33,550 --> 02:07:37,420
里面却是残暴的狼
For inwardly, they are ravening wolves.

937
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:08,480
妈妈
Mama!

938
02:08:11,990 --> 02:08:14,090
不 妈妈 妈妈
No, mama! Mama!

939
02:08:14,690 --> 02:08:15,760
不
No!

940
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,160
妈妈
Mama!

941
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:23,740
妈妈
Mama!

942
02:08:46,350 --> 02:08:49,260
我对你女儿会完全照做我对你所做的
I will do to your daughter exactly as I did to you.

943
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:55,330
我会尽量伤害你
I am going to hurt you as much as I can.

944
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:39,310
我就让门开着
I will leave the door open.

945
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:17,520
我给你带了这个过来
I brought you this.

946
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:27,250
你母亲跟你说了成为女人意味着什么吗
Has your mother told you what it means to be a woman?

947
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:33,390
许多人认为神不赞成暴力
Many people believe that god does not approve of violence.

948
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:36,700
他们就没读过他们的圣经
They have not read their Bible.

949
02:10:37,470 --> 02:10:41,230
暴力洁净罪恶 净化心灵
"Violence cleanses evil. It purifies the heart."

950
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,870
你的心灵需要净化吗
Does your heart need purifying?

951
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:47,770
你有过不好的念头吗
Have you had bad thoughts?

952
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:51,380
或许和男人有关?
About men, perhaps?

953
02:10:53,950 --> 02:10:55,220
你喜欢男人吗
Do you like men?

954
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:04,290
你出过血吗
Have you bled yet?

955
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:25,450
我是个注定要遭厄运的人 珊慕
I am a doomed man, Sam.

956
02:11:27,850 --> 02:11:29,090
已无法被拯救
Beyond salvation.

957
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:31,890
我想做什么就做什么
I can do whatever I want.

958
02:11:37,930 --> 02:11:40,930
小女孩仍有着纯洁的气息
Young girls still carry the scent of innocence.

959
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:45,570
年长的女人闻上去就不同
Older women smell different.

960
02:11:57,140 --> 02:11:58,610
是时候了
The time has come.

961
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:49,860
人们觉得地狱难以忍受是因为那里的烈焰
People think it's the flames that make hell unbearable.

962
02:12:51,970 --> 02:12:53,030
并不是这样
It's not.

963
02:12:54,340 --> 02:12:56,470
而是因为没有爱
It is the absence of love.

964
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:03,280
嘿
Hey.

965
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:09,120
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

966
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:39,650
呀…
Well...

967
02:14:41,110 --> 02:14:42,910
好久不见 莉兹
Long time no see, Liz.

968
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:52,520
那时我崩溃了
I was a broken man.

969
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:54,990
无法继续在那生活
Couldn't go on living there.

970
02:14:56,720 --> 02:14:58,130
好在新来的传教士指引了我
Good thing the new preacher showed me

971
02:14:58,130 --> 02:15:00,010
让我去别处试试
I had to go try somewhere else.

972
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:05,180
是他告诉我毕斯玛司在招副警长
He was the one, told me they was lookin' for deputies up in bismuth.

973
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:08,870
我在那开启了新的生活
I made myself up a new life there.

974
02:15:11,670 --> 02:15:14,940
大约一年前 那里的警长遭到了枪击
About a year ago, the sheriff there got himself shot.

975
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:17,710
我被选任代替他的位置
And I was chosen to replace him.

976
02:15:19,610 --> 02:15:21,750
我清理他的办公室时
And while I was cleaning out his office...

977
02:15:25,390 --> 02:15:26,650
发现了这个
I found this.

978
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:28,910
[通缉令]
[2500美元赏金]
[犯谋杀罪 伊丽莎白·布兰迪 哑巴 没舌头]

979
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:34,030
你本该改名的 莉兹
You should've changed your name, Liz.

980
02:15:36,130 --> 02:15:37,360
你觉得世界上叫
How many Elizabeth brundys

981
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:39,130
伊丽莎白·布兰迪的人有多少
you figure there are in this world?

982
02:15:39,130 --> 02:15:42,170
而又有多少是没舌头的
And how many of 'em you figure don't got no tongue?

983
02:15:47,370 --> 02:15:49,180
伊丽莎白·布兰迪
Elizabeth brundy,

984
02:15:49,180 --> 02:15:52,850
你因谋杀你的前雇主兼弗兰克的地狱的业主
I hereby arrest you for the murder of frank blain,

985
02:15:52,850 --> 02:15:56,650
弗兰克·布莱恩 而被捕了
your former employer and proprietor of frank's inferno.

986
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:29,950
你逃不出你过去的所作所为 莉兹
Your past done caught up with you, Liz.

987
02:17:30,010 --> 02:17:33,710
时光荏苒 影像迷离
As life progresses, images blur.

988
02:17:36,050 --> 02:17:37,880
独留回忆
All that remains are memories.

989
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:48,700
我清楚地记得她
I remember her well.

990
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:52,730
她是一名战士
She was a warrior.

991
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:54,900
始终掌控一切
Always in control.

992
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,330
我常会想她下沉时在想什么
I've often wondered what she was thinking about on her way down.
