93
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,850
你说的对

94
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,920
你在想什么呢？

95
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,650
爸爸，对不起

96
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,930
听我说

97
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,650
那些人都是盲信徒

98
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,090
不要在他们面前玩

99
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,030

00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,850
嘿，你，站住

106
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,460
把这下放下，放下

107
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,990
- 把桶子分开  - 它们只是桶子

108
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,070
里面装了什么？

109
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,890
好吧

110
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,140
里面什么也没有，我就是个做买卖的

111
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,280

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,410
对啊

116
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,960
是什么游戏啊？

117
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,330
不适合你们小孩子玩

118
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,460

如果我再卖一个，可以让我玩游戏吗？

133
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,880
不，不，继续卖

134
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:23,450
桶子，桶子，桶子

135
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,450
哈立德，我很快就要走，你现在可以走了

136
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,450
给我一小时让我把这些都卖出去

137
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,320
留三个给我，剩下的都拿走

138
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,800
这些？

139
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:36,050

对，回家去

142
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,750
别去其他任何地方

143
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,750
明白吗

144
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,750

回家去

156
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,260
我认识你

157
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,470
我以前住在这，朋友

158
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,670
我现在是商人了，卖桶

159
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,230
你到哪去了？

160
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,380
我回了趟索马里，我妈妈病了

161
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,880
不不，我想起来了

162
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,380
这个人，我以前把他赶出去过

163
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,500
他爱个肯尼亚人

164
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,220
来，抓住他

165
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,720

166
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,220

172
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:54,830

Matter of fact, yeah.

311
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,940
是啊，一大群呢
Oh, wow. Yeah, a whole bunch of them

312
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,110
大概在城市以东三十英里

00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,520
飞机刚在轨道里安顿下来了
The aircraft is established in the orbit

314
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,610
飞行高度为两百，十分隐秘

Aircraft and GCS are in the green with no write-ups.

316
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,070
好，很好

317
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,780
所有的镜头都完好无损
All cameras checked good.

318
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,120
这是目标
Here's the target.

319
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,200
地面部队就在几个街区远的一个旧工厂里

320
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,460
这里

321
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,500
好的，谢谢

武器加快自旋都正常

323
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,920
空中待命还剩十小时
Ten hours' time on station remaining.

324
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,470
你们还有两枚“狱火”导弹，安全无线电也完好无损
You still have two Hellfire missiles. Secure radio checked good.

325
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,050
很好，谢谢各位
Great. Thank you, guys.

326
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,060
好了，好好干，别搞砸了
All right. Do good. Don't suck.

327
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,180
嘿，马特？你进来了吗？
Hey, Matt? You strapped in?

328
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,350
我在呢，这就来
I'm here. Here it comes.

329
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,750
肖曼5-0，北部2-0，早上好，莫斯，你好吗？
Showman 5-0, North 2-0. Good morning, Moses. How are you?

北部2-0，肖曼5-0，早上好，上校，我很好，谢谢
North 2-0, Showman 5-0. Good morning, Colonel. Very good, thank you.

331
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,590
确保海鹰在蓝色区域
Confirm Seahawk is in the Blue Zone,

332
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,260
但是秃鹰还在飞行中，对吗？
but Condor is still in flight, right?

333
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,800
海鹰在蓝色区域
Seahawk is in the Blue Zone.

334
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,590
我们希望秃鹰一小时后能着陆
We expect Condor to land in an hour.

335
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,800
谢谢，你们都就位了吗？
Thank you. Are your men in place?

336
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,260
是的，长官
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,680
宝贝，我是爸爸
Darling, it's your dad here.

338
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,270
我现在正看着一橱柜的安娜贝尔洋娃娃
I'm looking at a whole shelf of these Annabell dolls.

339
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,810
你没跟我说它们有这么多款式啊
You didn't tell me that there were different types.

340
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,890
我不知道该买哪一个
I have no idea what to buy her.

341
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,730
你能尽快回复我吗？
Can you get back to me ASAP?

342
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,980
不然…
Otherwise...

343
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,650
呃…
Um...

344
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,110
我现在正拿着一个“该睡觉了”娃娃
I'm holding a "Time to Sleep" doll.

345
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,830
上面写着，“当到了晚安时刻
It says here, "You will hear her babbling"

346
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,410
你会听见她的咿呀声”
"when it is beddy-byes."

347
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,000
尽快给我回电
Call me as soon as you can.

348
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,910
我是本森上将，来开内阁府会议
General Benson here for Cobra.

349
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,250
本森上将
General Benson.

350
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,380
杰克·克里利，我是今天的协调员
Jack Cleary. I'm coordinating today.

351
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,130
- 先生，这边请  - 谢谢
This way, sir. Thank you.

352
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,720
等等，“动感宝宝”？我买的是什么？
Hold on a minute. "Baby Moves"? What have I got?

353
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,720
好吧，有关系吗？我是说…
Well, does it matter? I mean...

354
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,180
上将，他们在找您了，先生
General, they're asking for you, sir.

355
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,980
对，好的，亲爱的，我试试看
Yes. Uh... All right, darling, I'll try.

356
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,060
好吧，拜拜
Yup. Bye-bye.

357
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,530
我本该买一个“动感宝宝”
I bought a "Time to Sleep" doll

358
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,690
结果我买了一个“该睡觉了”娃娃
when I should have bought a "Baby Moves."

359
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,530
显然，他们之间的区别很大
Apparently, there's an important difference.

360
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,280
长官，交给我来办吧
I'll see what I can do, sir.

361
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,810
内阁府训令室“A”
- 早上好，司法部长  - 早上好，弗兰克

363
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,340
女士
Ma'am.

364
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,460
祝贺你任新职了
Congratulations on your new appointment.

365
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,710
谢谢
Thank you.

366
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,720
我想和你们谈谈苏珊·丹福特的抓捕行动
I'm gonna talk you through the capture of Susan Danford,

367
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,890
也就是爱莎·艾哈迪
AKA Ayesha Al-Hady.

368
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,320
- 你好吗？  - 我很好，你呢？
How are you? I'm good, and you?

369
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,570
欢迎来到内罗比
Welcome to Nairobi.

370
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,400
秃鹰已降落
The Condor has landed.

371
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,990
收到，到蓝色区域去
Copy that. Proceed to the Blue Zone.

372
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,920
- 嘿  - 嘿
Hey. Hey.

373
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,840
- 你去看比赛了吗？ - 我太忙了
Did you go to the game? I was busy.

374
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,760
图像分析部，珍珠港
你也许还能赶上
You might still make it.

375
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,930
我们拍到什么了？
What have we got here?

376
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,010
正在追踪内罗比的某个激进分子
Tracking some extremists in Nairobi.

377
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,260
我的一个同乡
One guy's from my hometown.

378
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,560
开玩笑，说真的？
You're kidding. Serious?

379
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,770
- 对  - 这个是他吗？
Yup. Uh-huh. Is that him?

380
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,940
穆罕默德·艾迪萨拉姆，索马里人
Muhammad Abdisalaam, Somali.

381
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,770
那边有很多他们这种人
A lot of them there.

382
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,070
好吧，那但愿他回不来
Well, let's hope he's not coming back.

383
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,190
- 是啊，值班顺利  - 谢谢
Yeah. Have a good shift. Thanks.

384
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,810
谢谢
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

385
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,480
情况怎么样了？
What's going on?

386
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,850
秃鹰正在蓝色区域
We've got Condor in the Blue Zone.

387
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,480
秃鹰是谁啊？
Who the fuck is Condor?

388
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,440
就是机场的第二个人
The second guy in from the airport.

389
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,450
我记不住这么多名字
I can't keep up with these names.

390
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,280
肖曼5-0，能看到屋内的画面吗？
Showman 5-0, can we get a view into the house?

391
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,160
佩格9-0, 肖曼5-0，能试试调取屋内的画面吗？
Peg 9-0, Showman 5-0, can you try and look into the house?

392
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,330
正在调取
Moving now.

393
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,140
肖曼5-0，要我们派林戈去吗？
Showman 50, would you like us to bring in Ringo?

394
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,230
不用，等候三号抵达
Negative. Wait for number three to arrive.

395
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,180
有动静了
We have movement.

396
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,760
见鬼，他们这是要走了吗？
Damn it. Are they leaving?

397
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,680
丹福特和艾哈迪呢？
Where are Danford and Al-Hady?

398
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,560
上校，根据我们的情报，他们半小时后会到
Colonel, our intelligence only has them arriving in another half hour.

399
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,520
好吧，那我们的情报都太不灵通了
Well, then our intelligence is bad.

400
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,730
装载！
Load up!

401
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,610
北部2-0，肖曼5-0，我的人已经准备好了，进去吗？
North 2-0, Showman 5-0, I have my men ready. Do we go in?

402
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,030
不，不，不，少校，让你的人等等，我要抓丹福特
No, no, no. No, Major, please. Hold your men. I want Danford.

403
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,870
收到，立定！稍息！
Copy. Halt! Hold up!

404
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,070
立定！
Halt!

405
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,040
亡命徒2-7，如果他们离开，就继续跟踪
Bravo 2-7, follow if they leave.

406
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,370
夏威夷五号，做人脸识别
Hawaii 5, confirm PID.

407
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,750
收到，北部2-0，请再靠近点
Roger, North 2-0. I'd like to be closer.

408
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,670
佩格9-0，靠近点，去做人脸识别
Peg 9-0, go closer for PID.

North 2-0, Hawaii 5 confirms positive IDs on

穆罕默德·艾迪萨拉姆和拉希德·哈姆德
Muhammad Abdisalaam and Rasheed Hamud.

411
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
收到
Roger that.

412
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,080
- 那是谁？  - 放大
Who's that? Zoom in.

413
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,500
那个是丹福特吗？
Is that Danford?

414
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,420
做个人脸识别
I need a PID.

415
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,880
该死
Shit.

416
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,170
见鬼，那是她吗？还是艾哈迈德的老婆？
Damn it. Is that her, or does Ahmed have a wife?

417
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,880
抱歉，上校，我们不清楚
I'm sorry, Colonel, we don't know.

418
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,050
不，这样还不够出色，各位
No, not good enough, people.

419
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,180
那肯定是她
It has to be her.

420
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,510
为什么我们不知道她已经在那屋子里了？
Why didn't we know she was already in the house?

421
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,270
行动者，说出意图
Movers, say intentions.

422
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,140
- 继续停留在PAX  - 明白
- Stay on PAX. - Copy.

423
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,860
亡命徒2-7正在跟踪
Bravo 2-7 following.

424
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,490
夏威夷五号，得到画面后，我要你尽快做人脸识别
Hawaii 5, I want a PID on that woman as soon as we get a visual.

425
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,870
是，长官
Yes, ma'am.

426
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,830
缩小
Zoom out.

427
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,460
北部2-0，肖曼5-0
North 2-0. Showman 5-0.

428
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,510
他们好像是要去伊斯特利
Looks like they're heading towards Eastleigh.

429
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,720
她要是进那去了，我们还怎么发起地面攻击？
So, how do we launch a ground assault if she's going in there?

430
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,720
没办法，青年党控制了那片区域
We can't. Al-Shabab controls that neighborhood.

431
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,760
那会触发大屠杀
It would trigger a massacre.

432
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,680
好吧，好吧，那…
All right. All right, just...

433
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,640
就跟着她
Just stay with her.

434
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,230
肖曼5-0，亡命徒2-7
Showman 50, Bravo 27.

435
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,940
继续跟下去太冒险了
It's too risky to follow.

436
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,110
回基地
Return to base.

437
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,720
肖曼5-0，这房子我们认识吗？
Showman 5-0, do we know this house?

438
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,770
那是阿玛度·穆赫塔尔的家
It belongs to Amadu Mukhtar.

439
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,230
他是个索马里商人，除此之外，没有其他数据
He's a Somali trader, but there is no other intel on him.

440
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,740
该死
Oh, shit.

441
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,620
夏威夷五号，北部2-0，你有看见点什么吗？
Hawaii 5, North 2-0. Did you see anything there?

442
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,000
- 没有，长官  - 见鬼
No, ma'am. Shit.

443
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,840
肖曼5-0，我们需要在屋内安插一个眼
Showman 5-0, we need an eye inside that house.

444
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,100
我必须知道丹福特是否在里面，以及谁和她在一起
I have to know if Danford is inside, and who is with her.

445
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,930
长官，那意味着要安排一个人在街上
Ma'am, it would mean putting a man in the street,

446
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,100
而且要靠近到能够控制甲壳虫
and you'd have to get close to control the beetle.

447
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,810
那样很容易引起怀疑
It would easily raise suspicion.

448
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,770
怎么，就连用个索马里人也会引起怀疑？
What, even if you use a Somali?

449
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,150
任何陌生人都有嫌疑，就算是索马里人
Every stranger is suspicious, even a Somali.

450
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,030
莫斯，我们都确信那个丹福特就在屋里，对吗？
Moses, we both believe that Danford is inside that house, do we not?

451
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
是的，长官
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,660
而没有人脸识别，我就不能授权发起袭击
And I cannot authorize a strike without a positive ID.

453
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,750
我觉得我们必须接受风险，派个人进去
I believe we have to accept the risk and send someone in.

454
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,210
莫斯，你能做到吗？
Moses, can you do it?

455
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,130
是，长官
Yes, ma'am.

456
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,890
谢谢，非常感谢
Thank you. Appreciate what you're doing.

457
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,510
佩格9-0，肖曼5-0
Peg 9-0, Showman 5-0.

458
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,060
我需要你设法让林戈进入目标房屋内
I need you to engage Ringo at the target house.

459
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,480
我们需要进行人脸识别
We need a positive ID.

460
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,170
好了
Okay.

461
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,130
谢谢你，伙计
Thanks, man. Mmm-hmm.

462
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
什么鬼？
What?

463
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,090
阿丽亚
Alia.

464
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,980
阿丽亚
Alia.

465
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,050
那是什么？
What's that?

466
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,530
让林戈绕到另一边去识别那个女人
Get Ringo around the other side to identify the woman.

467
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,310
那就是丹福特，夏威夷五号，请进行人脸识别
That's Danford. Hawaii 5, confirm PID, please.

468
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,940
识别，苏珊·海伦·丹福特
PID, Susan Helen Danford.

469
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,620
我们找到丹福特了
We have Danford.

470
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,460
但是我们无法进入民兵监管区
But we can't enter the militia-controlled area.

471
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
不
No.

472
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,340
上将，你有什么计划？
What's the plan, General?

473
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,930
那个，使用“收割者”，我们有能力
Well, using the Reaper, we have the ability

474
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,390
用一个相当的精准度 袭击一个目标
to strike a target with considerable accuracy.

475
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,020
首相，只要你同意
If you agree, Minister,

476
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,060
我们可以消灭她
we could eliminate her.

477
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,690
绝对不行！
Absolutely not!

478
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,520
女士，她是一个青年党成员
Ma'am, she's a member of Al-Shabab

479
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,270
而且是东非要犯通缉名单上的第四位
and number four on our East African Most Wanted list.

480
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,190
上将，我不在乎你的名单
I don't care about your list, General.

481
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,820
我来这是为了目睹一次抓捕行动
I came here to witness a capture,

482
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,280
而不是消灭一个目标
not a targeted assassination.

483
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,400
乔治
George.

484
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,370
是的，很抱歉，弗兰克，我同意安吉拉的看法
Yes, I'm sorry, Frank. I agree with Angela.

485
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,120
我们的本意是抓捕丹福特，而不是杀了她
The idea was to capture Danford, not kill her.

486
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,790
这项任务是由首相认可的
This was the mission approved by the PM.

487
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,120
而且，和司法部长一样，抓捕才是我来这想看到的
And, as Attorney General, that is what I came here to witness.

488
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,210
我们希望把她带回这个国家受审
We want her brought back to this country to stand trial.

489
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,670
对
Right.

490
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,050
我转告一下鲍威尔上校
I'll put that to Colonel Powell.

491
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,370
怎么样了？
What's happening?

492
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,120
不知道
I don't know.

493
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,000
嘿，马特，情况怎么样了？
Hey, Matt, what's going on?

494
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,130
我们弄了只甲壳虫进屋
We got a beetle inside that house,

495
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,250
看到了一群我们不太喜欢的人
and we're seeing a bunch of people we don't like.

496
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,930
那个是他，是她丈夫，夏威夷5号，进行确认
That's him. That's her husband. Hawaii 5, confirm.

497
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,650
肖曼5-0，他们俩我们都找到了
Showman 5-0, we've got them both.

498
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,660
是的，长官，真是太好了
Yes, ma'am. This is wonderful.

499
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,370
我需要佩格9-0带我去另几个房间
I need Peg 9-0 to take me into the other rooms.

500
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,580
该死
Shit.

501
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
操，天呐
Oh, fuck, man.

502
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,540
- 我操，我操  - 马特，怎么了？
Fuck. Fuck. Matt, what's happening?

503
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,130
我们在那个屋子里看见了一堆
We're seeing suicide vests and a whole bunch of fucking explosives

504
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,760
自杀性爆炸背心
inside that house.

505
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,180
好吧，这情况就不同了
Well, this changes things.

506
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,140
好吧，保持冷静，好吗？别让我的飞行员紧张
All right. Keep it calm, okay? Don't wind up my pilot.

507
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,430
立刻派律师过来
I want legal in here right now.

508
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,020
是，长官
Yes, ma'am.

509
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,030
他们要录制自杀录像
They're gonna make a suicide video.

510
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,030
上校，那是谁？
Who is that, Colonel?

511
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,490
好像是奥斯曼·阿比德
Looks like Osman Abade.

512
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,000
拉姆爆炸事件中的爆炸物就是他提供的
He supplied the explosives in the Lamu bombing.

513
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,550
凯瑟琳，计划是什么？
What's the plan, Katherine?

514
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,970
我们要立即往那个屋顶投一枚“狱火”
We need to put a Hellfire through that roof right now.

515
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,510
我说过了，他们是来目击抓捕行动，不是杀戮
I told you, they came to witness a capture, not a kill.

516
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,720
给我一个抓捕选择
Give me a capture option.

517
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,810
我们已经没有抓捕选择了
We no longer have a capture option.

518
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,940
任何地面行动都会导致一场武装对抗
Any action on the ground will lead to an armed confrontation,

519
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,400
那将是我们无法牵制的
which we will not be able to contain.

520
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,070
他们正在看着
They're watching.

521
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,150
就算出现了背心，我们也需要他们的许可才能袭击
Even with the vests, we need their approval for a strike.

522
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,990
就告诉他们，我们发现了丹福特
Just tell them we've got Danford in our sights.

523
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,660
我是说，光这一点，就该使用狱火了
I mean, that alone should justify using a Hellfire.

524
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,820
那些背心只是附加条件
The vests are just a bonus.

525
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,370
丹福特是英国公民，他们希望她活着
Danford's a British citizen. They want her alive.

526
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,120
他们不能让她活着！
They cannot have her alive!

527
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,710
弗兰克，我已经追踪她六年了
Frank, I've tracked her for six years.

528
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,750
这是我最接近她的一次
This is the closest I've ever got.

529
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,000
所以，我们现在就需要扩大规则
So, we need to expand our rules of engagement right now

530
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,670
以保护平均人口
to protect the civilian population.

531
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,300
往那屋顶上投放“狱火”就是我们
A Hellfire through that roof is our

532
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,880
最实际的选择
most effective option.

533
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,180
我们必须弄清楚，我们是合法的
We have to know that we're legally in the clear.

534
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,850
对，对，当然，我现在正在处理这个问题
Yes. Yes, of course. I'm getting into that right now.

535
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,540
上校？
Colonel?

536
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,210
- 哈罗德，情况你都清楚了吗？  - 是的，长官
Oh, Harold, you've been following? Yes, ma'am.

537
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,420
计划是往那屋顶上
So, the plan is to put a Hellfire

538
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,670
投一枚“狱火”
through the roof of that house.

539
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,590
我现在需要法律建议
I need legal clearance right now.

540
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,510
- 从“收割者”上发射一枚导弹？  - 是的
A missile from the Reaper? Yes.

541
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,390
这么说这已经不是抓捕行动了
So, this is no longer a capture situation.

542
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:10,600
对，我们在屋里发现了，两套自杀性爆炸背心
No. We have two suicide vests with explosives inside that house.

543
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,310
附加损害
你能为我通过更高的CDE吗？
So, can you clear me to a higher CDE?

544
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
这…
Uh...

545
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,230
哈罗德，这是一个非常时效性的目标，我有权进行袭击吗？
Harold, this is a very time-sensitive target. Do I have authority to strike?

546
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,980
你所遵循的交战规则
The rules of engagement you're operating under

547
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,940
只允许一个低量的附带损害
only allow for a low collateral damage estimate.

548
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,530
对，对，而我的武器只恳求一个低CDE
Yes, yes, and my weapons only invoke a low CDE.

549
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,530
是那屋子里的爆炸物
It's the explosives inside that house

550
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,580
带来了潜在的高CDE
that bring it to a potentially high CDE.

551
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,290
既然你知道里面有爆炸物
And since you know the explosives are there,

552
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,540
那把这点纳入考虑，则是义不容辞的
it is incumbent upon you to take them into account.

553
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,080
我能预见一个潜在的合法反对
I can see a potential legal objection.

554
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,170
老天，我们在那屋内发现了
Jesus! We've got two suicide bombers

555
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,050
两套自杀性炸弹，还有三个非常关键的人物！
and three very high value individuals inside that house!

556
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,710
我明白你希望将他们从你的名单上抹除
And you want them off your list, I understand that.

557
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,670
但你所遵循的交战规则
But the rules of engagement you're operating under

558
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,300
预设是一次抓捕行动，而不是杀戮方案
envisaged a capture, not a kill scenario.

559
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,520
长官，我觉得上报会更为明智
Ma'am, I think it would be wise to refer up.

560
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,600
你是在建议我，还是在反驳我？
Are you telling me that, or just debating with me?

561
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
关于上报？
To refer up?

562
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,690
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

563
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,320
我是在建议你
I am telling you. Oh!

564
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,070
- 本森  - 长官
- Benson. - Sir.

565
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,530
律师建议我上报司法部长
Legal has advised me to refer up to the Attorney General.

566
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,120
弗兰克，我需要一个快速的回答
I need a quick answer, Frank.

567
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,080
好，我让他来接电话
Okay, I'll put that to him.

568
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,960
乔治
George.

569
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,960
这些爆炸物意味着紧迫的威胁
Those explosives mean there is an imminent threat

570
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,250
会对平均人口造成严重伤害
of serious harm to the civilian population.

571
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,710
我们能袭击吗？
Can we strike?

572
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,470
那个，考虑到新出现的情况，我会说，同意
Well, given the new circumstances, I would say yes.

573
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,550
布莱恩
Brian.

574
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,180
我们必须先打一通政治电话和法律电话
There is a political as well as a legal call to be made here.

575
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,850
是的，乔治，我意识到了
Yes, I'm quite aware of that, George.

576
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,940
首相，我们现在就需要一个决定
We need a decision now, Minister.

577
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,820
法律上，我们没有问题吗？
Legally, we don't have a problem?

578
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,940
是的，没有
No, we don't.

579
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,070
但政治上…
But politically...

580
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,410
是否允许我们进行？
Do we have permission to proceed?

581
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,740
那个
Well,

582
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,950
- 乔治，你似乎在暗示“是”  - 谢谢
you seem to be implying yes, George. Thank you.

583
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,120
- 稍等，等一下  - 不，我不是那意思…
Hold on a minute. Hold on. No. That is not what I...

584
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,920
这是抓捕任务转变为了击杀任务，对吗？
This is a change of mission from a capture to a shoot-to-kill, isn't it?

585
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,380
是的，没错
Yes, it is.

586
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,590
我们这么做没问题吗？
Are we all right with that?

587
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,300
我确定这样是有问题的
I'm sure we are not.

588
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,220
目标是两名英国公民和一个美国公民
There are two British citizens and an American as targets.

589
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,720
此次任务已经得到了
This mission has the full support

590
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,220
肯尼亚和美国的全力支持
of Kenya and the United States.

591
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,480
无人机袭击？
For a drone strike?

592
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,020
对，“收割者”上的导弹
Yes, a missile fired from an RPA

593
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,900
就是作为出现这种情况的
is part of an agreed contingency plan

594
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,480
应急计划的一部分
in circumstances like this.

595
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,860
我们能够进行攻击？
Do we have permission to proceed?

596
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,860
不，这种计划在没有得到国会的授权前
No. Such a plan should not have been signed off by the PM

597
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,110
首相是不能授权的
without the authority of Parliament.

598
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,370
战略操作本来通常就不在内阁进行讨论
Operational issues are not generally discussed at Cabinet,

599
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,620
毫无疑问，也不会在国会讨论
and certainly not at Parliament.

600
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,870
我很清楚草案，我说的是应该怎么做
I know the protocol. I'm talking about what should be happening.

601
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,410
安吉拉，在我看来，对于一次袭击来说
Angela, in my view, all the legal criteria

602
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,210
它已经符合了所有法律要件
for an attack have been met.

603
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,340
也就是说，这是军事需要
Namely, this is a military necessity,

604
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,670
没有其他合理的选择
there is no reasonable alternative,

605
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,300
而且我们被迫消除威胁
and the force to be used is in proportion to the threat.

606
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,720
这么说，应该解决了你的疑问
That should answer your question.

607
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,090
并没有，乔治
It does not, George.

608
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,430
历史上曾经有过一艘由英国驾驶的无人机袭击一个
Has there ever been a British-led drone attack on a city

609
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,100
未在交战中的友国的城市？
in a friendly country that is not at war?

610
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,770
上将？
General?

611
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,400
我想没有，是的
I do not believe so, no.

612
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,820
那我们怎么能认可它？
Then how can we sanction it?

613
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,370
重新生成这些无人机上的导弹
Generate new damage rings for the compound

614
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,910
所形成的破坏圈
with an assessment of the payload on those jackets.

615
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,910
- 是，长官  - 立刻
Yes, ma'am. Right now.

616
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,170
- 沃什上校  - 上校
- Colonel Walsh. - Colonel.

617
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,840
我能直接和你的飞行员通话吗？
Can I speak to your pilot directly?

618
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,300
是的，长官，帮我接线
Yes, ma'am. Patch me through.

619
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,890
史蒂夫
Steve.

620
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,020
鲍威尔上校想和你直接谈谈，接吧
Colonel Powell wants to talk to you directly. Pick up.

621
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,360
长官
Ma'am.

622
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,610
中尉
Lieutenant.

623
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,950
你现在是我们消灭这些难题的最佳选择
You are now our best option to take these HVIs out.

624
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,870
现在，准备发射一枚AGM-14“狱火”导弹
Now, prepare to launch a single AGM-114 Hellfire

625
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,950
到目标房屋
on the target house.

626
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,580
- 是，长官  - 这是一个友国城市
Yes, ma'am. This is a friendly city,

627
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,250
所以，附带损害必须降至最低
so collateral damage must be kept to a minimum.

628
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,290
- 长官…  - 什么？
Ma'am... Yes?

629
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,630
我有一个ROE问题
I have an ROE question.

630
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,720
我们的政府是否知道
Is my government aware that we are

631
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
我们正在把一个持美国护照的人作为目标？
targeting a person with a US passport?

632
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,180
是的，是的，中尉
Yes. Yes, it is, Lieutenant.

633
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,020
我在SPINS上，什么也没看到
I didn't see anything in the SPINS about that.

634
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,850
中尉，我们已经有了新的交战规则
Lieutenant, we have new rules of engagement.

635
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,060
你是受保护的
You are covered.

636
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,810
动作必须快，所以准备好投弹吧
This is going to happen fast, so be ready to shoot.

637
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,270
是，长官
Yes, ma'am.

638
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,230
正在检查三十四项清单
Running the dash 34 checklist.

639
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,910
卡莉，准备好了就呼叫我
Carrie, call when ready.

640
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,700
你以前有发射过狱火吗？
You ever shot a Hellfire?

641
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,040
没有
No.

642
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,910
其他弹药呢？
Or anything?

643
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,670
没有，我只当了一年天眼
No. I've only ever been the eye.

644
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,420
你呢？
You?

645
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,170
我也没有
Me, too.

646
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,920
伙计们，看来今天是你们的幸运日
Looks like it's your lucky day today, guys.

647
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,180
保持冷静，好吗？谨慎点
Just stay cool, okay? Be all right.

648
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,300
是，长官
Yes, sir.

649
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,300
卡莉，准备好了就呼叫
Carrie, call when ready.

650
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,350
倾斜范围二点二万英尺
Slant range 22,000 feet.

651
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,020
高冲击角
High-impact angle.

652
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,480
准备好目标简报
Stand by for targeting brief.

653
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,650
准备
Ready.

654
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,490
安吉拉，我同意我们有被视为是
Angela, I agree, we are at risk of being perceived

655
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,860
在从事击杀政策的风险
as embarking on a shoot-to-kill policy.

656
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,700
但既然所有的法律条件都充分
But since all the legal criteria are sound,

657
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,200
我确定，我们必须允许继续这项军事行动
I believe we must allow this military action to continue.

658
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,370
法律上我们也许是安全的
Legally we may be safe,

659
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,210
但政治上，我们这好比是在越雷池
but politically we're walking into a minefield.

660
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,290
尤其是里面还包含了一名美国公民
Especially with an American citizen involved.

661
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,170
首相，是否允许？
Do I have permission, Minister?

662
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,590
呃…
Um...

663
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,930
考虑到这个情况，这是任务转变
Given the situation, that it is a change of mission,

664
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,350
现在成了用导弹袭击英国目标
that it is now a missile attack on a British subject,

665
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,480
两名英国目标，和一名美国公民
two British subjects, and an American citizen,

666
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,070
而且是在一个友国
and in a friendly country,

667
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,360
我认为唯一合理的做法是
I think it is only right and proper

668
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,820
向外交部长上报
that I refer this up to the Foreign Secretary.

669
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:03,700
首相，刚才的争论你听见了，而他没听见
Minister, you've heard the arguments, he hasn't.

670
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,750
而且交战规则意味着
And the rules of engagement mean that

671
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,960
首相已经认可了它
the Prime Minister has already approved it.

672
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
- 不…  - 因此
No... Therefore,

673
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,420
外交部长无需提出意见
the Foreign Secretary's input should not be rendered...

674
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,460
不，重点是我之前没有参与
No, the point is that I have not been party

675
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,720
任何与首相的
to any previous discussion with the Prime Minister

676
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,550
关于此类事件的讨论
about matters such as this,

677
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,970
反之，外交部长是肯定参与了的
whereas the Foreign Secretary undoubtedly has.

678
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,270
所以，向他上报是我的义务
So, actually, it is my duty to refer to him.

679
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,560
那我怎么回复鲍威尔上校？
And what am I telling Colonel Powell?

680
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,810
让她等！
Tell her to wait!

681
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,190
我的苍天！
Oh, Christ Almighty!

682
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:39,610
新加坡，国际武器贸易展销会
谢谢
Thank you.

683
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,870
作为英国政府的成员
As a member of the British government,

684
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,330
我很自豪地向大家介绍综合战场解决方案
I am proud to introduce Integrated Battlefield Solutions,

685
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,000
一家英国公司带领了生产
a UK company leading the field in the production

686
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,040
自救，轻型的军事服装领域
of life-saving, lightweight military clothing.

687
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,630
在战场上保护我们的士兵
Protecting our soldiers in the field of battle

688
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,420
是我们政府对我们的军队
is at the core of my government's

689
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,260
恪守的核心
commitment to our armed forces.

690
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,180
“士兵安全第一” 就是我们为什么在…
"Soldier safety first" is why we 're in...

691
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,390
抱歉
Excuse me.

692
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:09,980
天呐，他要吐了！
Oh, God, he's gonna throw up!

693
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,520
我早跟他说，别吃大虾了
I told him not to eat the prawns.

694
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,900
抱歉
Excuse me.

695
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,190
很高兴向大家介绍IBS的常务董事
And so I'm very pleased to introduce you to IBS Managing Director.

696
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,740
奈杰尔·阿德勒先生
Mr. Nigel Adler.

697
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,570
非常感谢，外交部长
Thank you very much, Foreign Secretary.

698
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,370
今天我们要介绍坚固的防弹衣系统
Today we're introducing the Adamant Assault Body Armor System.

699
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,410
- 我们收到CDE了没？  - 是的，长官
Do we have that CDE yet? Yes, ma'am.

700
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,120
很好
Good.

701
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,170
如果我们以角落的这个房间为目标，也就是爆炸物的所在位置
If we target this corner room here, where the explosives are,

702
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,550
那个房间将发生百分百的死亡率
we would expect 100% mortality rate in that room

703
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,090
而其他房间的死亡率，则在百分之八十到百分之九十
and an 80 to 90% rate within the rest of the house.

704
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,390
集市是安全的
The market should be safe,

705
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,020
但街上的这片区域
but this area here in the street...

706
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,520
死亡率是百分之六十五到百分之七十五
A 65 to 75% rate.

707
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,190
那就是狱火的武力
That's just the Hellfire.

708
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,400
如果我们将爆炸背心计算在内
If we factor in the explosives in the vests,

709
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,280
那这片区域的损害范围将更大
we're looking at even more extensive damage way out to this area here.

710
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,450
但我无法精确计算那个范围
But I can't accurately estimate that yield.

711
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,070
但我们要包括那屋里
But we would be containing that payload in the vests

712
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,450
背心里的弹药，对吗？
within those walls, right?

713
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,620
附加损害远远达不到
Far less collateral damage

714
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,790
伤害集市里的人群
than them going off in a crowded shopping mall.

715
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,500
是的，没错
Yes. Of course.

716
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,830
对，谢谢
Yeah. Thank you.

717
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,960
显然，没有人在避免做出决定
Obvious to anyone not trying to avoid making a decision.

718
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:26,390
和马来西亚贸易部长的会议在四点半
The meeting with the Malaysian Trade Minister is now at 4:30.

719
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,220
你得替我去了
You'll have to do it for me.

720
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,100
但是，先生，我们来这的整个重点是…
But, sir, the whole point of us being here...

721
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,640
对，也许你可以吃片抗过敏药
Yeah, maybe if you take an Eezi Tum.

722
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,690
听着，我现在必须回酒店
Look. I need to go back to the hotel now.

723
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,480
杰克，这交通阻塞是怎么回事？
Jack, what's the holdup?

724
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,440
抱歉，先生，我已经在尽力联系他了
I'm sorry, sir, I'm trying to reach him.

725
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,740
首相，拖延决定
Minister, the consequences of delay

726
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,070
也许对大量市民们来说是致命的
may be fatal to scores of civilians.

727
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,620
上将，我很清楚这点
I'm well aware of that, General,

728
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,410
但得到他的认可，对我来说，是合理程序
but it is the proper procedure for me to seek his approval.

729
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:54,250
如果这些人现在分开乘坐汽车离开
If these men leave now, in separate vehicles...

730
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,670
那外面停了两辆车
There are two vehicles outside,

731
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,790
我们只有能力跟踪一辆
we have the ability to follow only one.

732
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,750
我们只有一个天眼
We have only one eye in the sky.

733
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,800
你在地面上的特工们应该可以拦截吧？
Surely you have agents on the ground who could intercept?

734
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,840
拦截城市街头的自杀炸弹袭击者？
Intercept a suicide bomber on a city street?

735
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,050
我们是想最大程度的减少附带损伤
We're trying to minimize collateral damage.

736
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,100
肖曼5-0，北2-0
Showman 5-0, North 2-0.

737
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,010
我发出攻击命令后，你必须
When I give the order to attack, you have to

738
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,640
让你的人立即离开
get your man out of there immediately.

739
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,230
我们大概三分钟就会到达
He'll have about three minutes.

740
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,690
明白
Understood.

741
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:51,600
我们一切正常，导弹状态稳定
We are greened up. Missile status is ready.

742
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,230
只要选择目标，编码，准备完毕
Left selected for single fire, coded and ready.

743
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,350
待命
Stand by.

744
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,150
你可以测试激光了
You're cleared to test the laser.

745
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,900
激光打开，状态良好
Laser on. Good laser.

746
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:17,290
快啊，长官
Oh, come on, sir.

747
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:19,210
我们需要许可，他们不会永远呆在那房子里
We need a go. They ain't gonna be in that house forever.

748
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,290
镇静点，好吗
Just keep it together, all right?

749
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,670
是
Yes, sir.

750
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,200
我们需要作出决定，部长
We need a decision, Minister.

751
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,540
现在
Right now.

752
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,160
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

753
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,080
外交部的电话
I have the Foreign Secretary.

754
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,670
嗯哼？
Mmm-hmm?

755
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,340
布莱恩来电话
It's Brian on your phone.

756
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,220
- 哪个布莱恩  - 伍德代尔
- Brian who? - Woodale.

757
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,380
他要什么？我现在没法跟他说话
What does he want? I can't talk to him now.

758
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,010
很紧急，他在眼镜蛇
It's urgent. He's at Cobra.

759
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,400
检查表对照完毕，安全检查已经完毕
The checklist is complete. Safety checklist complied with.

760
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,570
已捕获攻击低点
Desired point of impact is captured.

761
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,030
ROE还没回应，我们正在待命
ROE is pending. We're standing by for clearance.

762
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,910
先生们，没有美国国务院的许可
Gentlemen, I cannot authorize a missile attack on an American citizen

763
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,450
我不能授权攻击美国公民
without the approval of the US Secretary of State.

764
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,620
先生，国务卿在中国
Sir, the Secretary of State is in China.

765
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,160
那就找到他
Then track him down.

766
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,040
外交部，我是本森将军
Foreign Secretary, it's General Benson here.

767
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,170
恕我直言
With respect,

768
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,590
这件事已经经过了美国总统的解释
this has already been cleared at American Presidential level.

769
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:50,380
我们现在的状况在十分钟后可能导致…
We have a situation here which could result in massive loss of life

770
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,590
大规模人员伤亡
in the next 10 minutes.

771
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,600
那就用那十分钟争取到国务卿的许可
Then use those 10 minutes and get the Secretary's approval.

772
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,890
那就是我的决定，将军
That is my decision, General.

773
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,270
我去联系北京大使馆
I'll get onto the Embassy in Beijing.

774
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,850
我最好跟他谈谈，借过
I'd better speak to him. Excuse me.

775
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,110
凯特，把我的笔记本连上线
Kate. Get me linked in on my laptop. Sir?

776
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,200
- 是  - 这就去
Yes, sir. Got it.

777
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,450
噢
Oh!

778
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,340
好吧，太尴尬了，对不起
Okay, that was embarrassing. Sorry.

779
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,920
准备好了？等我一下
Ready? Just give me a second.

780
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:36,890
国务卿先生，乔丹·里卡多打来的电话
Mr. Secretary, I have Jordan Ricardo on the line.

781
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:37,970

Who?

782
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,310
北京大使馆的乔丹·里卡多

783
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,720

784
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,310
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

785
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,480
先生，我们接到英国打来的电话，关于一个行动的
Sir, we've received a call from the British regarding an operation.

786
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,700
为什么要拿这种事情来浪费我的时间
Why the hell are you wasting my time referring this to me?

787
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,030
不，他的公民身份不能保护他
No, his citizenship does not protect him.

788
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,530
通过加入青年党已经宣布了
By joining Al-Shabab he has declared

789
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,040
他是美国的敌人

790
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,290
听我说
Listen to me.

791
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,000
告诉英国人，要是他们真的
Tell the British, if they really do have

792
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,000
在东非发现了第二、四和五号人物
two, four, and five on the East Africa list in their sights,

793
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,130
我们完全支持他们攻击
they have our full support to strike.

794
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,420
对，这三个都在总统的名单上
Yes, all three are on the President's list.

795
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,970
好，来吧，耶
Okay, let's go! Yeah!

796
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,680
我一定要赢你
I'm gonna get you, Jian.

797
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,730
国务卿许可了
The Secretary of State has given his permission.

798
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,950
可以开始了
You may proceed.

799
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,530
谢谢，部长
Thank you, Minister.

800
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,420

00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,590
谢谢
Thank you.

802
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,190
夫人
Ma'am.

803
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:11,770
中尉，可以消灭目标
Lieutenant, you have clearance to prosecute the target.

804
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,940
马上动手
Do it now.

805
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,610
是，女士
Yes, ma'am.

806
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:17,950
准备发射地狱火导弹
Prepare to launch Hellfire.

807
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,130
我以为最糟糕的部分已经过去了
I think I'm through the worst of it.

808
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,220
出什么事了
What's happening?

809
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,470
国务卿同意了
The Secretary gave his permission.

810
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,770
他们在两万英尺高空有架掠食者
They have a Reaper at 20,000 feet

811
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,270
还在房间里装了微型监控
and a micro RPA inside the house.

812
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,080
武器准备完毕
Weapon is armed.

813
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,080
一切正常，激光状态良好
All green. Good laser.

814
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,790
DPI为房间中心
DPI is the center of the room.

815
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,880
收到，正校准目标
Copy. Crosshairs on it now.

816
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:17,710
待命
Stand by.

817
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,680
- 确认PAX状态  - 一切正常
- Confirm PAX status. - All good.

818
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,050
祝你好运
Good luck.

819
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,730
三
Three.

820
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,820
二
Two.

821
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,120
那是个孩子吗？放大
Is that a kid? Zoom in.

822
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,920
我给她时间走过去
I'll give her time to walk through.

823
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,840
夫人？
Ma'am?

824
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,260
你可以开火，中尉
You are cleared to engage, Lieutenant.

825
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,100
她停下了
She stopped.

826
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,880
中尉，我们只有这次机会，不要弄丢了
Lieutenant, we have this one opportunity. Let's not lose it.

827
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,050
夫人，她在卖饼
Ma'am, uh, she's selling bread.

828
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,130
天啊
Jesus.

829
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,720
那些人就要离开了，马上发射
Those men are about to disperse. Engage now.

830
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,050
夫人，我明白我们获得许可了
Ma'am, I understand we have clearance.

831
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,140
如果看到HVI移动我会发射
I will fire if I see the HVIs moving

832
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,310
或者等这女孩离开爆炸范围
or when this girl's out of the frag radius,

833
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:53,730
但我想给她个离开的机会
but I want to give her a chance to get out of the way.

834
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,390
中尉，你已经获得许可
Lieutenant, you have clearance.

835
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,060
这图像中包含的威胁比你想的要大
There is a lot more at stake than you see here in this image.

836
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,690
夫人，我需要将女孩包含在内后
Ma'am, I need you to run the collateral damage estimate

837
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,070
再进行一次附带损伤估算
again with this girl out front.

838
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:06,490
情况没有变化，中尉，你可以发射
The situation has not changed, Lieutenant. You are cleared to engage.

839
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,490
我们怎么办？
What do we do?

840
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,620
重复，可以发射
I repeat, you are cleared to engage.

841
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,760
鲍威尔上校，夫人
Colonel Powell, ma'am...

842
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,720
我是负责发射武器的驾驶员
I'm the pilot in command responsible for releasing the weapon.

843
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,980
我有权要求再次进行CDE
I have the right to ask for the CDE to be run again.

844
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,690
在那之前我不会发射武器
I will not release my weapon until that happens.

845
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,700
那就再做CDE
We will rerun CDE.

846
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,950
操
Fuck.

847
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,080
现在是否是“武器待命”
Do I understand we are now on "weapons hold"?

848
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,960
武器待命
Weapons hold.

849
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,580
- 中尉，重新做CDE  - 是，长官
- Sergeant, rerun CDE. - Yes, ma'am.

850
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,420
史蒂夫，你在干什么？
Steve, what the fuck are you doing?

851
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,920
你刚拿规定甩了一个上校一脸
You just threw the rule book at a colonel.

852
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,510
长官，我会管理好武器
Sir, I am safing up the weapon

853
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:12,430
直到你给我带有新CDE结果的许可
until you read me a new clearance with a new CDE.

854
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:19,940
干得好
Well done.

855
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,660
肖曼5-0，北部2-0
Showman 5-0, North 2-0,

856
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,540
能不能让你那里开甲壳虫的人
can you get your man with a beetle in there

857
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,460
去买下这女孩的饼，让她离开那
to buy this girl's bread, get her out of there?

858
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,610
见鬼
Shit!

859
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:30,320
操
Fuck!

860
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,860
能把视线转回房子上吗
Can you get me back to the house?

861
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,440
是，上校
Yes, Colonel.

862
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:56,530
卡莉，别管他，回到目标上
Carrie, forget him. Get back to the target.

863
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,280
卡莉
Carrie.

864
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,120
回到目标上
Back to the target.

865
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,850
天啊，她会再卖一次的
Jesus, she's gonna sell them again.

866
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,450
我们还能让谁去买饼？
Who else can we get to buy the bread?

867
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,910
别管饼了，中士
Forget the bread, Sergeant.

868
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,870
要是我们的人没把整个行动搞砸，就算运气好了
We'll be lucky if our man hasn't blown the whole operation.

869
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:47,410
哈罗德，在法律上我们怎么样
Harold, where are we legally?

870
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,870
- 加上小女孩？  - 对
With the girl? Yes.

871
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,460
- 有问题吗  - 呃
Are we in the clear? Uh...

872
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,920
我还是建议转交上级处理
Again, I would refer up.

873
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,550
不，不，我是问你
No. No. I'm asking you.

874
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,590
我们不能再拖延这次行动了
We cannot hold up this operation any longer.

875
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,300
我们需要采取所有合理的措施，来最小化附带损伤
We need to take all reasonable steps to minimize collateral damage.

876
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,390
如果我们买下她的饼那…
If we're buying her bread then...

877
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:03,550
我们不会
We're not.

878
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,760
我们不会买她的饼，那结束了
We're not buying her bread. That's over.

879
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:09,140
很多孩子的生命处在危险当中，而这只是一个女孩
Many children's lives are at risk. This is just one girl.

880
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:13,060
我们能不能发射？行还是不行？快点，做个决定
Are we clear to engage, yes or no? Come on, make a decision.

881
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:15,980
恕我直言，长官，这些决定不是我来做的
With respect, ma'am, I don't make those decisions.

882
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,030
我是来给你法律方面的建议
I'm here to advise you on the law!

883
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:19,780
法律不是来阻挠你
The law is not here to get in your way,

884
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,610
而是来保护你，保护你的目标的
it is here to protect you, and to protect your target.

885
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,030
别对我说教，哈罗德
Don't lecture me, Harold!

886
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,870
长官，必要以及相关的法律问题
Ma'am, the legal questions of necessity

887
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:27,120
都已经解决了
and proportionality are almost certainly met.

888
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,660
但为了保护你
But for the protection of you,

889
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,620
以及保护那个女孩
and for the protection of that girl,

890
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,540
我建议把问题上交给司法部长
I would refer up to the Attorney General.

891
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,130
本森
Benson.

892
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,970
弗兰克，我能跟司法部长说话吗
Frank, may I speak to the Attorney General?

893
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:43,010
接通司法部长
Connect us to Colonel Powell.

894
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,350
乔治
George.

895
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,270
她想跟你说话
She wants to talk to you.

896
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:52,480
说吧，凯瑟琳
Go ahead, Katherine.

897
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,900
长官，我们的律师说这女孩的存在
Sir, our lawyer says the girl's presence

898
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:59,110
不会改变我们行动的合法性
has not necessarily altered the legitimacy of our operation.

899
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:01,320
但他需要确认
But he does need that confirmed.

900
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:05,280
我们有没有估计她可能发生什么？
Do we have an assessment of what might happen to her?

901
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,910
目标估算她有百分之六十五到百分之七十五的可能性
The targeteer assesses a 65 to 75% chance

902
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,580
遭遇致命伤害
of fatal injury should we proceed.

903
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,540
但她同样关乎八十名…
But he has also assessed a projected loss of life

904
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,790
男女老沙的安危
of up to 80 men, women and children

905
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,460
如果爆炸背心在城市区域引爆
if the vests are detonated in an urban area.

906
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,920
虽然这只是猜测
Now that's a guess, of course,

907
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,840
但我们应该假设他们打算攻击人口密集区域
but we should assume they intend to target a crowded location.

908
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,640
百分之六十五的几率
A 65% assessment

909
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,850
要求我们尽一切可能
requires us to do whatever we can

910
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:28,760
让她能够离开现场
to enable her to be removed from the scene.

911
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:30,850
我们在有限的时间里
We have done what we can for her

912
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,060
已经进了一切所能
in the time available to us.

913
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,230
如果我们继续等，他们离开
If we wait and they leave,

914
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:35,190
我们就无法再控制情况了
we will no longer have control of the situation.

915
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,310
我们必须现在攻击
We must strike now.

916
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,440
没有法律解释这样的情况
There is no law covering a situation quite like this.

917
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,530
趁街上没人发射导弹
It's one thing to release a missile whilst the street is clear

918
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:44,860
并希望没人会上那条街是一回事
in the hope that it will remain so.

919
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:46,450
但知道这个女孩最严重的后果
It's quite another thing knowing that

920
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,280
就是遭遇致命损伤
this girl will,

921
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,080
或是起码受重伤
at worst, be fatally injured

922
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,370
则是另一回事
and, at best, severely injured.

923
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,590
很抱歉，我不同意你在诺斯伍德的律师的分析
So, I'm sorry, I disagree with the assessment of your lawyer at Northwood.

924
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:59,670
同意
Agreed.

925
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,550
希望“她是个贴心的小女孩”这评价没有包含你的判断
I hope the fact that she's a sweet little girl is not clouding your judgment.

926
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:07,010
如果这些人离开
Dozens of other little girls' lives

927
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,850
几十个其他小女孩的生命就会有危险
are at stake if these men leave.

928
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,390
对不起，但白宫的吉丽安·古德曼小姐
I'm sorry, but we have a Miss Jillian Goldman from the White House

929
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:13,770
要求接入通话
asking to be patched in.

930
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:15,350
- 谁？  - 吉丽安·古德曼
Who? Jillian Goldman.

931
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,810
她是美国国家安全委员会的高级法律顾问
She's a Senior Legal Adviser at the US National Security Council.

932
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,770
国务卿把情况向她简要介绍了
She's been briefed by the Secretary of State.

933
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,280
接过来
Put her through.

934
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:28,070
下午好，谢谢你们允许我评论
Good afternoon and thank you for allowing me to comment.

935
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,740
是的，谢谢你加入我们
Yeah, thanks for joining us.

936
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,910
你们也知道作为军队成员
As the military members of your committee know,

937
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:35,250
我们有个与附带损失评估相关的评分系统
we have a point system that takes into account collateral damage

938
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:38,460
来推断一个行动究竟是否合法
to deduce what is and what is not a legal strike.

939
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,630
我直接跟你说吧
And let me tell you categorically

940
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,760
这新情况的存在
that the existence of this new circumstance

941
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,550
不会让我们超出合法军事行动的范畴
does not push us beyond a legitimate military action.

942
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,800
我们的这一行动远远称不上“有争议”
We are way off what we would consider a dispute in this matter.

943
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:52,220
古德曼小姐，我们对附带损伤这个问题
Miss Goldman, we have a somewhat different approach

944
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,930
有不同的看法
to the question of collateral damage.

945
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,930
先生，你必须现在行动，你有两个人
Sir, you must act now. You have two men

946
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,060
即将开始自杀式任务
about to embark on a suicide mission.

947
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,940
你已经监控了总统东非清除名单上的
You have number two, four, and five

948
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,780
第二、四和五号人物
on the President's East Africa kill list in your sights,

949
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,440
你要因为一个附带损失
and you are putting the whole mission at risk

950
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,990
就让整个任务遇到危机？
because of one collateral damage issue?

951
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:09,450
我意识到这次任务是你发起的
I realize that this mission is your call,

952
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:11,120
如果你让这些人去
but there would be some mighty angry people

953
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,370
把一个购物中心炸上天，那你将面对…
here at the White House and at the Pentagon, and out there in the world

954
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,210
来自白宫，五角大楼
if you allow these people to leave

955
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,660
以及世界各地的人民的愤怒
and blow a shopping mall to kingdom come.

956
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:20,130
对不起，外交部长想加入
I'm sorry. We have the Foreign Secretary wanting to join.

957
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:22,590
好的，感谢你的意见，古德曼小姐
Right. We appreciate your thoughts, Miss Goldman.

958
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:23,670
谢谢
Thank you.

959
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,800
谢谢你
Thank you.

960
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,720
大家下午好，请原谅我这身衣服
Good afternoon, everybody. Excuse my appearance.

961
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,890
这边是晚上，我还有点水土不服
It's night here, and I have a bout of food poisoning.

962
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:32,930
抱歉把你从病床上拉起来
Sorry to drag you from your sick bed.

963
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,470
没错
That's quite all right.

964
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,310
乔治，我理解的是对的吗
George, do I understand this correctly?

965
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:39,440
关于等待那女孩
There's a legal argument for waiting

966
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,770
给她个机会把饼卖完，还存在法律上的争论？
and giving this girl a chance to sell her bread?

967
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,110
是的
Yes, there is.

968
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,780
但相反的，这不意味着
But, conversely, it does not mean

969
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,650
现在发射武器
that there is not also a legal argument

970
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,530
就不会带来法律问题
for releasing the weapon now.

971
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:50,990
请原谅，我不知道这对我有什么帮助
Forgive me, I'm not sure that helps me.

972
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:54,830
外交部长，现在采取军事行动是必须的
Foreign Secretary, there is a military necessity for acting now.

973
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:59,330
在我们看来，他们随时会离开那幢房子
In our view, they'll be making a move from that house at any moment.

974
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:04,040
先生们，有什么任务是合法的推荐给我的？
Gentlemen, what action is being legally recommended to me?

975
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,050
詹姆斯，法律争论是我们可以等
James, the legal argument is that we could wait,

976
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:08,840
但不需要等的
but we need not wait.

977
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:12,010
军事行动方面的争议则是不能等
And the military argument is that we should not wait.

978
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:13,430
- 对吗  - 没错
Right? Exactly.

979
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,310
是我建议不应该拖延
It's my recommendation that we should not delay

980
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,360
执行这次任务
in proceeding with this mission.

981
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,230
如果现在不行动，就会冒着
If we don't act now, we risk losing

982
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,820
失去八十条人命的风险
the lives of up to 80 people.

983
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,030
这些死亡你只能估算
You can only assume those deaths.

984
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:32,530
能确定的是，如果我们现在行动
What is certain is that if we do act now,

985
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:34,320
这一个女孩会很惨
this one girl will suffer.

986
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:38,580
你会救她，然后搭上另外八十条性命？
And you would save her and risk killing 80 others?

987
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,710
对，我会救她然后冒那个险
Yes, I would save her and take that risk.

988
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,460
那就是我会做的
That is what I would do.

989
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,720
安吉拉，到时候电视报道
Angela, is it you or me who will be invited onto the Today program

990
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,430
商场炸弹袭击中八十人丧生
to explain why we knew of the attack

991
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,140
而我们却没有阻止
on a shopping center that killed 80 people,

992
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,100
他们会请的人是你还是我？
but chose to do nothing to stop it?

993
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,270
是你，詹姆斯
You, James.

994
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:04,940
但说实话，从政治上说，我更愿意指出
But frankly, politically, I'd rather point to Al-Shabab

995
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,730
青年党才是杀死八十人的凶手
as murderers of 80 people shopping

996
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,570
而不是为我们的军队发起的
than have to defend a drone attack

997
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,530
害死一名无辜女孩的无人机攻击辩护
by our forces that kills an innocent child.

998
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:22,540
詹姆斯，安吉拉这个观点很明确
James, Angela makes a compelling point.

999
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:28,250
如果青年党杀死八十个人，我们就能赢得道义
If Al-Shabab kill 80 people, we win the propaganda war.

1000
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,170
如果我们杀一个孩子，他们就赢
If we kill one child, they do.

1001
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,100
那我们什么都不做？
So, we don't do it?

1002
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:39,850
她有个客人
She's got a customer.

1003
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:18,010
我建议你盯着另一个屏幕
I suggest you keep your eyes on the other screen.

1004
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,140
恕我直言，外交部长
With respect, Foreign Secretary,

1005
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,890
另外八十条人命也包括无辜的孩子
are the lives of 80 people, including innocent children,

1006
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,020
为了赢得道义真的需要付出这么大的代价吗
really worth the price of winning the propaganda war?

1007
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,190
将军，如果我们攻击，我们攻击的视频会泄露吗
General, if we go ahead, might footage of our attack be leaked?

1008
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,950
长官，来自掠食者的视频是绝对安全的
Sir, the footage from the Reaper is completely secure.

1009
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,820
将军，如果我们不再等一会
General, I would feel uncomfortable

1010
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,530
我会觉得不安的
if we did not at least wait a little longer.

1011
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:44,710
如果我们攻击，视频泄露这女孩被杀
If we go ahead and footage is leaked and this girl is killed,

1012
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:47,210
我认为国内民众会非常反感
then, I think, the country would be most disturbed.

1013
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:49,000
外交部长，我们的任务就是
Foreign Secretary, it is our task

1014
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,840
做出正确的军事决定
to make the right military decision.

1015
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,500
我们不能参与到将来视频网站上
We cannot engage in an argument

1016
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:54,920
可能发生的争论之中
about possible future postings on YouTube.

1017
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:58,930
恕我直言，将军，那些网站上的视频连革命都能煽动
With respect, General, revolutions are fueled by postings on YouTube.

1018
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,370
我认为既然后果会这么严重
I think the consequences are such

1019
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:22,280
我们需要获得首相的许可
that we need clearance from the PM.

1020
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:26,540
詹姆斯，你有作出决定的权力
James! You have the authority to make a decision!

1021
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:28,460
不，我告诉你，你得把问题教给他
No, I'm telling you. You need to take it to him.

1022
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,250
先生，首相今天下午要在斯特拉斯堡发表演讲
Sir, the PM is giving a speech in Strasbourg this afternoon,

1023
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,340
可能不太好打断
and may not be easily interrupted.

1024
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,090
这就交给你解决了，杰克
I'll leave you to sort that one out, Jack.

1025
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:37,550
是，先生
Yes, sir.

1026
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,550
我去联系他
I'll track him down.

1027
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,690
喂
Yes?

1028
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:33,650
长官，怎么了
Ma'am, what's happening?

1029
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,650
你在待命中，中尉
You're on standby, Lieutenant.

1030
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,690
是
Yes, ma'am.

1031
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,240
还在踢皮球
Still on the chain.

1032
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,760
还剩两块面饼
Two loaves left.

1033
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,220
我们得等等
We gotta wait now.

1034
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,100
快啊
Come on.

1035
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,400
长官，电池没电了
Ma'am, the battery died.

1036
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,480
我们的人倒下了，我们没法替换
Our man is down. We can't replace it.

1037
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,070
天啊
Christ.

1038
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:50,120
- 出什么事了  - 电池
What happened? Battery.

1039
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,530
噢，天啊
Oh, for God's sake!

1040
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,500
现在我们不知道他们在干什么了
Now we have no idea what they're doing.

1041
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,580
我也许有个办法
I might have a solution.

1042
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:58,830
如果我的瞄准手能够计算出
If my targeteer can calculate us

1043
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,090
女孩遭遇附带损伤的几率在百分之五十以下
coming in under 50% for collateral damage on the girl,

1044
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:03,670
你那边能够获得许可吗
do you think you can get approval at your end?

1045
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,340
是的
Yes, I do.

1046
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:10,260
谢谢
Thanks.

1047
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,020
电池
Battery.

1048
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,570
赛德中士
Sergeant Saddiq,

1049
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,610
我们想把这边这条街的附带损伤
we're looking to present the collateral damage

1050
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:30,410
算出致命度在百分之四十到百分之五十之间
in the street, in this area right here, as 45 to 50% fatality.

1051
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,280
你认为那可能吗
Do you think that's possible?

1052
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:35,160
我算出来的是六十五到七十五
I've calculated a 65 to 75.

1053
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,620
是的，当然
Yes, yes. Sure, sure,

1054
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:39,000
但你知道，如果我们把导弹瞄准这里和这里
but, you know, if we put the payload here, or here,

1055
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,540
或者也许这里
or maybe here,

1056
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,710
那就能确保目标致命
well, then we could guarantee the target fatality,

1057
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,880
但能降低损伤
but we could reduce the collateral.

1058
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:50,890
或者也许能让导弹瞄准这里
Or maybe we could target the missile right here, look.

1059
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:52,800
是，长官
Yes, ma'am.

1060
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,220
你能不能…
Will you just...

1061
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,190
尽你一切所能救这女孩的命
You just do whatever you can to save this girl's life.

1062
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:01,770
我就交给你了
I'll leave it with you.

1063
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:04,610
是
Yes, ma'am.

1064
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,320
如果我们要向内罗毕的人宣布
If we have to announce to the people of Nairobi

1065
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,990
我们知道一切但没有行动…
that we knew everything but did nothing...

1066
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,750
我们不需要宣布我们知道任何事，将军
We do not have to announce that we knew anything, General.

1067
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,290
首相要我们尽可能减小伤亡
The PM asks that we do what we can to minimize casualties.

1068
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,090
- 该死的懦夫  - 你以为我们在干什么
Bloody coward! What do you think we're doing?

1069
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,250
你怎么理解这话，乔治
How do you interpret that, George?

1070
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,260
部长，我们不能让受命于政府的委员会
Minister, we cannot have military decisions

1071
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:30,300
来做出军事方面的决定
dictated by government committees.

1072
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:33,350
更不能在军事行动的每个阶段都停下来
Nor can we put on hold a military operation at every stage

1073
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:35,140
等待法律许可
for legal clarification.

1074
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,600
你让我们什么时候去打仗，我们就打
You tell us when to go to war, we conduct the war,

1075
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,850
剩下的你来处理
you deal with the aftermath.

1076
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,940
要那么简单就好了
If only it were that simple.

1077
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:57,660
抱歉又要催你了，中士，但我们没多少时间
Sorry to rush you, Sergeant, but we don't have much time.

1078
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,120
是
Yes, ma'am.

1079
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,790
长官
Ma'am.

1080
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:10,050
- 把攻击点调到这里  - 嗯哼
Adjusting the point of impact to here... Mmm-hmm.

1081
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:12,880
致命几率就只有百分之四十五到百分之六十五
There is a 45 to 65% possibility of fatality.

1082
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:14,590
- 百分之六十五  - 对
65%? Yes.

1083
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:18,390
不，我需要把计算结果降到百分之五十以下
No, I need that calculation to be below 50%.

1084
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:23,190
也许能评估一下
Perhaps there could be an assessment

1085
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:25,560
目标点在这里的损伤
of the impact of the damage right here.

1086
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:29,360
计算结果已经是我认为最低的了
That calculation is already at the lowest limit of what I believe is possible.

1087
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,530
要是让导弹击中这里呢
What if you put the missile there?

1088
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:34,570
我还是必须
I would still have to make that

1089
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,160
把可能上限定为百分之六十五
a 65% possibility on the upper limit.

1090
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,000
中士，我们要让行动成功
Sergeant, we need to make this work.

1091
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,330
你明白吗
Do you understand?

1092
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,880
我们已经锁定了目标
We are locked into this kill chain.

1093
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,380
我们必须作出决定，有…
- We have to make a decision. - There are...

1094
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:55,390
有很多条人命在危险中
There are many lives at risk.

1095
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,270
女士
Ma'am.

1096
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,230
我认为
I think...

1097
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,440
我认为如果我
I think if I

1098
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,610
把这里作为攻击点
make this the point of impact, then...

1099
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:12,490
在那里可以预测出百分之四十五的致命可能性
There I could predict a 45% possibility of fatality.

1100
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:13,990
- 那是有可能的  - 百分之四十五？
That might be possible. 45%?

1101
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:15,450
- 有可能  - 好的，太好了
Possibly. Good man. Good man.

1102
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:17,070
我告诉眼镜蛇
I'll put that to Cobra.

1103
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,120
长官
Ma'am.

1104
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:23,460
这只是个估计
It's just an estimate.

1105
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,870
对，当然，我明白
Yes, of course. Of course, I understand.

1106
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:31,130
在这种情况下任何计算都只可能是估计
In these circumstances, any calculation can only be a speculation.

1107
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:32,380
别担心
Don't worry.

1108
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,470
这不会让你负担任何责任
This puts you beyond any culpability.

1109
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,800
谢谢，谢谢，中士
Thank you. Thank you, Sergeant.

1110
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,100
谢谢，长官
Thanks, ma'am.

1111
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,730
长官，我已经收到瞄准手的评估
Sir, I have a revised assessment from the targeteer.

1112
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,110
如果你看图表
If you would look at the diagram.

1113
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,240
把导弹瞄准这里
By targeting the missile here,

1114
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,990
在女孩所处的这个区域
there is an estimated 45% chance of fatality

1115
