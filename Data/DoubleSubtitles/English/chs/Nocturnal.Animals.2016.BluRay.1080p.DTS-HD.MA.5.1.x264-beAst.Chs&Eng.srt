12
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,530
亲爱的 顺便一提 你这样袒胸露乳
And by the way, honey, with all this decolletage

13
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,820
难道不应该对他
you should be getting a lot

14
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,870
产生更大的诱惑吗
more dickoletage than what he has to offer.

15
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,800
但是我想了一下
And as I can recall it,

16
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
是你告诉我 他高潮的时候
you were the one that told me that when he came,

17
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,470
精液和椰子汁一样稀
it was as thin as coconut water.

18
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,370
亲爱的 要是我的话肯定和他分了
Honey, that's a deal breaker for me.

19
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,140
的确很稀
It was that thin.

20
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,040
好吧 物以稀为贵嘛
Well, I see we're settling for less nowadays.

21
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,280
真是不可理喻
That's beyond.

22
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,320
莫罗太太 有你的包裹
Mrs. Morrow, a package arrived for you.

23
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,560
我今天早上在邮筒里看见的
I found it in the mailbox this morning.

24
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,290
我能问一下这个周末您属意谁值班吗
May I ask you who you'd like on duty this weekend?

25
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,330
呃 其实 不如这个周末大家都放假
Um, actually, why don't you give everybody the weekend off?

26
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,660
- 真的吗  - 嗯 真的
- Are you sure?  - Yeah, yeah.

27
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,670
我跟先生可能会去海滩别墅 呃
We might go to the beach house and, uh,

28
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,240
如果不去 独自享受周末也不错
if not, it might be nice to have a weekend alone.

29
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,640
- 我会通知其他人的  - 谢谢
- I'll let everyone know.  - Thank you.

30
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,580
喔 该死
Oh, damn it.

31
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,150
- 克里斯多夫  - 怎么了
- Christopher?  - Yes?

32
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,480
抱歉 你能帮我打开它吗 我刚被纸划伤了
I'm sorry. Can you help me open this? I just got a paper cut.

33
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,420
- 当然可以 这个放着我来  - 谢谢
- Yeah, of course. Here, let me do it.  - Thank you.

34
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,990
嗯嗯 我只是 被纸划了一个口子
Yeah, yeah. I just... A paper cut.

35
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,990
- 有一个便笺  - 你读一下
- There's a note.  - You can read it.

36
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,260
“亲爱的苏珊 ”
"Dear Susan, I've written

37

“这部小说和我们当初在一起时写的那些”
"It's different from the kind of things that I was writing

39
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,340
“不一样”
"When we were together."

40
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,440
你继续
Go ahead.

41
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,110
“分手的时候你给了我所需的创作灵感”
"In the end you left me with the inspiration that I needed

42
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,040
“用心创作”
"To write from the heart.

43
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,450
“我希望你是第一个读者”
"I wanted you to be the first to read it,

44
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,450
“所以我给你寄了一份样本”
so I'm sending along a proof.

45

"And it would be good to see you after so long.

47
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,420
“我的手机号码和邮箱地址都在下面 爱德华”
"My cell number and email address are below. Edward."

48
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,460
谢谢
Thanks.

49
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,470
早 早上好
Morning. Good morning.

50
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,740
那是什么 爱德华寄给我的手稿
What's that? It's a manuscript Edward sent me.

51
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,440
他写了一部小说
He wrote a novel.

52
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,480
哪个爱德华
Edward who?

53
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,150
前夫爱德华 你记得他的
Edward, my first husband. You remember him.

54
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,380
我不知道他还会写作
I didn't know he could write.

55
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,550
不 你知道 我们在一起的时候他就在写一部小说
Yes, you did. He was writing a novel when you and I got together.

56
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,250
你只是不想记得
You just don't remember.

57
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,490
你们二十年来有联系过吗
Have you guys even talked in 20 years?

58
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,990
十九年
19.

59
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,830
没有 我几年前
No. I tried calling him a

60
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,000
试过打给他 但是他挂了我的电话
couple of years back, but he hung up on me.

61
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,170
我还以为他在达拉斯的预科学校教英文
I think he's teaching English at some prep school in Dallas.

62
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,000
真的很替他难过 他没有再婚
It's sad, really. He never remarried.

63
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,410
你昨晚去哪了 为什么没来艺廊
Where were you last night? You didn't come by the gallery.

64
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,440
这的很抱歉 我
I'm sorry. Really, I...

65
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,410
我离开办公室的时候晚宴就已经迟到了
By the time I left the office, I was late for my dinner and...

66
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,580
只会占用你十五分钟
It would have taken you 15 minutes.

67
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,820
十五分钟而已 对我却是意义重大
Fifteen minutes, and it would have meant a lot to me.

68
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,690
算了
Never mind.

69
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,420
- 你昨晚没上床睡觉  - 我不想吵醒你
- You didn't come to bed last night.  - I didn't wanna wake you.

70
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,460
哦
Yeah.

71
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,660
其实 我昨晚没睡 我为艺展开幕而焦虑
Well, I wasn't asleep. I was too wound up from the opening.

72
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,470
顺便说一下 进展得很顺利 显而易见
It went well, by the way. Apparently.

73
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,000
很棒 是
Good. Yeah.

74
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,540
我们去海滩别墅怎么样
Look, why don't you and I go to the beach?

75
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,280
我们可以今晚去 星期一回来
We can go tonight and come back on Monday.

76
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,880
或许我们需要二人世界 独享这个周末
Maybe if we just spent some time, just the two of us?

77
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,620
你为什么星期六还穿这件西装
Why are you wearing this blazer on a Saturday?

78
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,500
因为我要回公司
Because I gotta go back to the office,

79
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,040
然后去机场
and then I gotta go to the airport,

80
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,670
再然后回纽约
and then I gotta go back to New York.

81
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,130
你刚从那里回来 是 我知道
You just came from there. Yes, I know.

82
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,140
但是如果我想做成这笔交易就必须再回去
But I have to go again if I wanna get this deal done,

83
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,310
我不想再去推销别的东西
and I don't wanna have to sell anything else.

84
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,140
- 该死  - 没关系
- Shit.  - It's okay.

85
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,510
你知道吗 这件事的吊诡之处在于
You know, the strange thing is is,

86
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,080
我不太在意这次艺展
I don't really care about all this art.

87
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,760
- 听起来不像你  - 我知道 但是真的
- That doesn't sound like you.  - I know, but it's true.

88
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,490
我在意
I care.

89
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,490
它让我很生气
It pisses me off.

90
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,260
我知道你很在意
I know you do.

91
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,370
别担心 我可以在墙上挂满洛杉矶新人们的作品
Don't worry, I can fill the walls with some new la artists

92
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,600
大家会以为
and people will think we're

93
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,500
我们走在时尚前沿 而不是濒临破产
ahead of the curve instead of going broke.

94
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,010
你不用为此感到为难
You won't have to be embarrassed.

95
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,120
事情有没有好一点
Are things a little better?

96
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
他现在事业上正步履维艰
He's just having a hard time with his business right now.

97
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,630
卡洛斯跟我说了
Carlos told me.

98
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,960
还真是惊讶 我还以为我们隐藏得很好
I'm surprised. I thought we were hiding it pretty well.

99
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,370
如果哈顿知道大家都心知肚明一定会很沮丧
Hutton would be very upset to find out anybody knew.

100
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,800
他只是不喜欢服输
He just hates not to win.

101
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,400
你现在能入睡吗
Are you sleeping?

102
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,640
你打电话给我的心理药理学家了吗 打了吗
Did you call my psychopharmacologist? Did you call him?

103
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,310
你应该打给他 因为他简直就是个天才
You should call him, because he's a genius.

104
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,080
我真的很担心你
I'm worried about you, seriously.

105
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,610
你看我一眼 看着我
Just look at me for a second. Look at me.

106
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,250
上次我们聊天的时候你吓到我了
You scared me the last time we talked.

107
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,250
我没事
I'm fine.

108
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,320
我很好 我
I am fine. I am...

109
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,160
我 我简直难以置信我对你和盘托出
I am. I just can't believe that I told you all of those things.

110
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,230
我只是有点窘迫 你懂的
I'm just kind of embarrassed, you know.

111
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,400
因为我有什么权利不高兴 我什么都有了
Because what right do I have to not be happy? I have everything.

112
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,000
不高兴我都觉得心中有愧
I feel ungrateful not to be happy.

113
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,270
你和所有人享有同等的权利 苏珊
As much right as anyone, Susan, as much right as anyone,

114
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,240
因为一切都是相对的
because it's all relative.

115
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,250
你只是对自己太严苛了
You're just awfully hard on yourself.

116
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,290
你过得怎么样
How do you do it?

117
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,860
你是说跟卡洛斯在一起 我只是 我对此完全无感
You mean with Carlos? I just... it's... I'm totally cool with it.

118
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,360
而且有一个同志丈夫也不是一件特别糟糕的事 你懂吗
And having a gay husband is not such a bad thing, you know?

119
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,200
我们是闺蜜 我们彼此深爱着对方
We're best friends. We love each other completely.

120
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,770
我绝对是他生活里唯一的女人
I'm certainly the only woman in his life.

121
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,370
而且这比肉欲更长久 不是吗
And that lasts longer than lust, doesn't it?

122
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,440
简直就是永恒
It's forever, really.

123
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,210
我和哈顿之间没有这种感觉
Hutton and I don't have that.

124
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,780
你有过吗
Did you ever?

125
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,770
我觉得我们只是想要不同的东西
I think we just want different things,

126
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,180
或者是我想要的不一样
or I want different things.

127
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,050
你还爱他吗
Do you still love him?

128
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,890
他在叫我 失陪一下
I'm being summoned. Pardon me.

129
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,390
他要赶飞机 我要跟他道别
He has to catch a plane. I'm gonna say goodbye.

130
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,900
希望这笔交易能成功
I hope this deal works out for you.

131
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,470
我真的希望 我知道你需要它 是我们需要它
I really do. I know you need it. We need this.

132
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,470
不 是你需要
No. You need this.

133
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,310
- 拜  - 拜
- Bye.  - Bye.

134
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,690
所以我说
So I said,

135
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,930
“嗯 我妈经常跟我说”
"Well, my mother always told me

136
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,200
“如果你在婴儿出生前一个月”
"If you massage your pussy with Pam cooking spray

137
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,700
“用喷雾油按摩阴道”
"A month before the baby comes,

138
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,670
“你都不需要进行阴道修复手术”
"You don't need vaginal rejuvenation."

139
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,170
我要去买一些喷雾
I've gotta get some Pam.

140
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,540
她今年要被提名了
And she is going to get a nomination this year.

141
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,510
只是提名吗 她志在必得
A nomination? She's gonna win.

142
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,880
我们聊聊你的艺术展开幕吧
Let's talk about your opening.

143
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,450
- 我的最爱  - 不是我最爱的
- My favorite subject.  - Not mine.

144
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,120
昨晚的开场真是引人入胜
The opening was spectacular last night.

145
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,960
真的吗 这就是你以为的
Really? That's what you thought?

146
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,860
- 什么 你不是这样想的吗  - 不是
- What, you didn't?  - No.

147
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,290
我觉着这部作品真是难以置信的强大
I thought the work was incredibly strong.

148
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,300
在我们生活的垃圾文化中简直熠熠生辉
So perfect with all this junk culture that we live in.

149
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,130
垃圾 那是垃圾
It's junk. It is junk.

150
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,740
完全就是垃圾
Total junk.

151
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,370
亲爱的 你真的很成功
Darling, you are a big success.

152
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,150
- 没有人真正喜欢自己的工作  - 那为什么我们还要做
- No one really likes what they do.  - Then why do we do it?

153
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,380
因为我们是迫不得已
Because we're driven.

154
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,950
也许还缺乏安全感
Maybe a bit insecure.

155
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,560
年轻的时候我们沉迷其中
We get into things when we're young

156
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,660
因为我们以为它们意义重大
and because we think they mean something.

157
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,490
之后我们发现原来它们索然无味
And then we find out that they don't.

158
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,400
哦 苏珊 享受这荒谬的世界吧
Oh, Susan, enjoy the absurdity of our world.

159
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,900
这样才不会那么痛苦
It's a lot less painful.

160
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,960
相信我 我们的世界
And believe me, our world

161
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,410
要比尘世少很多痛苦
is a lot less painful than the real world.

162
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,900
为什么我们要开这个老古董去玛法[美国德州的一座城市]
Yeah, why are we driving this old thing to marfa?

163
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,000
因为我刚把它重新拾掇了一番 这可是一代经典
Because I just had it completely rebuilt. It's a classic.

164
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,570
它的音响系统真的很烂
It has a terrible sound system.

165
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,570
好吧 你还是要忍受它
Well, you're gonna have to suffer through that.

166
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,570
你居然有两双长筒靴吗 尹迪亚
You have two sets of boots, India?

167
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,310
我们今晚真的要停下来吗 我宁愿直接到那儿
Do we really have to stop tonight? I'd rather just get there.

168
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,480
好了 问你妈吧 她说了算
All right, ask your mother. She's the boss.

169
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,650
我定了闹钟
I set the alarm.

170
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,240
尹迪亚 你已经玩了四个小时了
India, you've been on that thing for hours.

171
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,680
我以为你想开夜车的
I thought you were the one who wanted to drive all night.

172
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,590
是 但是我们能做什么呢
I did, but what are we supposed to do,

173
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,250
唱篝火之歌还是什么
sing campfire songs or something?

174
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,420
- 还要多久  - 不知道
- How much longer?  - I don't know.

175
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,460
三小时 或者三个半小时
Like three, three and a half hours.

176
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,130
嗯 爸 这下你心满意足了
Well, dad, you're gonna get your wish.

177
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,300
我的手机没信号了
My cell service just went out.

178
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,700
天呐 你能相信这里竟然没信号吗
Jesus, can you believe there's no service here?

179
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,470
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

180
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,970
我最喜欢西德克萨斯两件事
Two of the things I love most about west Texas,

181
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,870
没有信号 人烟稀少
no phones and no people.

182
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,680
哦 拜托
Oh, come on.

183
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,010
真是混蛋 甩掉他们了吗
Total jerks. Are we rid of them?

184
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,250
- 尹迪亚 不要这样  - 什么
- India, don't do that.  - What?

185
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,050
- 什么 她做了什么  - 她对他们竖中指
- What? What'd she do?  - She just gave 'em the finger.

186
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,720
- 妈妈 妈妈 我好怕  - 托尼
- Mom. Mom, I'm scared.  - Tony.

187
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,190
加速
Speed up.

188
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,260
- 没事 没事  - 不 我不喜欢这样
- It's all right, it's all right.  - No, I don't like this.

189
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,660
没事
It's all right.

190
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,860
加速 托尼
Speed up. Tony.

191
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,100
该死 哦 太好了
Shit. Oh, good.

192
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,660
就让他们走 让他们走
Just let 'em go. Let 'em go.

193
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,770
尹迪亚 不要看他们
India, don't look at them.

194
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,840
- 但是他们在看我  - 不要给他们任何借口
- But, they're...  - Just don't give them any reason.

195
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,610
他为什么笑成那样
Why is he smiling like that?

196
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,110
我不知道 亲爱的 没事的
I don't know, sweetheart. It's all right. It's all right.

197
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,390
喔
Whoo!

198
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,290
他疯了吧
He's crazy.

199
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,260
- 哦 天呐  - 哦 天呐
- Oh, my god.  - Oh, my god.

200
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,700

哦 天呐 托尼
Oh, god, Tony.

203
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,320
尹迪亚 你的手机现在能用吗 尹迪亚
India. Is your phone working yet, India?

204
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,120
不能 但我把车牌号记下来了
No, no, but I took down the license number.

205
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,130

Oh, no. What do you want from us?

211

They probably have a gun.

217
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,130
求求你了 托尼 开出去
Please, Tony, pull out.

218

动不了 他把车堵住了
I can't move. He's blocked the car.

219
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,200

What's he doing?

220
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,910
没事的 不要下车
It's okay. Don't get out the car.

221
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,420
我不会下车的 亲爱的
I'm not getting out of the car, sweetheart.

222
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,430
- 晚上好  - 晚上好
- Good evening.  - Good evening.

223
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,260
你知道有事故应该停车的 对不对
You know you're supposed to stop when there's an accident, right?

224
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,060
是 我知道 那你为什么不停
Yeah, I know that. Why didn't you stop, then?

225
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,600
没用的
That won't work.

226
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,610
这里没信号
No signal here.

227
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,450
你不应该
You're not supposed to

228
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,180
肇事逃逸 这是犯罪
leave the scene of an accident. It's a crime.

229
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,610
- 你那么开车谁能不撞  - 对不起 你说什么
- After the way you were driving...  - I'm sorry, what'd you say?

230
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,950
你开车的方式简直离奇
Just the way you were driving was crazy.

231
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,520

back in your car now and leave us alone.

235
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,690
不要慌 我们要举报一起事故 就这样
Calm down. We got an accident to report, that's all.

236
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,200
- 镇静 嘿 小姐  - 这只是一个手电筒 亲爱的
- Calm down. Hey, lady, lady, lady.  - It's a flashlight, sweetheart.

237
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,570
只是一个手电筒 没事
It's just a flashlight. It's all right.

238
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,570
- 天呐  - 好 我们交换一下信息
- Jesus Christ.  - Okay, so let's exchange information.

239
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,370
信息 对
Information? Yeah.

240
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,880
交换信息 把它从储物箱里拿出来
Let's exchange information. Get it out of the glove compartment.

241
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,910
好啊 我是双子座 我最喜欢的颜色是浅桃红
Okay, I'm a gemini. My favorite color's pale pink.

242
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,210
我喜欢远途散步和小猫
I like long walks and kittens.

243
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,160
我们应该 你知道吗 我们应该叫警察
We should... you know what? We should call the police.

- Oh, oh? Really?  - Yeah. Yeah.

245
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,340
想法很好
That's a great idea.

246
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,740
- 这他妈全是你的错 对不对  - 什么
- It was your fucking fault, right?  - What?

247
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,410
是谁的错不重要 让我们走吧
It doesn't matter whose fault it was. Let's get going.

248
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,280
嘿 瑞 这些人车胎爆了
Hey, ray, these guys have got a flat tire.

249
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,180
当然了 嗯 你知道吗
They sure do. Well, what do you know?

250
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,110
- 他说什么  - 别信他 爸爸
- What'd he say?  - Don't believe it, dad.

251
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,020
- 他说我们车胎爆了  - 他说了什么
- He said we had a flat tire.  - What did he say?

252
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,750
别信他 我们车胎没爆
Don't believe him. We don't have a flat.

253
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,190
什么 什么
What? What?

254
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,690
没错 你的左胎爆了 确实是
Yep, your left tire's flat. It sure is.

255
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,800
一定是你在路上挤我们的时候爆的
Must have bust it when you were shoving us off the road.

256
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,470
我们没挤你 是你挤我们
We did not shove you off the road. You shoved us off the road.

257
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,700
- 你睁眼说瞎话  - 你认为我在骗你
- It's a lie.  - You think I'm a liar?

258
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,140
没事 没事
It's okay. It's okay.

259
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,310
- 她还是个孩子  - 你觉得我是骗子
- She's just a child.  - You think I'm a liar?

260
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,180
不是 她没那么说 兄弟 她还是个孩子
No, she's not saying that, man. She's just a child.

261
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,880
你车胎没爆 继续开啊
You don't got a flat, go on, drive.

262
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,950
- 开引擎 继续开  - 快开
- Start the engine and drive. Please drive.  - Just drive.

263
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,290
开车啊 混蛋 没人拦着你 开走啊
Just drive on it, asshole. Nobody's stopping you. Drive away.

264
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,220
走 滚开
Go. Fuck off.

265
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,130
臭傻逼
Stupid motherfucker.

266
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,900
- 该死  - 哦 天呐 哦 天呐

402
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,010
- 求你们了 放我走吧  - 别碰她
- Let go of me, please.  - Get your hands off her.

403
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,040
妈的
Shit.

404
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,340
尹迪亚
India...

405
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,340
看看你们干的好事
Look what you gone and did.

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,850
没事了 没事了
Hey, hey. It's okay.

407
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,280
她是一家之主吗
She the boss? Is she the boss of your family?

408
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,790
- 劳拉  - 你有阴道吗
- Laura?  - Have you got a vagina?

409
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,750
我问你有没有阴道
Have you got a fucking vagina there?

410
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,460
喂
Hey!

411
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,020
- 劳拉  - 阴道哥

412
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,960
- 把她弄进车里  - 阴道哥
- Just get her in the car. Get her in the car.  - Vagina boy!

413
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,360
- 滚  - 你想惹事儿是不

- Get in the car.  - Okay, here we go.

417
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,040
我们两辆车都开走 喂 卢
We're goin' in both cars. Hey, Lou.

418
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040

419
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,310
爸爸
Dad. Dad.

420
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,880
- 喂  - 爸爸
- Hey!  - Dad. Dad.

421
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,750

423
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,940
苏珊
Susan?

424
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,440
你为什么不打电话告诉我你安全到达了
Why didn't you call me and let me know you got in safely?

425
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,010
因为现在才凌晨四点 我不想吵醒你
'Cause it's 4:00 in the morning. I didn't wanna wake you.

426
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,910
如果你失眠的话 为什么不吃药呢
If you can't sleep, why don't you take one of your pills?

427
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,920
你在哪
Where are you?

428
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,590
我刚进宾馆大门
I'm just walking in the door of the hotel.

429
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,860
- 先生 请问您要去哪一层  - 三十一层 谢谢
- What floor, sir?  - 31, please.

430
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,360
我们平时不住那层
That's not our usual floor.

431
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,690
我们平时那间房间有人住了
No, our regular room wasn't available.

432
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,330
你真应该看看我在大堂发火的样子
You should have seen the scene I caused in the lobby.

433
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,140
你在飞机上睡得好吗
I hope you got some sleep on the plane.

434
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,110
我很担心你 虽然你可能没意识到
I do worry about you. Even though you think that I don't, I do.

435
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,110
你肯定很累了
You must be exhausted.

436
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,610
- 我讨厌那个航班 真的  - 三十一层到了 女士
- I hate that flight. It's really not...  - 31, madam.

437
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,280
我到了 我先挂了 一会打给你 苏珊
I'm at my floor. I gotta run. I'll call you later, okay? Susan?

438
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,790
苏珊 听得见吗
Susan, can you hear me?

439
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,800
听得见
Yes. Yes, I heard you.

440
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,800
好好睡一觉
Get some sleep.

441
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,930
你来开
You're driving.

442
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,940
- 是这个路口吗  - 什么路口
- Is this the exit?  - Exit for what?

443
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,340
- 去贝利镇的路口  - 继续开
- Well, for Bailey.  - Keep going.

444
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,690
继续开 开快点
Keep going. Speed up.

445
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,630
- 你们到底要对我们做什么  - 就是这里 沿这条路开下去
- What the fuck are you doing to us?  - Here. Turn down here.

446
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,370
去死吧 我不会沿这条路开的
No, fuck you. I am not going down that road.

447
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,370
先生 还想见到你的妻子和女儿吗
Listen, mister, you wanna see your wife and kid?

448
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,210
那就沿这条路开下去
Then turn down the road.

449
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,380
你现在要哭了吗
You gonna cry now?

450
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,850
我们刚刚路过的那辆车是我的
That's my car we just passed.

451
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,920
不是你的 继续开
It ain't your car, man. Keep going.

452
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,920
你没必要担心你的妻子和女儿
I don't think you need to worry about your wife and kid.

453
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,930
我说过了 没必要担心她们
Like I say, you don't need to worry about them.

454
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,050
你什么意思
What do you mean, I don't need

455
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,930
什么叫我不需要担心她们
to worry about them? What the fuck does that mean?

456
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,960
冷静点 他可从来没杀过人
Calm down. He ain't never killed nobody yet, that's all I mean.

457
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,930
至少我认识他的时候不会
Least as far as I know he ain't.

458
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,700
杀人 你什么意思
Killed? What are you talking about, killing?

459
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,470
我说他没杀过人
I said he ain't killed nobody yet.

460
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:29,010
看来你没认真听我说话
If you'd listen to me, you'd hear what I was saying.

461
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,810
好吧 看上去已经开到头了 但是还没有见到她们
Well, looks like we've run out of road and they ain't here.

462
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,310
可能我指错路了吧
I wonder if I made a mistake.

463
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,040
现在你可以下车了 好吗
It's time for you to get out now, okay?

464
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,150
- 下车  - 你想做什么
- Get out!  - What are you... What are you doing?

465
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,590
- 小心点 不然弄死你  - 等等
- You'll get killed if you don't watch it.  - Wait.

466
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,750
停车
Wait!

467
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,320
不 停车
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait!

468
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,430
不
No! No!

469
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,210
你把他扔在那荒郊野外的做什么
What did you fucking leave him out here for?

470
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,220
喂 先生
Hey, mister!

471
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,320
你妻子找你
Your wife wants you!

472
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,630
上车去
Get in the fucking car.

473
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,230
先生 你妻子找
Hey, mister! Your wife!

474
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,070
先生
Mister!

475
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,400
妈的
Shit.

476
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,010

00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,940
喂
Hey.

480
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,380
我可以借个电话吗
May I use your phone?

481
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,830
哈斯廷斯先生 这附近
Mr. Hastings, there's no town

482
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,430
没有叫贝利的镇啊
near here called Bailey.

483
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,330
我最害怕的事情发生了
I was afraid of that.

484
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:23,300
街对面有家旅馆 你身上有钱吗
There's a motel across the street. You got money?

485
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,440
我有信用卡
I have... I have credit cards.

486
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,240
天还很早呢 哈斯廷斯先生
It's still early, Mr. Hastings.

487
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,340
有线索我们会联系你
But we'll call if we get anything.

488
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,740
非常感谢
All right, thank you.

489
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,080
喂
Hello?

490
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,650
我是格里弗斯警长
This is lieutenant graves.

491
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,850
他们在一处干涸的河床里找到了你的车
They found your car over in a dried-out arroyo at topping.

492
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,020
- 那我的妻子和女儿呢  - 仍然没有消息
- What about my wife and daughter?  - Still no news.

493
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,590
她们不在车里
They weren't in the car.

494
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,660
我们把这个案子移交给安德斯警长了
We're turning the case over to lieutenant andes.

495
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,260
他想问你几分钟后能不能去接你
He wants to know if he can pick you up in a few minutes.

496
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,830
我已经准备好了
Yeah, I'm ready now.

497
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,850
早上好 很高兴见到你
Morning. Oh, glad to meet you.

498
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,450
我是波比·安德斯 负责这一带的警长
I'm Bobby andes. I look into things around here.

499
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,920
- 是你找到的我的车吗  - 他们在河床上找到的
- You found my car?  - They found it in a creek bed.

500
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,460
我们打算把你带到你报警的那户人家去
Tell you what, we take you back to the house we picked you up at,

501
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,730
你能从那里找回事发地点吗
you think you could backtrack from there?

502
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,430
我试试看
I could try.

503
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,300
好的 尽力吧 走吧
Okay, then, you try. Let's go.

504
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,770
根据我的理解 这些家伙没有枪是吗
It's my understanding these fellas didn't have any guns.

505
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,110
没有
No.

506
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,820
好的
All right.

507
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,490
那我就直接问了 你说有一个名叫卢的家伙
So let me get this straight, you say some fella named Lou

508
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,590
开车把你带到树丛里并且把你丢在那了是吗
just drove you out into the brush and left you there?

509
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,720
- 不 是他强迫我开车  - 他强迫你开车
- No, he made me drive.  - He made you drive.

510
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,740
然后你想往外走的时候
And then when you started to walk out,

511
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,230
又看见他们回来了
you saw 'em coming in again.

512
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,160
- 是的  - 他们开的谁的车
- Yes.  - Hmm. Whose car were they in?

513
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,070
我觉得应该是我的车
I think it was mine.

514
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,930
你觉得 你为什么会这么觉得呢
You think? What makes you think that?

515
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,070
看上去和听上去都像是我的 听上去像
By the look of it and the sound of it. It sounded like my car.

516
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,570
你在黑暗中看得清他们吗
Could you see 'em in the dark?

517
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,680
- 看不清  - 他们说了什么吗
- Not very well.  - Did they say anything?

518
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,420
他们说 先生 你妻子找你
They said, "Mister, your wife wants you."

519
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,020
你并没有走过去 为什么呢
You didn't go to 'em. Why didn't you go to 'em?

520
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,590
我不知道为什么 当时我
I don't know why I didn't go. I was...

521
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,710
好了
Okay.

522
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,270
从这里开始你能指路吗
Can you take it from here?

523
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,380
可以 我从高速公路上下来的 走了很久
Yeah, I came down the highway and I walked for a long time,

524
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,450
因为根本没有人为我停车
'cause no one stopped for me.

525
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,320
警官 沿路肩慢慢倒回去
Sergeant, back up slowly down the shoulder.

526
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,390
打开信号灯
Put your signal lights on.

527
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,240
停车 停车
Stop the car. Stop the car!

528
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,470
我就是从那处铁丝网钻出来的
I came out of that barbwire fence right there.

529
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,910
就在那个反射器边上 我记得很清楚
Right by the reflector. I remember that.

530
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,650
下车吧 接下来步行 你说你是走出来的对吧
Let's get out and walk. You said you walked out, right?

531
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,650
我就从这里出来的
I came up... I came up right here,

532
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,590
因为我一直沿着那个沟壑走的
'cause I walked along that arroyo over there.

533
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,920
这里以前是个田野
This is part of the old valdes place.

534
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,760
那边过去一点是以前的牧牛场
There's an old cattle station down that way a bit

535
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,360
旁边是烧垃圾的地方
next to where they burn their garbage.

536
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,260
这条路通向那里
This road leads to it.

537
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,820
她还好吧
Is she all right?

538
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,190
妈妈 是你吗 没事吧
Mom? Is that you? Is everything all right?

539
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,420
没事 我只是想听听你的声音
Yeah, yeah, it's fine. I just wanted to hear your voice.

540
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,430
我想你了
I miss you.

541
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:25,200
你把我吵醒了 我还在睡觉 今天礼拜天啊妈妈
You woke me up. I'm still in bed. It's Sunday morning, mom.

542
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,760
我能之后再打给你吗
Can I call you later?

543
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,000
可以 没事 继续睡吧宝贝
Yeah. Yeah, call me later. Go back to bed, sweetheart.

544
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,770
你听起来怪怪的 没事吧
You sound weird. Are you okay?

545
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,540
没事
I'm fine. I'm fine.

546
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,710
继续睡吧
Go back to bed.

547
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,110
我爱你
I love you.

548
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,950
我也爱你
Me too.

549
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,450
- 我等会打给你  - 好的
- I’ll call you later.  - Okay.

550
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,650
爱德华 是你吗
Edward? Edward?

551
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,250
嗨 苏珊
Hi. Susan.

552
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,090
嗨 天哪 你好
Hi. God. How are you?

553
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:25,160
- 见到熟面孔真是太好了  - 见到你真高兴
- It's good to see someone I know.  - It's good to see you.

554
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,760
你还是那么美
You look beautiful, as always.

555
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,330
你在纽约干什么呢
What are you doing in New York City?

556
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,330
我来这里参加哥大奖学金的面试
I'm here for an interview for a scholarship at Columbia.

557
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,840
哥大 我以为你在德克萨斯州立大学呢
Columbia? I thought that you were at the university of Texas

558
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,670
你不是要当作家吗
becoming a great writer.

559
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,540
作家 没有吧
A great writer? I mean, I don't... I don't think so.

560
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,180
好吧 没错
Well, I am...

561
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,180
你不是在耶鲁要当艺术家吗
But aren't you at Yale becoming a great artist?

562
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,380
我已经从耶鲁毕业了 现在在哥大读硕士
Graduated Yale, but I'm at Columbia getting my master's degree.

563
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,290
- 哇  - 艺术史专业
- Oh, wow.  - Yeah, art history.

564
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,450
太棒了
That's great. Yeah.

565
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,460
你在纽约还认识别人吗
Listen, do you know anybody else in New York?

566
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,960
- 除了你没了  - 好吧
- Just you.  - Just me.

567
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,700
那要一起吃个晚饭吗
Okay, well, would you like to go to dinner?

568
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,370
- 好啊  - 好
- Absolutely.  - Okay.

569
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,180
先等我
Okay, great. Just let me...

570
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,470
先等我回公寓把这些东西放下吧
Just let me drop off my packages at my apartment.

571
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,570
要我帮你拿着吗 我可以帮你拿
All right, do you want me to grab them for you? I can hold that.

572
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,810
好啊 谢谢 我真怀念德州的男人
Yeah, great. Thank you. Oh... I miss Texas men.

573
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,540
德州可没有这样的暴雪
You don't have blizzards like this in Texas.

574
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,640
对啊
No, you don't.

575
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,500
你知道我们在哈斯廷斯的时候你是我第一个暗恋对象吗
You know that you were my first crush when we were at Hastings?

576
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,800
我当时和你哥哥关系那么好
I only spent so much time

577
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,000
只是为了有机会多靠近你一点
around your brother just to be around you.

578
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,840
他第一个暗恋对象可是你
Well, you were his first crush.

579
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,170
- 什么  - 真的
- What?  - Yeah.

580
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,510
我可一直都不知道库珀是同性恋啊
Well, I had no idea Cooper was gay.

581
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:54,010
我觉得那时候他自己都不知道 但是他真的很喜欢你
I don't think he knew back then, but he was obsessed with you.

582
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:54,810
唔
Mmm.

583
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,620
- 哇  - 真的
- Wow.  - Yeah.

584
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,750
如果我当时没发现你总是盯着我的话
If I hadn't caught you staring at me so much,

585
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,150
我还以为你跟他搞在一起了呢
I would have thought you were sleeping with him.

586
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,520
我 说实话 挺内疚的
I, actually... I feel terrible.

587
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,860
好多年没有跟他联系了
I haven't called him in a few years.

588
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,260
我一定是个很不称职的朋友 我希望没有伤害到他
I feel like I've been a bad friend. I hope I didn't hurt him.

589
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,470
你挺好的
You're good, you know that?

590
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,700
真的 大多数男人如果听说
No, you are. Most guys would have freaked out

591
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,440
自己最好的哥们爱上了自己 估计早就吓跑了
if they found out their best friend was in love with them.

592
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,840
你人很好
You're very sweet.

593
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,710
你可以打电话给他 他会很高兴的
You should call him. He would like that.

594
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,280
我们的父母差不多已经和他断绝关系了
My parents have basically disowned him.

595
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,480
他们几乎没有联系了
They're not really talking anymore.

596
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,120
- 为什么  - 你不知道为什么吗
- Why?  - Why? Are you serious?

597
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,720
你知道我父母就是那样的人
Well, you know my parents, right?

598
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,060
虔诚的教徒 保守派 性别歧视 种族歧视
They're religious, conservative, sexist, racist,

599
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:45,460
共和党 唯物主义者 纳粹主义者 种族歧视
republican, materialistic, narcissistic, racist.

600
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,630
还有很多很多
I could keep going...

601
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,300
我只是想知道你是怎么想的 苏珊
I'm just wondering what you really think, Susan.

602
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,670
我知道库珀是认真的
It's true, I know.

603
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,900
但是他们总是把我们看成他们的影子
But they just see us as a reflection of themselves,

604
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,910
所以他们不能接受库珀不是他们想要的样子
so they can't accept Cooper for who he is.

605
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,980
我也不知道自己要怎么做
I'm not sure how I'm gonna fare.

606
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,810
你和他们关系也不好吗
Aren't you being a little hard on them?

607
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,410
不好
No.

608
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,350
他们对我的生活还保留着那些老古董般的思想
They have an antiquated idea of how I should live my life.

609
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,920
尤其是我妈妈
Especially my mother.

610
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:13,260
我理解 我一直很敬爱她
I understand. I've always loved your mom.

611
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,090
- 真的吗  - 真的
- Really?  - Oh, yeah.

612
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,160
我父亲去世后她和我相处得很好
She was great with me when my dad died.

613
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,260
嗯
Mmm.

614
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,930
在你们眼中有着同样的忧郁
You both have the same kind of sadness in your eyes.

615
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,270
- 什么  - 你和你妈妈
- What?  - You and your mother.

616
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,940
听起来可真够别扭的 爱德华
That is a weird thing to say, Edward.

617
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,940
哦 抱歉 我无意要冒犯你
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you.

618
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,010
我只是 在我看来她一直很忧郁
I just... she just always seemed sad to me.

619
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,450
当我还是小孩的时候
She has sad eyes.

620
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,520
我就认为她有一双忧郁的眼睛
And I've thought that since I was a little boy.

621
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,520
你们有同样的眼睛
You have the same eyes.

622
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,290
很漂亮的眼睛
They're beautiful.

623
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,200
能不能别说我跟我妈妈很像 我并不想像她一样
Just don't say I'm like my mom, okay? I don't wanna be like her.

624
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,980
有意思 可是我一直很羡慕你们家
It's funny, 'cause I always envied your family.

625
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,380
我感觉我在学校里就像戴了面具一样
I felt like such an impostor at school.

626
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,420
你也是 我一直以为我唯一一个有那种感觉的人
You did? I thought I was the only one who felt like that.

627
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,980
- 你  - 是啊
- You?  - Yeah.

628
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,150
我总是专注于变得完美但是
I was so busy trying to be perfect and...

629
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,820
- 但是你内心却与之相悖  - 是的
- And you don't feel that way?  - No.

630
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,390
就是这个让你变得如此完美
That's exactly what makes you so perfect.

631
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,060
你能成为一个伟大的小说家
You are gonna be a great novelist,

632
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,590
因为你在脑海中创造了一个
'cause you have created a

633
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,170
虚构的人物
fictitious character in your head about...

634
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,330
- 不是  - 是的
- No.  - Yes.

635
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,070
- 不是  - 是的
- No.  - Yes.

636
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,340
不是的
No.

637
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,970
我不这么认为
I don't believe that.

638
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,140
你为什么放弃了你的艺术家之路
Why'd you give up on becoming an artist?

639
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,850
因为我太愤世嫉俗了 所以成不了艺术家
Because I'm too cynical to be an artist.

640
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,690
我总觉得这样还是挺好的
I think that to be really, really good,

641
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:51,980
因为你得由内而外的展现
you have to come from

642
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,860
你内心的某处东西 而我可能没有
someplace inside that I'm just not sure I have.

643
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,490
你太低估你自己了
You underestimate yourself.

644
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,830
你难道没意识到吗
Do you know that?

645
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,110
爱德华 呃
Edward, um,

646
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,610
你愿意跟我回家吗
will you come home with me?

647
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,220
这可真是有点快了
Well, that's a bit forward.

648
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,980
是啊
Yeah.

649
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:23,120
我没想到德州的上流社会女子的首次亮相会是这样
It's not what I'd expect from a Texas debutante.

650
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,620
你知道的 她们都是荡妇 所以
Well, you know all debutantes are sluts, so...

651
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,290
嗯
Hmm.

652
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,630
嗯 嗯
Hmm. Hmm.

653
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,460
而且你也是我第一个迷恋的对象
And you were my first crush too.

654
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,300
我知道
I know.

655
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,430
我们收到了来自奥佐纳的报告
We got a report from ozona.

656
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,830
昨晚在高速公路上也有别人和你一样遇到了骚扰
Someone else harassed on the highway last night just like you.

657
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,610
如果你不介意 我们需要用你的指纹
If you don't mind, we could use your fingerprints.

658
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,070
我的
Mine?

659
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,010
车后备箱上有一大堆的指纹
There's just a bunch of prints on the trunk of the car.

660
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,240
用你的指纹能帮我们从中区分开来
It could help us sort 'em out.

661
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,850
还有别的事
There's something else.

662
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,850
什么事
Yeah?

663
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,620
我们找到了死因
We have the cause of death.

664
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:40,630
你的妻子头骨碎裂
Your wife had a fractured skull.

665
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,030
她可能是被锤子或是棒球棍所攻击
She was probably struck with a hammer or a baseball bat,

666
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,800
可能是一下或者两下 所以
probably just once or twice, so...

667
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,870
你女儿遭受了更多的罪
Your daughter had a much more difficult time.

668
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,110
她是窒息而死的
She was suffocated.

669
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,650
她的一条胳膊也断了
She also had a broken arm.

670
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,320
她们都遭受了强奸
And they had both been raped.

671
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:10,660
关于那间屋子你也说对了
It turns out you were right about that trailer, too.

672
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,900
怎么呢
How?

673
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,660
那伙人 就想你想的那样
Those fellas, they took your folks in there,

674
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,900
他们把你们关在里面
just like you thought.

675
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,400
你是怎么知道的
How do you know that?

676
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,470
我们在床柱上发现了你妻子的指纹
We found your wife's fingerprints on the bedpost.

677
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:26,280
- 那是谁的屋子  - 查明了
- Whose trailer is it?  - It's clear.

678
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,180
房主不住在那里 他现在在埃尔帕索
Guy doesn't even live here. He's in El Paso.

679
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,020
房屋被擅自闯入 有人一直住在那里
Trailer's been broken into. Somebody's been living in it.

680
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,520
那里面到处都是指纹
There's prints all over the place.

681
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,950
我们会对照房主的指纹一一检查
We're gonna have to check 'em against the owner's,

682
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,850
看看能不能把那些指纹分离出来
see if we can separate 'em out.

683
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,520
- 说得对  - 我还是抱有希望的
- Right.  - I'm hopeful, though.

684
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,260
房主去年秋天就不在那里了 所以
The owner hasn't been there since last fall, so...

685
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,590
看起来有戏
Looks promising.

686
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,000
有
Prom...

687
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,440
有戏
Promising?

688
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,450
你之前怎么没告诉过我
Why didn't you tell me this before?

689
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,220
你这可是要离开纽约
You're actually gonna leave New York,

690
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,290
搬到奥斯汀然后去那个该死的德州大学
move to Austin and go to the goddamn university of Texas?

691
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:15,630
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

692
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,290
我是说 你打算干什么
I mean, where is this gonna go?

693
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,960
你什么意思 我打算干什么
What do you mean, where is this going to go?

694
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,170
我要嫁给爱德华 这就是我打算的
I'm going to marry Edward. That's where this is going to go.

695
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,800
这话从你嘴里说出来可真是可笑
This is a ridiculous conversation.

696
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,140
现在结婚对你来说还太早
You're too young to get married.

697
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,170
真的吗
Really?

698
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:30,580
妈妈 去年夏天你还试着
Mom, last summer you tried

699
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,740
说服我得去嫁给贝斯
to convince me that I had to marry bass.

700
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,310
那个不一样
That is different.

701
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,350
贝斯和你门当户对
Bass is your equal.

702
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,020
哦 我的天呐 你竟然能这么说
Oh, my god. Did you just say that? You really just said that.

703
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,090
没想到能从你口中听到这句话 这可真是
That came out of your mouth. That's...

704
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,390
你为什么总是把我想的那么坏
Why do you always think the worst of me?

705
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,930
我并不是这个意思
That is not what I meant.

706
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:57,500
我的意思是 你的个性很强
What I meant is that you are very strong-willed,

707
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,540
而爱德华 尽管很温柔 但是对你来说他太弱了
and Edward, as sweet as he is, he's too weak for you.

708
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,840
我从不会用弱这个字来形容爱德华
Weak is not a word that I would use to describe Edward.

709
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,710
我会用敏感来形容他
Sensitive is a word that I would use,

710
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,840
咱们家里每一个人
which isn't a word I would

711
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,710
都配不上这个词
use to describe anyone else in this family,

712
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,110
可能除了库帕
except maybe Cooper.

713
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,410
别提库帕
Don't bring Cooper into this.

714
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,280
抱歉
Sorry.

715
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,190
你别这样 苏珊
Come on, Susan.

716
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,620
我知道咱们俩的关注点不一样
I know you think that we don't care about the same things,

717
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,960
但是你错了
but you're wrong.

718
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,880
出不了几年
In a few years, all these bourgeois things,

719
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,130
你现在不屑一顾的小资情调
as you so like to call them,

720
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,400
会对你来说非常重要
are gonna be very important to you,

721
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,200
而爱德华却无法给你这些东西
and Edward's not gonna be able to give them to you.

722
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,540
他没有钱
He has no money.

723
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,140
他不努力 他没有上进心
He's not driven. He's not ambitious.

724
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:40,540
我能向你保证 如果你嫁给了爱德华
And I can promise you, if you marry Edward,

725
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,110
你父亲也不会给你钱的
your father's not gonna give them to you either.

726
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,320
是 你说的对 他是不努力
No, you're right. He's not driven

727
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,150
其实他只是不如你所愿的那样去努力
the way that you would like him to be.

728
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,320
但是他很强
But he is strong.

729
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,820
你要比我的很多方面都要强
He's stronger than I am in a lot of ways.

730
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,430
只是 他只是有一种不同的力量而已
Just... he just has a different kind of strength is all.

731
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,430
一种不同的力量
"A different kind of strength."

732
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:01,000
那到底是怎样一种力量
And what kind of strength is that?

733
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,300
他有相信自己的力量
He has the strength to believe in himself

734
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,800
同时也相信我
and believe in me.

735
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:08,670
苏珊
Susan,

736
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,840
如果你一定要跟他约会的话
keep seeing him if you have to,

737
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,940
和他住在一起 我不管了
live with him, I don't care,

738
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:16,950
但是别嫁给他
but do not marry him.

739
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:21,020
我明白在你眼中的爱德华是什么样的 我懂你
I understand what you see in Edward. I get it.

740
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,750
不 我真的明白
No. No, wait, I do.

741
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,750
- 不 你不了解 你不明白  - 我了解
- No, you don't. No, you don't.  - Yes, I do.

742
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,690
他富有浪漫主义
He is a romantic.

743
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,190
但他同时也很脆弱
But he is also very fragile.

744
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,530
我在他父亲去世的时候看出来的
I saw that when his father died.

745
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,100
你别
Don't...

746
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,600
你别嫁给他
Don't do this.

747
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,200
你会后悔的
You'll regret it.

748
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,870
而且到最后你只会伤害爱德华
And you'll only hurt Edward in the end.

749
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,310
当初令你对他产生爱意的种种
The things you love about him now are the things you'll hate

750
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,380
出不了几年就会令你厌烦
in a few years.

751
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,620
你可能意识不到
You may not realize it,

752
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,460
但是你和我之间相像的地方比你意识到的还要多
but you and I are a lot more alike than you think.

753
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:06,530
不 你错了 我和你一点也不像
No. You're wrong. You and I are nothing alike.

754
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:08,630
是吗
Really?

755
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,400
走着瞧吧
Just wait.

756
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,370
我们最终都会成为自己母亲的样子
We all eventually turn into our mothers.

757
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:36,240
[亲爱的爱德华
[大作拜读，非常震撼，我深为感动]
[不知周二晚上你是否仍有空，很多话想说]
[爱你的苏珊]

758
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,580
- 喂  - 托尼·哈斯廷斯
- Yeah?  - Tony Hastings?

759
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,790
- 是我  - 哪位
- Yes.  - Who is this?

760
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:08,690
罗伯托·安德斯 我给你发了封邮件 收到了吗
Roberto andes. I've sent you an email. You get it?

761
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,790
是的
Yes.

762
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,090
你认识这个人吗
Well, you recognize the guy?

763
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,700
- 不认识  - 该死
- No.  - Shit.

764
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,630
真该死 你确定吗
God damn it. You sure?

765
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,400
是的 整个事情现在都很模糊
Yeah. The whole thing's just a blur.

766
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,640
嗯 你的车子上全部都是他的指纹
Well, his prints are all over your car.

767
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,470
也在屋子里发现了他的指纹 他的名字是史蒂夫·亚当斯
They found 'em at the trailer too. His name's Steve Adams.

768
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,810
他在加州有过犯罪记录 偷车
He's got a record in California. A stolen car,

769
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,650
被告强奸却又宣判无罪 我已经发出了通缉令
acquittal on a rape charge. I put out an apb on him.

770
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,650
托尼 他是我们找到的唯一线索
He's the only lead we got, Tony,

771
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,480
而且我很确定不再有其他的证人
and I sure as hell don't have any other witnesses.

772
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,150
你确定你认不出他
You sure you don't recognize him?

773
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,320
不
No.

774
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:41,820
妈的 你怎么回事
Fuck. What's wrong with you, man?

775
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,430
你想不想把那些人都抓起来
Don't you wanna put these guys away?

776
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:44,730
想 我当然想
Yeah, of course I do.

777
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,560
这整件事就是有些
The whole thing is just some...

778
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,000
记忆模糊了
Just a blank.

779
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,120
我确定是他
I know it was him.

780
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,430
可能吧 但最近没有人在附近看到过他
Well, that may be, but nobody's seen him around here lately.

781
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:16,860
听着 我跟你说实话
Listen, I gotta be honest with you.

782
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,930
目前情况不太乐观
Right now it's not looking good.

783
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:22,470
有时候 这些案子一连几个月或是几年都可能没有进展
Sometimes these cases go months or even years without a break.

784
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,200
你得做好心理准备
You need to prepare yourself for that.

785
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,410
你为什么这么努力地去写作
Why are you so driven to write?

786
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:12,250
我想这是种让记忆保持鲜活的方式
I guess it's a way of keeping things alive.

787
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,920
你知道的 让那些终将逝去的记忆 永久封存在文字里
You know, saving things that will eventually die.

788
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,720
如果我把它写下来
And if I write it down, then,

789
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:24,490
它就不会消失了
it'll last forever.

790
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,480
[西德克萨斯]

791
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,960
- 下午好  - 嘿 你好
- Afternoon.  - Hey, there.

792
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,030
抱歉我迟到了 在洲际公路上堵了会儿
Sorry I'm late. There was traffic on the interstate.

793
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,260
没关系
That's all right.

794
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,560
你看起来不一样了
You look different.

795
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,700
没胡子了
No beard.

796
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,640
你看起来 你看起来也不一样了
You look... You look different too.

797
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:11,410
是吗 我告诉你我们发现了什么
Yeah. So I'll tell you what we got.

798
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,240
我们昨晚发现了一起
We had an attempted hold-up

799
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,480
在商场超市快闭店的时候发生的持枪抢劫
at the supermarket in the mall last night just before closing.

800
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,910
我们抓住了其中一个劫匪
We caught one of the guys,

801
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,880
一个被击毙 还有一个逃跑了
one got killed and one got away.

802
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,650
你想让我做什么
What do you, what do you want me to do?

803
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,820
看看你认不认识我们抓的那个人
See if you recognize the guy we caught.

804
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,990
尽管我觉得没必要
You can look at the dead one too,

805
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:31,160
那个被击毙的劫匪你也可以看看
although I don't really think it's necessary.

806
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,000
我们知道他是谁
We know who he is.

807
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,060
是谁
Who?

808
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,400
史蒂夫·亚当斯
Steve Adams.

809
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,900
我去年给你发的邮件里那个你称之为特克的
The one you called turk that I emailed you about last year?

810
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,480
进来
Come on in.

811
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:57,190
你害不害怕面对面见这个人 敢让他见你吗
Are you afraid to look this fella in the eye? Let him see you?

812
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,250
不害怕
No.

813
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,160
挺好 我觉得这样会让他张嘴
That's good. I think it will help him talk.

814
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,440
是他 左边那个人
That's him, that guy on the left.

815
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,770
最左边的那个 是他
On the far left. That's him.

816
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,710
不 不 不 别走 小子
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hold up, son.

817
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,380
你没那么幸运 过来
You ain't that lucky. Get over here.

818
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,120
- 是这个人吗  - 是的
- This fella?  - Yes.

819
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,160
我明白了 好吧 我不认为他明白了
I see. Right. I don't think he understands.

820
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,630
卢 嘿 说你呢
Lou. Lou. Hey, you.

821
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,300
你是叫卢吧 你知道我的名字 我告诉过你
Your name Lou? You know my name. I told you.

822
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,730
- 是吗  - 是的 怎么了
- Yeah?  - Yeah. What's going on?

823
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,150
我想让你
Well, I guess I want you to

824
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,740
告诉我你之前见没见过这个人
tell me if you've ever seen this man before.

825
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,970
仔细想想 你之前见过他吗
Think carefully. You ever seen him?

826
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,310
不 我不认识他
No, I don't know him.

827
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,680
- 嗯  - 他是谁
- Hmm?  - Who is he?

828
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,580
何不你来告诉他 托尼 给他提个醒
Why don't you tell him, Tony? Tell him who he is.

829
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,520
去年夏天 这个人 卢 还有他的同伙
Last summer, this man, Lou, and his friends,

830
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,490
他们迫使我们洲际公路上开下马路
they forced us off the road on the interstate

831
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:05,740
其中两个强行进入我的车里
and two of them forced their

832
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:07,760
里面还有我的妻子和我女儿
way into my car with my wife and my daughter.

833
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,660
- 然后这个人…这个人  - 这个叫卢的人
- And then this man... This man?  - This man Lou?

834
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,000
是的 罗 他让我开他的车
Yes. Lou, he made me drive his car,

835
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,930
他带我到沙漠中间然后把我扔下
he took me to the middle of the desert and he left me there.

836
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:17,930
再后来就在那附近的地方
And later my wife and daughter were found dead

837
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,400
找到了我妻子和女儿的尸体
near the same place.

838
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:26,180
这么做可不对
Well, that ain't right.

839
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,850
你对于那个人的妻子和女儿有没有什么可说的
What you got to say about this man's wife and daughter?

840
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,120
我对此一无所知
I don't know nothing about that.

841
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,290
我活到今天就没见过他
I've never seen him before in my life.

842
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:43,960
那你给我说说雷和特克
What you gonna tell me about ray and turk?

843
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,100
- 谁  - 谁
- Who?  - Who?

844
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:52,640
你是个猫头鹰吗 卢 你是猫头鹰吗
What, are you an owl? You an owl, Lou?

845
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,540
- 我从没听说过他们  - 你从来没听说过他们
- I never heard of 'em.  - You never heard of 'em?

846
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,370
没有 长官
No, sir.

847
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,390
好吧
All right.

848
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,060
警官
Officer.

849
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,790
把他关起来
Put him up.

850
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:24,730
- 你确定他就是那个人吗  - 是的 绝对确定
- Are you sure this is the man?  - Absolutely, yes.

851
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:27,170
你能在法院上 在伪证罪的惩罚下宣誓吗
You'll swear in a court of law under penalty of perjury?

852
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,240
我能
Yes.

853
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,080
好的
Good.

854
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,750
好 我们找到卢了
Well, we got Lou.

855
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,790
我会以谋杀罪起诉他
I'm gonna charge him with murder.

856
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:44,450
什么 你有足够的证据了吗
What, do you have enough evidence?

857
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,600
哦 当然了 我们有你
Oh, you bet, between you

858
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,590
还有他留在车里和屋子里的指纹
and the prints in the car and the trailer.

859
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,690
什么 他在扔下我之后回到那间屋子里去了吗
What, he went back to the trailer after he left me?

860
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:50,810
是的 看起来是这样 呃 他
Yeah, looks like it. Uh, he

861
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:52,930
可能只是回去告诉他们你在哪
probably just went back to tell 'em where you were.

862
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,770
这就是为什么他们带着尸体回来的
That's why they came back with the bodies.

863
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,500
他们是 他们是打算把你杀了
They were, they were gonna kill you.

864
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,700
你明白了吗
You see? Yeah.

865
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:03,270
我敢打赌那个雷就是持枪抢劫里的第三个同伙
I bet your friend Ray's the third fella in the hold-up.

866
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,940
- 那现在怎么办  - 你就等着开庭吧
- What now?  - Well, you're gonna wait for trial.

867
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,950
我得去找雷
And I'm gonna go find ray.

868
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,230
别忘了你下午三点在博物馆有董事会
Don't forget you have a board meeting at the museum at 3:00.

869
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,230
抱歉 你刚说什么
I'm sorry. What was that?

870
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,900
你又失眠了是吗
You didn't sleep again, did you?

871
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,640
你知道我的 我从来不睡
You know me. I never sleep.

872
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:44,410
我的前任丈夫曾称我为夜行动物
My ex-husband used to call me a nocturnal animal.

873
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,880
什么前任丈夫
What ex-husband?

874
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,350
我不知道你有前任丈夫 什么时候的事
I didn't know you had an ex-husband. Since when?

875
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,250
几年前读研究生的时候
A couple of years in graduate school.

876
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,760
很奇怪 我最近总是想起他
It's weird, I've been thinking about him a lot lately,

877
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,090
然后他最近寄给我一本他写的书
and then recently he sent me this book that he's written

878
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:58,890
这本书
and it's

879
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,160
很暴力也有点悲伤
violent and it's sad,

880
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:05,170
他把这本书命名为夜间动物并在题献词署上了我的名字
and he titled it nocturnal animals and he dedicated it to me.

881
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,340
你爱过他吗
Did you love him?

882
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,570
是的 我爱过他
Yeah, I loved him.

883
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:14,940
他那时候是个作家 我当时对他没有信心
He was a writer and, uh, I didn't have faith in him.

884
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,610
我有点慌乱还对他做了一些很糟糕的事情
I panicked and I did something horrible to him.

885
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,620
一些无法原谅的事 真的
Something unforgivable, really.

886
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,850
- 你先离开的吗  - 我离开他的
- You left him?  - I left him.

887
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,960
我很粗暴地离开了他
I left him in a brutal way,

888
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:31,890
选择了英俊又时髦的哈顿
for the handsome and dashing hutton.

889
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,300
- 他的确是英俊又…时髦  - 是的
- Who is very handsome and dashing. ...And dashing.  - Yes.

890
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:38,070
你有过这样的感觉吗 就是你的生活要发生一些
Do you ever feel like your life has turned into something

891
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,030
你从未打算过的改变
you never intended?

892
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:49,080
没有
No.

893
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,610
当然没有 你才刚开始你的人生
Of course not. You just started living your life.

894
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,050
你真的是一点都没睡是不是
You really didn't get any sleep, did you?

895
01:05:58,820 --> 01:05:59,890
没睡
No.

896
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:43,130
[复仇]

897
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:51,110
这幅画是从哪来的
Where did this painting come from?

898
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:53,380
你什么意思 这从哪来的
What do you mean, where did it come from?

899
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,280
你给我们买的 不记得了吗
You bought it for us, remember?

900
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,310
这是大约八年前的一个系列的一部分
It was part of the series like eight years ago.

901
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,050
- 挺棒的 不是吗  - 是的
- It's great, isn't it?  - Yeah.

902
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:01,650
那是什么
What is that?

903
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,890
哦 我的天哪 这个太酷了
Oh, my god, it's so cool.

904
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:07,660
这个软件能让我看到在婴儿床里的薇洛
It's this app that lets me watch Willow while she's in her crib.

905
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:10,460
真的吗 你不信任你的保姆吗
Really? Do you not trust your nanny?

906
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,630
不 不 我信任她 我只是讨厌她 所以
No, no, I do. I just hate her, so...

907
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:13,800
我只是想在薇洛的一天时间里
And I would like to be more involved

908
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,060
和她多接触 所以
with Willow throughout the day, so...

909
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:19,300
你看 那是她
Look. There she is.

910
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,100
音效真是难以置信 你能真切地听到她呼吸
And the sound's incredible. You can actually hear her breathing.

911
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,590
如果我想的话 我还能和她说话
And I can talk to her if I want to.

912
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:29,210
对不起 我很抱歉 我
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm...

913
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,850
- 你没事吧  - 没事
- Are you okay?  - Yeah.

914
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:33,080
嗯 我只是
Yeah, I just...

915
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:35,820
我想我看到了一个人
I thought I saw someone.

916
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,990
没错 你是看到了一个人
Well, you did see someone.

917
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,660
是小床里的薇洛
That's Willow and she's in her crib.

918
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:43,430
她睡着了
She's sleeping.

919
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:47,200
很抱歉把你电话摔坏了 我可以
I'm really sorry about your phone. I can, um...

920
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,660
没关系 反正下周又发布新款了 所以
It's fine. A new one comes out next week anyway, so...

921
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,730
谢谢
Thanks.

922
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,830
走吧
Shall we?

923
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,270
她们在等我们
They're all waiting for us.

924
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,540
我们没有合同义务 好事儿
We're under no contractual obligations. Which is good.

925
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,780
我知道对于这件事大家的意见有分歧
I know we all have different, you know, opinions about this,

926
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,080
但是我认为
but as far as I'm concerned...

927
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:18,460
无论如何 我想我们应该让她走
Anyways, I think we should cut her loose.

928
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,460
她已经不是当初我们看中的那个人了
She isn't who she sold herself to be when we hired her.

929
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,730
我不同意 我认为目前要留着她
I disagree. I think we should keep her for now.

930
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:25,470
- 为什么  - 因为她很棒 我们都喜欢她
- Why is that?  - Because she's great and we all like her.

931
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:28,040
她要的只是大家的支持和多一点时间 仅此而已
She just needs our support and a little bit of time, that's all.

932
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,640
- 这样未必有效  - 我们得炒了她
- But it's not working.  - We need to fire her.

933
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,470
哈默博物馆有位上佳人选 我们可以撬过来
There's an awesome candidate that we could steal from the hammer

934
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,480
当然要快
if we move fast.

935
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,780
我同意琳达的意见 我们既然招她进来 应该支持她
I agree with Linda. We hired her. We should support her.

936
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,320
换了医生
New doctor?

937
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:43,950
没有 换了发型
No. New haircut.

938
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,920
但是苏珊 不是你上次开会提出
But, Susan, you were the one who brought it up last meeting

939
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,990
要有变动吗
that you were looking for a change.

940
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,830
我记得 但是现在我认为我们要留下她
I know, but now I think we should keep her.

941
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,800
有时候
Sometimes it's...

942
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,270
有时候变动太大
Sometimes maybe it's not such a good idea

943
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,740
可能并不好
to change things quite so much.

944
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:20,520
我不明白 我们干嘛来这
I don't get it. What are we doing here?

945
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,820
该死
Shit.

946
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,260
你没事吧
Are you okay?

947
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:31,230
嗯没事 跟我来
Yeah. I'm fine. Follow me.

948
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,270
这就是雷·马科斯
That's ray Marcus.

949
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,210
大家都知道他经常跟
He's been named as a frequent companion

950
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,780
卢·贝茨和史蒂夫·亚当斯混在一起
of Lou bates and Steve Adams.

951
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:51,010
他干点零活 电工和水管工
Part-time electrician, part-time plumber,

952
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,550
所以能搞出那么个出彩的马桶
hence the clever toilet facilities.

953
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:55,280
他很符合你和
He's not a bad match to your description

954
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:57,550
另一个劫匪的描述
and the fella at the hold-up.

955
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,060
没留下指纹 这点我们以前就领教过
No fingerprints, but we knew that before.

956
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,120
不明白为什么会没有他的指纹
I wonder why there aren't any fingerprints.

957
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,690
这个 很可能他当时把手放在你妻子身上
Well, his hands were probably on your wife.

958
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:10,470
除了一桩已撤销的强奸指控 他没有案底
His record's clean, except for a rape charge that got dropped.

959
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:12,800
牧营酒吧的酒保告诉我
I heard from this barman at this place, line camp bar,

雷和一个叫莱拉的女孩住在这里

961
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,210
但他另外有个据点
but he also keeps another spot

962
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,140
瞒着她把别的女孩带到那里
to take girls she don't know about,

963
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,440
因你这案子而曝光的那间屋子 之前很可能就是他的据点
probably your murder trailer before it got notorious.

964
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:25,210
他看起来像不像那家伙
Does he look like he could be the guy?

965
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,050
就是他
Yes, that's him.

966
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:28,120

Good.

967

969
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:48,400

Who the hell are you?

970
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,410
从我这儿滚出去
Get off my property, man.

971
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,510

我有事问你
I wanna ask you some questions.

973
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,250
滚
Fuck you.

974
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,580
老子正忙
I'm occupied at the moment.

975
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,350
- 什么事  - 问几个问题 仅此而已
- What's that?  - Just a few questions, that's all.

- We need you to come with us.  - What for? I ain't done nothin'.

977
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,790
- 我没说过你做了  - 那就在这儿问
- I ain't saying you did.  - Well, ask me here.

978
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:13,530
不行 我们得开车带你走一段
No, we need you to take a little drive with us.

979
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,630
行了 快点完事 跟我们走
Come on, finish up what you're doing and let's go.

980
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:16,430
你不能转过身去吗
Do you mind turning round?

981
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,100
相信我 我也很不想看 但是
Believe me, I wish I could, but...

982
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,880
见鬼了

- You questioning me?  - Yeah.

987
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:53,630
对 我们正在进行这事
Yeah, that's what we're doing,

988
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:54,970
- 不是吗  - 你还没宣读我的权利
- ain't it?  - You ain't read me my rights.

989
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,980
- 雷 你了解你的权利  - 你应给宣读给我听
- You know your rights, ray.  - You're supposed to read 'em to me.

990
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,820

994
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:15,260
我应该有律师什么的吧
I'm supposed to have a lawyer or something.

995
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,930
冷静点 帅哥
Calm down, sunshine.

996
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:20,030
只是非正式的讯问 没别的
This is just informal questioning, that's all.

997
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:22,760
你得合作 我并没有指控你任何事
You're helping me out. I ain't charged you with nothing yet.

998
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,370
不过 如果你想要律师 我可以把你带到警局
Now, if you want a lawyer, I can take you down to the station

见到你之前 我对于抢劫案的了解
I don't know any more about

1004
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,450
并不比今天在这儿知道的少
this hold-up than I did before I met you.

1005
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:37,610
这么说吧
I tell you what,

1006
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,780

你不觉得它很熟悉吗

Now, we're going to a place you might remember,

1061
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:15,440
你可以告诉我们那里发生的事情 从而帮你自己脱困
and you can help yourself out by telling me about it.

1062
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,270
不过如果你不记得
But if you don't remember,

01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:22,440
喂 伙计 我很难过你失去了亲人
Hey, I'm sorry you lost your folks, man.

1065
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:25,510
真不幸 但这事跟我没有任何关系
It's a shame. But I didn't have nothin' to do with it.

1066
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:47,300
- 这是哪里  - 你知道这个地方
- What's this place?  - You know this place.

1067
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,810
- 对天发誓 我不知道  - 托尼 你也下车
- Honest to god, I don't.  - You wanna get out, Tony?

1068
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,570
- 雷 我们进去看看吧  - 看什么呢
- Shall we have a look inside, ray?  - What for?

1069
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,540
过来 我们进去看看
Come on, let's take a look.

1070
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,460
好了 好了
All right, all right.

1071
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,930
噢 我想你是在床上强奸了她们
Oh, you raped them on the bed, I suppose.

1072
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:18,930
- 我从没强奸过任何人  - 别兜圈子了 雷
- I never raped nobody.  - Stop fucking around, ray.

1073
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:21,240
我们查过你的案底 我们知道卢博克市那个姑娘的事情
We seen your record. We know about that girl in lubbock.

1074
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,740
那个指控已经撤销了 我从没强奸过别人
The charges were dropped. I never raped nobody.

1075
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,570
雷 我要知道
I wanna know, ray.

1076
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,680
我要知道你对她们所犯罪行的全部经过
I wanna know the exact story, what you did to them.

1077
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,650
- 这你得问别人  - 我要知道她们说过什么
- You'll have to ask somebody else.  - I wanna know what they said.

1078
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:38,520
我要知道我妻子说过什么
I wanna know what my wife said

1079
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,860
我要知道我女儿说过什么
and I wanna know what my daughter said.

1080
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:51,870
我要知道你是如何杀死了她们
I wanna know how you killed them.

1081
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:55,640
我要知道她们是否知道所遭受的一切
And I wanna know if they knew it was happening to them.

1082
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,110
我要知道她们的感受
I wanna know what they felt!

1083
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,610
我要知道她们是否感到痛苦
I wanna know if they hurt.

1084
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,620
回答我
Answer me!

1085
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:10,720
回答我
Answer me!

1086
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:16,220
说啊 狗杂种
Answer me, you fucking bastard!

1087
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,140
这样是不是好一点
Is it better?

1088
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:40,080
你可能会误会我的意思 但是
You're gonna take this the wrong way, but, um,

1089
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:40,900
我觉得你应该
I think that you should

1090
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,380
写其他事情 而不是写你自己
write about something other than yourself.

1091
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,090
人都是只写自己 不写其他东西
Nobody writes about anything but themselves.

1092
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:50,990
我只是 我一边看一边在走神
I just, my mind started to wander when I was reading it,

1093
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:53,500
这算是写得不好 对吧
and that's not good, right?

1094
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,600
我不知道怎么办 也许 你知道
I don't know what to do. Maybe, you know,

1095
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,200
也许我没有写书的潜质
maybe I don't have a book in me.

1096
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,770
也许你该给自己一点空间 做点别的
Maybe give yourself some space. Just do something else.

1097
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:00,500
- 你能不能别这样  - 怎么了
- Can you not do that?  - What?

1098
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,000
因为这样 这样让我觉得你对我没信心
Because it... That makes me feel like you don't believe in me.

1099
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:04,840
- 爱德华 我可没这么说  - 是 你没这么说
- Edward, that's not what I said.  - No, you didn't say that.

1100
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,110
但是你脸上的表情在这么说
But you're saying it with your face

1101
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:08,040
你的叹息也在这么说
and you're saying it when you sigh.

1102
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:08,850
不管怎样 当你要我重回学校的时候
Whatever, you're saying it

1103
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:10,280
你说的是这个意思
when you say you want me to go back to school.

1104
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,780
是的 我是想要你重回学校
Well, yeah, I do want you to go back to school.

1105
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,880
我没觉得这有什么不对
I don't see what's wrong with that.

1106
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,620
我想说 我只是个现实主义者
I mean, I'm just being a realist.

1107
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:17,450
我想说 你打算就开一间书店 写一本小说
I mean, you're gonna work at a book store and just write a novel,

1108
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:18,450
似乎这就是你想要的生活
like that's what you wanna do with your life?

1109
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:26,130
我想说 这样很浪漫 但是怎么办 只是这些吗
I mean, that's really romantic, but, like, what? This is it?

1110
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,860
- 就是这些 这就是…  - 你这么说话就像你妈妈
- This is it? This is what...  - You sound like your mother.

1111
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:35,200
你总是说我让你觉得我多像她
Well, you always said that I reminded you so much of her, so...

1112
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:37,310
你知道 这就是我不想看你的作品的根本原因
You know, this is exactly why I don't wanna read your work

1113
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:39,140
因为你总是心怀戒备
because you always get so fucking defensive.

1114
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:41,210
是 我当然要心怀戒备
Yeah, of course I'm defensive!

1115
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,290
你知不知道这是什么滋味
Do you know what it feels

1116
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:44,310
当你醉心创作的时候
like to put yourself out on the line creatively

1117
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:45,520
你所爱的人却告诉你
and then have someone you

1118
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,650
他们看不懂
love tell you that they don't understand it?

1119
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,480
我不知道什么滋味 因为我没有创造力
No, I don't, because I'm not creative...

1120
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,890
那是因为你选择了不去创作
That's because you choose not to be.

1121
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:57,230
我不想吵架 我又累又烦
I don't wanna fight. I'm tired and I'm edgy.

1122
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,490
整晚都在写作
I've been writing all night.

1123
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:00,300
我只希望你能喜欢它 好吗
I just wanted you to like it, all right?

1124
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:09,840
谢谢你
Thanks.

1125
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,680
有个消息会令你不快
I got some news you're not gonna like.

1126
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:25,920
他们要释放雷·马科斯
They're letting ray Marcus go.

1127
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,760
什么 什么意思他们要释放他
What? What do you mean, they're letting him go?

1128
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,090
地区检察官说我们没有铁证
The d.A. Says we don't have enough hard evidence,

1129
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:32,660
我们只有一些不重要的证据
what we have is circumstantial.

1130
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,000
他要的是铁证
He needs corroboration.

1131
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,000
托尼 我真的很抱歉
I'm real sorry, Tony.

1132
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,040
太遗憾了
It's a goddamn shame.

1133
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,040
至少你狠狠地打了他一顿
At least you got to lay a good belt on him.

1134
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,710
这哪里够 我们还能做什么
No, that's not enough. What else can we do?

1135
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:52,710
我可以想点什么
I can think of something.

1136
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:55,720
但你要快点过来
You'd better get here quick, though.

1137
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,050
他不会在这儿呆很久
He ain't gonna stick around for long.

1138
01:20:58,150 --> 01:20:59,550
好 我这就出发
Okay, all right, I'm leaving now.

1139
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:04,460
什么
What?

1140
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:09,360
我跟你说过 我得了肺癌 已经扩散了
I told you, I got lung cancer. It's metastasized.

1141
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:14,900
- 但你一直在抽烟  - 是啊 该抽还得抽
- But you smoke all the time.  - Yeah, well, that's how it works.

1142
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:17,070
现在戒烟有什么意义 我还能活一年
What's the point in quitting now? I'll be dead in a year.

1143
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:19,010
有个叫简克思的家伙
It's this fella named jenks.

1144
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:21,010
是法庭指派给雷的律师
He's the lawyer the court appointed for ray.

1145
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:23,810
他来自达拉斯 有点小聪明
He's a little smartass from Dallas.

1146
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:26,580
他和地区检察官达成协议让雷得以释放 这就是政治
He and the d.A. Made a deal and ray got off. Politics.

1147
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:28,850
你什么时候跟我说过你病了
When did you tell me you were sick?

1148
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,990
你看 他们想要赶走我
See, they're trying to force me out.

1149
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:33,350
他们已经找了一个人来接替我的工作
They already got another fella lined up for the job.

1150
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,660
我不明白你在说什么
I don't understand what you're talking about.

1151
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,420
他们就这么撂下一单谋杀案
They'd drop a murder case to do that?

1152
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:41,200
是啊 只要他们能弄到理由和材料
Oh, yeah. Give 'em the reason, ammunition.

1153
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,350
他们说我这单案子准备不足
They said my case wasn't well-prepared,

1154
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:44,830
是草率粗心完工的
was a sloppy job, slapdash,

1155
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,840
没有证据 证据获取不当
no evidence and evidence improperly gathered,

1156
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:48,840
在法庭上根本站不住脚
won't stand up in court.

1157
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:52,470
检察官是个胆小鬼
The d.A.'S too much of a

1158
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,510
不敢接可能会输的案子
chickenshit to take a case he might lose.

1159
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:59,680
卢的案子他们会起诉
They're not dropping Lou.

1160
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:05,020
但是 如果放走了雷 就他妈太糟了
Well, it's no fucking good if we don't get ray.

1161
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,790
好
Good.

1162
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:11,630
这正是我希望你会说的
That's what I was hoping you'd say.

1163
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:13,200
他们想要我退休
They want me to retire and

1164
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,030
到别处去享受我的肺癌福利
enjoy the benefits of my cancer somewhere else.

1165
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:18,730
- 见鬼去  - 你从没跟我说你得了癌症
- Fuck that.  - You never told me about the cancer.

1166
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,640
雷的问题是他有不在场证明
The problem with ray is his alibi.

1167
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,100
你有家人吗
You have a family?

1168
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:24,040
- 雷申辩说他当时跟那个小  - 波比
- Ray claims he was with that little... Bobby.  - Bobby.

1169
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,710
怎么
What?

1170
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:28,980
你有家人一起生活吗
Do you have anyone in your life?

1171
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,950
没有 没老婆 也没
No. No wife or...

1172
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,790
我有个女儿在科普斯
I have a daughter in corpus.

1173
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,230
她帮过你吗
Has she been a help?

1174
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,670
她都不知道 她又能做什么
She doesn't know. What can she do about it?

1175
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,240
不管怎样 雷申辩说
Anyway, ray claims

1176
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,750
她当时和那个叫莱拉什么的小姑娘在一起
he was with that little girl, Leila whatever her name is,

1177
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,450
她为他作证
and she backs him up.

1178
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:07,850
她姨妈则为她作证
Her aunt backs her up.

1179
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,580
我们怎么办
What are we gonna do?

1180
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:16,190
这取决于你有多想伸张正义
It's a question of how serious you are about seeing justice done.

1181
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:19,930
你懂我的意思吗
You get me?

1182
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,100
我吃不下 想吐
I can't eat. Gonna throw up.

1183
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:31,140
你如果不吃东西 又怎么去做好事情
How are you gonna get anything done if you can't eat?

1184
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:34,610
有时能吃点 有时吃不下 这里糟透了
Sometimes I can, sometimes I can't. This place is terrible.

1185
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:35,610
我需要你吃点东西
I need you to eat something.

1186
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,460
现在让我问你一个私人问题
So let me ask you a personal question.

1187
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,030
不会记录在案 只有你知我知
Off the record, between you and me.

1188
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,560
你想要我怎么对付雷·马科斯
What do you want me to do with ray Marcus?

1189
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,230
那么你能怎么对付他
Well, what can you do with him?

1190
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,140
任何你想要的
Anything you goddamn like.

1191
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:09,080
但是我记得你说过
But I thought you said that...

1192
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:09,980
听我说
Listen,

1193
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,250
我不会有任何损失
I got nothin' to lose.

1194
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:17,650
我不能让这个混蛋检察官搞砸我的最后一桩案子
I'm not gonna let this asshole d.A. Fuck up my last case.

1195
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:20,660
我也不能袖手旁观地看着杀人犯逍遥法外
I'm also not gonna stand by and watch a murderer go free.

1196
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,350
这些年我已经见过太多雷·马科斯
I've seen too many sick

1197
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:25,660
这样的变态狂都逃脱了惩罚
fucks like ray Marcus get off over the years.

1198
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,260
现在 你愿意走法律以外的途径吗
Now, are you willing to go outside of strict procedure on this?

1199
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:29,700
好
Yes.

1200
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,000
- 你确定  - 是的
- You sure?  - Yes.

1201
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,510
我是安德斯
Andes here.

1202
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:43,910
你在说笑 好了 谢谢
You're kidding? All right, thanks.

1203
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:49,920
雷刚刚出现在牧营酒吧
Ray just showed up at line camp.

1204
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:53,620
我打算让那个小笨蛋喝高
I'm gonna let that little idiot get nice and liquored up

1205
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,260
然后再把他抓起来 带到我的地盘
and then I'm gonna go grab his ass and take him to my camp.

1206
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:59,390
我想你跟我一起去
And I want you to come with me.

1207
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,730
我们打算扣留他一阵子 玩一玩他
We're gonna keep him for a little while, work him over a bit,

1208
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:04,200
给他来点难堪 让他受点罪
get a little rough, make him suffer.

1209
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:07,100
然后我们再看他怎么做
And then we'll see what he does.

1210
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,040
你觉得怎么样
Would you like that?

1211
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:19,380
你要明白这样是行不通的
You have to realize that this is not working.

1212
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,250
我们合不来 我们相差太多
We are not working. We are too different.

1213
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:23,550
- 我们不合适  - 苏珊 别说了
- We are not right for each other.  - Susan, stop.

1214
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:25,650
我们不合适吗
We're not right for each other?

1215
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,590
就是不合适
No, we're not right for each other.

1216
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:28,440
我们非常相配的啊
We are perfect for each other.

1217
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:29,720
不 一点都不相配 爱德华
No, we're not perfect for each other, Edward.

1218
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:32,160
如果我们没有生活在现实世界里
We may be perfect for each other

1219
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,060
那可能的确很相配
if we didn't live in the real world,

1220
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,300
但问题是我要活在现实里
but I live in the real world

1221
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:37,170
我需要过得更稳定有序一些
and I need a life that is more structured.

1222
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:38,830
- 我需要更稳定有序的未来  - 喂
- I need a future that is more structured.  - Hey.

1223
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,670
我也想变成你要的那种伴侣 但我做不到
I want to be the person that you want me to be, but I just can't.

1224
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,940
- 你不需要改变啊 你已经很好了  - 我做不到
- You are. You are.  - I can't be that.

1225
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,670
冷静点 别这么说
Hey, no, stop.

1226
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:50,180
我真的很想成为你所以为的那个我
I, I really wanted to be this person that you thought I was,

1227
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:51,910
我很努力了 但我真的不是那样
I really did, but I'm just not that person.

1228
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,850
- 我 我很愤世嫉俗 又世俗实际  - 不 听我说
- I'm, I'm cynical, I'm pragmatic.  - No, look...

1229
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:56,020
- 不 我就是这样 我特别实际  - 你只是害怕 你只是怕了
- No, I am. I'm a realist.  - You're afraid. You're afraid.

1230
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,750
不 我没有害怕
No, I'm not afraid.

1231
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,120
- 我们都共同经历过那么多大风大浪了  - 我不是怕
- We've been through this so many times before.  - I'm not scared.

1232
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,160
- 我不是怕 我只是不高兴  - 好吧
- I'm not scared. I'm unhappy.  - All right.

1233
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,000
我非常非常不高兴
I'm just really, really unhappy.

1234
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:14,700
你真的非常
You're so...

1235
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:18,110
你真的是个非常好的人 而且你是如此
You really are so wonderful and you're just so

1236
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,940
敏感又浪漫 而且
sensitive and romantic and...

1237
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:25,050
- 很懦弱 没错  - 什么 我没说你懦弱啊
- Weak. That's right, yeah.  - What? I did not say you were weak.

1238
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:27,450
- 你以前说过好多次  - 我可没说你懦弱
- You've said it so many times before.  - I did not call you weak.

1239
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:29,380
你明明说过的 再说一次也无妨啊
You've said it before, so why don't you say it again?

1240
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:31,650
- 不就是懦弱嘛  - 我没说过你懦弱
- Weak.  - I did not say you were weak.

1241
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:34,560
- 我肯定没说你懦弱  - 你爱我吗
- I did not say you were weak.  - Do you love me?

1242
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,320
- 这不是重点  - 不 这就是重点
- That's not the point.  - No, that is the point.

1243
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:37,990
- 不 才不是重点  - 就是重点
- No, it is not the point.  - That is the point!

1244
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:39,060
- 这根本不重要  - 你还没回答我
- That is not the point.  - You didn't answer me.

1245
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:44,470
- 没错 我爱你  - 好啊 你要是爱一个人的话
- Yes, I love you.  - Well, when you love someone,

1246
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:46,800
你会想办法解决问题
you work it out.

1247
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,970
而不是一味地断舍离
You don't just throw it away.

1248
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:51,140
你要珍惜爱情
You have to be careful with it.

1249
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,140
因为可能再也没有第二次了
You might never get it again.

1250
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,810
我不能跟你继续下去了 爱德华
I can't do this with you anymore, Edward.

1251
01:26:56,910 --> 01:26:58,810
我没法坚持下去了
I just can't keep doing this.

1252
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,150
苏珊
Susan...

1253
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,750
你不能一直
You can't just walk away from things

1254
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,050
只知道逃避啊
all the time.

1255
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:18,100
- 行了 行了  - 哦 该死 得了吧
- Come on. Come on.  - Oh, shit. Come on.

1256
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:21,100
我都说过了 我啥也不知道啊
I told you, I don't know nothin' about this situation.

1257
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:22,440
你干嘛不去问问别人呢 老哥
Why don't you go ask in there, man?

1258
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,940
我一会再来找你 听到没
I'll see you in a minute, okay?

1259
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:26,270
好不好啊 宝贝
Okay, sweetie?

1260
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:38,950
我们准备去我的地盘
We're going to my camp.

1261
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,790
在白溪那边 就在他们抓走你家人的屋子附近
It's in white creek near the trailer where they took your folks.

1262
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:46,690
你跟着一起来吧
You follow.

1263
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,380
坐起来
Sit up.

1264
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:11,650
我的天 我要吐了 托尼 过来 快点
Oh, Jesus. I'm gonna be sick. Tony, get over here, quick.

1265
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:13,490
给你 用这个 行不
Here, you use this, right?

1266
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:15,160
要是他有什么不规矩的地方就打他
You shoot him if he gets out of line.

1267
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,770
呕
Boo.

1268
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:27,940
喂 哥们 你们这样做不合法吧 要是合法的话
Hey, man, this ain't legal. If this were legal,

1269
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:29,800
你们就直接带我去警局了 才不会来这种鬼地方呢
you'd have taken me to the station, not this fucking place.

1270
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:32,340
现在我们说了算 小子
It's all the legal we need, boy.

1271
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,780
- 你们也没有什么新证据  - 是吗
- There ain't no new evidence.  - Oh, yeah?

1272
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:41,480
要是你们有证据了 干嘛不直接把我抓进去呢 嗯
Why don't you take me in if you got new evidence? Huh?

1273
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,090
因为我更喜欢这里 气氛比较融洽
I like it better here. It's more relaxed.

1274
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,520
你这套把戏我可是见识过的
It seems to me you tried this trick already.

1275
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:51,260
要是你以为这个人能对付得了我
If you think this guy's gonna break me down,

1276
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:52,830
- 那你已经知道这办法行不通了  - 是啊没错
- you already seen that don't work.  - Oh, yeah,

1277
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,360
但是要是我告诉你
but what would you say if I told you

1278
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:57,630
你朋友卢·贝茨已经把你
your friend Lou Bates implicated you

1279
01:28:57,630 --> 01:28:59,430
在哈斯廷斯一家谋杀案中的罪行供出来了呢
in the Hastings murders?

1280
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,540
要是卢真把我供出来了 你们早就把我抓进去了
If Lou had done that, you would have taken me in.

1281
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:05,370
哦 别担心 我们会送你去警局的
Well, don't worry, we'll get you to the station.

1282
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:07,440
- 不用担心  - 哦 谁啊
- Don't worry.  - Oh, who's this?

1283
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,110
- 啊 看看谁来了  - 你个混蛋
- Well, looky here.  - You son of a bitch.

1284
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,280
好了
All right.

1285
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:18,890
好了 快点 小子 过来
Okay, come on, boy. Get over there.

1286
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:21,220
- 卢 你他妈跟这人说什么了  - 我啥也没说啊
- Lou, what'd you fucking tell this guy?  - I didn't tell him nothin'.

1287
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:22,090
不可能 他说你告诉他
No, he said you told him I

1288
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:23,660
我是杀了这人老婆孩子的凶手
was the one who killed this guy's wife and kid.

1289
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:25,990
啥 这不是他跟我说的吗
What? That's what he told me about you.

1290
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,330
你可是执法人员 这啥情况啊
You're supposed to be the lawman. What kind of bullshit is this?

1291
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:29,400
闭嘴
Fuck off

1292
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:32,000
俩人都闭嘴
both of you.

1293
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,870
现在 你们俩有什么遗言想说吗
Now, do you two have any last words you wanna say to each other?

1294
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,070
我觉得吧 托尼
I think what we should do, Tony,

1295
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,580
我们现在就应该干脆杀了他们
is we should just kill them right now.

1296
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,310
放他们逍遥法外可挺烦人的
It's gonna be rough for 'em out there,

1297
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:48,480
不知道会有什么影响
not knowing how it's gonna come.

1298
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,390
或许雷的死因是拒不受捕 嗯
Maybe Ray'll get killed for resisting arrest, huh?

1299
01:29:57,690 --> 01:29:59,430
深夜晚归
Coming home late at night,

1300
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,900
可能被窃贼开枪打死
he might get shot by a burglar.

1301
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,670
哦 你觉得不好受吗 小子
Oh, you feeling uncomfortable, boy?

1302
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:14,340
喔 起来
Ooh. Come on up here.

1303
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:16,280
真的 你好像真的觉得不好受啊
Yeah, you look like you're feeling uncomfortable.

1304
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:18,450
- 什么  - 抱歉 我很抱歉
- What?  - Sorry. I'm sorry.

1305
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:19,350
你说什么
What's that?

1306
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:22,520
我不会杀你的 小子
I ain't gonna kill you, son.

1307
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,680
我可是警察
I'm a policeman.

1308
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:26,950
怎么 你要哭啦
What, you gonna cry?

1309
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,360
真要哭啦
Are you gonna cry?

1310
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:34,900
哦哟 好吧 既然你都这么难受了
Aw, okay. Well, since you're feeling so uncomfortable...

1311
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,200
托尼 过来
Tony, get over here.

1312
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:38,100
拿好
Take this.

1313
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:40,870
- 来吧 站这 好不  - 求你别
- Go on, right here, okay?  - Please don't.

1314
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:42,900
站好 站好
Fuck. Right here, right here.

1315
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:44,540
站好 好吗
Right here, okay?

1316
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,540
- 好了  - 喂 喂
- Right.  - Hey, hey.

1317
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:48,310
那我呢 我也觉得难受了
What about me? I might be feeling uncomfortable too.

1318
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:49,780
哦 是吗
Oh, yeah?

1319
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:52,450
好吧 起来吧
Okay, come on up.

1320
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,650
好了 重归自由

1324
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:09,560

1325
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:11,730

Let's go...

1328
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,410
他有枪的
He's got a gun.

1329
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,450
- 波比  - 开枪 托尼 开枪
- Bobby?  - Shoot 'em, Tony. Shoot 'em.

1330
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:26,410

1332
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:52,270
不要 求你
No, please.

1333
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:24,640
你还好吗
Are you okay?

1334
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:28,810
我的余生都要在悔恨中度过了
I'm gonna live to regret this.

1335
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:33,380
我现在好后悔
I regret it now.

1336
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:38,720
你知道的 我信天主教 我不支持人工流产的
You know, I'm catholic. I don't even believe in abortions.

1337
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:42,160
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

1338
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,230
我真没用
I feel so useless.

1339
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:50,500
你可千万别这么说 你总能想到最好的做法
You're anything but useless. You always know exactly what to do.

1340
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:53,600
谢谢你
Thank you.

1341
01:32:59,610 --> 01:33:02,110
我觉得自己再也无法直面爱德华了
I just don't think I'm ever gonna be able to look at Edward again

1342
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,780
毕竟我对他的孩子犯下了这种罪孽
after what I did to his child.

1343
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:05,180
他永远不会知道的
He'll never find out.

1344
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:16,390
我都做了什么 我都做了什么
What did I do? What did I do?

1345
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:18,390
我保证不会有事的
I promise it'll be okay.

1346
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,860
我会让一切都好起来的
I'll make it okay.

1347
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,540
哦 天啊 不
Oh, my god, no.

1348
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:37,110
爱德华
Edward.

1349
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,720
托尼
Tony.

1350
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:45,650

1351
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:47,790
喂
Hey.

1352
01:33:50,330 --> 01:33:52,330
你知道我除了开枪别无选择 对吧
You know I had to shoot him, right?

1353
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:58,930
我他妈一点都不在乎你开枪打他
I don't give a goddamn fuck that you shot him!

1354
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:00,500
你开枪打他我很高兴
I'm glad that you shot him!

1355
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,570
他终于死了我他妈高兴死了
I'm fucking glad that he's dead!

1356

我应该可以阻止的
I should have stopped it!

1357
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:15,850
我应该保护好她们的
I should have protected them.

1358
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:17,590
我应该想到会那样的
I should have seen it coming.

1359
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:20,520
我本来可以阻止的
I should have stopped it.

1360
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,690
好了 好了
Hey, now. Hey, now.

1361

我本来可以阻止的
I should have stopped it.

1362
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:23,990
嘘
Shh.

1363
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:27,460
- 好了  - 我本来可以阻止的
- It's okay.  - I should have stopped it.

1364
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:28,600
好了
It's okay.

1365
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,530
喂
Hey.

1366
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:33,430
冷静点
You're okay.

1367
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,640
我应该阻止的 波比
I should have stopped it, Bobby.

1368
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:36,670
看着我
Look at me.

1369
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:39,770
你是个好人
You're a good man.

1370
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,610
你是个好人
You're a good man.

1371
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:52,320
好了 起来吧
Come on. We gotta get up.

1372
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,050
雷跑上公路了 他肯定要去搭车
Ray gets to the road, he's gonna hitchhike.

1373
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,320
我们要在他搭上车之前抓住他
We gotta catch him before he gets a ride.

1374
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,060
听我说
Now, listen to me.

1375
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:59,390
走到一个三岔路的时候 你走左边那条路
When you get to the fork in the road, you veer to the left.

1376
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,730
然后你就会回到他抓走你家人的地方
That's gonna take you back towards where he took your folks.

1377
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:03,500
我怀疑他会往高速路走
I suspect he's gonna go for the highway.

1378
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,900
我去那个方向追
I'll go that direction.

1379
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:08,570
你带着这个 我车里还有一把
You take this. I got another one in the car.

1380
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:09,970
- 波比  - 怎么
- Bobby...  - What?

1381
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:12,910
你做这些会惹上麻烦吗
Are you in trouble for all this?

1382
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,150
我也不知道 但我一点都不在乎
Hell, I don't know. I don't really give a shit.

1383
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:20,150
我快死了 你忘了吗
I'm dying, remember?

1384
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:05,490

1385
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:08,520
是你啊 你的伙伴呢
You. Where's your pal?

1386
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:09,820
他马上就到
He's on his way.

1387
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:12,930
警察们呢
Your cop friends?

1388
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:17,600
他们就在附近
They're around.

1389

他们在这
They here?

1390
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:25,770
现在就我自己
It's just me for the moment.

1391
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:28,210

1392
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:31,780
就你和这把你根本不会用的枪啊
You and that fucking gun you don't know how to use.

1393

龟儿子
Fucking son of a bitch.

01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:45,790
你那个朋友可会有大麻烦的 你知道吧
That's big trouble for your friend, you know that, right?

1398
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,630
我不觉得
I don't think so.

1399
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,960
你不觉得
You don't think so?

1400
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,630
好吧 那你到底想干嘛
Well, then, what the fuck do you want?

1401
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,570
你拿把破枪想干嘛
You and that silly gun.

1402
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:00,140
你好像拿着还挺顺手的呢
I've seen how handy you are with that thing.

1403
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:01,710
坐下 坐下
Sit down. Sit down.

1404
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:05,150
快坐下不然我一枪崩了你
You sit down or I'll fucking kill you.

1405
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:12,990
听着 哥们
Listen, man...

1406
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:18,030
为什么像你这样的好人
Why does a nice guy like you

1407
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:21,500
会跟安德斯这种杀人不眨眼的人一起玩呢
hang out with a guy like Andes who kills people?

1408
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:24,500
你才杀人不眨眼
You kill people.

1409
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:33,580
她们遭遇不幸
They had it coming to 'em,

1410
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:35,840
你的老婆孩子 但是你
your fucking wife and that kid, but you...

1411
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:37,380
你误会我了 那是个意外
You got me wrong, it was an accident.

1412
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:38,950
你说是意外
It was an accident?

1413
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:41,920
我是很爱惜名声的
I got a certain pride in how people talk to me.

1414
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:45,690
我也有底线的
There are certain things I don't put up with.

1415
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:49,360
要是有人说我犯了什么事
When someone accuses me of something,

1416
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,020
那绝对是侮辱
that's a fucking insult.

1417
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:53,960
锅可不能白背
It gives me the right.

1418
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:58,300
要是我的女人说我跟别人鬼混
If my woman accuses me of fucking somebody else,

1419
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:00,630
那我就会去找个女人鬼混
well, then, I'll go fuck somebody else.

1420
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:05,640
要是你闺女觉得我是强奸犯 那我就强奸她
If your daughter thinks I'm a rapist, then she gets raped.

1421
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:13,480
你对我们犯下那种罪行 绝不可能逍遥法外 绝不可能
Nobody gets away with what you did to us. Nobody.

1422
01:39:14,650 --> 01:39:15,720
绝不可能
Nobody.

1423
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:17,320

They don't?

1424
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,390
不可能
Nobody.

1425
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:21,960
不可能
Nobody.

1426
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:24,830
不可能
Nobody.

1427
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:26,660
好啊 那你直接杀了我呗
Well, then, you should just kill me, then.

1428
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,400
对吧
Right?

1429
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:32,170
你应该杀了我
You should fucking kill me.

1430
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,070
老哥 你啥也不懂
Man, you know nothing.

1431
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:41,980
杀人很好玩的
It's fun to kill people.

1432
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:45,280
大家都应该尝试一下
You of all people should try it sometime.

1433
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,350

我记得我睡过你老婆
I remember fucking your wife.

1444
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,460
你太懦弱了
You're too weak.

1445
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,000
太他妈懦弱 知道吗
Too fucking weak, you know.

1446
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,800
你太懦弱所以什么也做不了
You're too weak to do anything about it.

1447
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:48,140
去你妈的
Son of a bitch!
