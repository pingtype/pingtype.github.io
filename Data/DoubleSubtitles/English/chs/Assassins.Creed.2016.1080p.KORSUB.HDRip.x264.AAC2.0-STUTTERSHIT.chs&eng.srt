00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,470
但我们中部分人相信
{\fs16}But there are those of us who believe that

262
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,980
神或某种古代文明
{\fs16}God or some ancient civilization

263
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:41,480
留给了我们一个路线图来 了解为什么人类如此暴力
{\fs16}have left us a road map to understand why people are violent.

264
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,070
阿吉拉尔是我们所知的 最后一个拥有伊甸苹果的人
{\fs16}Aguilar was the last person known to have had it in his possession.

265
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,240
我们需要你找出他把它藏在哪里了
{\fs16}We need you to find out where he hid it.

266
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,790
我以为我是来接受治疗的
{\fs16}I thought I was here to be cured.

267
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,370
暴力就是种疾病
{\fs16}Violence is a disease.

268
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,580
像癌症一样
{\fs16}Like cancer.

269
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,960
并且像癌症一样 我们希望有一天能治愈它
{\fs16}And like cancer, we hope to control it one day.

270
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,720
是暴力让我还活着
{\fs16}Violence is what kept me alive.

271
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,470
好吧 严格地说你死了
{\fs16}Well technically, you're dead.

272
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,520
我饿了
{\fs16}I'm hungry.

273
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,440
我有什么好处?
{\fs16}What's in it for me?

274
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,690
一旦我的研究完成 这里就不需要你了
{\fs16}Once my research is complete, there is no reason to keep you here.

275
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,110
我能回到自己的生活?
{\fs16}I get my life back?

276
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,410
比那更好你将有个新生活
{\fs16}Better. A new one.

277
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,290
你不是饿了么
{\fs16}You are hungry.

278
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,480
你不知道他是谁 他是干什么的
{\fs16}You don't know who he is, what he is.

279
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,270
他是个危险人物
{\fs16}He is a dangerous man.

280
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,110
多给他点时间埃米尔
{\fs16}Give him little more time, Emir.

281
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,480
他或许能证明他的骨子里流着高贵的血
{\fs16}Man may prove that has some noble blood in him yet.

282
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,780
坐这里怎么样先生?
{\fs16}How about, sir?

283
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:20,000
可以随便点菜 但我们推荐鸡
{\fs16}It's an open menu, but we do recommend a chicken.

284
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,090
你想要点什么 林奇先生? 可以随便点菜
{\fs16}What can I get you, Mr. Lynch? It's an open menu,

285
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,840
但我们推荐鸡
{\fs16}but we do recommend a chicken.

286
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:36,970
我要牛排
{\fs16}I'll steak.

287
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,060
给开拓者一份牛排
{\fs16}Steak for the pioneer.

288
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,650
你是谁?
{\fs16}Who are you?

289
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,860
他们叫我穆萨
{\fs16}They call me Moussa.

290
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,740
但我的名字是巴普蒂斯特 我已经死了200年了
{\fs16}But my name is Baptiste. I'm dead 200 years now.

291
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,620
伏都毒师
{\fs16}Voodoo poisoner.

292
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,580
我不会伤害任何人
{\fs16}I'm harmless.

293
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,300
他们在盯着你
{\fs16}They're watching you.

294
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,510
等着发现你是谁开拓者
{\fs16}Waiting to see who you are, pioneer.

295
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,140
你见过他了么?
{\fs16}Have you met him yet?

296
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,730
你有没有见过他?
{\fs16}Have you met him yet?

297
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,070
我们都是最后保护伊甸苹果的人我的朋友
{\fs16}We are the last to protect the Apple, my friend.

298
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,780
做错一个选择 你将把我们都送入无底深渊
{\fs16}Pick the wrong choice, you'll send us all to infinity.

299
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,450
这个
{\fs16}This...

300
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,040
是你的
{\fs16}belongs to you.

301
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,100
你将把他们直接引向它
{\fs16}You're going to lead them right to it.

302
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,020
不我打算吃了它
{\fs16}Ne, I'm going to eat it.

303
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,450
什么鬼?
{\fs16}What the fuck is going on?

304
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,980
他必须回到Animus
{\fs16}He has to go back in the Animus.

305
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,030
现在
{\fs16}Now.

306
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,280
在再次进入之前他还需要点时间
{\fs16}He needs more time before he goes in again.

307
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,240
我们没时间了
{\fs16}We don't have time.

308
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,870
为什么?
{\fs16}Why?

309
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,380
我不会拿他的命冒险
{\fs16}I won't risk his life.

310
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,590
那么我就找其他人来做
{\fs16}Then I'll have to find someone else to do it.

311
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,460
- 该你上了高手 - 我已经疯了
{\fs16}- You're up, slugger. - I'm crazy.

312

因感到寂寞而疯
{\fs16}Crazy for feeling so lonely.

314
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,270
他们又让他进去了
{\fs16}They're getting him back in again.

315
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,820
我们必须在他背叛我们之前阻止他
{\fs16}We should stop him before he betrays us.

316
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,610
日期调到6
{\fs16}Set the date for the six.

317
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,320
如果他状态恶化 就拉他出来
{\fs16}If his condition deteriorates, pull him out.

318
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,280
- 你父亲 - 我不管我爸说了什么
{\fs16}- You father... - I don't care what my father said.

319
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:11,120
我在世上到底做了什么?
{\fs16}What in the world did I do?

320
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,460
- 卡尔听我说 - 我为尝试疯狂
{\fs16}- Cal, listen to me. - I'm crazy for trying...

321
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,340
听我说 你必须紧盯着阿吉拉尔
{\fs16}Listen to me. You have to stay with Aguilar.

322
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,800
为哭泣疯狂
{\fs16}Crazy for crying...

323
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,300
呆在同步空白处很危险
{\fs16}Staying in synch-void could be dangerous.

324
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:26,470
我为爱你而疯狂
{\fs16}And I'm crazy for loving you...

325
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,600
很快他们将进军格拉纳德
{\fs16}Soon they will march on Granada.

326
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,180
苏丹穆罕穆德已经虚弱了
{\fs16}Sultan Muhammad is weak.

327
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,770
他将交出伊甸苹果
{\fs16}He'll surrender the Apple

328
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,940
并且为了救王子背叛信条
{\fs16}and betray the Creed to save the prince.

329
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,160
爱让我们变弱
{\fs16}The love makes us weak.

330
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:35,420
值得高兴的是我将牺牲我的血肉
{\fs16}Gladly I'll sacrifice my flesh and blood,

331
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,130
让信条得以幸存
{\fs16}for survival of the Creed.

332
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,310
当我今天死去时 别为我浪费眼泪
{\fs16}When I die today, don't waste your tears for me.

333
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,320
主发话了
{\fs16}The Lord spoke.

334
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,160
他说:
{\fs16}And he said:

335
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,790
"如果一个人不遵从我
{\fs16}"If a man abide not in me

336
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,370
他就会被投入火中
{\fs16}he is cast into the fire

337
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,710
并且被烧死!"
{\fs16}and he is burned!"

338
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,630
数十年来
{\fs16}For decades,

339
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:12,600
你们因宗教不同
{\fs16}you have lived in the world torn apart

340
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,430
生活在四分五裂的世界
{\fs16}by religious discord.

341
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,770
但很快感谢上帝
{\fs16}But soon, thanks to God

342
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,230
和宗教法庭
{\fs16}and Inquisition

343
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,570
我们将清洗这一疾病!
{\fs16}we will purge this disease!

344
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,460
你们面前的这些罪人
{\fs16}The sinners before you,

345
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:43,880
在这场圣战中致力于保护
{\fs16}sought to defend the heretic prince of Granada,

346
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,510
野蛮人最后的据点格拉纳德
{\fs16}the last heathen stronghold

347
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:51,300

348
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,800
所以今天
{\fs16}So today,

349
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,930
在我们的国王及皇后面前
{\fs16}before our king and queen

350
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,140
我发誓我将在上帝的圣火中
{\fs16}I swear we shall wash ourselves clean,

351
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,560
净化我们自己!
{\fs16}in the holy fire of God!

352
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,360
看啊
{\fs16}Behold...

353
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,660
上帝的意志!
{\fs16}God's will!

354
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:21,460
你将看着你们的导师被烧死 然后以最慢的方式死去
{\fs16}You will watch your mentor burn and then you will die the slowest.

355
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,930
给未来带来荣耀
{\fs16}Give glory to the future.

356
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,270
而不是给我们
{\fs16}Not to us.

357
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,810
他正在同步
{\fs16}He is synchronizing.

358
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,030
该死的异教徒!
{\fs16}Damned heretics!

359
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,840
别让他们跑了!

360
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,640
跳
{\fs16}Jump.

361
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,450
同步消除完毕
{\fs16}Complete desynch.

362
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,910
放他下来!

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,870
叫医生!
{\fs16}Call the medics!

368
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,260
我的腿没知觉了
{\fs16}I can't feel my legs.

369
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,840
瘫痪是暂时的
{\fs16}Paralysis is temporal.

370
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,470
坏消息呢?
{\fs16}What's the bad news?

371
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,770
它造成了神经分裂  但是我们带你挺过来了
{\fs16}It caused a neurological split but we got you through it.

372
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,390
这一次
{\fs16}This time.

373
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,690
我会死在这儿对吧?
{\fs16}I'm gonna die in here, aren't I?

374
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,490
不会
{\fs16}No.

375
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,700
只要你自愿进入那里就不会死
{\fs16}Not if you go in there on your own free will.

376
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,040
我办不到
{\fs16}I can't do this.

377
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,830
不你行的
{\fs16}Yes, you can.

381
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,830
你从哪儿得到它的?
{\fs16}Where did you get this?

382
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:06,630
我父亲从你母亲的谋杀现场取来的
{\fs16}My father recovered it from the scene of your mother's murder.

383
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,380
并带到这里保管
{\fs16}And brought it here for safekeeping.

384
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,340
保管?
{\fs16}Safekeeping?

385
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:13,880
你偷了它
{\fs16}You stole it.

386
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:17,140
这是你母亲的项链 我希望你拿着它
{\fs16}It's your mother's necklace. I wanted you to have it.

387
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,260
他为什么在这?
{\fs16}Why was he there?

388
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,270
- 为了救她 - 从谁手里?
{\fs16}- To save her. - From whom?

389
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,940
- 她自己的人 - 和你有什么关系?
{\fs16}- Her own people. - What's that got to do with you?

390
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:29,230
刺客和圣殿骑士的战争 持续了几个世纪了
{\fs16}Assassins and Templars have been at war for centuries.

391
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:31,940
我想改变它
{\fs16}I aim to change that.

392
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,990
哦对我忘了
{\fs16}That's right, I forgot.

393
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,320
我们是来和侵略作斗争的
{\fs16}We're here to combat aggression.

394
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,030
我不喜欢你的方法
{\fs16}I don't think I like your methods.

395
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,910
我是科学家
{\fs16}I am a scientist.

396
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,370
我是来治疗暴力的
{\fs16}I'm here to be cured of violence.

397
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,420
谁来治愈你?
{\fs16}Who's gonna cure you?

398
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,510
我们在喂养野兽
{\fs16}We're feeding the beast.

399
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:43,680
我们在使他变得更强
{\fs16}We're making him stronger.

400
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,950
我是莱金博士
{\fs16}I am Dr Rikkin.

401
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,950
艾伦
{\fs16}Alan.

402
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,660
我在阿布斯泰戈这里负责照看一些事物
{\fs16}I look after things here in Abstergo.

403
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,500
你喜欢把事物 放在一个大家庭里是吧?
{\fs16}You like to keep the things in the family, huh?

404
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:12,960
是的
{\fs16}Yes.

405
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,710
很抱歉让你感到不舒服
{\fs16}I'm sorry if we caused you any discomfort.

406
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,180
我还能为你做什么?
{\fs16}Is there anything I can do?

407
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,840
放了我怎么样?
{\fs16}How about you let me out of here?

408
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:34,400
这我办不到
{\fs16}That's something I can't manage.

409
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,400
我是来做交易的
{\fs16}I'm here to make a deal.

410
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,110
我们需要伊甸苹果
{\fs16}We need the Apple.

411
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:47,040
需要你为我们找到它
{\fs16}And we need you to get it for us.

412
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:52,000
你已经和Animus消除同步了
{\fs16}You've been desynching in the Animus.

413
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:55,540
我们希望你不要这样
{\fs16}We need you not to do that.

414
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,710
把我送回机器里?
{\fs16}Sending me back to the machine?

415
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:02,300
不 你已经给我们看了我们需要看到的
{\fs16}No, you've already shown us what we needed to see.

416
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,090
那你会放我们走吗?
{\fs16}Will you let us free then?

417
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,770
你想从新来的那里获得什么?
{\fs16}What do you hope to gain from the newcomer?

418
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,650
一些有益我们所有人的东西
{\fs16}Something that'll benefit us all.

419
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:25,120
还有你穆萨
{\fs16}You too, Moussa.

420
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,930
你对他们做了什么?
{\fs16}What have you done to them?

421
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,150
当你不是自愿回到过去时就会这样
{\fs16}It's what happens if you don't enter in regression on your own volition.

422
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:07,160
你认出这个了吗?
{\fs16}Do you recognize this?

423
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,990
这是刺客的袖剑
{\fs16}It's Assassin's blade.

424
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,170
这就是那把
{\fs16}This is the actual one...

425
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,340
你父亲用来杀死你母亲的刀
{\fs16}your father used to take your mother's life.

426
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:25,260
他也在这你知道吗?
{\fs16}He's here, you know?

427
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,230
母亲的死卡尔
{\fs16}Mother's death, Cal.

428
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:38,270
可不是什么应该让孩子看到的东西
{\fs16}Not something a boy should ever be made to see.

429
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:29,740
这是错的
{\fs16}This is wrong.

430
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:31,780
你逼我的
{\fs16}You left me no choice.

431
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,330
他必须以自己的意志进入你说的
{\fs16}He has to go in on his own free will, you said that.

432
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,790
- 我必须协商 - 你是说操控?
{\fs16}- I had to negotiate. - You mean manipulate?

433
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,550
我向长老保证我们会为伦敦获得伊甸苹果
{\fs16}I assured the Elders we would have the Apple for London.

434
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,340
在两天内
{\fs16}That's in two days.

435
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,640
他不想知道他的过去 或他父亲的
{\fs16}He doesn't want to know his past, or his father.

436
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,480
他想摧毁他们全部
{\fs16}He wants to destroy them, both.

437
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:01,440
我们不是来制造怪物的
{\fs16}We're not in the business of creating monsters.

438
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,320
我们既不会制造他们也不会毁灭他们
{\fs16}We neither created them nor destroyed them.

439
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:07,320
我们只不过任他们沉溺于 自己不可动摇的信仰
{\fs16}We merely abandoned them to their own inexorable faith.

440
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:26,130
- 你是你母亲的儿子 - 什么意思?
{\fs16}- You're your mother's son. - What does that mean?

441
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,050
你体内流动的血不只是你自己的
{\fs16}Blood that flows through you is not your own.

442
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:35,010
还属于信条
{\fs16}Belongs to the Creed.

443
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,680
你母亲知道的
{\fs16}Your mother knew that.

444
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,810
她死了信条才得以存活
{\fs16}She died so the Creed may live.

445
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:45,730
告诉我为什么会这样!
{\fs16}Remind me how, exactly!

446
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,110
你看到的确实是我做的
{\fs16}What you saw, I did.

447
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,330
你谋杀了她
{\fs16}You murdered her.

448
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:03,080
我宁可夺去她的生命也不想它让机器偷取
{\fs16}I took her life rather than have it stolen by that machine.

449
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,800
使命让人伟大
{\fs16}Man grows with the greatness of his task.

450
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,800
我本应杀了你
{\fs16}I ought to have killed you.

451
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,350
我下不了手
{\fs16}I couldn't.

452
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,640
那么现在
{\fs16}Well, here.

453
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:23,600
杀了我
{\fs16}Take it.

454
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,940
做你30年前做不了的事
{\fs16}Do what you couldn't do 30 years ago.

455
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,020
刀在你手里卡尔
{\fs16}It's in your hands now, Cal.

456
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,110
这就是他们想要的
{\fs16}This is what they want.

457
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,700
让我留血
{\fs16}Spill my blood.

458
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,580
但是别再回机器里了
{\fs16}But do not go back in the Animus.

459
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,200
为什么?
{\fs16}Why?

460
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,040
伊甸苹果包含了自由意志的基因编码
{\fs16}The Apple contains the genetic code for free will.

461
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:47,790
他们会用它毁了我们
{\fs16}They will use it to destroy us.

462
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,840
我要找到它
{\fs16}I'm gonna find it.

463
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:57,930
然后看着他们摧毁你和你的信条
{\fs16}And watch them destroy you and your Creed.

464
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,270
你毁不掉信条
{\fs16}You can not kill the Creed.

465
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,810
它在你的血液里
{\fs16}It's in your blood.

466
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,190
伊甸苹果就是一切
{\fs16}The Apple is everything.

467
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:08,900
你母亲为保护它而死
{\fs16}Your mother died to protect it.

468
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:14,240
她没得选
{\fs16}She had no choice.

469
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:25,080
我有
{\fs16}I do.

470
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,170
你会毁了信条!
{\fs16}You're gonna kill the Creed!

471
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:23,060
带我去Animus
{\fs16}Take me to the Animus.

472
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,230
把我放进去
{\fs16}Put me in.

473
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:35,360
准备好Animus
{\fs16}Prepare the Animus.

474
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,070
自愿回归
{\fs16}Voluntary regression.

475
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,530
你知道刺客名字的由来吗?
{\fs16}Do you know how the Assassins came to be named?

476
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:47,210
来自阿拉伯语 "Hashashin"
{\fs16}From an Arabic word "Hashashin".

477
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,830
他们是被社会排斥的人
{\fs16}They were society's outcasts.

478
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,670
那些冷血偷窃、谋杀的人
{\fs16}Those who stole, who murdered in cold blood.

479
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:59,840
人们嘲笑他们 叛逆者愚蠢的人瘾君子
{\fs16}People ridiculed them... Rebels, fools, drug addicts.

480
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,010
但他们是智慧的
{\fs16}But they were wise.

481
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:06,890
他们利用这个名声来向那些甚至最强的敌人
{\fs16}They used this reputation to hide the dedication to principles

482
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,850
隐藏自己所献身原则的
{\fs16}beyond those of even their strongest enemies.

483
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:15,280
我为此敬佩他们
{\fs16}And for that I admire them.

484
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,110
但你不是其中之一
{\fs16}But you're not one of those men.

485
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,280
那你是吗?
{\fs16}Are you?

486
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:27,000
走着瞧吧
{\fs16}Let's find out.

487
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,550
启动回归
{\fs16}Commencing regression.

488
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:44,850
这是我一生的工作
{\fs16}This is my life's work.

489
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:48,680
这是我的生活
{\fs16}It's my life.

490
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,610
为了信条
{\fs16}For the Creed.

491
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:44,200
我们的生命
{\fs16}Our own lives...

492
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,740
我们所留下的才是重要的
{\fs16}What matters is what we leave behind.

493
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,680
苏丹
{\fs16}Sultan...

494
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,310
交出伊甸苹果
{\fs16}Surrender the Apple.

495
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:11,480
你的刺客保护者都没了
{\fs16}Your Assassin protectors are gone.

496
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,440
信条完了
{\fs16}The Creed is finished.

497
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,270
我的孩子
{\fs16}My son.

498
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:39,020
这里埋藏着
{\fs16}Here lies the seed

499
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,900
人类第一次反抗的种子
{\fs16}of man's first disobedience,

500
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:45,900
自由意志的种子
{\fs16}of free will itself.

501
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,670
多亏了伊甸苹果
{\fs16}Thanks to the Apple of Eden,

502
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:01,330
我们所知的世界
{\fs16}the known world

503
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:04,670
将被领入新时代
{\fs16}shall be ushered into a new age.

504
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:07,800
一个和平时代
{\fs16}One of peace,

505
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,050
所有战争中的人
{\fs16}in which all the warring populations of mankind

506
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:15,100
将完全只服从于
{\fs16}shall bow in perfect obedience

507
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,690
我们圣殿骑士的统治
{\fs16}to our one templar rule.

508
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,170
伊甸苹果
{\fs16}The Apple.

509
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,920
给他
{\fs16}Give it to him.

510
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:31,840
现在
{\fs16}Now.

511
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,350
为了信条
{\fs16}For the Creed.

512
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,470
上!
{\fs16}Go!

513
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:42,620
原谅我
{\fs16}Forgive me.

514
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,720
结束了!
{\fs16}It's over!

515
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,930
刺客!
{\fs16}Assassin!

516
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,630
信仰之跃
{\fs16}A leap of faith.

517
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,950
我们在哪儿?
{\fs16}Where are we?

518
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:28,160
看起来像军港
{\fs16}It looks like a military port.

519
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:43,000
卡的斯帕洛斯-德拉弗龙特拉
{\fs16}Kadiz, Palos de la Frontera.

520
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:22,630
刺客为它而死
{\fs16}The Assassins died for it.

521
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:25,800
用你的生命保护它
