00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:47,101
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}弗兰克先生。啊，你们都在这儿，不错。
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Frank. Ah, you're all here. That is good.

81
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,610
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们本来希望做的有条不紊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We had hoped to have everything in order.

82
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:52,112
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}卡勒先生，请不要那么想
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please, Mr. Kraler, don't even think of it.

83
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:55,116
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要知道，我们有足够空闲时间安排我们的一切
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}After all, we'll have plenty of leisure to arrange everything ourselves.

84
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:58,119
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我带了些三明治做你们的午餐。   -谢谢，米耶普
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I brought sandwiches for your lunch. - Thank you, Miep.

85
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:01,122
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}灌装食物在这儿，还有你们要储存的干豆和马铃薯
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The canned goods are here, and your stores of dried beans and potatoes.

86
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,626
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我下午把定量供给证拿来。   -定量供给证？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I'll get ration books this afternoon. - Ration books?

87
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:07,958
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}如果他们看到供给证上有我们的名字，就会知道我们在这里了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}If they see our names on ration books, they'll know we're here.

88
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,193
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}别担心，上边不会写你们的名字
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Don't worry. It won't be your names that'll be on them.

89
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,604
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}爸爸！西部教堂！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}father! The Westertoren!

90
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,663
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮，不！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Anne, no!

91
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:22,209
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}永远不要碰那扇窗帘，永远不要.
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You must never touch a curtain. Never.

92
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:25,714
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}任何人都不可以碰窗帘，无论白天还是晚上
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No one must ever touch a curtain, day or night.

93
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:29,273
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要是街上有人向上看，或者对面房子中有人看到......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}If someone on the street should look up, or someone in those houses should see...

94
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:31,182
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们就毁了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}we would be lost.

95
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:34,188
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}请记住，这不仅仅是对我们自己性命攸关...
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please remember, it's not only our lives that are at stake...

96
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:36,190
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}而且也关系到米耶普和卡勒先生的性命
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}but also Miep's and Mr. Kraler's.

97
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:39,125
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你只有13分钟安顿一下。  -谢谢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- You have but 1 3 minutes to get settled. - Thank you.

98
00:15:39,194 --> 00:15:44,063
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}米耶普和我会每天上来一次，给你们带来食物和消息。米耶普，我们必须走了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Miep or I will be up each day to bring you food and news. Miep, we must go.

99
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:46,124
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}再见
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Good-bye for now.

100
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,464
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}真不知道怎样谢谢你们
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}How can we thank you?

101
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:54,008
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我永远也想不到还有......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I never thought I'd live to see the day...

102
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:57,011
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}象弗兰克先生这样的人竟然也躲起来的时候
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}when a man like Mr. Frank would have to go into hiding.

103
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,309
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当你想想......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When you think of the...

104
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:01,315
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-再见     -谢谢，卡勒先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Good-bye. - Thank you, Mr. Kraler.

105
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:03,374
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-再见，米耶普。   --再见
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Good-bye, Miep. - Good-bye.

106
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,251
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-再见
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Good-bye.

107
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:20,331
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-安妮！   -好了，我多穿了3件
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Anne! - It's all right. I have on three more.

108
00:16:20,402 --> 00:16:22,336
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}打扰一下，弗兰克先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Excuse me, Mr. Frank.

109
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,998
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他什么意思，只有13分钟？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What did he mean, just 13 minutes?

110
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:27,008
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是指工人到来之前
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Before the workmen come.

111
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:30,011
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}各位，当下面的楼里有人的时候......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Now, while the men are in the building below...

112
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,013
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们必须保持绝对安静
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}we must have complete quiet.

113
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:34,515
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}任何声音下面都会听到......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Every sound can be heard down there...

114
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,518
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不但办公室，车间也会听到
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}not only in the offices but in the workrooms too.

115
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:40,453
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}人们大概8点半到，5点半离开
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The men come at about 8:30, they leave at about 5:30...

116
00:16:40,522 --> 00:16:43,958
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}所以，为了绝对安全，从早上8点到晚上6点......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}so to be perfectly safe, from 8:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening...

117
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:47,462
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}除非万不得已，我们才可以在这儿四处走动......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}we must move about up here only when it is absolutely necessary...

118
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:49,463
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}而且一定要穿着长袜
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and then in stocking feet.

119
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:52,466
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们只能轻声低语，不可以放水
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We must not speak above a whisper. We must not run any water.

120
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:55,970
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们不可以用水池甚至--抱歉--厕所
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We cannot use the sink or even-- forgive me-- the W.C.

121
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:58,472
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那些管道通向下面的车间
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The pipes go down through the workrooms.

122
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,532
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-垃圾也不可以......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- No trash must ever be

123
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:23,064
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}垃圾也不可以扔出去，因为可能暴露有人住在这里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No trash must ever be thrown out which might reveal someone is living up here.

124
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:25,066
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}即使一块土豆皮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Not even a potato peeling.

125
00:17:25,134 --> 00:17:28,069
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们必须在晚上把所有东西烧掉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We must burn everything in this stove at night.

126
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:32,733
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这就是我们必须过的日子，直到一切都结束，如果我们还活着的话
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}This is the way that we must live until it is over, if we are to survive.

127
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:35,242
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}直到一切都结束
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Until it is over.

128
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,245
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}6点之后我们可以自由活动
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}After 6:00 we can move about.

129
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:41,510
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们可以说笑，吃晚餐，阅读，做游戏......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We can talk and laugh, have our supper, read, play games...

130
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,517
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就像平时在家里一样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}just as we would at home.

131
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:48,022
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在，最明智的是请我们都回到自己的房间，8点前安顿好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Now it would be wise if we all went to our rooms and were settled before 8:00.

132
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,456
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}范・戴恩太太，你和你丈夫住楼上
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mrs. Van Daan, you and your husband will be upstairs.

133
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:53,461
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}很遗憾上面没有彼得的地方......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I regret that there's no place up there for Peter...

134
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:55,463
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是他可以住这，我们旁边
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}but he'll be here, near us.

135
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:59,467
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-那我住哪儿？  -和玛戈特住那里边
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- And where am I? - You and Margot will be in there.

136
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:01,969
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-打扰一下，弗兰克先生。  -什么事？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-Excuse me, Mr. Frank. - Yes?

137
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:06,098
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你和弗兰克太太睡哪儿？  -这个房间也是我们的卧室
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Where do you and Mrs. Frank sleep? - This room is also our bedroom.

138
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:08,109
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，不，你们住楼上。
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, no. You take the upstairs.

139
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:11,112
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-没关系，那是你们的地方。  -我们住下边吧
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- It's not right. It's your place. - We'll sleep down here.

140
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,876
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我已经考虑过了，这是最好的安排。唯一的安排
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I've thought this out. It's the best arrangement. The only arrangement.

141
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:15,883
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}呃，埃蒂茨？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Uh, Edith?

142
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:17,885
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嗯？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Hmm?

143
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:19,887
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你得休息了，亲爱的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You must have some rest, dear.

144
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:21,889
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你昨晚一夜没合眼
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You didn't close your eyes last night.

145
00:18:21,957 --> 00:18:24,653
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-和玛戈特去孩子们的房间。  -安妮，你呢？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Go in the girls' room with Margot. - How about Anne?

146
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:28,663
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我很好，我帮帮爸爸
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I feel fine. I'm going to help father.

147
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:30,892
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}请这边走，范・戴恩太太
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}This way, Mrs. Van Daan.

148
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,060
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}抱歉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Excuse me.

149
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,174
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}从这儿上去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Up here.

150
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:24,508
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}弗兰克先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Frank.

151
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:27,111
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-弗兰克先生？    -彼得？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Mr. Frank? - Peter?

152
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:31,091
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我可以给我的猫弄些水吗？  -你有猫？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-Do I have time to get water for my cat? -Have you got a cat?

153
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:33,992
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}去吧，但是轻点。你只有5分钟
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Go ahead, but be quick. You only have five minutes.

154
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:36,292
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没有猫他就没法活
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He couldn't live without that cat.

155
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:44,671
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不知道你有猫
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I didn't know you had a cat.

156
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:46,673
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我爱猫
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I love cats.

157

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-它叫什么名字？   -毛刺
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- What's its name? - Mouschi.

158
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:52,513
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是什么？毛刺。公的还是母的？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What is it? Mouschi. A him or her?

159
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:55,516
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}公的。它不喜欢生人
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's a tom, and it doesn't like strangers.

160
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:58,610
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那么，我必须尽快和它熟悉，是吗？会拴住它吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, I'll have to stop being a stranger, won't I? Is he fixed?

161
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:00,621
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不会
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No.

162
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:04,125
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，你应该拴住它，避免它打架
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, you ought to have him fixed to keep him from fighting.

163
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:06,456
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}多好看的猫啊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What a nice cat.

164
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:10,497
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你在哪儿上学?
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Where do you go to school?

165
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:12,499
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}犹太中学
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Jewish Secondary.

166
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:14,501
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我和玛戈特也在那里上学
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's where Margot and I go.

167
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:16,503
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嗯，我知道
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Yeah, I know.

168
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:18,505
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}过去从来没见过你啊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I've never seen you around.

169
00:20:18,573 --> 00:20:20,507
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我有时候会见到你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I used to see you sometimes.

170
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:22,509
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你见过？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You did?

171
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:25,512
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是为什么你那时候不过来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But why didn't you ever come over?

172
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,481
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，我也不知道。我是那种独来独往的人
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, I don't know. I'm sort of a lone wolf.

173
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,745
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这竟然有一条孤独的狼
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Can't be a lone wolf here.

174
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:37,551
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我真想知道我们今天没露面，我们的朋友会说什么？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Wonder what our friends will say when we don't show up today?

175
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:39,491
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我和珊妮约过时间
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I had a date with Sanne.

176
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:41,495
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你认识珊妮・德・沃瑞斯吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Do you know Sanne de Vries?

177
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:44,498
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-不认识。  -珊妮是我最好的朋友
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- No. - Sanne's my best friend.

178
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:47,330
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她和我一样瘦
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She's thin like me.

179
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:51,099
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他们总是对我们起哄：“安妮和珊妮，两根细麻杆。”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}They always yell at us, "'Anne and Sanne, the skinny bananas. '"

180
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:55,404
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}把你的星星摘下吧
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You took off your star.

181
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:58,345
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's right.

182
00:20:58,413 --> 00:21:02,247
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不可以，如果你不佩戴星星出去，他们会逮捕你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You can't do that. They'll arrest you if you go out without your star.

183
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:04,251
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谁会出去啊？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Who's going out?

184
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:08,255
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}帮一下
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Help me.

185

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我来帮忙
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I'm helping.

186
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:15,087
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你怎么处理它？  -烧掉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- What are you going to do with it? - Burn it.

187
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:18,189
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}太有趣了。我可不能烧掉我的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's funny. I don't think I could burn mine.

188
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:20,200
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我也不知道原因
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't know why.

189
00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:23,760
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你不能？那个他们逼你带上然后鄙视你的东西？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You couldn't? Something they make you wear so they can kick you around?

190
00:21:23,838 --> 00:21:25,772
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我知道
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know.

191
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,470
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是，毕竟这是大卫之星，不是吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But, after all, it is the Star of David, isn't it?

192
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:33,945
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮，快8点了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Annele? It's almost 8:00.

193
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:39,818
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}彼得，你不想过来和我们坐在一起吗？马上就是漫长的一天了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Don't you want to come and sit with us, Peter? It's going to be a long day.

194
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:41,947
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，谢谢，这就可以
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No, thanks. This is fine.

195
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:45,015
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}别忘了脱下鞋，记住
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You won't forget to take off your shoes, will you?

196
00:21:47,595 --> 00:21:50,029
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Peter.

197
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:52,589
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}很高兴你能和我们在一起
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's nice to have you with us.

198
00:21:53,902 --> 00:21:55,893
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嗯，弗兰克先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Yes, Mr. Frank.

199
00:21:58,073 --> 00:22:00,064
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}回见
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}See you later.

200
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:05,736
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-他在同一所学校......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- He went to the same school that...

201
00:22:41,683 --> 00:22:44,743
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有一种很欣慰的感觉，一想到卡勒先生和他的秘书......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's comforting to think Mr. Kraler and his secretary...

202
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:47,947
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就在我们下面的办公室里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}are down there below us in the offiice.

203
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:49,956
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们称呼他们是“我们的保护人”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Our protectors, we call them.

204
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:55,462
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我问过爸爸，到底会发生什么样的事情，要是有人发现......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I asked father what would happen to them if anyone found out...

205
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,464
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他们藏匿了我们
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}they were hiding us.

206
00:22:57,532 --> 00:23:01,798
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}爸爸说他们会遭受和我们同样的命运
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}father said they would suffer the same fate that we would.

207
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:06,673
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们是在一个老调料工厂上面
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We are over an old spice factory.

208
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:10,074
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你可以闻到整个楼弥漫着香料味道
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You can smell the spices all through the building.

209
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:07,954
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那一天我是读着《双城记》度过的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I read A Tale of Two Cities through in that first day.

210
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:13,057
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}和我以往曾经做过的相比......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"It is a far, far better thing I do...

211
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:15,687
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没有比这更好的事情了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"than I have ever done.

212
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:19,699
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}和我以往所知道的相比......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"It is a far, far better rest that I go to...

213
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:22,600
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没有比这更好的休息了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"than I have ever known.

214
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:25,639
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}结束
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The end. '"

215
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:29,268
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这是我读过的最悲惨的书
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It was the saddest book I ever read.

216
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:12,019
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是我们，米耶普和卡勒
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It is us, Miep and Kraler.

217
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:21,467
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}晚上好，卡勒先生。晚上好，米耶普
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Good evening, Mr. Kraler. Good evening, Miep.

218
00:27:23,537 --> 00:27:25,471
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-晚上好，安妮。   -你好，你好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Evening, Annele. - Hello. Hello.

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Hello.

220
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,309
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-哦，弗兰克先生。  -哦？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Oh, Mr. Frank. - Yes?

221

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- This is the box you asked for. - Thank you.

222
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:34,314
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-晚上好，卡勒先生。   -朋友们，你们在这上面真安静
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Good evening, Mr. Kraler. - My friends, you are so quiet up here.

223
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:36,373
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我都以为你们出去散步了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I thought you'd gone out for a walk.

224
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,214
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你能想象到我一句话都没说吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Can you imagine me? I didn't talk.

225
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:43,383
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我一天几乎都没动。我希望他们在学校能听到我说的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I hardly moved for one whole day. I wish they could hear that at school.

226
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:45,391
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}毛刺！毛刺！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mouschi! Mouschi!

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Peter!

228
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:50,093
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}毛刺！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mouschi!

229
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,530
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-嘘！    -嘘，安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Shh! - Shh. Annele.

230
00:27:55,603 --> 00:27:58,003
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-安妮！   彼得，我警告你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Annele! - Peter, I'm warning you.

231
00:27:58,072 --> 00:28:01,041
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}请安静。玛戈特，玛戈特！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please, quiet. Margot. Margot.!

232
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:05,006
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-这些是什么？   -不必小声说话
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- What are these? - You don't have to whisper.

233
00:28:14,188 --> 00:28:16,122
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，给你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, there you are.

234

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}一只漂亮的猫
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's such a nice cat.

235

237
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,544

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Annele. There's a box there.

238
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:43,606
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}打开好吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Will you open it, please?

239
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:47,820
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你知道我是怎样看这里的吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You know how I'm going to think of it here?

240
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:51,722
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}一个提供饭食的公寓，非常独特的公寓
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}As a boardinghouse. A very peculiar boardinghouse.

241
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:54,556
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}爸爸，我的影星！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}father, my film stars!

242
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:57,791
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我一直在想他们在哪里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I was wondering where they were.

243
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:03,793
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}威廉敏娜女王。太棒了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And Queen Wilhelmina. How wonderful.

244
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:05,805
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}还有呢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}There's something more.

245
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:07,864
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}快，再看看
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Go on. Look further.

246
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,914
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}日记本
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}A diary.

247
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:24,651
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我从来没有过日记本......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I've never had a diary...

248
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:27,660
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我一直想要一个
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and I've always wanted one.

249
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:30,162
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Ohh.

250
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:32,165
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}铅笔？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}A pencil?

251
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:34,326
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我下楼去拿根铅笔
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm going downstairs to get a pencil.

252
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:36,836
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-安妮，不可以。   -现在下面没有人啊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Anne, no. - But there's nobody down there now.

253
00:29:36,904 --> 00:29:39,031
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那不重要。任何时候不要走过那扇门
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It doesn't matter. Don't ever go beyond that door.

254
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:41,040
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-任何时候？   -永不
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Ever? - Never.

255
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:43,099
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}对不起，安妮。那不安全
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm sorry, Anne. It isn't safe.

256
00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:50,309
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我知道了。  -我知道很难
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I see. - It'll be hard. I know that.

257
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:52,318
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是要一直记住，安妮：
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But always remember this, Anneke:

258
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:56,322
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没有任何人可以把墙，锁头，门闩放在你心头
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}there are no walls, no locks, no bolts that anyone can put on your mind.

259
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,325
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}事实上，只有我们之间，安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}As a matter of fact, just between us, Annele...

260
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:01,327
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}在这里对你有好处
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}being here has certain advantages for you.

261
00:30:01,395 --> 00:30:05,331
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}还记得那次因为套鞋你和你妈妈吵架吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Remember that battle you had with your mother on the subject of overshoes?

262
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,959
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你说要是穿套鞋你宁可去死
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You said you'd rather die than wear overshoes.

263
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:09,969
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}记得吗？发生什么事了？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Remember?Well, what happened?

264
00:30:10,037 --> 00:30:12,972
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}最后，你还得穿上
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}In the end, you had to wear them.

265
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,975
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在，在这里你一直不必穿套鞋了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Now, for as long as we are here you won't have to wear overshoes.

266
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:17,977
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那不好吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Isn't that good?

267
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:19,979
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}还有钢琴？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And the piano?

268
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:22,982
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你再也不用练习钢琴了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You won't have to practice on the piano.

269
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,043
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}告诉你，这对于你会是很美好的生活
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I tell you, this is going to be a fine life for you.

270
00:30:50,644 --> 00:30:55,081
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}记日记对于像我这样的人来说，是一个很奇特的想法
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's an odd idea for someone like me to keep a diary.

271
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:58,414
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不仅仅是因为我过去从来没有记过......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Not only because I have never done so before...

272
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:03,423
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}而且还因为对于我来说，似乎我本人，还有与此相关的其他人......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}but because it seems to me that neither I, nor for that matter anyone else...

273
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:09,123
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没有谁会对一个13岁小女孩吐露的秘密感兴趣
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}will be interested in the unbosomings of a 13-year-old schoolgirl.

274
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:13,132
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不过，那重要吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Still, what does that matter?

275
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,327
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我要写下来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I want to write.

276
00:31:15,402 --> 00:31:17,427
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}更重要的是......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}but more than that...

277
00:31:17,505 --> 00:31:20,440
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我要呈现出所有......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I want to bring out all kinds of things...

278
00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:23,500
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}深深埋在我心底的东西
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}that lie buried deep in my heart.

279
00:31:24,812 --> 00:31:27,747
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}首先，我希望能描述出......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}First of all, I expect I should be describing...

280
00:31:27,815 --> 00:31:30,750
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}躲藏起来是什么样的感觉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}what it's like to go into hiding.

281
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:33,810
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是除了我自己的感受，我还一无所知
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}but I don't really know yet myself.

282
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:39,555
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我只知道从不到外面去有点不舒服
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I only know it's funny never to be able to go outdoors...

283
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:41,561
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}从不呼吸新鲜空气......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}never to breathe fresh air...

284
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:46,122
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}从不奔跑，不呼唤，不跳跃
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}never to run and shout and jump.

285
00:31:52,273 --> 00:31:56,869
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}1942年9月23日，星期三
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Wednesday, the 23rd of September, 1942.

286
00:31:56,944 --> 00:31:59,538
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}战争消息很好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The news of the war is good.

287
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:02,343
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}斯大林格勒还在坚持
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Stalingrad is still holding out.

288
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:06,477

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-安全了，最后一个工人离开了。  -耶！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- It's safe. The last workman has left. - Whee!

290
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:23,094
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-安妮！   -我第一个去厕所
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Anne! - I'm first for the W.C.

291
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:26,768

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Where are my shoes?

293

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}看到我的鞋了吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Have you seen my shoes?

294
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:37,342
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-什么鞋？   -你应该不好意思
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- What shoes?  - You're gonna be sorry.

295
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:39,443
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我？   -安妮宝贝

303
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:09,248
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那不好看
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's not dignified.

304
00:33:09,316 --> 00:33:12,251
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谁要什么好看不好看？我才不要什么好看
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Who wants to be dignified? I don't want to be dignified.

307
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,752
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不知道和那个男孩一起又怎样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't know what's the matter with that boy.

308
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:29,932
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}给他一点时间吧，他还不习惯女孩
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Give him a little time. He isn't used to girls.

309
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:32,268
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}时间？不是已经两个月了吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Time? Isn't two months time?

310
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,273
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我都想哭
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I could cry.

311
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:37,276
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我真奇怪米耶普在哪里。她一般很及时来的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I wonder where Miep is. She's usually so prompt.

312
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,397
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}玛戈特，来和我一起跳舞吧
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Margot, come and dance with me, please.

313
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:05,370
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我还有些事要做，安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I've got more work to do, Anne.

314
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:09,742
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你看，我们都快忘了怎样跳舞了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You know, we're going to forget how to dance.

315
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,472
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当我们出去的时候，什么都会忘了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When we get out, we won't remember a thing.

316
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:37,570
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}彼得在哪儿？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Where's Peter?

317
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:40,004
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他能在哪儿？和他的猫在一起呗
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Where would he be? With his cat.

318
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:42,564
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他还没做完功课，是吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He hasn't finished his lessons, has he?

319
00:34:43,577 --> 00:34:45,511
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Peter.

320
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:48,742
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-彼得！   -那是什么？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Peter! - What is it?

321
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:51,545
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你妈妈让你出去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Your mother says to come out!

322
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:54,553
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我在给毛刺吃晚饭，我在喂我的猫
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm giving Mouschi his dinner. I'm feeding my cat.

323
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:57,886
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你记得你爸爸一直说你在那只猫身上浪费了所有时间
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You know what your father says about you wasting all your time with that cat.

324
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:01,826
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我午饭后就没见到他。  -我告诉你了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I haven't looked at him since lunch. - I'm only telling you.

325
00:35:03,764 --> 00:35:05,698
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我要喂猫
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'll feed him.

326
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:09,167
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}出去，我要你别进来，我是说出去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You stay out of here. And I mean out.

327
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:13,332
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你就这么和你这个小女朋友说话吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Is that any way for you to talk to your little girlfriend?

328
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:16,876
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}妈妈......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mother...

329
00:35:16,944 --> 00:35:19,742
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我问过你，不要那样说话可以吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I asked you, would you please not say that?

330
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:21,906
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}看，他脸红了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Look, he's blushing.

331
00:35:21,982 --> 00:35:23,711
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他脸红了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He's blushing.

332
00:35:23,784 --> 00:35:27,515
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，我不会那样了，不过......能让我单独呆会吗
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please. I'm not, but... Leave me alone, will you.

333
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:30,250
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你都说什么了？你的举动就好像做错什么了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What did I say? You act like it's something to be ashamed of.

334
00:35:30,324 --> 00:35:33,259
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有个小女朋友没什么可害臊的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's nothing to be ashamed of to have a little girlfriend.

335
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:36,524
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-真是疯了。她才13岁。  -什么？你16岁了，正合适
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- That's crazy. She's only 13. - So what? You're 16. It's just perfect.

336
00:35:36,597 --> 00:35:39,430
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你爸爸比我大10岁
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Your father is 10 years older than I.

337
00:35:39,499 --> 00:35:43,697
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}弗兰克先生，我得警告你，这场战争还要持续很长时间，我们要成亲戚了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Frank, I warn you, this war lasts much longer, we're gonna be related.

338
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,431
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}恭喜你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mazel tov.

339
00:35:45,505 --> 00:35:48,736
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}午饭后我就没见到我的猫
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I haven't seen my cat since lunch.

340
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:50,800
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我在喂毛刺晚饭
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm giving Mouschi his dinner.

341
00:35:50,877 --> 00:35:53,072
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我的小毛刺
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}My little Mouschi.

342
00:35:53,146 --> 00:35:56,081
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没有我珍贵的毛刺，我可没法活
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I couldn't live without my precious Mouschi.

343
00:35:56,149 --> 00:35:58,913
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你奇妙的猫，你！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You wonderful cat, you!

344
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:02,187
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是的，呱呱小姐
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}All right, Miss Quack-Quack.

345
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:04,849
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-说什么？  -呱呱小姐！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- What's that? - Miss Quack-Quack!

346
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:08,190
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没听说你在班里那么能说吗？他们叫你呱呱小姐
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Heard about how you talk so much in class, they call you Miss Quack-Quack.

347
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:10,161
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你太让人受不了了，你是我见过的最让人受不了的男孩！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're the most intolerable, insufferable boy I ever met!

348
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,561
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}呱-呱-呱！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Quack-quack-quack!

349
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,059
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我会让你好看的！  -呱！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I'll give it to you good! - Quack!

350
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:17,069
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嗷！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Ooh!

351
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:19,935
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮宝贝，你很热
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Anne dear, you're hot.

352
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:22,271
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你有点热。感觉好点了吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're warm. Are you feeling all right?

353
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:25,277
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-妈妈，请。  -你没发烧吧？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Mother, please. - You don't have a fever, do you?

354
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:28,280
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-没有。  -你知道在这儿可不能叫医生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- No. - You know we can't call a doctor here.

355
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:31,283
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}只有一件事可做：小心预防
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}There's only one thing to do: watch carefully.

356
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:34,946
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}得病之前就预防好。让我看看你舌头
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Prevent an illness before it comes. Let me see your tongue.

357
00:36:35,022 --> 00:36:37,456
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}妈妈，这太荒唐了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mother, this is perfectly absurd.

358
00:36:37,524 --> 00:36:39,890
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮宝贝，别像个小孩似的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Anne dear, don't be such a baby.

359
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,396
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}让我看看你舌头
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Let me see your tongue.

360
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:45,397
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-奥托。  -安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Otto. - Anne.

361
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:48,696
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-听你妈妈的话。  -快点，张开嘴
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- You hear your mother, don't you? - Come on, open up.

362
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:52,532
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}呱
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Quack.

363
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:56,542
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Anne.

364
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,601
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-奥托。  -安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Otto. - Anne.

365
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:12,415
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你没事
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're all right.

366
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:24,895
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想我们的安妮也没有什么大不了的病，就像骑上自行车......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think there's nothing the matter with our Anne that a ride on her bike...

367
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:28,532
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或者和她的朋友珊妮・德・沃瑞斯的旅游治不了的病
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}or a visit with her friend Sanne de Vries wouldn't cure.

368
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:30,542
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是那样吗,安妮?
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Isn't that so, Annele?

369
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:38,884
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我一直希望彼得是个女孩......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I keep wishing that Peter was a girl...

370
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:40,886
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}而不是个男孩
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}instead of a boy.

371
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:43,946
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那样我就有可以说话的了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Then I'd have someone to talk to.

372
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:55,700
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}世界上那么多男孩......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}With all the boys in the world...

373
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:58,761
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}为什么我偏偏要锁定他呢？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}why did I have to get locked up with him?

374
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,854
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有人吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Is it someone?

375
00:38:15,922 --> 00:38:17,913
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是米耶普
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Is it Miep?

376
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,364
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们没听到，真怪
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's strange we don't hear.

377
00:38:25,432 --> 00:38:27,366
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或许她受伤了――高射炮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Maybe she got hurt-- the flak.

378
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:30,369
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-她会来的。  -我希望她来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- She'll come. - I wish she'd get here.

379
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:32,428
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没有烟我都快疯了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm going crazy without cigarettes.

380
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:39,310
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮，今天的历史卷子你得了个“优”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Anne, you got an "excellent" in your history paper today...

381
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:41,313
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}拉丁语得了个“良”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and a "very good" in Latin.

382
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:43,315
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}噢，那代数呢？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Yes, but how about algebra?

383
00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:45,317
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有件事要坦白了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, I have a confession to make.

384
00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:48,320
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}到现在我一直在努力领先你代数
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Up until now I managed to stay ahead of you in algebra.

385
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:50,322
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}今天你赶上我了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Today you caught up with me.

386
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,824
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们留给玛戈特改正吧
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We'll leave it to Margot to correct.

387
00:38:52,893 --> 00:38:55,487
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你不感觉代数太恶心了吗，爸爸？  -恶心
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Isn't algebra vile, father? - Vile.

388
00:38:55,562 --> 00:38:57,496
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我做的怎么样啊？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}How did I do?

389
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:59,828
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-当然优秀了。  安妮，安妮，请
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Excellent, of course. - Anne, Anne, please.

390
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,165
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你今天的法语作文太好了，太好了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Your French composition today was wonderful,just wonderful.

391
00:39:03,236 --> 00:39:05,670
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}范・戴恩太太，我可以试穿一下吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mrs. Van Daan, may I try it on?

392
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:07,673
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No, Anne.

393
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:09,834
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}可以的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's all right. Really.

394
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,845
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是当心点
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But please, be careful with it.

395
00:39:12,913 --> 00:39:16,849
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我爸爸去世那年送给我的这件大衣
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}My father gave me this coat the year before he died.

396
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:20,080
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他总是送给我钱可以买到的最好东西
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He always bought me the best money could buy.

397
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:56,021
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}范・戴恩太太，你过去是不是有很多男朋友......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mrs. Van Daan, did you have a lot of boyfriends...

398
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:58,023
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就是在你结婚以前？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}before you were married?

399
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:00,025
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮，那是私人问题
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Anne, that's a personal question.

400
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:03,028
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}问私人问题不礼貌
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's not courteous to ask personal questions.

401
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:05,030
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不介意
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't mind.

402
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:08,295
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮，我们的房子总是招来一群男孩
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Anneke, our house was always swarming with boys.

403
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:11,997
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-当我还是个年轻女孩的时候......  -哦，不，已经不再是了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- When I was a young girl... - Oh, no. Not again.

404
00:40:12,072 --> 00:40:14,506
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}住嘴！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Shut up!

405
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,977
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}一年夏天，我们在希尔沃森有一所大房子
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}One summer we had a big house in Hilversum.

406
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:22,879
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那些男孩......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The boys...

407
00:40:26,553 --> 00:40:30,819
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那些男孩跑来嗡嗡，就像蜜蜂围着蜜罐
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The boys would come buzzing around like bees around a jam pot.

408
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:32,825
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当我17岁的时候......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When I was 17...

409
00:40:32,893 --> 00:40:35,828
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}呵，我们那时穿的裙子非常短的......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, we were wearing our skirts very short in those days...

410
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:38,160
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我有一双漂亮的腿
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and I had such good-looking legs.

411
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:42,725
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在也是。我可能不如过去漂亮了，但是我的腿仍然漂亮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I still have. I may not be as pretty as I used to be, but I still have my legs.

412
00:40:42,802 --> 00:40:44,878
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你看怎么样，弗兰克先生？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}How about it, Mr. Frank?

413
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:48,970
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是的，是的。我们看到了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}All right, all right. We see them.

414
00:40:49,048 --> 00:40:52,017
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没问你。我再问弗兰克先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm not asking you. I'm asking Mr. Frank.

415
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:53,780
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}妈妈，看在老天的份上
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mother, for heaven's sakes.

416
00:40:53,853 --> 00:40:55,787
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}噢，让你也尴尬了，是吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, I embarrass you too, do I?

417
00:40:55,855 --> 00:40:59,882
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我只是希望你也找个那么漂亮的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, I only hope the girl you marry has as good.

418
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:04,487
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮，我爸爸很为我担心，因为那些男孩晃来晃去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Anneke, my father used to worry about me with all the boys hanging around.

419
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:07,499
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他常对我说：“要是哪个男孩对你调情......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And he used to say to me, "If any of those boys get fresh...

420
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,501
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}“你就对他说......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"you just say to him...

421
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:13,528
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}“记住，某某先生，记住，我是一个淑女。”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}'Remember, Mr. So-and-so, remember, I am a lady.'

422
00:41:13,606 --> 00:41:16,040
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你看你，在她面前说那种话
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Look at you, talking that way in front of her.

423
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:19,306
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-她会把所有的话都记在该死的日记里。  -写了又怎样？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- She puts it all in that damned diary. - So what if she does?

424
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:21,506
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我只是说实话而已
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm only telling the truth.

425
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,517
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}还没做完吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Haven't you finished yet?

426
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:27,780
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没有
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No.

427
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:29,549
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，思想家
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh. The thinker.

428
00:41:29,622 --> 00:41:31,556
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}别管他
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Leave him alone.

429
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:34,616
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}好吧，好吧。我是个蠢材，没用的东西
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}All right, all right. I'm a dunce, a hopeless case.

430
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:36,628
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你不是没用
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're not hopeless.

431
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:40,496
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你只是没有人帮你，就像爸爸帮助安妮和我一样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's just that you haven't got anyone to help you like father helps Anne and me.

432
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:44,469
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那么，要是我......要是我们能够帮......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, if I... Well, if we could help...

433
00:41:44,537 --> 00:41:46,971
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你看怎么样，彼得？你愿意和我们一起学习吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What about it, Peter? Would you like to study with us?

434
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,804
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们创建一所男女合校好吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Shall we make our school coeducational?

435
00:41:49,876 --> 00:41:52,367
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谢谢，当然愿意
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Thanks. Yes.

436
00:41:52,445 --> 00:41:56,040
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}弗兰克先生，你是个天使，完美的天使
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Frank, you are an angel, an absolute angel.

437
00:41:56,115 --> 00:41:59,448
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}为什么遇到那位之前，我没遇到你啊？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Why didn't I meet you before I met that one there?

438
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:03,388
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我......想最好......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I... think it might be better...

439
00:42:03,456 --> 00:42:05,890
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}彼得，你是不是要进你房间学习
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}if you went into your room, Peter, to work.

440
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:07,893
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}失陪了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Excuse me.

441
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:12,330
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你要听弗兰克先生的。弗兰克先生受过高等教育
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You listen to Mr. Frank. Mr. Frank is a highly educated man.

442
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:17,863
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}已经过8点了，他们都哪儿去了？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's after 8:00. Where are they?

443
00:42:17,937 --> 00:42:21,566
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-至少其中一个人本应该来啊。  -他们会来的，别担心
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- At least one of them should have come. - They'll come. Don't worry.

444
00:42:21,641 --> 00:42:24,576
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}别这么说，我知道肯定是哪里不对劲了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Don't tell me. I know something's wrong.

445
00:42:24,644 --> 00:42:28,045
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你不四肢伸开躺在那占地方不好吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Isn't it bad enough around here without you sprawling all over the place?

446
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:31,049
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要是你不这样一直抽烟，脾气就不会变得这么坏
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}If you didn't smoke all the time, you wouldn't be so bad-tempered.

447
00:42:31,117 --> 00:42:34,553
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你看到我抽烟了？  -你已经把所有的烟抽光了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Do you see me smoking? - You already smoked all the cigarettes?

448
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:37,556
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就一包，米耶普只给我买了一包
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}One package. Miep only brought me one package.

449
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:40,422
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你那是坏习惯，现在正是戒掉的好时候
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's a filthy habit, and this is a good time to break yourself of it.

450
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:43,428
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-哦，闭嘴。  -你把所有的钱全抽光了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Oh, stop it. - You're smoking up all our money!

451
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:45,862
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}能闭嘴吗！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Will you shut up!

452
00:42:49,435 --> 00:42:51,426
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你在盯着什么？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And what are you staring at?

453
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:55,538
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我过去从来没有见过大人这样吵架
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I never heard grown-ups quarrel like that before.

454
00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:57,542
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我还以为只有小孩才打架
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I thought only children quarreled.

455
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,579
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这不是吵架，是讨论
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}This isn't a quarrel. It's a discussion.

456
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:03,912
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我都没见过孩子这么粗鲁。  -我，粗鲁？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- And I never heard children so rude. - I, rude?

457
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:05,917

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The trouble with you is, you've been spoiled. You need a spanking.

459
00:43:09,956 --> 00:43:12,891

00:43:15,962 --> 00:43:18,897
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}为什么你不能像你的妹妹玛戈特那样优雅，安静一些？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Why aren't you nice and quiet like your sister Margot?

462
00:43:18,965 --> 00:43:21,399
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}为什么你非得一直卖弄自己？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Why do you have to show off all the time?

463
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:24,903
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}让我给你一点忠告，年轻人――男人可不喜欢那样的女孩
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Let me give you a little advice, young lady-- men don't like that in a girl.

464
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:28,407
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你喜欢吗？一个男人喜欢听话的女孩
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Do you know that? A man likes a girl who will listen to him once in a while.

465
00:43:28,474 --> 00:43:32,410
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-喜欢知道做饭，打扫的女孩。  -我宁可抹脖子
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- A girl who loves to cook and clean-- - I'd cut my throat first!

466
00:43:32,478 --> 00:43:34,742
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我要张扬个性
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'd open my veins.

467

472
00:43:49,729 --> 00:43:52,163
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你这个笨蛋！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You clumsy little fool!

473
00:43:52,231 --> 00:43:55,166

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- This is the coat my father gave me! - I'm so sorry.

474
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:58,169
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你把大衣毁了。怎么这么不小心？你毁了大衣！

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I could kill you! I could just kill you!

476
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,676

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}佩特罗内拉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Petronella.

478
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:08,680
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}只是件大衣而已
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's only a coat.

479
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:11,683

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It was an accident. Anyone can have an accident.

481
00:44:15,054 --> 00:44:17,989
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不是那意思，我是说你顶嘴
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't mean that. I mean the answering back.

482
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:19,991
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你不可以顶嘴
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You must not answer back.

483
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:21,993
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他们都是客人

484
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:25,326
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}玛戈特从来没有那样和客人争吵，不是吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You don't hear Margot getting into any arguments with them, do you?

485
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:27,832
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}向玛戈特学学
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Try to be like Margot.

486
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,836
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}让他们象踩玛戈特那样踩我吗？不，谢谢了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And have them walk all over me the way they do her? No, thanks.

487
00:44:31,904 --> 00:44:34,839
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不知道你到底怎么了，安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't know what happens to you, Anne.

488
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:38,035
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要是当初我也象你对我说话那样，对我妈妈说话......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}If I had ever talked to my mother as you talk to me--

489
00:44:38,111 --> 00:44:39,976
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}一切都在变，妈妈
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Things have changed, Mother.

490
00:44:40,046 --> 00:44:42,310
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}大家都不那样了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}People aren't like that anymore.

491
00:44:42,382 --> 00:44:46,318
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}“是，妈妈。”，“不，妈妈”，“听你的，妈妈。”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"Yes, Mother." "No, Mother." "Anything you say, Mother."

492
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:48,854
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我必须为自己努力争取
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I've got to fight things out for myself.

493
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:50,855
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-但是......    -争取自己应得的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- But...   - Make something of myself.

494
00:44:50,923 --> 00:44:53,858
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没必要去吵吵嚷嚷去争啊。玛戈特就不吵嚷
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It isn't necessary to fight to do it. Margot doesn't fight.

495
00:44:53,926 --> 00:44:55,860
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}玛戈特！我耳朵都灌满了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Margot! That's all I hear.

496
00:44:55,928 --> 00:44:57,862
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}“为什么你不象玛戈特？”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"Why aren't you like Margot?"

497
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:01,366
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她做什么都是对的，我做什么都是错的！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Everything she does is right, and everything I do is wrong!

498
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:05,268
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你们都看不上我，你最看不上我！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're all against me, and you worst of all!

499
00:45:09,075 --> 00:45:12,010
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不知道这样过日子，还能挺多久
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't know how we can go on living this way.

500
00:45:12,078 --> 00:45:15,343
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我一句都不能说安妮了，她和我吵来吵去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I can't say a word to Anne, she flies at me.

501
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:19,351
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你了解安妮。不出半小时她就会连说带笑地出来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You know Anne. In a half hour she'll be out here laughing and joking.

502
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:21,683
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}并且，呃...
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And, uh...

503
00:45:21,754 --> 00:45:24,689
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我告诉你爸爸这样根本不行――两家在一起
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I told your father it wouldn't work-- two families.

504
00:45:24,757 --> 00:45:27,692
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，不，他会问的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But no, no, he had to ask them.

505
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:31,753
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嘘
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Shh.

506
00:45:49,315 --> 00:45:52,250
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}每次听到声音，我的心跳都要停了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Every time I hear that sound, my heart stops.

507
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:54,309
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-是米耶普。  -爸爸！

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Here's your list.

510

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Miep's here.

513
00:46:10,036 --> 00:46:13,472
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我都不好意思说我对那件大衣有多抱歉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I can't tell you how sorry I am about the coat.

514
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:15,473
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没事了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Don't worry.

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When Mr. Kraler comes, the sun begins to shine.

518
00:46:22,548 --> 00:46:25,483

519
00:46:25,551 --> 00:46:28,987
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他得躲到乡下去，摆脱那些工人的电话
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He had to go into hiding in the country to escape a labor call-up.

520
00:46:29,055 --> 00:46:31,990
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是他让我给你们带来一台收音机

533
00:48:04,283 --> 00:48:08,276
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}好吧，彼得。让我们听听他们会说纳粹什么
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}All right, Peter, now let's see what they have to say about the Nazis.

534
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:14,292
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}柏林
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Berlin.

535
00:48:48,694 --> 00:48:51,162
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}还要听吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Must we listen?

536
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:55,630
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}行了，彼得，够了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}All right, Peter. That's enough.

537
00:49:36,762 --> 00:49:39,595
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}环保警察，他们发现我们了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The Green Police. They've found us.

538
00:50:28,848 --> 00:50:30,839
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嗯
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Hmm.

539
00:50:44,997 --> 00:50:46,988
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嗯
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Hmm.

540
00:50:50,035 --> 00:50:52,026
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}啊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Ah.

541
00:51:26,438 --> 00:51:28,429
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嘘
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Huh.

542
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:49,183
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嘘
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Huh.

543
00:51:52,031 --> 00:51:54,022
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嘘
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Hmm.

544
00:54:15,574 --> 00:54:17,565
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这边走，达索尔先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}This way, Mr. Dussel.

545
00:55:12,865 --> 00:55:16,460
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-是卡勒，请开门。   -还有米耶普
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- It is Kraler. Please open. - And Miep.

546
00:55:16,535 --> 00:55:18,560
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}噢，保佑他们，他们来了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, bless them. They are here.

547
00:55:18,637 --> 00:55:22,903
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-卡勒？  -还有米耶普。请开门
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-Kraler? -And Miep,yes. Open, please.

548
00:55:27,146 --> 00:55:31,776
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-哦，昨晚来了一个访客。  -昨晚一个访客？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Well, we had a visitor last night. - A visitor last night?

549
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,511
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-是的，是的。  -一个窃贼
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Yes, yes. - A thief.

550
00:55:33,585 --> 00:55:35,416
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-那是个窃贼？  -你听到了？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- It was a thief? - Did you hear him?

551
00:55:35,487 --> 00:55:37,318
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-是的，我们听到了。  -他就在你们下面
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Yes, we heard him. - He was right under you.

552
00:55:37,389 --> 00:55:40,222
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-正下面的办公室里。  -我们不知道
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- In the office right under here. - We did not know.

553
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:42,692
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们还以为是环保警察
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We thought it was the Green Police.

554
00:55:42,761 --> 00:55:47,562
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你能肯定吗，米耶普？  -当然，你们那时安静吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Are you sure, Miep? - You were, of course, quiet?

555
00:55:47,633 --> 00:55:51,626
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们没有动，甚至整晚都几乎没有呼吸
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We didn't move. We hardly breathed all night.

556
00:55:51,703 --> 00:55:55,696
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-很好，很近啊。  -太近了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- That is good. It was close. - Too close.

557
00:55:55,774 --> 00:55:58,140
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他把桌子和所有的档案翻了个底朝天
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He went through everything. The desk and the files.

558
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:01,805
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}桌子和所有的档案，并且也发现保险柜了，但是没能打开
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The desk and the files. And he found the safe, but he could not get it open.

559
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,542
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他在找我们从黑市弄的口粮供应卡
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He was looking for our ration card supply from the Underground.

560
00:56:04,616 --> 00:56:06,948
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-有人知道。  -都在那个保险柜里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Somebody knows. - They're in that safe.

561
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:11,956
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他们还会回来。扔掉保险柜吧，从这儿弄出去。
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}They'll come back. Get rid of that safe. Get it out of here.

562
00:56:12,024 --> 00:56:14,083
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是的。门上贴个条子：
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Yes. Put a sign on the door:

563
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:16,684
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}“窃贼，别回来了，保险柜已经没有了。”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"Burglars, do not come back. The safe is gone."

564
00:56:16,762 --> 00:56:17,990
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}笑话而已
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Jokes, yet.

565
00:56:18,063 --> 00:56:20,327
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-弗兰克先生，我得和你谈谈。  -好的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Mr. Frank, I must talk to you. - Yes, of course.

566
00:56:20,399 --> 00:56:22,594
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或许是那台收音机。我们应该丢掉它
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Maybe it's the radio. We should get rid of the radio.

567
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:26,126
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}扔到炉子里烧了吧。要是环保警察发现收音机......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Put it in the stove, burn it. If the Green Police found that radio...

568
00:56:26,205 --> 00:56:28,196
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或许还会发现她的日记。我们也要烧掉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And they'd find her diary. We'll burn that too.

569
00:56:28,273 --> 00:56:30,138
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我的日记不可以
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Not my diary.

570
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:33,144
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我和日记共存亡。   -日记在哪？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- My diary goes, I go with it. - Where is it?

571
00:56:33,212 --> 00:56:36,340
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要是他们发现我们，他们同样会发现日记和收音机
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}If they find us, they might just as well find the diary, the radio.

572
00:56:36,415 --> 00:56:37,916
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有什么不同吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What'll be the difference?

573
00:56:38,417 --> 00:56:41,648
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我来的时候，总是尽力带好消息。  -是的，我知道
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- When I come, I try to bring good news. - Yes, I know.

574
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,211
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}发生了一件事，一个男人来找我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Something has happened. A man came to me.

575
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:47,224
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他告诉我他有一个犹太朋友，一个牙医
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He told me that he has a Jewish friend-- a dentist.

576
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:51,228
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他求我帮他找个藏身地方，所以我来找你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He begged me, could I find him a hiding place? So I have come to you.

577
00:56:51,296 --> 00:56:54,629
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我知道很难说出口，象你们这样的状况......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know it is a terrible thing to ask, living the way you are...

578
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,692
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}把他带来了吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}but could you take him in?

579
00:56:57,769 --> 00:57:00,966
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-嗯，当然我们会收留。  -他叫让・达索尔
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Well, of course we will. - His name is Jan Dussel.

580
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:05,476
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-达索尔，等等，我认识他。  -留下他很不错
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Dussel. Wait. I think I know him. - It's fine to have him.

581
00:57:05,544 --> 00:57:08,308
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是，奥托，我们把他放在哪儿啊？哪里？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But, Otto, where are we going to put him? Where?

582
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,729
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}吃的这么少，还收留另外一个人......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}There's so little food as it is, and to take in another person...

583
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:12,727
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们一人省一口就可以，范・戴恩先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We can stretch the food a little, Mr. Van Daan.

584
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:15,357
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-他可以用我的床。  -不用，谢谢你，彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- He can have my bed. - No, thank you, Peter.

585
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:17,924
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}玛戈特搬到我们这儿，他可以用她的床
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Margot will move in here with us, and he can have her bed.

586
00:57:18,003 --> 00:57:21,336
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我把东西拿出来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'll get my things out.

587
00:58:00,512 --> 00:58:02,446
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}达索尔先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Dussel.

588
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:14,352
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}别碰到头
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Don't bump your head.

589
00:58:17,629 --> 00:58:21,292
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}进来，达索尔先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Come in, Mr. Dussel.

590
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:25,029
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-这位是弗兰克先生。   -奥托・弗兰克先生？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- This is Mr. Frank. - Mr. Otto Frank?

591
00:58:25,103 --> 00:58:27,799
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是。把东西给我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Yes. Let me have your things, please.

592
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:31,467
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谢谢，弗兰克先生。我把你交给他们了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Thank you, Mr. Frank. I leave you in good hands.

593
00:58:31,543 --> 00:58:33,272
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-达索尔先生？  -嗯？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Mr. Dussel? - Hmm?

594
00:58:33,345 --> 00:58:36,007
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我得把大衣拿回去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I must return your coat.

595
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:40,214
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我该怎么谢你啊？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What can I say to thank you?

596
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:44,187
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}卡勒先生，米耶普。他们是我们的生命线。没有他们，我们都活不了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Kraler, Miep, they're our lifeline. Without them, we couldn't live.

597
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:47,088
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，你说的好像我们很崇高，并不是那样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please,you make us seem very heroic. It isn't that at all.

598
00:58:47,158 --> 00:58:51,060
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们只是不喜欢纳粹，不喜欢他们的所作所为......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We simply don't like the Nazis. We don't like their methods...

599
00:58:51,129 --> 00:58:54,792
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我知道。“没人告诉我们荷兰人该怎样对待该死的犹太人。”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know. "Nobody's gonna tell us Dutchmen what to do with our damn Jews."

600
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:58,962
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们明早上来看看，他们会对你很好的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We will be up tomorrow to see that they are treating you right.

601
00:58:59,037 --> 00:59:01,301
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-再见。  -再见，卡勒先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Good-bye. - Good-bye, Mr. Kraler.

602
00:59:01,373 --> 00:59:02,931
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}再见，米耶普
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Good-bye, Miep.

603
00:59:03,008 --> 00:59:06,171
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}欢迎，达索尔先生。   -谢谢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Welcome, Mr. Dussel. - Thank you.

604
00:59:06,244 --> 00:59:09,873
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这是我妻子，埃蒂茨。范・戴恩先生太太
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}This is my wife, Edith. Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.

605
00:59:09,948 --> 00:59:14,442
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他们的儿子，彼得。我的女儿玛戈特和安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Their son, Peter, my daughters Margot and Anne.

606
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:16,919
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-安妮。   -你好

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}和卡勒先生告诉我们的太不一样了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's so different from what Mr. Kraler tells us.

01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:18,638
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，不。我对带毛动物过敏
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No, no. I have an allergy to fur-bearing animals.

668
01:05:18,716 --> 01:05:22,652
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-会让我哮喘。  -哦，天啊

671
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:55,184
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们很少见到，彼得一直在自己房间养它
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We hardly ever see it. He keeps it in his room all the time.

672
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:57,584
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我相信会好的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm sure it will be all right.

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}because they know I get along well with them.

680
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:25,538
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}所以不必担心
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}So don't you worry about that.

01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:37,454
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}晚安，达索尔先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Good night, Mr. Dussel.

684
01:06:43,634 --> 01:06:45,727
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当心
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Careful.

685
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,905
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}珊妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Sanne.

686
01:08:38,983 --> 01:08:41,474
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}珊妮？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Sanne?

687
01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:43,713
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}珊妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Sanne.

688
01:08:55,099 --> 01:08:58,000
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}停！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Halt!

689
01:09:12,116 --> 01:09:14,880
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}救救我！救救我！不，不！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Save me! Save me! No, no!

690
01:09:14,952 --> 01:09:18,718
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-不！不，不要碰我！  -住手。住手
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Oh! No, don't take me! - Stop it. Stop it.

691
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:30,830
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-救救我。   -安静，亲爱的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-Save me. -Hush, darling.

692
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:33,369
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安静。没事了。没事了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Hush. It's all right. It's all right.

693
01:09:33,437 --> 01:09:36,964
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}达索尔先生，请打开灯。只是个梦
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please, Mr. Dussel, turn on the light. It was just a dream.

694
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,942
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你在这里，很安全。知道吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're here, safe. You see?

695
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:44,003
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这孩子一定有什么事，那么大声叫
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Something must be done with that child, yelling like that.

696
01:09:44,081 --> 01:09:48,142
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谁知道什么人会在街上。她危及到我们生命了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Who knows who might be in the street. She's endangering all our lives.

697
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:52,712
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}达索尔先生，毕竟安妮不是训练有素的前线士兵
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Dussel, after all, Anne is not exactly a trained, frontline soldier.

698
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:55,725
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}达索尔先生，请回去睡觉吧
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please, Mr. Dussel, go back to bed.

699
01:09:55,793 --> 01:09:59,194
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}过一两分钟她就会好，对吗，安妮？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She'll be herself in a minute or two. Won't you, Anne?

700
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:04,494
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}回去睡觉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Go back to bed.

701
01:10:06,236 --> 01:10:11,674
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}打扰下，我要去厕所，唯一安静的地方
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Excuse me. I'm going to the W.C., the one room where there's peace.

702
01:10:11,742 --> 01:10:14,074
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在回去睡觉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Go back to bed now.

703
01:10:14,144 --> 01:10:18,808
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要点水吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Would you like some water?

704
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:22,477
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是个恶梦吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Was it a very bad dream?

705
01:10:22,553 --> 01:10:24,680
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}也许你能告诉我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Perhaps if you told me.

706
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:28,953
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我宁可不说。  -好好睡觉吧
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I'd rather not talk about it. - Try to sleep then.

707
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:34,958
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我就坐在你旁边。  -不用的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I'll sit right here beside you. - You don't have to.

708
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:40,693
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我真的非常想陪你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But I'd like to stay with you very much. Really.

709
01:10:40,771 --> 01:10:43,205
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}真的不用了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'd rather you didn't.

710
01:10:48,579 --> 01:10:52,743
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}晚安...
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Good night...

711
01:10:57,421 --> 01:11:01,790
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没事吧？什么也不要吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You'll be all right? There's nothing that you want?

712
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:06,023
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}能让爸爸过来吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Will you please ask father to come?

713
01:11:11,702 --> 01:11:14,694
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当然，安妮宝贝
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Yes, of course, Anne dear.

714
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:25,404
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她叫你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She asks for you.

715
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,351
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-埃蒂茨。   -去吧，奥托
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Edith. - Go to her, Otto.

716
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:32,081
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她在吓得发抖
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She's still trembling with fear.

717
01:11:50,771 --> 01:11:55,265
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她不需要我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She wants nothing of me.

718
01:11:55,342 --> 01:11:57,674
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我弯腰去亲她，她躲开了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She pulled away when I leaned down to kiss her.

719
01:11:57,744 --> 01:12:00,269
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}环保警察破门而入，抓住我......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The Green Police broke down a door and grabbed me...

720
01:12:00,347 --> 01:12:02,781
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要把我象珊妮一样拖走
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and tried to drag me out the way they did Sanne.

721
01:12:02,849 --> 01:12:05,682
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}只是一个年龄阶段而已
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's just a phase.

722
01:12:05,752 --> 01:12:08,687
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}所有的女孩在这个阶段都要爸爸
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}All girls turn to their fathers at this age.

723
01:12:08,755 --> 01:12:11,121
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}把所有的爱给爸爸
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}They give all their love to their fathers.

724
01:12:11,191 --> 01:12:15,321
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你不该这样，不该排斥我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You weren't like this. You didn't shut me out.

725
01:12:17,597 --> 01:12:19,531
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那么......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}So...

726
01:12:21,201 --> 01:12:23,533
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那么，要不要我给你读一会书？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}now, do you want me to read to you for a while?

727
01:12:23,603 --> 01:12:26,936
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不。陪我坐一会就行
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No.Just sit with me for a minute.

728
01:12:27,007 --> 01:12:30,306
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我很讨厌吗？你认为是不是外面的人都听到了？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Was I awful? Do you think anyone outside could've heard me?

729
01:12:30,377 --> 01:12:35,280
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不。现在安静地躺着。就这样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No. Now lie down quietly. So, like this.

730
01:12:35,348 --> 01:12:37,942
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在使劲睡着吧
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Now try to sleep.

731
01:12:38,018 --> 01:12:43,684
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我是个胆小鬼。我对自己失望极了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm a terrible coward. I'm so disappointed in myself.

732
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,525
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想我真的已经长大了......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think I'm really grown up...

733
01:12:48,595 --> 01:12:52,395
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}然后发生事情，我却象小孩一样跑到你身边
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and then something happens and I run to you like a baby.

734
01:12:52,465 --> 01:12:55,298
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我爱你，爸爸。除了你，我谁也不爱
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I love you, father. I don't love anyone but you.

735
01:12:55,368 --> 01:12:57,734
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮。安妮。
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Annele. Annele.

736
01:12:57,804 --> 01:13:01,467
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}真的，你是我唯一爱的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's true. You're the only one I love.

737
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:05,534
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我已经想很长时间了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I've been thinking about it for a long time.

738
01:13:05,612 --> 01:13:10,345
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}很好，能告诉我你爱我 ，那很好......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's fine-- It's fine to have you tell me that you love me...

739
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:14,649
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是，要是你能告诉我你也爱你妈妈，我会更高兴
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}but I'd be much happier if you said that you loved your mother as well.

740
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:17,884
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她太需要你的帮助了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She needs your help so much.

741
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:22,060
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-那时你的爱。  -我们没有共同语言
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Your love. - We have nothing in common.

742
01:13:22,128 --> 01:13:24,562
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她不理解我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She doesn't understand me.

743
01:13:24,631 --> 01:13:28,362
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}每当我想说说对生命的看法，她就问我是不是便秘
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Whenever I try to explain my views on life, she asks me if I'm constipated.

744
01:13:30,203 --> 01:13:34,367
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}刚才你太伤她心了。她在哭。在那里哭呢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You hurt her very much just now. She's crying. She's in there crying.

745
01:13:43,283 --> 01:13:48,482
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}噢，爸爸，我是不是很可怕？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, father, I was horrible, wasn't I?

746
01:13:48,555 --> 01:13:51,547
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我怎么了？告诉我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What's the matter with me? Tell me.

747
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:54,594
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不要说这是要经历的阶段。帮帮我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Don't say it's just a phase. Help me.

748
01:13:57,030 --> 01:14:01,865
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮，父母对孩子能做的太少啊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}There's so little we parents can do to help our children, Anne.

749
01:14:01,935 --> 01:14:06,429
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们只是尽力作个好榜样，指出一条路
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We can only try to set a good example. Point the way.

750
01:14:06,506 --> 01:14:09,066
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}其余的都得靠你自己
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The rest you must do yourself.

751
01:14:09,142 --> 01:14:13,704
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我在努力，真的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm trying. Really, I am.

752
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:18,945
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}每天晚上我都在反省我过去做过的所有错事
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Every night I think back over all the things I did that day that were wrong.

753
01:14:19,019 --> 01:14:21,988
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就像把湿拖把放到范・戴恩太太床上
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Like putting the wet mop in Mrs. Van Daan's bed.

754
01:14:26,259 --> 01:14:28,921
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在又放到妈妈那里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And now this with Mother.

755
01:14:28,995 --> 01:14:31,987
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我对自己说：“那是错误的。”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I say to myself, "That was wrong."

756
01:14:32,065 --> 01:14:35,660
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}并且下决心再也不那么做了。再也不
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And I make up my mind I'm never going to do that again. Never.

757
01:14:37,337 --> 01:14:40,238
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我也许会做更坏的事情，但是绝不会做那件事
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I may do something worse, but I'll never do that again.

758

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's fine. Thank you, Annele. Thank you.

908
01:27:31,091 --> 01:27:34,754
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-太漂亮了。  -好可爱，不是吗？谢谢，安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Isn't it beautiful. - Lovely, huh? Thank you, Anne.

909
01:27:38,431 --> 01:27:43,266
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-给毛刺的。  -他一定会喜欢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- For Mouschi. -He'll like it.

910
01:27:44,604 --> 01:27:50,304
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这是给你的。你自己的，来自呱呱小姐
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And this is for you. Yourself. From Miss Quack-Quack.

911
01:27:52,178 --> 01:27:54,043
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}快，打开
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Go on. Open it.

912
01:27:54,114 --> 01:27:57,777
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不想打开吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Aren't you going to open it?

913
01:28:00,153 --> 01:28:04,783
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-给我们看看是什么。  -是个安全剃须刀
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-Show us what it is. - It's a safety razor.

914
01:28:04,858 --> 01:28:09,192
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不是新的。米耶普给我弄的二手货。你的确需要有个剃须刀
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's not new. Miep got it for me second-hand. But you do need a razor.

915
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:15,795
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-用来做什么？  -看他的上唇。看到没有？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- What for? - Look at his upper lip. See?

916
01:28:15,869 --> 01:28:17,962
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他要刮掉吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He wants to get rid of that?

917
01:28:18,037 --> 01:28:21,302
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}上面涂些牛奶，让你的猫舔掉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Put some milk on it and let the cat lick it off.

918
01:28:23,109 --> 01:28:25,168
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你认为很可笑，是吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You think you're funny, don't you?

919
01:28:25,245 --> 01:28:28,737
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}看，他都等不及了。他现在就要去试试
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Look, he can't wait. He's going in to try it now.

920
01:28:28,815 --> 01:28:31,807
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我要把礼物给毛刺
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm going to give Mouschi his present.

921
01:28:31,885 --> 01:28:34,877
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-毛刺，毛刺，毛刺。  -够了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Mouschi, Mouschi, Mouschi. - Enough.

922
01:28:34,954 --> 01:28:39,288
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}最后，却不是最少，给我的室友，达索尔先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And last, but never least, my roommate, Mr. Dussel.

923
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:41,691
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有东西给我？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Something for me?

924
01:28:48,435 --> 01:28:51,927
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-胶囊。  -是耳塞，塞到你的耳朵里......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Capsules. - They're earplugs to put in your ears...

925
01:28:52,005 --> 01:28:54,735
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那样晚上我折腾的时候，你就听不见了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}so you won't hear me when I thrash around at night.

926
01:28:54,808 --> 01:28:58,471
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我自己做的，试一下，看能不能听到我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I made them myself. Try them. See if you can hear me.

927
01:29:03,082 --> 01:29:05,642
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}等我塞进去――这样吗？你是这意思吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Wait, I'll put-- Like that? Is that what you mean?

928
01:29:05,718 --> 01:29:07,777
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-准备好了吗？  -什么？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Are you ready? - What?

929
01:29:07,854 --> 01:29:13,087
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-准备好了吗？  -好使了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Are you ready? - They work.

930
01:29:19,032 --> 01:29:22,297
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}出不来了。出不来了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}They went in. They went in.

931
01:29:22,368 --> 01:29:25,132
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他拿不出来了。你怎么了？拿出来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He can't get 'em out. What's the matter with you? Get 'em out.

932
01:29:25,205 --> 01:29:27,366
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}把耳塞拿出来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Take 'em out.

933
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,431
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}拿出来了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I got 'em.

934
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:35,443
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谢谢你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Thank you.

935
01:29:35,515 --> 01:29:38,177
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在让我们唱一首歌吧，爸爸
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And now let's sing the song, father.

936
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:41,084
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}等等，你就要听到光明节颂歌了，达索尔先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Wait till you hear the Hanukkah song, Mr. Dussel.

937
01:29:44,157 --> 01:29:46,489
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮，我们今晚不该唱歌
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Annele, we shouldn't sing the song tonight.

938
01:29:46,559 --> 01:29:49,892
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你看，达索尔先生，那是一首喜悦，欢乐之歌
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You see, Mr. Dussel, it's a song of jubilation and of rejoicing.

939
01:29:49,963 --> 01:29:52,454
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}人啊，太真容易对那种事情兴致勃勃了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}One is apt to become just a little too enthusiastic about it.

940
01:29:52,532 --> 01:29:55,126
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}求你，爸爸，让我们唱颂歌吧。我保证不喊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please, let's sing the song, father. I promise not to shout.

941
01:29:55,201 --> 01:29:58,466
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-好吧，不过要小声，安妮。  -哦！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Very well, but quietly, Anne. - Oh!

942
01:29:58,538 --> 01:30:03,032
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦！我告诉过你不要带猫过来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh! I told you not to come in here with that cat.

943
01:30:03,109 --> 01:30:06,875
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}出去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Get out of here.

944
01:30:06,946 --> 01:30:10,109
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你怎么了？难道你没有感觉吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What's the matter with you? Haven't you any sense?

945
01:30:10,183 --> 01:30:12,777
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-把猫弄出去。  -猫？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Get that cat out of here. - Cat?

946
01:30:12,852 --> 01:30:16,686
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}听着，把它弄出去！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You heard me. Get it out of here!

947
01:30:18,057 --> 01:30:20,821
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我没有猫
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I have no cat.

948
01:30:20,894 --> 01:30:23,328
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}达索尔先生！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Dussel!

949
01:30:23,396 --> 01:30:26,160
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不必是猫本身
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It doesn't have to be the cat.

950
01:30:26,232 --> 01:30:29,895
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}仅仅猫身上的毛就足够了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Just the hairs on his clothing from the cat is enough.

951
01:30:29,969 --> 01:30:33,234
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-当他进来的时候......  -不要再烦人了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- When he comes in the room...  - You won't be bothered anymore.

952
01:30:33,306 --> 01:30:36,400
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我们必须摆脱它。  -最后，你听我说
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- We're getting rid of it. - At last, you listen to me.

953
01:30:36,476 --> 01:30:40,139
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我并不是替你说话。都是你自己认为的，都是
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm not doing it for you. That's all in your mind. All of it.

954
01:30:40,213 --> 01:30:44,513
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我那么做是因为，看到那只猫吃掉所有我们的食物，我很恼火
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm doing it because I'm sick of seeing that cat eat all our food.

955
01:30:44,584 --> 01:30:46,518
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不对。我只是喂它残渣剩饭
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's not true. I only give him scraps.

956
01:30:46,586 --> 01:30:51,080
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}得了。它天天在胖
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Don't tell me. He gets fatter every day.

957
01:30:51,157 --> 01:30:54,285
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}该死的猫看起来比我们过的都好。今晚让它滚出去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Damn cat looks better than any of us. Out he goes tonight.

958
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,523
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-不！  -范・戴恩先生，你不能那么做
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- No! - Mr. Van Daan, you can't do that.

959
01:30:57,597 --> 01:30:59,997
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那是彼得的猫。彼得爱他的猫
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's Peter's cat. Peter loves that cat.

960
01:31:00,066 --> 01:31:01,431
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Anne.

961
01:31:02,835 --> 01:31:06,737
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-要是他走，我也走。  -走，走
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- If he goes, I go. - Go. Go.

962
01:31:06,806 --> 01:31:09,468
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他不会走，猫也不用走。你怎么了？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He's not going, and the cat's not going. What's the matter with you?

963
01:31:09,542 --> 01:31:13,603
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}光明节。光明节，来，安妮，唱歌
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's Hanukkah. It's Hanukkah. Please, Anne, sing.

964
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:19,677
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Annele.

965
01:31:19,752 --> 01:31:22,516
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想我们应该先把蜡烛吹灭
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think we should first blow out the candles.

966
01:31:22,589 --> 01:31:24,523
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那样明晚还会有东西了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Then we'll have something for tomorrow night.

967
01:31:24,591 --> 01:31:28,584
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}爸爸，你应该让蜡烛自己点完
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}father, you're supposed to let it burn itself out.

968
01:31:28,661 --> 01:31:31,596
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我肯定上帝会理解我们的窘迫的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm sure that God understands shortages.

969
01:31:31,664 --> 01:31:33,598
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}赞美我主，供养我们......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Praise be Thou, O Lord our God, who has sustained us...

970
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:35,998
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}允许我们欢庆这快乐的节日
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and permitted us to celebrate this joyous festival.

971
01:31:36,069 --> 01:31:38,003
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-阿门。  -阿门
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Amen. -Amen.

972
01:35:17,556 --> 01:35:21,219
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我想他们走了。 -他们发现我们了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I think they've gone. - They found us.

973
01:35:21,293 --> 01:35:23,488
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要是发现了，他们现在就已经上来了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}If they had, they would be up here by now.

974
01:35:23,562 --> 01:35:28,056
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我知道那一定是环保警察。他们去找帮手了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know it was the Green Police. They've gone to get help.

975
01:35:28,134 --> 01:35:30,364
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或许是盖世太保，在找文件
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It may be the Gestapo, looking for papers.

976
01:35:30,436 --> 01:35:34,532
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或者是另一个窃贼在找钱
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Or another thief looking for money.

977
01:35:40,813 --> 01:35:43,475
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我下去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm going down.

978
01:35:43,549 --> 01:35:47,007
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-他们可能还在那儿。  -安妮，今天是星期六
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- They may still be there. - Annele, this is Saturday.

979
01:35:47,086 --> 01:35:49,452
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们没办法知道下面发生什么了......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We have no way of knowing what has happened down there...

980
01:35:49,522 --> 01:35:51,456
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}等米耶普和卡勒先生来了才能知道
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}until Miep and Mr. Kraler come.

01:49:42,792 --> 01:49:46,626
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}并且开始想着在身体中发生的奇迹
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and begin to think of the miracle that is taking place in their bodies.

1056
01:49:48,932 --> 01:49:53,426
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想我身上发生的一切都太美妙了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think that what is happening to me is so wonderful.

1057
01:49:53,503 --> 01:49:58,668
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不仅仅是外表能看到的，还有内在发生的一切
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Not only what can be seen, but what is taking place inside.

1058
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:05,404
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}每次变化发生的时候，我就拥有了一个甜蜜的秘密......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Each time it has happened, I feel I have a sweet secret...

1059
01:50:05,482 --> 01:50:10,476
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我渴望再次感觉到秘密的时刻
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and I long for the time when I shall feel that secret within me again.

1060
01:51:59,262 --> 01:52:02,754
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮，彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Annele. Peter.

1061
01:52:02,832 --> 01:52:06,666
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}一个惊喜，卡勒先生和米耶普来了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}A wonderful surprise. Mr. Kraler and Miep are here.

1062
01:52:06,736 --> 01:52:08,966
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，谢谢。你们可以不必来的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, thank you. You shouldn't have come.

1063
01:52:09,038 --> 01:52:13,270
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你们至少该给你们自己留一天
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You should have at least one day to yourselves.

1064
01:52:13,343 --> 01:52:16,141
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}别那么说。见到他们太好了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Don't say that. It's so wonderful to see them.

1065
01:52:16,212 --> 01:52:18,874
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-那是什么？那是什么？  -卡勒先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- What is it? What is it? - Mr. Kraler.

1066
01:52:18,948 --> 01:52:22,782
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-新年快乐，达索尔先生。  -新年快乐
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Happy New Year, Mr. Dussel. - Happy New Year.

1067
01:52:22,852 --> 01:52:26,344
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你好吗，玛戈特，感觉好点了吧？  -我很好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- How are you, Margot? Feeling better? - I'm all right.

1068
01:52:26,422 --> 01:52:28,390
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们用各种药把她填满了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We filled her full of every kind of pill...

1069
01:52:28,458 --> 01:52:31,859
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}所以她不咳嗽弄出噪音了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}so she won't cough and make a noise.

1070
01:52:31,928 --> 01:52:36,092
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}看米耶普给我们带来什么了。 一只蛋糕
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Look what Miep has brought us. A cake.

1071
01:52:36,165 --> 01:52:38,133
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嗯
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mmm.

1072
01:52:38,201 --> 01:52:41,864
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-蛋糕。  -是啊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Cake. - Well.

1073
01:52:41,938 --> 01:52:45,897
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我拿些盘子。  -谢谢你，米耶普
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I'll get some plates. - Thank you, Miepia.

1074
01:52:45,975 --> 01:52:49,138
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你肯定把好几个星期定量的糖用了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You must have used all of your sugar rations for weeks.

1075
01:52:49,212 --> 01:52:53,046
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}多漂亮啊，不是吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's beautiful, isn't it?

1076
01:52:53,116 --> 01:52:55,550
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}从我上次见到蛋糕，都好几个世纪了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's ages since I've even seen a cake.

1077
01:52:55,618 --> 01:52:57,609
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}从去年你买了一个以后就没见过，记得吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Not since you brought the one last year, remember?

1078
01:52:57,687 --> 01:53:00,679
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}上面写着“1943年和平”......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It had "Peace in 1943" written on...

1079
01:53:04,594 --> 01:53:06,721
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}“1944年和平”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"Peace in 1944."

1080
01:53:08,565 --> 01:53:11,000
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你知道和平一定会到来。  -给你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Peace has to come sometime, you know. - Here you are.

1081
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,333
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}--你知道和平一定会到来。  -给你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Peace has to come sometime, you know. - Here you are.

1082
01:53:14,404 --> 01:53:16,838
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那么，我们一共几个人？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Now, how many of us are there?

1083
01:53:16,906 --> 01:53:18,965
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-不用算我们，谢谢。  -哦，得算
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- None for me, thank you. - Oh, you must.

1084
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:20,976
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}来吧，米耶普
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please, Miep.

1085
01:53:21,044 --> 01:53:25,378
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}好。还有一，二，三...我们七个人
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Good. That leaves one, two, three... seven of us.

1086
01:53:25,448 --> 01:53:30,283
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}八个。和往常一样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Eight. The same as it always is.

1087
01:53:30,353 --> 01:53:33,220
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我没算玛戈特。我担保玛戈特一点也不会吃
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I left Margot out. I take it for granted Margot won't eat any.

1088
01:53:33,289 --> 01:53:35,849
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-为什么她不吃啊？  -我想吃点对她没有坏处
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Why wouldn't she? - I think it won't harm her.

1089
01:53:35,925 --> 01:53:39,918
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}好吧，好吧。我只是不想让她再咳嗽
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}All right, all right. I just didn't want her to start coughing again.

1090
01:53:41,331 --> 01:53:45,700
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}弗兰克太太，请切蛋糕吧
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And, please, Mrs. Frank should cut the cake.

1091
01:53:45,768 --> 01:53:49,864
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你什么意思？  -啊，弗兰克太太分东西更好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- What do you mean? - Well, Mrs. Frank divides things better.

1092
01:53:49,939 --> 01:53:54,603
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你到底要说什么?  -得了，我们在浪费时间
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-Just what are you trying to say? - Forget it. We're wasting time.

1093
01:53:54,677 --> 01:53:57,976
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，不。我难道是一直分配不公吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No, no. Don't I always give everybody exactly the same?

1094
01:53:59,949 --> 01:54:03,441
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我不公吗？  -得了，卡里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Don't I? - Forget it, Kerli.

1095
01:54:03,519 --> 01:54:05,749
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，我要解释。我不公吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No, I want an answer. Don't I?

1096
01:54:05,822 --> 01:54:10,885
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，不，不。你分配的很公平
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Yes. Yes, yes. Everybody gets exactly the same.

1097
01:54:12,261 --> 01:54:15,059
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}除了给范・戴恩先生稍微多一点
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Except Mr. Van Daan gets a little bit more.

1098
01:54:15,131 --> 01:54:18,658
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-说谎。她总是平均切。  -范・戴恩先生，请不要这样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- That's a lie. She always cuts the same. - Mr. Van Daan, please.

1099
01:54:18,735 --> 01:54:21,727
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你看，米耶普，一小块糖蛋糕把我们弄成什么样了？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You see, Miep, what a little sugar cake does to us?

1100
01:54:21,804 --> 01:54:24,739
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们都迷住了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It goes right to our heads.

1101
01:54:24,807 --> 01:54:28,971
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-给你，弗兰克太太。  -谢谢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Here you are, Mrs. Frank. - Thank you.

1102
01:54:37,086 --> 01:54:40,578
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你肯定一点也不要？  -肯定
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- You sure you won't have any? - Very sure.

1103
01:54:42,091 --> 01:54:44,082
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-米耶普？ -真的不要，谢谢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Miep? - No, thank you. Really.

1104
01:54:45,762 --> 01:54:49,926
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-切蛋糕。  -好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-Cut the cake. - All right.

1105
01:55:10,126 --> 01:55:12,117
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谢谢，彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Thank you, Peter.

1106
01:55:16,399 --> 01:55:18,390
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这是你的，彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's yours, Peter.

1107
01:55:21,304 --> 01:55:23,898
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或许毛刺回来了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Maybe Mouschi went back to our house.

1108
01:55:23,973 --> 01:55:27,374
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你在那熬过吗？你认为你能吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Do you ever get over there? Do you think that you could?

1109
01:55:27,443 --> 01:55:30,571
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我恐怕在毛刺离开的一星期，彼得......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm afraid with him gone a week, Peter...

1110
01:55:30,646 --> 01:55:34,776
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你就死心吧。有人已经把毛只猫当做腹中餐了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Make up your mind. Already someone has had a big nice meal from that cat.

1111
01:55:41,691 --> 01:55:44,592
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-嗯，真好吃，米耶普。  -好吃
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Mmm, it's delicious, Miep. - Delicious.

1112
01:55:52,868 --> 01:55:55,962
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那么，我必须走了，晚上有个聚会
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, I must run. There's a party tonight.

1113
01:55:56,038 --> 01:55:58,700
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}太棒了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}How heavenly.

1114
01:55:58,774 --> 01:56:00,867
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}记住每个人穿的......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Remember now what everyone's wearing...

1115
01:56:00,943 --> 01:56:04,071
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}每一样你吃的，明天好告诉我们
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and what you have to eat and everything so you can tell us tomorrow.

1116
01:56:04,146 --> 01:56:07,081
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我会向你详细汇报。再见，各位
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'll give you a full report. Good-bye, everyone.

1117
01:56:07,149 --> 01:56:09,083
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-再见。  -再见，米耶普
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Good-bye. - Good-bye, Miep.

1118
01:56:09,151 --> 01:56:12,882
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嘿，等一下。有件事要你帮一下
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Hey,just a minute. There's something I'd like you to do for me.

1119
01:56:12,955 --> 01:56:15,480
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}普提，你要去哪？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Putti, where are you going?

1120
01:56:15,558 --> 01:56:17,549
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}普提，你要做什么？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Putti, what are you gonna do?

1121
01:56:19,061 --> 01:56:21,495
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}普提
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Putti.

1122
01:56:21,564 --> 01:56:23,862
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，不，不。你怎么敢拿那件大衣
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No, no, no. Don't you dare take that coat.

1123
01:56:23,933 --> 01:56:25,867
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有什么不对劲吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What is wrong?

1124
01:56:25,935 --> 01:56:28,995
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}爸爸说他要卖了她的真皮大衣
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}father says he's gonna sell her fur coat.

1125
01:56:29,071 --> 01:56:31,096
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}因为那件大衣，她都发疯了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She's crazy about that old fur coat.

1126
01:56:31,173 --> 01:56:34,233
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-那是我的。我爸爸留给我的大衣。  -给我大衣
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-It's mine. My father gave me that coat. -I want the coat.

1127
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:36,335
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你，你没有权利。  -把手松开
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- No, you have no right. - Get your hands off it.

1128
01:56:36,412 --> 01:56:40,644
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}还有人会......傻到......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Is it possible that anyone can... be silly enough...

1129
01:56:40,716 --> 01:56:43,810
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}在这种时候操心一件真皮大衣？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}to worry about a fur coat at a time like this?

1130
01:56:43,886 --> 01:56:45,945
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不关你的事
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's none of your darn business.

1131
01:56:46,022 --> 01:56:48,513
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-要是你再说一次......  -彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- And if you say one more thing... - Peter.

1132
01:56:55,631 --> 01:56:57,690
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}只是......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Just a...

1133
01:56:57,767 --> 01:57:01,897
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}讨论了一下卖这件大衣的事情
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}little discussion on the advisability of selling this coat.

1134
01:57:01,971 --> 01:57:04,064
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我常常提醒范・戴恩太太......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}As I have often reminded Mrs. Van Daan...

1135
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:08,543
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}外面还有那么多需要衣服的人，留着大衣是很自私的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}it's selfish to keep it when people outside are in such need of clothing.

1136
01:57:10,413 --> 01:57:12,472
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}所以，你看能不能帮我卖了大衣
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}So if you please to sell it for us.

1137
01:57:12,548 --> 01:57:14,607
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}会卖个好价钱
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It should fetch a good price.

1138
01:57:14,683 --> 01:57:17,481
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}顺便说一下，能帮我带些烟吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And by the way, would you get me cigarettes?

1139
01:57:17,553 --> 01:57:20,545
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不在乎什么烟。能弄到的尽管弄
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't care what kind they are. Get all you can.

1140
01:57:20,623 --> 01:57:23,990
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}很难弄到，范・戴恩先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It is very difficult to get them, Mr. Van Daan.

1141
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:26,858
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不过我会试试。再见
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But I will try. Good-bye.

1142
01:57:26,929 --> 01:57:28,863
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-再见。  -再见，米耶普
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Good-bye. - Bye, Miep.

1143
01:57:28,931 --> 01:57:30,922
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}弗兰克先生，可以和你谈谈吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Frank, could I talk to you?

1144
01:57:35,938 --> 01:57:38,998
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}发生什么事情了吗，卡勒先生？发生什么事情了？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Something's happened, hasn't it, Mr. Kraler? What's happened?

1145
01:57:39,075 --> 01:57:42,806
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是一件与这里的人相关的事情，我们最好都听听
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}If it is something that concerns us here, we'd better all hear it.

1146
01:57:42,878 --> 01:57:44,812
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-孩子们......  -他们想象的......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- The children... - What they'd imagine...

1147
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:47,041
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}会比任何现实都变得更糟
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}would be worse than any reality.

1148
01:57:47,116 --> 01:57:51,678
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有一个男人在储藏室。他叫卡尔。你认识他
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It is a man in the storeroom. His name is Karl. You knew him.

1149
01:57:51,754 --> 01:57:55,087
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有一天他来到办公室。他关上门然后问我......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}One day he came to the office. He closed the door and asked me...

1150
01:57:55,157 --> 01:57:57,625
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}“你有你的朋友弗兰克先生的消息吗？”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"What do you hear from your friend Mr. Frank?"

1151
01:57:57,693 --> 01:58:00,628
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我告诉他有传闻说你在瑞士
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I told him there was a rumor that you were in Switzerland.

1152
01:58:00,696 --> 01:58:04,792
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他说他也听到传闻了，但是他认为我了解得更多
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He said he had heard that rumor too, but he thought I might know something more.

1153
01:58:04,867 --> 01:58:07,927
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我没当回事。我......我尽力把那件事忘了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I did not pay much attention. I... I tried to forget it.

1154
01:58:08,003 --> 01:58:10,665
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}然后昨天......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And then yesterday...

1155
01:58:10,739 --> 01:58:14,300
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们走出储藏室
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}we were coming out of the storeroom out there.

1156
01:58:14,376 --> 01:58:17,903
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}下楼去办公室
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I had started down to the office.

1157
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:19,948
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我回头一看
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I looked back.

1158
01:58:20,015 --> 01:58:22,643
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他正站着，盯着书架
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He was standing, staring at the bookcase.

1159
01:58:22,718 --> 01:58:27,621
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他说，“我想我记得有个门通到这儿。
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He said, "I thought I remember a door up here.

1160
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:32,286
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这儿没有门通向阁楼吗？”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Was not there a door here leading to the loft?"

1161
01:58:32,361 --> 01:58:35,819
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}然后他向我要更多的钱。一周加二十吉尔特
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Then he asked me for more money. Twenty gilders more a week.

1162
01:58:35,898 --> 01:58:39,390
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-敲诈。  -二十吉尔特？适度的敲诈
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Blackmail. - Twenty gilders? Very modest blackmail.

1163
01:58:39,468 --> 01:58:41,629
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那才刚刚开始
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's just the beginning.

1164
01:58:42,838 --> 01:58:44,999
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你知道我怎么想吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You know what I think?

1165
01:58:45,074 --> 01:58:48,532
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他就是那天晚上来楼下的窃贼
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He's the thief who was down there that night.

1166
01:58:48,611 --> 01:58:50,738
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那就是为什么他知道我们在这里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's how he knows we're here.

1167
01:58:50,813 --> 01:58:53,213
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}会怎样啊？你怎样答复他的？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}How was it left? What did you tell him?

1168
01:58:53,282 --> 01:58:55,614
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我告诉他我考虑一下
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I told him I had to think about it.

1169
01:58:55,684 --> 01:58:57,675
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我该怎么办？给他钱？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What shall I do? Pay him the money?

1170
01:58:57,753 --> 01:58:59,721
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}找个机会解雇他，还是怎么的？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Take a chance on firing him or what?

1171
01:58:59,788 --> 01:59:03,019
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我不知道。  -看在老天份上，别解雇他
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I do not know. - For heaven's sakes, don't fire him.

1172
01:59:03,092 --> 01:59:06,687
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}把他要的给他。让他留在这，你好盯着他
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Pay him what he asks. Keep him here where you can keep your eye on him.

1173
01:59:06,762 --> 01:59:10,095
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是不是他要的太多了？我是说，现今的工钱应该是多少？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Is it so much that he is asking? I mean, what are they paying nowadays?

1174
01:59:10,166 --> 01:59:12,259
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-他在兵工厂能赚到那么多。  -啊哈
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- He could get it in a war plant. - Mm-hmm.

1175
01:59:12,334 --> 01:59:17,101
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但这不是兵工厂。注意，我不知道他是否知道情况
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But this is not a war plant. Mind you, I do not know if he knows or not.

1176
01:59:21,544 --> 01:59:25,105
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}给他一半。然后我们就知道是不是敲诈了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Offer him half, then we'll soon know if it is blackmail or not.

1177
01:59:25,181 --> 01:59:29,049
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要真是敲诈，我们就得付钱，对吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And if it is, we've gotta pay, haven't we?

1178
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:31,279
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}无论他要什么，我们都得给
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Whatever he asks, we've gotta pay.

1179
01:59:31,353 --> 01:59:35,255
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}事到临头再决定吧
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Let us decide that when the time comes.

1180
01:59:35,324 --> 01:59:37,417
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或许只是我多虑了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}This may be all my imagination.

1181
01:59:37,493 --> 01:59:41,623
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在大家都到怀疑每个人，每件事的地步了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You get to a point these days where you suspect everyone and everything.

1182
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:01,780
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}假期的电话铃声是怎么回事？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What does that mean, the telephone ringing on a holiday?

1183
02:00:05,387 --> 02:00:09,585
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那是我妻子。我告诉她我在办公室里看些文件......{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's my wife. I told her I had to go over some papers in my office...

1184
02:00:09,658 --> 02:00:11,785
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她是从教堂出来给我打的电话
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}to call me here when she got out of church.

1185
02:00:11,860 --> 02:00:14,226
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-再见。  -再见
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Good-bye. - Good-bye.

1186
02:00:14,296 --> 02:00:16,321
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}新年快乐
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Happy New Year.

1187
02:00:16,398 --> 02:00:18,866
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}再见。  -再见，卡勒先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-Good-bye. - Good-bye, Mr. Kraler.

1188
02:00:20,936 --> 02:00:23,530
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我要先付他一半
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I will offer him half then.

1189
02:00:23,606 --> 02:00:25,597
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谢谢，卡勒先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Thank you, Mr. Kraler.

1190
02:00:30,145 --> 02:00:31,814
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}多谢你儿子做的一切
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Thank your son for this.

1191
02:00:31,814 --> 02:00:33,748
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}多谢你儿子做的一切
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Thank your son for this.

1192
02:00:33,816 --> 02:00:36,808
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他和他该死的猫。那天晚上。在那儿
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Him and his damn cat. That night. There.

1193
02:00:39,088 --> 02:00:43,548
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我告诉你，那只是，只是，只是，只是个时间问题
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I tell you, it's...it's...it's... it's just a question of time now.

1194
02:00:49,565 --> 02:00:53,296
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有时候我真希望结局快点来，不管是什么样的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Sometimes I wish the end would come, whatever it is.

1195
02:00:53,369 --> 02:00:57,237
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-玛戈特！  -那样至少我们会知道我们在哪里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Margot! - Then at least we'd know where we were.

1196
02:00:58,540 --> 02:01:01,634
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你应该对自己感到害臊。说出那种话
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You should be ashamed of yourself, talking that way.

1197
02:01:02,645 --> 02:01:04,579
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}想想我们多幸运
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Think how lucky we are.

1198
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:10,712
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}想想每天千千万万战争中死去的人
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Think of the thousands dying in the war every day.

1199
02:01:10,786 --> 02:01:13,778
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-想想集中营里的人。  -那有什么好处？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Think of the people in camps. - What's the good of that?

1200
02:01:15,457 --> 02:01:19,621
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当你已经很悲惨了，再想那些悲惨有什么好处？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What's the good of thinking of misery when you're already miserable?

1201
02:01:19,695 --> 02:01:22,129
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}太蠢了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's stupid.

1202
02:01:22,197 --> 02:01:24,688
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们还年轻。玛戈特，彼得还有我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We're young, Margot and Peter and I.

1203
02:01:24,767 --> 02:01:26,962
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你们大人都有过你们的机会
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You grown-ups have had your chance.

1204
02:01:29,104 --> 02:01:34,303
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}看看我们。要是我们开始去想世上所有的可怕，我们就毁了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Look at us. If we begin thinking of all the horror in the world, we're lost.

1205
02:01:34,376 --> 02:01:37,209
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们都努力把握住某种理想......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We're trying to hold on to some kind of ideals...

1206
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:40,169
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当一切――理想，希望――一切都在毁掉的时候
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}when everything-- ideals, hope-- everything is being destroyed.

1207
02:01:40,169 --> 02:01:41,830
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当一切――理想，希望――一切都在毁掉的时候
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}when everything-- ideals, hope-- everything is being destroyed.

1208
02:01:43,505 --> 02:01:46,633
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}世界如此混乱并不是我们的错
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It isn't our fault the world is in such a mess.

1209
02:01:46,708 --> 02:01:48,699
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}一切开始的时候我们还没有到来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We weren't around when all this started.

1210
02:01:48,777 --> 02:01:52,440
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-现在听我说。  -不要试图从我们身上剥夺。
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Now you listen to me. - So don't try to take it out on us.

1211
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:05,223
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她的口气好像是我们发动的战争
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She talks as if we started the war.

1212
02:02:06,295 --> 02:02:08,456
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们发动战争了吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Did we start the war?

1213
02:02:17,606 --> 02:02:19,597
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你忘拿这个了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You left this.

1214
02:02:20,609 --> 02:02:22,600
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谢谢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Thanks.

1215
02:02:27,149 --> 02:02:29,379
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我感觉你刚才说的很好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I thought you were fine just now.

1216
02:02:29,451 --> 02:02:32,818
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你知道如何和他们讲话。我都不能想象什么时候会发疯
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You know just how to talk to 'em. I can never think when I'm mad.

1217
02:02:34,022 --> 02:02:36,650
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我说的太多了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I say too much.

1218
02:02:36,725 --> 02:02:39,057
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我伤了他们的心
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I hurt people's feelings.

1219
02:02:41,497 --> 02:02:43,556
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想你做的很好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think you're just fine.

1220
02:02:54,476 --> 02:02:56,467
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谢谢，彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Thank you, Peter.

1221
02:03:02,518 --> 02:03:06,318
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那个达索尔，他说的毛刺那些话，什么有人把它吃了之类......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That Dussel, what he said about Mouschi, about somebody eating him...

1222
02:03:06,388 --> 02:03:08,652
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想做的就是揍他
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}all I could think is I wanted to hit him.

1223
02:03:08,724 --> 02:03:11,318
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我过去在学校常常那样，但是.....
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's what I used to do in school, but...

1224
02:03:11,393 --> 02:03:13,918
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这里争吵一开始，我只是在我屋里躲着
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}here a fight starts, I just duck in my room.

1225
02:03:13,996 --> 02:03:17,159
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你很幸运还有个房间去呢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're lucky having a room to go to.

1226
02:03:17,232 --> 02:03:20,258
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他那大驾总是在我房间里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}His Lordship is always in mine.

1227
02:03:20,335 --> 02:03:24,431
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}每当他进来的时候，我都得站起来让路
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When they start in on me, I have to stand and take it.

1228
02:03:24,506 --> 02:03:27,441
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你刚把一部分还给他们
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You gave some of it back to them just now.

1229
02:03:27,509 --> 02:03:30,478
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我疯了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I get so mad.

1230
02:03:30,546 --> 02:03:33,037
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他们对什么事
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}They've formed their opinions.

1231
02:03:33,115 --> 02:03:35,049
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}都已经有成见了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}About everything.

1232
02:03:36,051 --> 02:03:38,451
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是我们还在试图找出
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But we're still trying to find out.

1233
02:03:40,522 --> 02:03:45,118
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们在这儿遇到的问题，是和我们一样大的人从来没遇到过的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We have problems here that no other people our age have ever had.

1234
02:03:46,261 --> 02:03:48,695
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你刚以为你已经解决了问题......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And just as you think you've solved them...

1235
02:03:48,764 --> 02:03:51,289
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就又有事情冒出来，砰......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}something comes along and, bang...

1236
02:03:53,468 --> 02:03:56,665
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你还得从头再来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}you have to start all over again.

1237
02:03:59,708 --> 02:04:01,699
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我认为你爸爸很好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think your father's fine.

1238
02:04:01,777 --> 02:04:04,507
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，是的，彼得，他是很好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, he is, Peter. He is.

1239
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:08,516
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他是唯一一个让我感觉我还是一个有意义的人
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He's the only one who's ever given me the feeling that I have any sense.

1240
02:04:14,289 --> 02:04:16,348
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我和你，不可笑吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Isn't it funny, you and I?

1241
02:04:17,826 --> 02:04:20,522
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}在这里虽然我们一直在一起......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Here we've been together all this time...

1242
02:04:20,596 --> 02:04:23,087
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这还是我们第一次真正谈话
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and this is the first time we've ever really talked.

1243
02:04:26,635 --> 02:04:30,002
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}和人谈话还是很有益处的，不是吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It helps a lot to have someone to talk to, doesn't it?

1244
02:04:31,006 --> 02:04:33,270
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}可以帮助你释放心情
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It helps you let off steam.

1245
02:04:51,026 --> 02:04:53,153
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不管什么时候......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Any time that...

1246
02:04:53,228 --> 02:04:55,924
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你想要发泄的时候......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}you want to let off steam...

1247
02:04:55,998 --> 02:04:58,159
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你可以来我屋里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}you can come into my room.

1248
02:04:59,468 --> 02:05:02,801
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我可以攒很多很多郁闷
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I can get up an awful lot of steam.

1249
02:05:02,871 --> 02:05:04,964
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那对我无所谓
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's all right with me.

1250
02:05:06,141 --> 02:05:08,075
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}真的吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Do you mean that?

1251
02:05:11,313 --> 02:05:14,373
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不是说了吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I said it, didn't I?

1252
02:05:30,866 --> 02:05:32,993
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-晚安。  -晚安
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Good night. - Good night.

1253
02:05:33,068 --> 02:05:35,696
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-晚安。  -晚安
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Good night. - Good night.

1254
02:05:45,947 --> 02:05:50,782
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我可以进来吗？  -不，达索尔先生。我还没穿衣服
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- May I come in? - No, Mr. Dussel. I'm not dressed yet.

1255
02:05:50,852 --> 02:05:52,786
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh.

1256
02:06:17,345 --> 02:06:19,313
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-玛戈特。  -啊？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Margot. - Hmm?

1257
02:06:19,381 --> 02:06:22,714
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}告诉我，我是不是很丑啊？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Tell me, am I terribly ugly?

1258
02:06:22,784 --> 02:06:24,843
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-哦，别问了。  -不，告诉我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Oh, stop fishing. - No. Tell me.

1259
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:28,981
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你当然不丑。你有一双漂亮的眼睛......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Of course you're not. You've got nice eyes...

1260
02:06:29,057 --> 02:06:32,891
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}并且很活泼，并且......并且......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and a lot of animation and...and...

1261
02:06:53,648 --> 02:06:55,843
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我可以进来吗？  -进来，妈妈
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- May I come in? - Come in, Mother.

1262
02:06:56,952 --> 02:06:59,420
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}达索尔先生要进来，都等的不耐烦了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Dussel is impatient to get in here.

1263
02:06:59,488 --> 02:07:02,423
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他整天自己占着房间
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He takes the room for himself the entire day.

1264
02:07:02,491 --> 02:07:05,324
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你不打算今晚再去见彼得吗，嗯？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're not going in again tonight to see Peter, hmm?

1265
02:07:06,328 --> 02:07:08,762
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我是那么想的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That is my intention.

1266
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,992
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你不怕打扰他？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Aren't you afraid you're disturbing him?

1267
02:07:15,070 --> 02:07:17,368
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}妈妈，我有分寸
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mother, I have some intuition.

1268
02:07:17,439 --> 02:07:19,600
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那么我多说点行吗，安娜？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Then may I ask this much, Annie?

1269
02:07:19,674 --> 02:07:22,268
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你进去后请不要关上门
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please don't shut the door when you go in.

1270
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:27,471
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你真象范・戴恩太太
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You sound like Mrs. Van Daan.

1271
02:07:27,549 --> 02:07:30,882
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，不。我这是为你好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, no. I don't mean to suggest anything wrong.

1272
02:07:30,952 --> 02:07:34,115
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我只是希望你不要受到责备
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I only wish you wouldn't expose yourself to criticism.

1273
02:07:34,189 --> 02:07:38,125
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}对不起，妈妈。我要去彼得那里了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm sorry, Mother. I'm going to Peter's room.

1274
02:07:38,193 --> 02:07:41,492
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我可不想让彼得罗妮拉・范・戴恩毁了我们的友谊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm not going to let Petronella Van Daan spoil our friendship.

1275
02:07:47,869 --> 02:07:49,962
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}稍等，达索尔先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Just a moment, Mr. Dussel.

1276
02:07:52,841 --> 02:07:55,309
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}在我那时候都是男孩拜访女孩的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}In my day the boys called on the girls.

1277
02:07:55,377 --> 02:07:57,208
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你了解年轻人
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You know how young people are.

1278
02:07:57,279 --> 02:07:59,110
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}彼得的房间是唯一能谈话的地方
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Peter's room is the only place they can talk.

1279
02:07:59,181 --> 02:08:01,206
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}谈话？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Talk?

1280
02:08:01,283 --> 02:08:03,774
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我还是个女孩的时候，他们可不那么叫
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's not what they called it when I was a girl.

1281
02:08:06,254 --> 02:08:10,247
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}抱歉，玛戈特，，又得你自己呆着了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm sorry, Margot, that you have to be the one left out.

1282
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:14,722
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我对你很内疚
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I feel so guilty about you.

1283
02:08:14,796 --> 02:08:16,991
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}为什么？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Why?

1284
02:08:18,066 --> 02:08:21,627
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我是说，每次我去彼得那里......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I mean, every time I go to Peter...

1285
02:08:21,703 --> 02:08:25,400
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我在彼得房间的时候，都感觉伤害你了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}into Peter's room, I have the feeling that I'm hurting you.

1286
02:08:27,075 --> 02:08:30,238
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我知道要是我的话，会嫉妒死的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know if it were me, I'd be desperately jealous.

1287
02:08:33,081 --> 02:08:35,072
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我是有点嫉妒
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I am jealous a little.

1288
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:37,141
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不是你和彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Not of you and Peter.

1289
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:40,411
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm...

1290
02:08:40,488 --> 02:08:43,787
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我只是遗憾没有任何人......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm only feeling sorry that I haven't anyone...

1291
02:08:43,859 --> 02:08:46,726
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}和我讨论我的感情
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}with whom to-- to discuss my feelings.

1292
02:08:46,795 --> 02:08:48,763
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}玛戈特，我甚至不会......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Margot, I won't even...

1293
02:08:48,830 --> 02:08:52,630
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}听着，你找到了友谊，我要你好好享受
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Listen, you've found a companionship, and I want you to enjoy it.

1294
02:08:52,701 --> 02:08:58,264
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}只是在我心里，我感觉有权和别人分享我的感情
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Only in my heart I feel I've got a right to share feelings with someone too.

1295
02:08:59,841 --> 02:09:04,471
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是我肯定彼得......那个男孩，不是我要的那种人
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But I'm sure that Peter... that that boy, he could never be that person for me.

1296
02:09:06,548 --> 02:09:09,073
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或许没有什么可嫉妒的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Maybe there's nothing to be jealous about.

1297
02:09:10,685 --> 02:09:13,051
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或许我只是替代了他猫的位置
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Maybe I'm just taking the place of his cat.

1298
02:09:13,121 --> 02:09:15,055
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}可以让我进我的房间吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Will you please let me in my room?

1299
02:09:15,123 --> 02:09:18,650
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}稍等，亲爱的，亲爱的达索尔先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Just a minute, dear, dear Mr. Dussel.

1300
02:09:29,638 --> 02:09:32,436
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}好了，我走了......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, here I go...

1301
02:09:32,507 --> 02:09:34,475
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}去受他们夹攻了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}to run the gauntlet.

1302
02:09:37,445 --> 02:09:39,470
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}非常感谢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Thank you so much.

1303
02:09:51,359 --> 02:09:53,827
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}看她
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Look at her.

1304
02:09:53,895 --> 02:09:57,524
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}养个儿子真有好处。我从来见不到他
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}A lot of good it did me to have a son. I never see him.

1305
02:09:59,367 --> 02:10:01,392
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}稍等，亲爱的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Just a minute, dear.

1306
02:10:02,837 --> 02:10:06,568
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想和我儿子说几句话，你介意吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'd like to say a few words to my son. Do you mind?

1307
02:10:06,641 --> 02:10:10,236
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}彼得，我不想要你整夜不睡觉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Peter, I do not want you staying up till all hours tonight.

1308
02:10:10,312 --> 02:10:12,371
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你需要睡眠，你正在长身体
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You need your sleep. You are a growing boy.

1309
02:10:12,447 --> 02:10:16,076
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}安妮不可以呆的太晚。她必须九点钟睡觉
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Anne won't stay late. She's going to bed promptly at 9:00.

1310
02:10:16,151 --> 02:10:20,019
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-不是吗，安妮？  -是的，妈妈，我可以走了吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Aren't you, Anne? - Yes, Mother. May we go now?

1311
02:10:20,088 --> 02:10:22,352
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你听敲钟就可以，亲爱的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Listen for the chimes, dear.

1312
02:10:42,310 --> 02:10:44,403
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}难道可能吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Aren't they impossible?

1313
02:10:46,147 --> 02:10:49,275
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}待我们就好像我们还在保育室里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Treating us as if we're still in the nursery.

1314
02:10:50,852 --> 02:10:53,844
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}别让它烦你了......它并没有让我烦
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Don't let it bother you. It...It doesn't bother me.

1315
02:10:57,959 --> 02:11:00,325
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想你真的不能怪他们
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I suppose you can't really blame them.

1316
02:11:01,696 --> 02:11:04,426
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他们总是回忆他们在我们这么大时候的一举一动
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}They think back to what they were like at our age.

1317
02:11:05,734 --> 02:11:09,465
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他们意识不到我们已经进步多少了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}They don't realize how much more advanced we are.

1318
02:11:20,382 --> 02:11:23,146
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我已经知道自己该做什么了。你呢?
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Already I know what I want to do. Don't you?

1319
02:11:24,285 --> 02:11:27,277
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想做个记者什么的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I want to be a journalist or something.

1320
02:11:27,355 --> 02:11:29,346
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我喜欢作家
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I love to write.

1321
02:11:30,759 --> 02:11:32,750
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你要做什么
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What do you want to do?

1322
02:11:34,896 --> 02:11:36,921
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我现在知道我要做什么
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know what I'd like right now.

1323
02:11:36,998 --> 02:11:40,525
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想去英国，和自由荷兰力量在一起
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'd like to make it to England, get with the Free Dutch Forces over there.

1324
02:11:40,602 --> 02:11:43,730
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}彼得，你不可以做那种事
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Peter, you wouldn't try a thing like that.

1325
02:11:44,739 --> 02:11:48,140
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你不会做。  -我会的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- You'd never make it. - I'd make it.

1326
02:11:53,281 --> 02:11:56,045
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那只是我想做的无数事情中的其中一个
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Only a few of the hundreds that try do.

1327
02:11:57,852 --> 02:12:02,016
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我知道，但是......我想加入进去，然后打回来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know, but... I'd like to get in it and-- and hit back.

1328
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:05,389
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就坐在这儿，那可不是我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}To just sit here, it's not for me.

1329
02:12:10,598 --> 02:12:12,896
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你喜欢玛戈特吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You like Margot, don't you?

1330
02:12:12,967 --> 02:12:14,901
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}开始你喜欢她
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Right from the start you liked her.

1331
02:12:14,969 --> 02:12:17,055
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}比起我你更喜欢她
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Liked her better than me.

1332
02:12:18,823 --> 02:12:20,814
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，我不知道
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, I don't know.

1333
02:12:20,892 --> 02:12:22,826
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是那样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's all right.

1334
02:12:22,894 --> 02:12:25,021
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}大家都是那么想的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Everyone feels that way.

1335
02:12:25,096 --> 02:12:27,257
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}玛戈特那么好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Margot's so good.

1336
02:12:27,332 --> 02:12:31,894
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她甜蜜，聪明又漂亮，我都不是
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She's sweet and bright and beautiful, and I'm not.

1337
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:33,904
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我没那么说啊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I wouldn't say that.

1338
02:12:33,972 --> 02:12:37,135
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦，不，我都不是。我知道的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh, no, I'm not. I know that.

1339
02:12:37,208 --> 02:12:40,336
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我十分清楚我不漂亮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know quite well that I'm not a beauty.

1340
02:12:40,411 --> 02:12:42,606
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}过去，将来都不漂亮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I never have been and never shall be.

1341
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:45,410
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我绝对不同意
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't agree at all.

1342
02:12:47,251 --> 02:12:49,845
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想你很漂亮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think you're pretty.

1343
02:12:49,921 --> 02:12:51,980
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那不是真话
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's not true.

1344
02:12:52,056 --> 02:12:54,490
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}再有一件事
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}A...And another thing.

1345
02:12:54,559 --> 02:12:57,756
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你变了，我的意思是，从开始就变了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You've changed. From the first, I mean.

1346
02:12:57,829 --> 02:12:59,854
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我变了？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I have?

1347
02:13:01,966 --> 02:13:05,834
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我过去认为你太吵闹了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I used to think that you were awful noisy.

1348
02:13:05,903 --> 02:13:09,498
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你现在怎么想的，彼得？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And what do you think now, Peter?

1349
02:13:09,574 --> 02:13:11,542
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我变成什么样了？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}How have I changed?

1350
02:13:13,077 --> 02:13:15,671
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嗯，你......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, you...

1351
02:13:15,747 --> 02:13:17,681
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你更文静了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're quieter.

1352
02:13:20,651 --> 02:13:23,142
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我很高兴你不讨厌我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm glad you don't just hate me.

1353
02:13:24,255 --> 02:13:26,246
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我从来没那么说过啊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I never said that.

1354
02:13:48,246 --> 02:13:52,012
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我敢打赌只要你从这出去，你就会永远忘了我
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I bet when you get out of here, you'll never think of me again.

1355
02:13:53,418 --> 02:13:55,477
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}真是疯了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's crazy.

1356
02:13:56,988 --> 02:13:59,081
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当你带着你的朋友们回来......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When you get back with all your friends...

1357
02:13:59,157 --> 02:14:01,125
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你会说......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}you're going to say...

1358
02:14:01,192 --> 02:14:03,956
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}“现在我真不知道为什么我会喜欢那个呱呱小姐？”
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}"Now what did I ever see in that Miss Quack-Quack?"

1359
02:14:05,263 --> 02:14:08,755
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我没有朋友。  -彼得，你当然有
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I haven't got any friends. - Peter, of course you have.

1360
02:14:09,934 --> 02:14:12,266
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}每个人都有朋友
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Everyone has friends.

1361
02:14:12,336 --> 02:14:15,533
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不包括我，我一个也没有
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Not me. I don't want any.

1362
02:14:15,606 --> 02:14:18,040
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}没有朋友我也过的很好
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I get along fine without 'em.

1363
02:14:20,878 --> 02:14:24,006
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你的意思是不是没有我，你也过得很好啊？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Does that mean you can get along without me too?

1364
02:14:26,184 --> 02:14:29,017
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我把自己当成你的朋友
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think of myself as your friend.

1365
02:14:30,254 --> 02:14:33,121
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No.

1366
02:14:33,191 --> 02:14:35,921
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}如果他们都喜欢你......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}If they were all like you...

1367
02:14:35,993 --> 02:14:37,927
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那就不同了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}it'd be different.

1368
02:14:48,606 --> 02:14:51,700
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-彼得。  -啊？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Peter... - Hmm?

1369
02:14:51,776 --> 02:14:54,074
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你吻过女孩子吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Did you ever kiss a girl?

1370
02:14:58,082 --> 02:15:00,073
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Yes.

1371
02:15:00,151 --> 02:15:02,119
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}一次
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Once.

1372
02:15:03,121 --> 02:15:05,419
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}她漂亮吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Was she pretty?

1373
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:08,186
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那个你吻过的女孩
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}The girl you kissed.

1374
02:15:08,259 --> 02:15:11,023
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不知道。我被蒙住眼睛了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't know. I was blindfolded.

1375
02:15:11,095 --> 02:15:13,689
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那是在一个聚会。一个亲吻游戏
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It was at a party. One of those kissing games.

1376
02:15:13,764 --> 02:15:15,732
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哦
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Oh.

1377
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:18,360
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想那并不算数，对吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't suppose that really counts, does it?

1378
02:15:20,905 --> 02:15:22,930
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}对于我可不算数了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It didn't with me.

1379
02:15:25,143 --> 02:15:27,134
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我吻过两次
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I've been kissed twice.

1380
02:15:29,814 --> 02:15:33,011
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}一次是一个我从没见过的男人吻我的脸蛋......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Once a man I'd never seen before kissed me on the cheek...

1381
02:15:33,084 --> 02:15:35,211
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当他把我从冰上拉起来的时候
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}when he picked me up off the ice.

1382
02:15:36,287 --> 02:15:38,312
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我那时在哭
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I was crying.

1383
02:15:39,991 --> 02:15:44,428
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}另外一次是我父亲的一个朋友，吻我的手
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And the other was a friend of father's who kissed my hand.

1384
02:15:47,465 --> 02:15:50,491
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你不会说不算数吧，是吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You wouldn't say those counted, would you?

1385
02:15:52,537 --> 02:15:54,835
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不会的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I wouldn't say so.

1386
02:16:07,852 --> 02:16:09,911
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我知道几乎毫无疑问......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know almost for certain...

1387
02:16:09,987 --> 02:16:13,855
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}玛戈特永远不会吻任何人，除非和他订婚
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Margot would never kiss anyone unless she was engaged to them.

1388
02:16:17,528 --> 02:16:21,157
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我也肯定妈妈在爸爸之前也从来没碰过男人
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And I'm sure too that Mother never touched a man before father.

1389
02:16:24,302 --> 02:16:26,270
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是我不知道
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But I don't know.

1390
02:16:27,271 --> 02:16:29,501
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在什么都变了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Things are so different now.

1391
02:16:31,342 --> 02:16:33,503
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你怎么想？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What do you think?

1392
02:16:35,012 --> 02:16:37,446
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你是不是认为一个女孩不该吻一个人......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Do you think a girl shouldn't kiss anyone...

1393
02:16:37,515 --> 02:16:40,211
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}除了和她订婚了什么的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}except if she's engaged or something?

1394
02:16:44,222 --> 02:16:47,316
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}想想该怎么做太难了......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's so hard to try to think what to do...

1395
02:16:48,826 --> 02:16:52,660
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}在这里，当我们伴着整个世界在耳边坍塌时
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}when here we are with the whole world falling around our ears.

1396
02:16:54,165 --> 02:16:57,225
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那么你想......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And you think...

1397
02:16:57,301 --> 02:17:00,429
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你看，你不知道明天会怎样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}well, you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

1398
02:17:03,174 --> 02:17:05,108
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你是怎么想的?
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What do you think?

1399
02:17:06,344 --> 02:17:08,812
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}嗯，呃......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, uh...

1400
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:11,939
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想，那得看女孩的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I suppose it...it depends on the girl.

1401
02:17:13,751 --> 02:17:17,551
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}对于一些女孩来说，无......无论他们做什么，都是错的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}With some, n-no matter what they do, it's wrong.

1402
02:17:18,623 --> 02:17:20,557
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}而另一些......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But others...

1403
02:17:22,093 --> 02:17:24,857
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}怎样做都没有错
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}it wouldn't necessarily be wrong with them.

1404
02:17:24,929 --> 02:17:27,090
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我过去总想......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I always thought that...

1405
02:17:27,164 --> 02:17:29,098
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当两个人......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}when two people--

1406
02:17:29,166 --> 02:17:31,293
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想我该走了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think I should go now.

1407
02:17:32,637 --> 02:17:35,572
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's right.

1408
02:17:38,743 --> 02:17:40,768
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}晚安
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Good night.

1409
02:17:45,783 --> 02:17:49,617
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-不要让他们阻止你来。  -不会的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-You won't let 'em stop you from coming? -No.

1410
02:17:50,621 --> 02:17:53,488
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我要把日记带来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I might bring my diary.

1411
02:17:53,557 --> 02:17:57,118
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}里面有太多我要和你谈论的东西了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}There are so many things in it I want to talk over with you.

1412
02:17:57,194 --> 02:17:59,389
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有很多关于你的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}There's a lot about you.

1413
02:17:59,463 --> 02:18:01,397
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}什么内容啊？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}What kind of things?

1414
02:18:04,068 --> 02:18:06,468
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}呃......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well...

1415
02:18:06,537 --> 02:18:08,835
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有些我不想让你看
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I wouldn't want you to see some of it.

1416
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:12,104
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我过去认为你什么都不是
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I thought you were nothing.

1417
02:18:13,177 --> 02:18:15,509
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就像你对我的看法似的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Just the way you thought about me.

1418
02:18:17,915 --> 02:18:20,145
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你是不是已经改变了对我的看法......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Did you change your mind...

1419
02:18:21,352 --> 02:18:23,786
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就像我改变了对你的看法一样？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}the way I changed my mind about you?

1420
02:18:25,589 --> 02:18:28,080
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}噢，你会知道的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Well, you'll see.

1421
02:19:47,838 --> 02:19:49,829
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}晚安，安妮
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Good night, Annele.

1422

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Good night, angel. - Good night.

1423

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}啊哈
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mm-hmm.

1424
02:20:38,389 --> 02:20:41,051

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}人们除了谈论解放的希望，什么也不说了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And people talk of nothing else but the hope of liberation.

1427
02:20:48,299 --> 02:20:50,233
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}解放最好快点到来
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It had best come soon.

1428

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}好像他得了溃疡
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It seems he has ulcers.

1432
02:21:04,895 --> 02:21:07,386
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我恐怕我们就是他的溃疡
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm afraid we are his ulcers.

1433
02:21:08,599 --> 02:21:11,193
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}米耶普得处理公事，还得照看我们
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Miep has to run the business and us too.

1434
02:21:13,437 --> 02:21:15,496
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们真的太幸运了......

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当想到外面发生的一切的时候
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}when you think of what is happening outside.

1436

1438
02:22:26,009 --> 02:22:28,102
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我彻底迷茫了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'm utterly confused.

1439
02:22:30,047 --> 02:22:34,040
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我一直渴望...渴望着一切
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I am longing...so longing for everything.

1440
02:25:18,248 --> 02:25:21,308

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Otto! Otto, quick. He's stealing the food!

1441
02:25:21,385 --> 02:25:23,580
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-埃蒂茨，埃蒂茨！  -范・戴恩先生，让我看看！

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Give me... - What happened? Mr. Van Daan. Mr....

1444
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:31,293

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Look, the bread!

1445
02:25:31,361 --> 02:25:33,295
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你这个肮脏的贼
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You dirty thief.

1446
02:25:33,363 --> 02:25:36,093
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你这个废物。 -放开他。救救我，彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- You good-for-nothing. - Let him go. Help me, Peter.

1447
02:25:36,166 --> 02:25:38,691
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}放开他！彼得，救救我！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Let him go! Peter, help me!

1448
02:25:38,769 --> 02:25:41,670

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Let him go!

1449

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Putti, what is it?

1450
02:25:55,419 --> 02:25:58,354
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他在偷面包
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He was stealing the bread.

1451
02:25:58,422 --> 02:26:02,688
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}是你啊。我们还都一直以为是老鼠偷的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It was you. And all the time we thought it was the rats.

1452
02:26:02,759 --> 02:26:05,523
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}范・戴恩先生，你怎么能这样？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Van Daan, how could you?

1453
02:26:06,797 --> 02:26:10,289
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我饿啊。  -我们都饿
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- I'm hungry. - We're all of us hungry.

1454
02:26:10,367 --> 02:26:13,564
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我看着孩子们越来越瘦
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I see the children getting thinner and thinner.

1455
02:26:13,637 --> 02:26:17,471
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你自己的儿子，我听到他在梦中呻吟，他太饿了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Your own son, I've heard him moan in his sleep, he's so hungry.

1456
02:26:17,541 --> 02:26:22,342
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你却下来偷食物，那些应该给孩子们的食物
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And you come down and steal food that should go to them, the children.

1457
02:26:24,548 --> 02:26:26,675
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他比我们需要更多的食物
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He needs more food than the rest of us.

1458
02:26:26,750 --> 02:26:29,184
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他吃得多，他太胖了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He's used to more. He's a big man.

1459
02:26:29,252 --> 02:26:31,345
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And you!

1460
02:26:31,421 --> 02:26:34,049
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你比他更坏。你是一个母亲
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're worse than he is. You're a mother.

1461
02:26:34,124 --> 02:26:37,025
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}为了这个人，你竟然牺牲你自己的儿子，这个......这个......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And yet you sacrifice your son to this man, this...this...

1462
02:26:37,094 --> 02:26:39,028
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}埃蒂茨
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Edith.

1463
02:26:39,096 --> 02:26:41,121
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}别以为我没看到你
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Don't think I haven't seen you.

1464
02:26:41,198 --> 02:26:44,998
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}总是挑出最好的那点留给他。我一直盯着你呢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Always saving the choicest bits for him. I've watched you.

1465
02:26:45,068 --> 02:26:47,901
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}多少天了，我忍着没说，现在不忍了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Day after day, and I've held my tongue, but not any longer.

1466
02:26:47,971 --> 02:26:49,905
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}以后再也不忍了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Not after this!

1467
02:26:49,973 --> 02:26:53,340
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在我要他离开。我要他从这里出去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Now I want him to go. I want him to get out of here!

1468
02:26:53,410 --> 02:26:55,344
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}埃蒂茨
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Edith.

1469
02:26:55,412 --> 02:26:57,903
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}从这出去？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Get out of here?

1470
02:26:59,382 --> 02:27:02,715
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你是什么意思？  -就这样，拿着你的东西，出去
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- What do you mean? -Just that. Take your things. Get out.

1471
02:27:02,786 --> 02:27:05,755
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你在说气话。你不是那意思
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're speaking in anger. You cannot mean what you're saying.

1472
02:27:05,822 --> 02:27:09,417
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-就是那意思。  -两年了，我们生活在一起
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-I mean exactly that. -For 2 years we have lived side by side.

1473
02:27:09,493 --> 02:27:11,552
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们尊重彼此的权利
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We have respected each other's rights.

1474
02:27:11,628 --> 02:27:14,563
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们努力和平相处。我们现在要全都丢弃吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We have managed to live in peace. Are we going to throw it all away?

1475
02:27:16,666 --> 02:27:18,657
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}范・戴恩先生......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Van Daan...

1476
02:27:18,735 --> 02:27:21,499
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我知道这种事再也不会发生了。是不是？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know this is never going to happen again, is it?

1477
02:27:21,571 --> 02:27:25,473
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-不会了，不会了  -哈，偷一次，还会偷第二次
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- No, no. - Ah, he steals once, he'll steal again.

1478
02:27:25,542 --> 02:27:28,511
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我要他们离开。现在就走
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I want them to leave. You go now!

1479
02:27:36,186 --> 02:27:38,120
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}妈妈
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mother.

1480
02:27:38,188 --> 02:27:41,885
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你要把彼得也撵出去？他什么也没做啊
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You're not putting Peter out? Peter hasn't done anything.

1481
02:27:41,958 --> 02:27:45,121
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不是说彼得。他可以呆在这里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't mean Peter. Peter can stay.

1482
02:27:45,195 --> 02:27:48,460
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要是他走我也得走。他是我爸爸
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'll have to go if he goes. That's my father.

1483
02:27:48,532 --> 02:27:51,000
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他不配做你爸爸，那个人
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He's no father to you, that man.

1484
02:27:51,067 --> 02:27:53,194
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他不知道爸爸意味着什么
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He doesn't know what it means to be a father.

1485
02:27:53,270 --> 02:27:55,966
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}感觉不合适。我不能留在这
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I wouldn't feel right. I couldn't stay.

1486
02:27:56,039 --> 02:27:58,132
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那么好吧
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Very well then.

1487
02:27:58,208 --> 02:28:00,142
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}彼得，不
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Peter. No.

1488
02:28:03,647 --> 02:28:08,016
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}弗兰克太太，你要把我们赶到大街上吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mrs. Frank, you would put us out in the street?

1489
02:28:09,286 --> 02:28:11,254
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你们可以再找一个藏身之处
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You can find another hiding place.

1490
02:28:12,522 --> 02:28:16,322
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们去哪里找一个地窖......一个壁橱啊？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Where would we even find a cellar... a-a closet?

1491
02:28:22,899 --> 02:28:24,833
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}弗兰克先生......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Frank...

1492
02:28:27,704 --> 02:28:29,865
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你告诉普提......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}you told Putti...

1493
02:28:29,940 --> 02:28:34,274
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你不会忘了吧，当你刚来到荷兰的时候，他是怎么对你的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}you would never forget what he did for you when you first came to Holland.

1494
02:28:34,344 --> 02:28:36,608
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你说过你永远都报答不了他
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You said you never would be able to repay him.

1495
02:28:36,680 --> 02:28:40,275
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要是我丈夫有什么欠你的，他已经加倍偿还了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}If my husband had any obligations to you, he has paid it over and over.

1496
02:28:40,350 --> 02:28:43,877
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}埃蒂茨，我不明白。我从来没见你这样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Edith, I don't know you. I've never seen you like this.

1497
02:28:43,954 --> 02:28:46,479
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我早就该说出来了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I should have spoken out long ago.

1498
02:28:46,556 --> 02:28:48,717
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你对有些人没好处
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You can't be nice to some people.

1499
02:28:48,792 --> 02:28:51,886
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}如果你不来这，本来我们会有足够的东西
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}There would have been plenty for all of us if you hadn't come in here!

1500
02:28:51,962 --> 02:28:55,090
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，不，范・戴恩太太。
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No, no, Mrs. Van Daan. Please.

1501
02:28:59,102 --> 02:29:02,469
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们不必纳粹毁掉我们了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We don't need the Nazis to destroy us.

1502
02:29:02,539 --> 02:29:05,064
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们自己就毁掉自己了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We're destroying ourselves.

1503
02:29:10,180 --> 02:29:13,149
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}妈妈，请不要让他们离开
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mother, please don't send them away.

1504
02:29:13,216 --> 02:29:16,549
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-已经天亮了。  -他们会被抓住的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- It's daylight. - And they'll be caught.

1505
02:29:18,054 --> 02:29:20,522

1631
02:39:09,985 --> 02:39:12,010

{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Perhaps it's Sunday.

1632
02:39:12,087 --> 02:39:14,078
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们或许都没法判断日期了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We may have lost track of the days.

1633
02:39:15,224 --> 02:39:18,682

{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我知道今天星期几
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know exactly what day it is.

1636

1637
02:39:29,171 --> 02:39:31,901
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}今天星期五，却没有一个人上班
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It's Friday, and not a man at work.

1638
02:39:35,811 --> 02:39:38,075
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}告诉你，卡勒先生死了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I tell you, Mr. Kraler is dead.

1639
02:39:39,281 --> 02:39:41,306
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那是唯一的解释
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's the only explanation.

1640
02:39:41,383 --> 02:39:43,613
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}他死了，这栋楼歇业了......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}He's dead, and they've closed down the building...

1641
02:39:43,685 --> 02:39:45,619
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那就是米耶普试图告诉我们的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and that's what Miep's trying to tell us.

1642
02:39:45,687 --> 02:39:48,087
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}可能她从来没给我们打过电话，达索尔先生
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}She would never telephone us, Mr. Dussel.

1643
02:39:48,156 --> 02:39:50,681
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我求你了，弗兰克先生，去接电话
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Please, I beg of you, Mr. Frank, answer the phone.

1644
02:39:50,759 --> 02:39:53,284

1645
02:39:53,362 --> 02:39:56,490
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}只是听听，看是不是米耶普
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Just listen and see if it's Miep.

1646
02:39:56,565 --> 02:39:59,193
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}看在上帝的份上，去接电话！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}For God's sake, answer the telephone!

1647
02:39:59,268 --> 02:40:01,293
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我说了，不
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I've told you, no.

1648
02:40:06,575 --> 02:40:10,534
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不会做任何事情，让别人知道我们在这栋楼里
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I'll do nothing that might let anyone know that we're in this building.

1649
02:40:10,612 --> 02:40:13,137
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}弗兰克先生是正确的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Frank's right.

1650
02:40:13,215 --> 02:40:15,479
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不用告诉我们你赞成谁
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}There's no need to tell us what side you're on.

1651
02:40:15,551 --> 02:40:20,750
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}如果我们就这么安静，耐心地等着，我相信会有帮助到来的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}If we wait here quietly and patiently, I believe that help will come.

1652
02:40:27,796 --> 02:40:30,560
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}达索尔先生......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Dussel...

1653
02:40:30,632 --> 02:40:33,624
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，达......达索尔先生......达索尔先生！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No, Mr.... Mr. Dussel... Mr. Dussel!

1654
02:40:48,150 --> 02:40:50,084
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}太迟了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Too late.

1655
02:40:57,392 --> 02:41:01,920
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就这么一直等着......等到死
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}So we just wait here... until we die.

1656
02:41:01,997 --> 02:41:04,795
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我受不了了。我要自杀
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I can't stand it. I'll kill myself.

1657
02:41:04,866 --> 02:41:07,460
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}看在老天的份上，别说话
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}For heaven's sake, stop it.

1658
02:41:07,536 --> 02:41:11,063
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要是我自杀，你会高兴的。你愿意要我死
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think you would be glad if I did. You want me to die.

1659
02:41:11,139 --> 02:41:13,130
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们在这里是谁的错？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Whose fault is it we're here?

1660
02:41:13,208 --> 02:41:15,836
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们本来可以在美国或者瑞士很安全
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We could have been safe in America or Switzerland.

1661
02:41:15,911 --> 02:41:19,039
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，不。我想离开的时候，你却不愿意离开
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But no, no. You wouldn't leave when I wanted to.

1662
02:41:19,114 --> 02:41:21,378
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你舍不得你那些值钱的东西
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You couldn't leave your precious things.

1663
02:41:21,450 --> 02:41:23,918
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-你的家具。  -是那样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}- Your furniture. - That's right.

1664
02:41:23,986 --> 02:41:27,080
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}全都怪我。都是我的错
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Blame it all on me. It's all my fault.

1665
02:41:27,155 --> 02:41:29,783
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你的帽子，你的鞋，还有那些碟子
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Your hats,your shoes,your dishes.

1666
02:41:29,858 --> 02:41:32,122
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不就是为了让你过的舒适才弄那些吗
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}For your comfort we had anything.

1667
02:41:32,194 --> 02:41:36,028
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-我的舒适。  -我从来没有过我想要的东西
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}-My comfort. - I never had anything I really wanted.

1668
02:41:36,098 --> 02:41:38,157
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}哪个不是为了让你高兴！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Everything was for your pleasure!

1669
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:49,142
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}看，彼得。看天空
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Look, Peter. Look at the sky.

1670
02:41:50,445 --> 02:41:53,710
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那些云彩漂亮吧？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Aren't the clouds beautiful?

1671
02:41:55,083 --> 02:41:57,881
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}好好可爱的一天
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}A lovely, lovely day.

1672
02:42:07,062 --> 02:42:08,996
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你知道我要做的吗......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You know what I do...

1673
02:42:09,064 --> 02:42:12,932
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当我无法再忍受哪怕一分钟被关在笼子里的时候
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}when I think I can't stand another minute of being cooped up?

1674
02:42:14,936 --> 02:42:16,961
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想象着我在外面了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think myself outside.

1675
02:42:19,841 --> 02:42:23,607
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想象着我在公园里散步，那个我常和爸爸一起去的......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think I'm on a walk in the park where I used to go with father...

1676
02:42:23,679 --> 02:42:27,706
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}漫坡都是番红花，长寿花，还有紫罗兰的地方
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}where the crocus and the jonquils and the violets grow along the slopes.

1677
02:42:32,521 --> 02:42:35,490
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你知道......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You know...

1678
02:42:35,557 --> 02:42:40,085
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你想过在外面最美好的是什么吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}the most wonderful part of thinking yourself outside?

1679
02:42:47,335 --> 02:42:50,168
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你可以随心所欲做你想要做的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You can have it any way you like.

1680
02:42:52,674 --> 02:42:57,304
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}你可以让玫瑰花，紫罗兰，郁金香都在一个季节里开放
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}You can have roses, violets and tulips all blooming in the same season.

1681
02:43:00,716 --> 02:43:03,048
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}多美妙啊！
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Isn't that wonderful?

1682
02:43:07,355 --> 02:43:11,291
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当我以前在外面的时候，我一直认为什么都理所当然
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When I was outside, I used to take it all for granted.

1683
02:43:11,359 --> 02:43:14,487
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}现在在这里，一想到大自然，我都要疯了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}And now in here I've just gone crazy about nature.

1684
02:43:17,833 --> 02:43:19,824
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我已经疯了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I've just gone crazy.

1685
02:43:21,002 --> 02:43:24,369
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想要是不快点发生什么......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think if something doesn't happen soon...

1686
02:43:24,439 --> 02:43:27,374
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}要是我们不能出去......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}if we don't get out of here...

1687
02:43:27,442 --> 02:43:31,276
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我就再也受不了了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I can't stand much more of this.

1688
02:43:31,346 --> 02:43:34,008
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我希望你信仰宗教，彼得
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I wish you had a religion, Peter.

1689
02:43:35,751 --> 02:43:37,981
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不，谢谢
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}No, thanks.

1690
02:43:38,053 --> 02:43:39,987
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不信
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Not me.

1691
02:43:40,055 --> 02:43:42,387
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我不是要你信正教......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I don't mean you have to be Orthodox...

1692
02:43:43,792 --> 02:43:47,319
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}或者信什么天堂，地狱，炼狱之类
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}or believe in heaven and hell and purgatory and things.

1693
02:43:48,330 --> 02:43:50,662
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我只是说某个宗教
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I just mean some religion.

1694
02:43:52,134 --> 02:43:54,295
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不管是什么教
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It doesn't matter what.

1695
02:43:54,369 --> 02:43:56,394
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}只是信点什么
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Just to believe in something.

1696
02:44:01,609 --> 02:44:03,804
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当我想着所有外面的......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When I think of all that's out there...

1697
02:44:03,878 --> 02:44:06,210
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}树和花......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}the trees and flowers...

1698
02:44:07,282 --> 02:44:09,273
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那些海鸥......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and those seagulls--

1699
02:44:13,621 --> 02:44:16,681
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当我想着你的可爱，彼得......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When I think of the dearness of you, Peter...

1700
02:44:23,765 --> 02:44:26,427
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}想着我认识的所有善良的人......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}and the goodness of the people we know--

1701
02:44:26,501 --> 02:44:29,368
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}卡勒先生和米耶普，那个蔬菜商......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Mr. Kraler and Miep, the vegetable man...

1702
02:44:31,139 --> 02:44:34,597
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}所有那些人都为了我们的生活冒险......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}all of them risking their lives for us every day...

1703
02:44:36,578 --> 02:44:41,015
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当我想着这些美好的时候，我不再害怕了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When I think of these good things, I'm not afraid anymore.

1704
02:44:41,082 --> 02:44:43,676
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我发现自己......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I find myself...

1705
02:44:43,751 --> 02:44:45,685
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}信主，并且我......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}in God, and I...

1706
02:44:45,753 --> 02:44:49,120
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那......那真好，不过......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That's... That's fine, but...

1707
02:44:51,960 --> 02:44:54,622
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}当我开始想的时候......，嗯......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}When I begin to think, well...

1708
02:44:54,696 --> 02:44:57,529
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我就会发疯
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I get mad.

1709
02:44:57,599 --> 02:45:00,261
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}看看我们
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Look at us.

1710
02:45:00,335 --> 02:45:02,496
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}藏在这里两年了
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Hiding out here for two years.

1711
02:45:03,805 --> 02:45:05,796
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}不能动。就好像......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Not able to move. Caught like...

1712
02:45:09,010 --> 02:45:11,638
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}等着他们来抓我们似的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Waiting for them to come and get us.

1713
02:45:22,824 --> 02:45:26,385
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我们不是唯一被迫忍受苦难的人
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}We're not the only people that have had to suffer.

1714
02:45:26,461 --> 02:45:29,589
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}还有很多人不得不忍受
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}There have always been people that have had to.

1715
02:45:29,664 --> 02:45:33,293
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}有时候是这个民族，有时候是另一个，但是......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Sometimes one race, sometimes another, and yet...

1716
02:45:33,368 --> 02:45:35,598
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}这并没有让我减少痛苦
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}That doesn't make me feel any better.

1717
02:45:38,539 --> 02:45:41,906
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我知道那很糟糕，一直努力树立信心......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I know it's terrible, trying to have any faith...

1718
02:45:41,976 --> 02:45:44,171
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就在人们做着可怕的事情当中......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}when people are doing such horrible...

1719
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:49,138
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是你知道我有时候怎么想吗？
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But you know what I sometimes think?

1720
02:45:49,217 --> 02:45:52,345
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我想世界是要经过一个阶段的......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I think the world may be going through a phase...

1721
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:55,218
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}就像我和妈妈经过的那个阶段一样
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}the way I was with Mother.

1722
02:45:55,290 --> 02:45:58,123
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}一定会过去的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}It'll pass.

1723
02:45:58,192 --> 02:46:00,558
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}也许用不了几百年......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}Maybe not for hundreds of years...

1724
02:46:00,628 --> 02:46:02,687
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}总有一天
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}but someday.

1725
02:46:05,566 --> 02:46:07,796
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我仍然相信......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I still believe...

1726
02:46:07,869 --> 02:46:10,201
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}尽管发生着每件事......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}in spite of everything...

1727
02:46:10,271 --> 02:46:12,569
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}人的内心深处还是善良的
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}that people are really good at heart.

1728
02:46:19,781 --> 02:46:22,477
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}我就想看到现在......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}I want to see something now...

1729
02:46:22,550 --> 02:46:25,417
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}而不是一千年后的什么
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}not a thousand years from now.

1730
02:46:25,486 --> 02:46:27,454
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}但是，彼得......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}But, Peter...

1731
02:46:27,522 --> 02:46:31,856
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}如果你只把它当做一个大图案的一部分......
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}if you'd only look at it as part of a great pattern...

1732
02:46:31,926 --> 02:46:34,360
{\fn黑体\fs12\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}那也只是我们生命中的一小会儿
{\fs9\bord1\shad0\pos(200,250)}that we're just a little minute in life.

1733
02:46:38,633 --> 02:46:43,093
