3
00:01:55,254 --> 00:02:00,668
泰国 1862年

4
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,257
快点搬，快点搬，不能整天耗在这
Come on, lads, hurry!
We haven't got all day.

5
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,221
船长，这就是泰国了吗
Is that it, captain? Are we here?

6
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,973
对，这就是曼谷
Aye, laddie. That's Bangkok all right.

7
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,726
路易，路易
Louis! Oh, Louis!

8
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,020
妈妈，曼谷到了
Mother! Look, there's Bangkok.

9
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,940
我知道，这真令人兴奋
Yes, I know. Isn't it exciting?

10
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,944
船长，告诉我为什么要抛下锚呢
有什么问题吗？
Captain, I heard them lowering
the anchor. ls anything wrong?

11
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,364
我们在等待涨潮，只有那时才能入港
We have to wait for the afternoon
tide to carry us over the bar.

12
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,199
原来是这样
Oh, I see.

13
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,456
妈妈，不知道国王会不会来接我们？
Will the king of Siam come down
to meet us, Mother?

14
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,584
我想当然不会来了，国王不会的，这有规矩
I hardly think so, dear.
Kings don't, as a rule.

15
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,926
船头人手不足，快去
Come forward, lads.
They need help in the bow.

16
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,511
快去那里
Get along there.

17
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,098
那是皇室的船
That's the royal barge.

18
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,231
国王来接我们了吗
The king is coming out to meet us.

19
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,608
没有，是克拉拉贺
It's not the king, it's the Oklahoma.

20
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,610
克拉拉贺是谁
Who is the kralahome?

21
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,696
他是首相
A sort of a prime minister.

22
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,740
应该是国王的助手吧
The king's right-hand man, you might say.

23
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,244
让我看一下好吗，看一下
May I look? Please, may I see?

24
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,871
夫人，我提醒你
Aye, laddie.

25
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:28,834
最好对他小心点
Ma'am, if I might be allowed to offer
you a word of warning,

26
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,588
因为他是一个很有权利的人
that man has power, and he can
use it for you or against you.

27
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,465
跟他作对，后果不堪设想
You must stop worrying about me,
Captain Orton.

28
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,594
我的事你尽管放心好了，船长
Sometimes I wonder if you know what
you're really facing.

29
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,180
我当然担心，一个英国女人
独自来到这个国家
An Englishwoman alone in a country like Siam.

30
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,932
没关系，船长,我来这是工作的
It doesn't matter, captain.
I shall have work to do,

31
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,894
再说国王又答应给
我和孩子提供住所
and the king has promised me
a house of my own.

32
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,564
如果亡夫地下有知的话,一定会赞成的
I'll have a place to bring up my boy
as his father would have wished.

33
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,651
妈妈,你看,那位大臣竟然是赤裸的
Mother, look. The prime minister is naked!

34
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,155
别好笑了，路易,怎么可能了
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Louis.
He can't be naked.

35
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,740
他只是.
He's only...

36
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,117
...半裸的
...half-naked.

37
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,580
他们看起来有点吓人，妈妈
They look so cruel, Mother.

38
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,750
爸爸不愿意看到我们害怕，是吗？
Father wouldn't have liked us to be afraid, would he?

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,253
路易，爸爸从来不愿看到我们害怕
No, Louis. Father would not have
liked us to be afraid.

40
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,464
从来不
Not ever.

41
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,591
妈妈，你什么都不怕吗
Doesn't anything ever frighten you?

42
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,051
有时会的
Oh, yes, sometimes.

43
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,470
你害怕的时候怎么办？
我会吹口哨
- What do you do?
- I whistle.

44
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,306
那就是为什么你会吹口哨了
Oh, that's why you whistle.

45
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,309
那就是我吹口哨的原因
That's why I whistle.

46
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,063
当我感到害怕时
<i>Whenever I feel afraid</i>

47
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,398
我就会挺起胸膛
<i>I hold my head erect</i>

48
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:38,278
吹起高兴的乐曲，所以没人怀疑
<i>And whistle a happy tune,
So no one will suspect</i>

49
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,864
我害怕
<i>I'm afraid</i>

50
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,867
当我打颤时
<i>While shivering in my shoes</i>

51
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,537
我就做个无畏的动作
<i>I strike a careless pose</i>

52
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,830
吹高兴的乐曲
<i>And whistle a happy tune</i>

53
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,960
没人知道我害怕
<i>And no one ever knows I'm afraid</i>

54
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,214
口哨是很不可思议
<i>The result of this deception</i>

55
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,675
的魔法
<i>is very strange to tell</i>

56
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,803
连恐惧的对象
<i>For when I fool the people I fear</i>

57
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,055
以及自己都被蒙骗
<i>I fool myself as well!</i>

58
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,933
只要吹吹口哨
<i>I whistle a happy tune</i>

59
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,602
在短时间内
<i>And every single time</i>

60
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,188
就会被活泼的旋律
<i>The happiness in the tune</i>

61
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:17,651
把恐惧冲散
<i>Convinces me that I'm not afraid.</i>

62
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,280
要相信你很勇敢
<i>Make believe you're brave</i>

63
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,866
这样勇气就会充满心胸
<i>And the trick will take you far.</i>

64
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,660
你要勇敢
<i>You may be as brave</i>

65
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,288
相信你能行
<i>As you make believe you are.</i>

66
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,921
相信自己
<i>You may be as brave</i>

67
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,341
你很勇敢
<i>As you make believe you are.</i>

68
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:51,059
这是个好主意，妈妈，太好了
I think that's a very good idea,
Mother. A very good idea.

69
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,229
对，这的确是个好主意
Yes, it is a good idea, isn't it?

70
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:58,108
我不会再感到恐惧了，不会了，妈妈
I don't think I shall ever be afraid again.

71
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,443
这就对了
Good.

72
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,112
口哨是非常不可思议
<i>The result of this deception</i>

73
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,823
的魔法
<i>ls very strange to tell</i>

74
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,743
连恐惧的对象及自己
<i>For when I fool the people I fear</i>

75
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,703
都会被蒙骗
<i>I fool myself as well!</i>

76
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,684
这位是安娜李恩诺太太
This is Anna Halloweens.

77
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,355
李恩诺太太，他是克拉拉贺首相
Mrs. Halloweens, may I present
His Excellency, the kralahome.

78
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:44,571
请问阁下是皇室特聘的家庭教师吗
Sir, you are lady who will be
schoolmistress of the royal children?

79
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,532
是的
他称你阁下
- Yes.
- He called you "sir."

80
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,908
嘘，别说话
Hush, dear, hush.

81
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,077
您在曼谷有朋友吗？
Have you friends in Bangkok?

82
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,871
我不认识任何人
I know no one in Bangkok at all.

83
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:03,131
首相问您结婚了没有
His Excellency wishes to know,
are you married, sir?

84
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,591
我是个寡妇
I am a widow.

85
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,428
您丈夫生前的
工作是什么呢
What manner of man,
your deceased husband?

86
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,599
先夫是英国皇家陆军军官…
My husband was an officer
of Her Majesty's Army in...

87
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,019
我想问一下，
那些事…
Tell your master his business with me

88
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,438
跟我当家庭教师有什么关系吗
is as schoolteacher to the royal children.

89
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,358
我希望不要探索我的隐私
He has no right to pry
into my personal affairs.

90
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,110
他不是这个意思，船长
He hasn't, Captain Orton.

91
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,202
我不喜欢这个人
I don't like that man.

92
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,498
你在这的期间最好别独树一帜，明白吗？
In foreign country is best
you like everyone until you leave.

93
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,043
你会说英语，竟然说不会
You might at least have told us
you speak English, Your Excellency.

94
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,464
我不许家庭教师什么都知道
It is not necessary for schoolteacher
to know everything at once.

95
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,300
你现在跟我来
You come with me now.

96
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,136
行李待会儿运到皇宫去
Your baggages shall be carried
to palace later.

97
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:53,515
请等一下，我并不住在那
Just a minute. Not the palace.
I am not living in the palace.

98
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,643
谁说的
国王
- Who say?
- The king say... Says.

99
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,938
在他的信里答应每月给我20磅的薪水
In his letter of agreement,
he promised me 20￡ a month

100
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,774
并在皇宫外给我安排了住的地方
and a house of my own
outside the palace walls.

101
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,944
国王已经不记得他的承诺了
King do not always remember
what he promise.

102
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,322
那就请你提醒他好了
Then you will have to remind him.

103
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:12,075
我若提醒.会引起他的圣怒
If I tell king he break this promise,
I will make anger in him.

104
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:16,622
我不想为了这些无聊的事引起不快
I think is better if king's anger
reserved for more important matters.

105
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,167
好啊，如果你不敢告诉他的话
Very well, then. If you are
afraid to tell him, I will.

106
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,170
我是不是要见他，要视情况而定了
I should like to see him at once,
while there's time for me

107
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,130
或许我应该立刻返回英国
to return to England on this boat.

108
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,674
国王正忙呢
阁下
- King very busy now.
- Your Excellency,

109
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,677
我并不想占用他很多时间
all I want is
a few minutes' audience with him.

110
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,347
我来这是工作的，但也不会放弃自己的权利
I have come here to work
and I intend to work,

111
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:37,017
我要争取得到我应得的一切
but I shall take nothing less
than I have been promised.

112
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,186
你就这样对国王说话吗？
You will tell king this?

113
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,855
我会的
I will tell king this.

114
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,484
这将是一场有趣的晋见
It should be very interesting meeting.

115
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,110
来吧
You come now!

116
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,988
如果你改变主意
If you change your mind...

117
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,033
再见，船长，谢谢你的照顾
Goodbye, Captain Orton,
and thank you for everything.

118
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,201
祝你好运，夫人
Good luck, ma'am.

119
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,119
再见，船长
再见孩子
- Goodbye, captain.
- Goodbye, laddie.

120
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,413
要好好照顾你的妈妈
Take good care of your mother, now.

121
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,655
国王今天心情不好
King in bad spirit today.

122
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:58,075
还是改天再来吧
Suggest schoolteacher wait for better day.

123
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,787
我也一样心情不好，先生
My spirit is just as bad, Your Excellency.
I cannot wait.

124
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,695
那个男的是缅甸皇室的使者
Man is Lun Tha,
emissary from court of Burma.

125
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:38,532
那个女的是缅甸皇太子送来的礼物
He bring present to king
from prince of Burma.

126
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,034
她名字叫达布提
Her name is Tuptim.

127
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,787
那个女孩是供品
Why, that girl is a present?

128
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,789
送给国王的
For king.

129
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,908
国王收下她了
King is pleased with her.

130
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,839
对不起，
国王上朝的时间到此结束
Sorry. King has concluded audience.

131
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,217
你是说我无法晋见国王
Well, you mean I cannot see him?

132
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,093
下次吧
Not today.

133
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,680
路易，跟我来
Louis, come with me.

134
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,020
你不能这样
You cannot do this!

135
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,237
国王陛下
你是谁
- Your Majesty.
- Who, who, who?

136
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,406
他是请来教英语的家庭教师
Your Majesty, is new English schoolteacher.

137
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,700
安娜女士和她的儿子
Mrs. Anna Halloweens and son.

138
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,036
他叫路易
Louis Halloweens.

139
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,082
你是家庭教师
You are schoolteacher?

140
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:14,711
是的，陛下，但在工作之前
我要弄清楚一件事
Yes, Your Majesty. But before I start
my work here, there is one point...

141
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,923
我是为了让泰国更现代化…
You are part of general plan I have
for bringing to Siam

142
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,425
所以才找你来
what is good in Western culture.

143
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:24,221
而且我还引进了印刷机
Already I have bring printing press here
for printing.

144
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,807
我知道，陛下
你怎么知道的
- Yes, I know, Your Majesty.
- How you know?

145
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:32,479
在签约之前，我已经将所有的事情都调查过了
Before I signed our agreement, I found out
about your ambitions for Siam.

146
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,736
你有多大？
How old shall you be?

147
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,073
你有自信教科学方面的知识吗
You do not look like
scientific person for teaching.

148
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,741
你到底几岁了
How old shall you be?

149
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,495
我有150岁，陛下
I am 150 years old, Your Majesty.

150
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,791
你是哪年生的
In what year were you borned?

151
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,921
我是1712年
In 1712, Your Majesty.

152
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:05,637
你结婚多久了
How many years
shall you have been married?

153
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,973
有几年了
Several, Your Majesty.

154
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,272
你有多少孙子
How many grandchildren
shall you have by now?

155
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,608
告诉我，有多少，
有多少
How many, how many, how many?

156
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,026
你答不出来了吧
You do not answer fast.

157
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,069
我赢了，我赢了
I make better question
than she make answer.

158
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,120
你不怕国王
You are not afraid of king.

159
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:35,292
对，科学精神是不允许有恐惧感的
Not to be afraid is good thing
in scientific mind.

160
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,504
我想也许.
I think maybe

161
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,006
你能够当个好老师
you make very good schoolteaching.

162
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,216
来吧
Come.

163
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,733
他们都是我的妃子
A few of my wives.

164
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,903
他们都很美丽却没有学识
They have beauty
but not gift for knowledge.

165
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,657
我因为外交事务繁忙，所以没时间管教育
I have no time for teaching,
being busy with foreign affairs

166
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,825
和一些其他的事情
and other situations.

167
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,163
她是张妃，是这里的大太太
I may present Lady Thiang, head wife.

168
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:19,837
遥远的地方有个富裕的国度
<i>There is a happy land
far, far away</i>

169
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,673
到处充满了圣者的
<i>Where saints in glory stand</i>

170
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:26,009
耀眼国度
<i>Bright, bright as day.</i>

171
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,181
"最初是神创造了天与地"
"In the beginning, God
created the heaven and the earth."

172
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,850
是传教士教我的
Missionary.

173
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,853
传教士教你英语了
Oh, a missionary taught you English.

174
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,939
是的
Yes, sir. Missionary.

175
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,191
我也有儿子
跟他差不多大
I have boy too.

176
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,737
他的名字是裘雷达汗皇太子
Crown Prince Chowfa Chulalongkorn,
heir to throne.

177
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,115
你来当她的助手…
You help Madam Halloweens
with schoolteaching

178
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,493
而且要好好的学习英语
and she in turn shall teach you
the better English.

179
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,290
她很感谢我的仁慈安排
She is very grateful to me for my kindness.

180
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,878
张妃，你去带孩子们，来见见老师
Lady Thiang, have children prepare
for presentation to schoolteacher.

181
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,007
这个，陛下，我想先谈谈和约问题
Speaking of teaching, Your Majesty,
in our agreement...

182
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,676
孙妃，达拉妃，碧亚妃
Lady Son Klin, Lady Talap, Lady Piam.

183
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,930
而这位女孩是由缅甸送来的
And this girl is present to me
from a Burma prince.

184
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,307
刚刚送来
She just arrived.

185
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,058
你好，夫人
Good day, madam.

186
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:19,980
我叫达布提，我也会说英语
My name is Tuptim. I already speak English.

187
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,566
你说的非常好
And very nicely too.

188
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,235
我有个更好的主意
I think I have fine idea.

189
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,655
在教孩子之余，顺便教教这些妃子们
In addition to children, you will also teach
those of my wives

190
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,574
教她们…科学知识
as have sense enough for learning.

191
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,619
先进国家的女性
Siam to be very modern, scientific country.

192
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,662
都会说英语
Everybody speaking the English.

193
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:40,375
但是国王陛下，我记得契约上没写要教妃子
Your Majesty, it is not in our agreement
that I teach your wives too.

194
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:44,588
另外你可以帮我写写外交文件
Also, I will allow you to help me
in my foreign correspondence.

195
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:47,591
我很乐意为你效劳
I shall be perfectly happy to help you
in any way I can

196
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:51,261
但是我想先谈谈房子的事情
provided we can clear up
this one little matter of the house.

197
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,763
房子？
House?

198
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,264
房子？什么房子
House? What house?

199
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:58,185
我记得你答应在皇宫旁边盖间房子给我的
My house, Your Majesty. The one
you promised me, adjoining the palace.

200
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,438
最好是住在皇宫里
It is a pleasure that you
shall live in palace.

201
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,316
在皇宫里教书，你就住在这
You teach in palace,
and you shall live in palace.

202
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:09,029
从这里可以看到很多美丽的景色
Will have nice apartment.
Can look out, see many things.

203
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,532
我当然知道看到什么东西了
Oh, yes, I'm sure we could see many things,

204
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:15,994
那就是铁栏杆，卫兵，等等等等
such as iron bars, guards at the doors,
et cetera, et cetera.

205
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,122
什么是等等
What is this "et cetera"?

206
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,170
那是表示还有其他相似东西的意思
Well, it means "and all the rest
and so forth," Your Majesty.

207
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,216
来见见我的孩子们
You will meet my children.

208
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,386
国王陛下，如果房子的问题没谈妥的话
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,
but if there is to be no house,

209
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,763
我想搭原来的船返回英国
I shall have to get back to the boat.

210
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:38,183
别再说了，见见我的孩子们
You will stand here and meet royal children.

211
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,566
遵命，陛下
Very well, Your Majesty.

212
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,069
但请快点
But there isn't much time.

213
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,494
王子和公主进来吧
The royal princes and princesses.

214
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,706
来
Well, well, well?

215
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:02,489
现在你还要解决房子的问题
Schoolteacher has graciously
changed her mind and shall live in palace.

216
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,409
房子迟些再说，陛下
For the time being, Your Majesty.

217
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,744
这些都是你要教的
These are the children you shall teach.

218
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,747
改天我让你见见其他的孩子
Someday shall allow you
to meet my others.

219
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,791
还有其他的孩子？
More, Your Majesty?

220
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,586
还有些不住在宫里的
Children of wives not in favor with king.

221
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,629
一共是67个
Sixty-seven, I think.

222
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:18,922
67个
Oh.

223
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:25,345
不
Hmm.

224
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:38,859
不，别这样，别乱动行李箱
No! Oh, ladies, please. Don't open that, no.

225
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:42,779
哦，我的天，请回你们自己房间去
Oh, my goodness! Oh, won't you all
go back to your rooms?

226
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,282
张妃，请叫她们别这样
Lady Thiang, will you please
ask them to leave?

227
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,451
我有自己的隐私
I must have some privacy.

228
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,465
天哪，她们到底想干什么
Good heavens!
What are they trying to do to me?

229
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:06,053
他们想知道你的身体是否也像裙子的形状
Sir, they think you wear dress like that
because you shaped like that.

230
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,388
哦，当然不是
Well, I most certainly am not.

231
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,810
他们只是想了解，阁下
你的孩子呢，他在哪
They wish to know, sir,
if they may see the boy?

232
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,230
对不起，他正在睡觉
I'm sorry, Lady Thiang, he is asleep.

233
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:20,484
请告诉我为什么称我为阁下
Please, do tell me.
Why do you keep calling me sir?

234
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:24,905
因为你不是普通的女人
Because you scientific,
not lowly like woman.

235
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:28,992
难道女人比男人低一等吗
But do you all think
that women are more lowly than men?

236
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,331
那是非常错误的观点
Well, I certainly do not.

237
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:38,502
要是让国王听到了会大发雷霆的
Please, sir, do not tell king.
Make king angry.

238
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:41,672
国王陛下也需要接受教育才行
Perhaps it's time somebody did tell him
a thing or two.

239
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,257
安娜夫人
Mrs. Anna?

240
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:47,594
请问你有没有英文书借给我看
Please, you have some English books
I can read?

241
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:51,390
当然有,可是要等到行李箱打开才行
Yes, of course, my dear,
but they're not unpacked yet.

242
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,524
她们笑她是因为她很愚蠢
They laugh at her
because she is foolish child.

243
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,611
她能在皇宫伺候国王，但并不快乐
She has come to live in palace of king
and yet she is unhappy.

244
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:07,155
毕竟，她在这件事上别无选择
After all, she had no choice in the matter.

245
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,533
我想她一定是思念自己的故乡
Perhaps she is homesick.

246
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:16,915
不是思念故乡
Is not homesickness that make me sad,
Mrs. Anna.

247
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,877
而是思念我无法再见到的人
Is love for one I shall never see again.

248
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,253
哦，可怜的孩子
Oh, poor child.

249
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,048
他就是带我来的使者伦塔
He is Lun Tha,
who was chosen to bring me here.

250
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:28,218
我们都极力克制过了…
We tried so hard
not to have love for each other

251
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,929
但还是情不自禁的双双堕入了情网
but we could not help ourselves.

252
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,307
我们试过了
We did try, Mrs. Anna.

253
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:37,936
思念不是说停就能停下来的
It isn't easy to stop loving a man
if he's the man you want.

254
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:41,106
并不是不见就能割断思念之情
Even if you know
you will never see him again.

255
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,442
我知道
I know.

256
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:47,404
我也非常思念我的先夫
I was very much in love with my husband.

257
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,287
请你们放回原处好吗
Please ask them to put that down.

258
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:58,624
大家想知道他是谁
They wish to know, sir, who is man?

259
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:03,337
他就是我死去的丈夫汤姆
That was my husband, Tom.

260
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,216
汤姆
- Tom.
- Mm-hmm.

261
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,176
他长的很帅
He was pretty in face.

262
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:13,639
是啊，他长的非常英俊
Oh, dear, yes, he was. Very pretty in face.

263
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,937
每当我想起他
<i>When I think of Tom</i>

264
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,773
就禁不住想那一夜
<i>I think about a night</i>

265
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:26,026
大地弥漫着夏日的气息
<i>When the earth smelled of summer</i>

266
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:29,154
云朵在天空漂浮
<i>And the sky was streaked with white</i>

267
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:32,950
轻柔的雾气弥漫
<i>And the soft mist of England</i>

268
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,994
着英格兰小山冈
<i>Was sleeping on a hill,</i>

269
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,541
这些我都记得
<i>I remember this</i>

270
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:47,339
永远记得
<i>And I always will.</i>

271
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,053
我深知我俩的爱情
<i>There are new lovers now</i>

272
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,932
见证在寂静山岗
<i>On the same silent hill</i>

273
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,604
常常浮现在我的脑海
<i>Looking on the same blue sea,</i>

274
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:07,234
汤姆和我永远
<i>And I know Tom and I</i>

275
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:10,988
是大地的一分子
<i>are a part of them all,</i>

276
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:16,326
而他们也是汤姆的一分子
<i>And they're all a part of Tom</i>

277
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:23,083
我也是
<i>and me.</i>

278
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:31,383
年轻的爱人们，无论你是谁
<i>Hello, young lovers, whoever you are,</i>

279
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:37,431
希望你们一切顺利
<i>I hope your troubles are few.</i>

280
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:45,230
我的祝愿伴你度过今宵
<i>All my good wishes go with you tonight.</i>

281
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:50,986
我也像你们一样爱过
<i>I've been in love like you.</i>

282
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,947
提起勇气
<i>Be brave, young lovers,</i>

283
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,700
抓住幸运之星
<i>and follow your star,</i>

284
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:02,539
提起勇气抓住真爱
<i>Be brave and faithful and true,</i>

285
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:06,210
紧紧相拥
<i>Cling very close</i>

286
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:10,797
在日升之前
<i>to each other tonight.</i>

287
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:16,345
我也像你们一样爱过
<i>I've been in love like you.</i>

288
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:21,600
我知道脚上长翅膀
是什么样的感觉
<i>I know how it feels
to have wings on your heels</i>

289
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:26,605
在梦中徘徊散步
<i>And to fly down a street in a trance.</i>

290
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:32,069
你们相识在偶然
<i>You fly down a street
on the chance that you'll meet,</i>

291
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,655
你们相识
<i>And you meet</i>

292
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:41,119
真的不是意外
<i>not really by chance.</i>

293
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:48,794
无论你们做了什么，
年轻的爱人们，别哭
<i>Don't cw, young lovers whatever you do</i>

294
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:54,591
别因为我孤独而为我哭泣
<i>Don't cry because I'm alone,</i>

295
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,804
我所有的记忆让我
<i>All of my mem'ries</i>

296
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:03,433
今晚很快乐
<i>are happy tonight,</i>

297
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:09,147
我曾经有过自己的爱
<i>I've had a love of my own,</i>

298
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:14,027
我曾经有过自己的爱
<i>I've had a love of my own,</i>

299
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:17,281
像你们一样
<i>like yours,</i>

300
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:21,076
我曾经有过
<i>I've had a love</i>

301
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:28,917
自己的爱
<i>of my own.</i>

302
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:44,850
快乐的殿堂
<i>Be it pleasures and palaces,</i>

303
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:49,855
任我们遨游
<i>Though we may roam,</i>

304
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:55,861
曾经如此卑微
<i>Be it ever so humble,</i>

305
00:28:56,028 --> 00:29:01,533
如家般温暖
<i>There's no place like home.</i>

306
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:06,830
天空的魅力
<i>A charm from the skies</i>

307
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:12,002
我们共同分享
<i>Seems to hallow us there,</i>

308
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:14,671
父皇，我上学快迟到了
- Father, I'll be late for school!
- You wait.

309
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:18,175
你昨天在学校学过什么谚语…
You are pleased to recite proverb
you learn yesterday

310
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:21,762
应该写过十二遍了吧
and writing down 12 times in copybook.

311
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,555
"不管在东方--
"A thought for the day:

312
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,682
还是西方"
East or west,

313
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,935
没有比家更舒适之处"
home is best."

314
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:31,146
东方、西方、家，又提到了房子
"East, west, home, best," means house!

315
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,483
"房子仅次于名誉…"
"A man's house is only less dear to him
than his honor."

316
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,278
每天总是提到房子的事
Every day, month after week,
something about house.

317
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,864
除了房子你还学到别的事吗
Are my children to be taught nothing more?

318
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:42,866
昨天她说…
Yesterday we are taught

319
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,452
地球像球一样的圆
that the world is a round ball

320
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:49,206
还会旋转呢…
which spins on an invisible stick
through its middle.

321
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:53,335
可是，地球应该在龟背上才对
Everyone knows
the world rides on the back of a turtle

322
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:55,295
这样才会安全
who keeps it from running into the stars.

323
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:58,257
但是接受己见不一定是对的…
How can it be
that everyone knows one thing

324
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,968
顽固的人总是犯下错？
if many people believe another thing?

325
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,512
那真相是什么呢
Then which is true?

326
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,099
我相信地球应该是…
The world is ball

327
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:08,851
圆的并且会旋转
with stick through it.

328
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:10,143
我相信
I believe.

329
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,728
你相信？
You believe?

330
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,147
所以你无所不知才行
Does that mean that you do not know?

331
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:17,150
没错，你必须知道，因为你要成为国王
But you must know, because you are king.

332
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,402
没错
Good.

333
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:21,238
有天你也会当上国王的
Someday you too will be king,

334
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,574
那时你就知道所有的事
and you too will know everything.

335
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,659
我怎么才能学习到呢
But how do I learn?

336
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:27,911
怎样才能无所不知呢
And when do I know that I know everything?

337
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:33,542
当你成为国王的时候
When you are king.

338
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,715
当你成为国王的时候
When you are king.

339
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:43,427
可我不知道
But I do not know.

340
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:48,182
我没有一件事确定…
In my head are many facts,
but I am not sure.

341
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:52,394
我该如何告诉她.
What to tell a growing son?

342
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,481
如何正确对待政治和子民呢
How to bring truth and justice
to my people?

343
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,946
当我是个孩子时
<i>When I was a boy,</i>

344
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,490
世界比现在还灿烂
<i>World was better spot,</i>

345
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:08,118
什么都是
<i>What was so was so,</i>

346
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,329
黑白分明
<i>What was not was not.</i>

347
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,956
现在我长大了
<i>Now I am a man,</i>

348
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,250
万事都改变了
<i>World have change a lot</i>

349
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,629
有些事很像
<i>Some things nearly so,</i>

350
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,674
有些事又不像
<i>Others nearly not.</i>

351
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:27,429
有时我又不确定
<i>There are times I almost think</i>

352
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:32,476
什么事我绝对知道
<i>I am not sure of what I absolutely know;</i>

353
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:34,895
不再有了
<i>Very often find confusion</i>

354
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:39,816
以往的结论
<i>In conclusion I concluded long ago.</i>

355
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,194
我头脑里有很多东西
<i>In my head are many facts that,</i>

356
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:47,032
当学生时学的东西
<i>As a student I have studied to procure</i>

357
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:49,576
我头脑里有很多东西
<i>In my head are many facts,</i>

358
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,080
我希望能有把握一点
<i>Of which I wish I was more certain</i>

359
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:56,083
我知道
<i>I was sure.</i>

360
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:02,339
这是个问题
<i>Is a puzzlement.</i>

361
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:08,595
我要跟其他的国家联合吗？
<i>Shall I join with other nations in alliance?</i>

362
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:12,891
如果联合失败了
我就失去了威信
<i>If allies are weak am I not best alone?</i>

363
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,020
如果联合成功了
<i>If allies are strong with power
to protect me,</i>

364
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:22,317
借着权力可以保护自己
<i>Might they not protect me out of all I own?</i>

365
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,029
也许他们不会保护我
<i>Is a danger to be trusting one another,</i>

366
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:30,909
相信别人是危险的
<i>One will seldom want to do
what other wishes;</i>

367
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:36,623
但人们永远无法彼此信任
<i>But unless someday,
Somebody trust somebody,</i>

368
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,712
除非有天都彼此相信了
<i>There'll be nothing left on earth</i>

369
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:44,256
地球上除了鱼什么也不剩
<i>excepting fishes!</i>

370
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,135
有段时间我想没人可信
<i>There are times I almost think</i>

371
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:53,223
也没人绝对知道什么
<i>nobody sure of what he absolutely know,</i>

372
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:55,350
人们为以往下的结论
<i>everybody find confusion</i>

373
00:32:55,434 --> 00:33:00,189
困惑不已
<i>In conclusion he concluded long ago.</i>

374
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:02,316
有时人们会满腹牢骚
<i>And it puzzle me to learn</i>

375
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,321
有时人们又会刮目相看
<i>that tho' a man may be in doubt
of what he know,</i>

376
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,573
他们的斗争非常快
<i>Very quickly will he fight,</i>

377
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:14,161
他们斗争是想证明
<i>He'll fight to prove
that what he does not know</i>

378
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:15,621
他不知道又怎么样
<i>is so.</i>

379
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:21,585
哦
<i>Ohhhh!</i>

380
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:24,421
有时我以为人民发疯了
<i>Sometimes I think that people going mad!</i>

381
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:28,759
啊
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

382
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,345
有时觉得他们没这么坏
<i>Sometimes I think that people not so bad.</i>

383
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:33,889
可无论我想什么
<i>But no matter what I think,</i>

384
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:37,434
我不能放弃国王的职责
<i>I must go on living life.
As leader of my kingdom</i>

385
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:38,810
我必须尽到
<i>I must go forth,</i>

386
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,940
父亲对孩子丈夫对妻子的职责
<i>Be father to my children,
And husband to each wife,</i>

387
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:45,651
等等等等
<i>Et cetera, et cetera, and so forth.</i>

388
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:50,155
请指给我一个明示之道
<i>If my Lord in heaven
Buddha show the way,</i>

389
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,784
我一直在努力
<i>Ev'ry day I try to live another day,</i>

390
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:57,704
请指给我一个明示之道
<i>If my Lord in heaven
Buddha show the way,</i>

391
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,377
每天我都在努力
<i>Ev'ry day I do my best for one more day,</i>

392
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,631
可是
<i>But</i>

393
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,386
那是多么难啊
<i>is a puzzlement</i>

394
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:23,230
好了，孩子们，我们开始上课了
Come along now, children.
Take your places, please.

395
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:26,525
请你们快点，不要说话
Quickly now, and quietly.

396
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:30,362
张妃，你开始上课
Lady Thiang,
will you start the lesson, please?

397
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:34,491
蓝色的部分
Blue

398
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,160
是海洋
is ocean.

399
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,495
红色的部分是
Red,

400
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:40,080
泰国
Siam.

401
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,501
这是泰国的国王
Here is king of Siam.

402
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,671
右手上拿着是
In right hand is weapon.

403
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:50,340
消灭敌人的
Show how he destroy

404
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,467
武器
all who fight him.

405
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:56,013
绿色部分是
Green,

406
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,098
缅甸
Burma.

407
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:03,687
这是缅甸国王
Here is king of Burma.

408
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:05,606
他光着身子
No clothes mean

409
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:08,942
因为缅甸太穷没有衣服穿
how poor is king of Burma.

410
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:16,074
谢谢你的解释张妃
Thank you, Lady Thiang. I'll continue.

411
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:20,204
这张地图是25年前的了…
The map you have been looking at
is 25 years old,

412
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,540
今天我们要看新的地图
and today we have a surprise for you.

413
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:28,879
这是刚刚从英国送来的地图
A new map just arrived from England.

414
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,297
我都找不到泰国
I do not see Siam.

415
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,299
这个白色的地方就是
The white is Siam.

416
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:34,801
泰国这么小
Siam not so small.

417
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:37,429
看，英国在这
Well, wait. Let me show you England.

418
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,682
看到了吗？它比泰国还小呢
See? It is even smaller than Siam.

419
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:46,855
以前对我来说
泰国只是地图上的小白点
Before I came here,
Siam was just that little white spot to me.

420
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:51,235
但是到这几个月后，已经不是
我想象的那个样子了
Now that I've been here many months
it has become far more than that

421
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:55,405
因为我现在已经喜欢上了这个国家
because I've met the people of Siam,
and I'm learning to understand them.

422
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,574
你喜欢我们吗
You like us, Mrs. Anna?

423
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,410
是的，我很喜欢
Yes, I like you very much.

424
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:02,371
非常喜欢
Very much, indeed.

425
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:05,916
有句很古老的谚语
<i>It's a very ancient saying,</i>

426
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,627
现在能表达我的心情
<i>But a true and honest thought,</i>

427
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:11,296
如果你们当了老师
<i>That if you become a teacher,</i>

428
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,424
教你们的学生
<i>By your pupils you'll be taught,</i>

429
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:18,428
作为老师我也在学习
<i>As a teacher I've been learning</i>

430
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:26,103
如果我有不对请原谅我
<i>And I've now become an expert,</i>

431
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:31,316
现在我最喜欢做的事
<i>On the subject I like most,</i>

432
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:34,611
了解你们
Getting to know you.

433
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,949
了解你们
<i>Getting to know you,</i>

434
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:43,453
了解你们所有的人
<i>Getting to know all about you.</i>

435
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,999
喜欢你们
<i>Getting to like you,</i>

436
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:50,752
希望你们喜欢我
<i>Getting to hope you like me.</i>

437
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,965
越是了解你们
<i>Getting to know you,</i>

438
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:56,884
我就越喜欢你们
<i>Putting it my way,</i>

439
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,304
越是喜欢
<i>but nicely,</i>

440
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:03,348
你们就象是我
<i>You are precisely</i>

441
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:06,018
杯中的茶
<i>My Cup of tea!</i>

442
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:11,273
越是了解你们
<i>Getting to know you,</i>

443
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:15,861
越感觉轻松自在
<i>Getting to feel free and easy.</i>

444
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,156
当我跟你们在一起时
<i>When I am with you,</i>

445
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:23,368
我就想说话
<i>Getting to know what to say,</i>

446
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:26,955
你们没注意到吗？
<i>Haven't you noticed?</i>

447
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:31,585
我突然感到欢快轻松
<i>Suddenly I'm bright and breezy</i>

448
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:38,091
因为我从你们身上
<i>Because of all the beautiful and new things</i>

449
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,094
学到了很多美丽的东西
<i>I'm learning about you</i>

450
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,098

00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,862
逐渐喜欢上你们

了解你们
<i>Getting to know you,</i>

457

每天不断发现你们的魅力

458
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:15,295
你们就象
<i>You are precisely</i>

00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:18,298
我杯里的茶

00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:07,134
哦，糟了，我们应上地理课
Goodness, this started out
to be a geography lesson.

493
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:09,553
快点，我们来上课
Quickly, let's get back to work.

494
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:17,811
快点
Shh! Shh! Shh!

495
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,191
那个绿色的是什么？
- Now...
- What is that green up there?

496
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:25,027
那是挪威
That is Norway.

497
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,112
挪-威
Nor... way.

498
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:29,406
挪-威
Nor... way.

499
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,950
挪威是个非常冷的国家
Norway is a very cold place.

500
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,036
有时因为太冷.
Sometimes it is so cold,

501
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,163
湖水和江河都结了冰…
that the lakes and rivers freeze

502
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:39,374
那时候就可以在冰上行走
and the water becomes so hard
that you can walk on it.

503
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,084
走在冰上
Walk on water?

504
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:42,878
是的，在冰上走
Yes, walk on water.

505
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,838
听上去不太可能
How is it possible?

506
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,256
有那么硬的水吗
Hard water?

507
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:50,385
知道吗，雨水冰冻的时候
Not only that, but the raindrops
change into small white spots

508
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:51,929
就会成为蕾丝状
that look like lace.

509
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,264
那就是雪
And this is called "snow."

510
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:55,933
雪
Snow.

511
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,935
蕾丝状
Spots of lace!

512
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:02,022
是的，殿下。雨从空中降落的途中就会变成雪
Yes, Your Highness. The water freezes
on its way down from the sky.

513
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,316
我才不相信有雪这种东西
I do not believe such thing as snow.

514
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:07,778
我也不相信有雪
And I do not believe such thing as snow.

515
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,405
我不相信泰国有这么小…
And I do not believe Siam is this big.

516
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:12,407
外国却那么大
And other country so big.

517
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:16,286
我们是世界上最大的国家
- Siam is biggest country in world!
- Siam!

518
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:22,292
什么
What, what, what?

519
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:28,799
这就是科学式的教学吗？
How can schoolroom be so unscientific?

520
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:32,886
陛下，他们不理解我在说什么
Well, Your Majesty,
we had a little misunderstanding.

521
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:34,805
我在解释什么是雪
I was trying to describe snow

522
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:37,808
他们竟然不相信有这种东西
and they refused to believe
there is such a thing.

523
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:40,727
雪？
Snow?

524
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:43,313
雪
Snow.

525
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:45,232
从山上落下来的
From mountaintop.

526
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:46,650
从天空落下，陛下
From sky, Your Majesty.

527
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,152
从天空落到山上然后再落下来
From sky to mountaintop.

528
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:50,988
对，陛下
That's right, Your Majesty.

529
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:53,740
我在照片里见过的
I remember. I see pictures of Switzerland.

530
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:56,869
瑞士笼罩在雪里一片洁白
Land all white with snow.

531
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:01,081
你们为什么不相信
Who does not believe this?

532
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:03,834
陛下，因为他们没有亲眼见过
Well, after all, they've never seen it.

533
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:06,003
没有见过
Never seen?

534
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:10,465
如果只相信见过的事物，就不需要学校了
If they believe only what they see,
why do we have schoolroom? Rise!

535
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:15,512
站起来，要相信老师的话…
Never let me hear
of not believing schoolteacher

536
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:20,100
她是我专程从英国请来的…
whom I have bring here at high expense.

537
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,478
每个月要付20磅
Twenty pounds each month.

538
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,900
20英镑
Twenty English pounds.

539
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,860
坐下
Sterling!

540
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:31,778
站起来
Rise!

541
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:34,781
这是为你们个人.
I command all of you

542
00:43:34,865 --> 00:43:38,660
和国家着想…
to make most of this opportunity
for expensive education.

543
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:41,955
所以别浪费了这么贵的上课费…
For sake of selves and country.

544
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:44,374
为了自己也是为了国家
Furthermore, it is...

545
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:47,294
什么，什么，不是我给你的书吧
What, what, what?
This is not study book I have provide.

546
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:50,047
不，陛下，是我的书
No, Your Majesty, it's one of mine.

547
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:52,883
我给她的
那本书是叫什么
- I gave it to Tuptim.
- The name! You tell me!

548
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:56,220
是汤姆叔叔的小屋
<i>Is calledThe Small House of Uncle Thomas.</i>

549
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:59,681
作者是美国的斯陀夫人
ls by American lady, Harriet Beecher Stowe.

550
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,309
一个女人也可以写书？
A woman has written a book?

551
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:05,646
汤姆叔叔的小屋，是本很优秀的作品
<i>Uncle</i> Tom's <i>Cabin.</i>
A wonderful book, Your Majesty.

552
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:08,565
是批评美奴隶制的
All about the evils of slavery in America.

553
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:11,735
林肯先生也是反对派的
President Lincoln of America
against slavery, no?

554
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:13,570
没错，陛下
Very definitely, Your Majesty.

555
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:15,239
我也不喜欢
Me too.

556
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:17,783
奴隶制很不好
Slavery very bad thing.

557
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:23,247
林肯为了解放奴隶而战，仍被人们喝彩
Mr. Lincoln is fighting a war,
even now, to set the slaves free.

558
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:25,249
你认为他很了不起
You admire him for this?

559
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:26,959
是的，陛下
Very much, Your Majesty.

560
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,837
他不怕吃苦.
He seems to be a fine man
who has studied hard

561
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,880
独自学习
and educated himself.

562
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,925
这点您就比他差点了
In that, he is not unlike yourself.

563
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:42,516
你认为他打赢之后赢得了总统的职位？
Shall Mr. Lincoln be winning this war
he is fighting at present?

564
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:44,351
我不这么认为
No one knows, really.

565
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:48,105
他有足够的枪和大象来运输
Does he have enough guns and elephants
for transporting same?

566
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:52,442
在美国是没有大象的，陛下
I don't think they have elephants
in America, Your Majesty.

567
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:54,528
没有大象？没有
- No elephants?
- No.

568
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:56,697
那他一定输定了
No wonder he's not winning war.

569
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:01,201
好了，孩子们，该上课了
All right, children, you may be seated now.

570
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:09,084
安娜夫人
什么事，裘雷拉汗
- Mrs. Anna?
- Yes, Your Highness?

571
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:11,336
我不明白
I do not understand

572
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,923
当主人解放奴隶之后…那些奴隶该怎么办呢
how slaves can be set free
if their masters wish to keep them.

573
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,302
必要时要执行法律
It's done by the passing of a law

574
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,971
强制性执行
and by the enforcing of that law,
if necessary.

575
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:22,890
但是如果我有奴隶
But my slaves

576
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:24,892
或者是父皇有奴隶…
and the slaves of my father...

577
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:28,312
而我们又反对这种法律该怎么办呢
Suppose there was such a law in Siam
and we did not want it so?

578
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:33,400
有时应该抑制欲望选择正确的
Sometimes things can't be just
a question of what we want, Highness,

579
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,902
这才是真正的为王之道
but of what is right.

580
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:46,163
对的
Ha.

581
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:53,253
好了，现在你们可以休息吃午饭了
I think perhaps we had better call
recess until after luncheon.

582
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:54,796
你们可以回去
You may be excused.

583
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:19,279
年轻的皇太子会
Young prince has healthy respect

584
00:46:19,363 --> 00:46:21,448
更认真地考虑人民的事
for ways of his own people.

585
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:23,909
有时甚至会超过国王
Sometimes more than king.

586
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:28,205
他是位思想很细致
Prince Chulalongkorn is a fine boy
with a keen and probing mind.

587
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,875
有强烈探索心的孩子
But he still has much to learn,
Your Excellency.

588
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:35,712
今后的教育，对他有重要的作用.
What is important for him to learn

589
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:38,257
不，我不认为这个教室对他有作用
I do not think he'll find
in this classroom.

590
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:42,386
这么说你是反对我来这教书了
I'm fully aware that you do not
approve of my coming to Siam.

591
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:45,472
你怎么看不出来呢
Why are you so blind?
Have you no eyes to see?

592
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:48,141
国王是向不可能挑战
King tries impossible task

593
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:51,270
讲究科学，讲究现代化
wishing to be scientific man
who learn all modern things.

594
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,438
我认为他有崇高的理想
I think it a fine ambition.

595
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:56,984
继承了父王的强大意志，不可能轻易改变
Inside him is strong king like
his father, who cannot change.

596
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,029
如果过于勉强导致灭亡
He will only tear himself in two, trying
to be something he can never be.

597
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:03,323
就得不偿失了
Of course he can never be

598
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:06,076
当然他需要身边的人协助,你说不是吗
if those closest to him
are unwilling to help him.

599
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,370
你根本不之道国王在想什么,你又能做些什么
You do not know king
as well as you think you do.

600
00:47:09,872 --> 00:47:12,457
你永远相信你有过人的智慧
You believe you have
great influence over him.

601
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:15,752
反正你也会成为国王的奴隶
You will end up as his slave
like all the others.

602
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:16,920
我…
I...

603
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:45,616
来了，请等一下
Yes, yes. Just a moment.

604
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:55,042
国王？
The king?

605
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:57,377
在这个时候
At this hour of the night?

606
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:03,425
好，那就先等我换件衣服吧
Well, I trust His Majesty won't object
if I put some clothes on first.

607
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:15,187
你召我来吗，陛下
You sent for me, Your Majesty?

608
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:23,487
陛下
Your Majesty.

609
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:33,372
原来陛下在看圣经
Oh, Your Majesty is reading
the Bible.

610
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,377
安娜夫人
Mrs. Anna,

611
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:41,338
我觉得摩西这个人实在是笨极了
I think your Moses
shall have been a fool.

612
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,173
摩西？
Moses?

613
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:46,760
摩西，摩西，摩西
我认为他是个大傻瓜
Moses, Moses, Moses.
I think he shall have been a fool.

614
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:49,263
他说.
Here it stands written by him

615
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:52,516
世界是在六天内造成的简直是开玩笑
that the world was created
in six days.

616
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:54,685
我们都知道…
Now you know and I know

617
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:57,604
这是经过几百万年演化而成的
that it took many ages
to create world.

618
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:01,191
他真是个没知识的人才这么写
I think he shall have been a fool
to have written so.

619
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:03,360
你看呢
What is your opinion?

620
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:07,739
国王陛下半夜三更的把我叫来，就是为了这件事
Is that why Your Majesty sent for me
at this hour of the night?

621
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,951
没理由，在讲重要事之前，还是先谈摩西
That is not reason, but first
I wish to discuss Moses.

622
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:13,537
你去哪寻求真实呢
Now, how am I ever to learn truth

623
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,707
如果每本书上写的都不一样的话
if different English books
state different things?

624
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:23,213
圣经不是一本科学化的书,是由信仰完成的
The Bible was not written by men
of science, but by men of faith.

625
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:27,009
他们只是在颂扬神创造的奇迹
It was their explanation
of the miracle of creation,

626
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:31,263
问题不在于几天还是几个世纪造成的
which is the same miracle whether
it took six days or many centuries.

627
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,816
我还是认为摩西是个大笨蛋
I still think your Moses
shall have been a fool.

628
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:45,736
你高兴怎么认为就怎么认为好了
As you wish, Your Majesty.

629
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:47,779
请问还有别的事吗
Now, was there something else?

630
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:49,239
写信
Take letter.

631
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,367
写信？ 现在？
A letter? Now?

632
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,495
现在写，现在的事情现在就做
Now. When else?
Now is always best time.

633
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:59,416
我要寄给有科学精神的林肯先生
Take letter to Mr. Lincoln of America,
who is very scientific ruler.

634
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:02,920
好吧，陛下
Very well, Your Majesty.

635
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,506
"受全宇宙…
<i>From Phra Mama Mongut,</i>

636
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:09,593
"最高权利祝福的…

super agency in the world

637

"泰国国王，君临天下
of the whole universe,
the king of Siam.

638
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:18,393

Sovereign of all tributary countries
adjacent and in every direction,

639
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:21,021
等等，等等"
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

640
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:25,442
你不尊敬国王吗
Do you not have any respect for me?

641
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,654
为什么你站着比我的头还高呢
Why do you stand over my head?

642
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:31,281
任何时间都不许站在我面前
I cannot stand all the time.

643
00:50:31,782 --> 00:50:35,118
在这个国家，是不允许低头看国王的
And in this country no one's head
shall be higher than king's.

644
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:39,623
你必须像我其他的臣下一样…
From now on in presence, you shall
so conduct like all other subjects.

645
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,292
你是要我趴在地上
You mean, on the floor?

646
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:44,461
所有的人都是这么做的
All subjects do so.

647
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:46,505
非常抱歉，陛下
I'm very sorry.

648
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:50,217
我最多只能把头低下
I shall try my best not to let my head
be higher than Your Majesty's,

649
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:53,053
可我拒绝趴在地上
but I simply cannot
grovel on the floor.

650
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:56,139
因为那样我就无法写信了
I couldn't possibly
work that way, or think.

651
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:05,816
你是个顽固的女人.
You are very difficult woman!

652
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:07,860
也许如此，陛下
Perhaps so, Your Majesty.

653
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:10,571
总之我不许你低头看我
But observe care that head
shall not be higher than mine.

654
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:14,366
我坐下时你也得坐下，我跪下时你也得跪下…
When I shall sit, you shall sit!
When I shall kneel, you shall kneel.

655
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:17,160
等等，等等
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera!

656
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:21,206
遵命，陛下
Very well, Your Majesty.

657
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:24,251
这算是承诺吗
Is promise?

658
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:30,507
是承诺
很好
- Is promise.
- Good.

659

"美利坚合众国的…

00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:06,270
林肯
Lincoln!

681
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:07,646
大象
Elephants!

682
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:10,649
半夜叫我趴在地上
Groveling on the floor
at 2:00 in the morning.

683
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:13,110
夫人，我是伦塔
I am Lun Tha.

684
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:15,821
你是家庭教师安娜夫人吗
You are Mrs. Anna, schoolteacher?

685
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:18,115
是的，可这禁止男人进入
Yes, but you shouldn't be...

686
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:21,243
我非常想见达布提求求你了
I must meet with Tuptim again.
Please!

687
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:23,745
你们以前在这见过面？
You have been seeing her here?

688
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,747
见过两次
Twice we have spoken.

689
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:28,125
但戒备森严
Each time it becomes more difficult.

690
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,210
她说过，你可以帮我们
She has said you will help us.

691
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:32,546
不，不行
Oh, no, I couldn't!

692
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:34,173
那样做太危险了
It's much too dangerous.

693
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:36,508
我很为你们的安全担心
Not for me, but for Tuptim and you.

694
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:40,929
在男人的禁地如被发现就活不了了，马上离开
You'll be killed if they find you in
the City of Women. You must leave!

695
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:45,392
与其痛苦的活着,还不如死了算了
求你了，安娜夫人
Death is not worse pain than
empty life. Please, Mrs. Anna.

696
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:48,103
抱歉
I'm sorry, Lun Tha.

697
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:50,189
我不能帮你的忙
There's nothing I can do.

698
00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:10,959
你等着
Wait there.

699
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:15,399
达布提
Tuptim.

700
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:17,818
伦塔
Oh, Lun Tha.

701
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:20,320
我已经无法再忍耐
Seeing you this way is not enough.

702
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,157
但是我们又能怎么样呢
There is nothing we can do.

703
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:29,037
随时都有人监视着我
I am watched too closely.

704
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:34,084
难道我们要永远这样下去吗
Must we go on forever
hiding our love like this?

705
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:42,009
在黑暗中拥吻
<i>We kiss in a shadow</i>

706
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:47,055
避开明亮的月光
<i>We hide from the moon,</i>

707
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:49,933
相逢之期渺茫
<i>Our meetings are few</i>

708
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:55,063
时光飞逝
<i>and over too soon.</i>

709
00:55:57,107 --> 00:56:01,945
我们耳语
<i>We speak in a whisper,</i>

710
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:05,949
害怕被偷听
<i>Afraid to be heard;</i>

711
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:09,870
害怕见到人影
<i>When people are near,</i>

712
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:14,583
不敢说话
<i>We speak not a word.</i>

713
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:21,757
一些其他的事情
<i>Alone in our secret,</i>

714
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,552
保守着我们的秘密
<i>Together we sigh</i>

715
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:29,515
等待
<i>for one smiling day</i>

716
00:56:29,598 --> 00:56:35,646
我们相逢的那天
<i>to be free,</i>

717
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:42,027
为了在阳光下亲吻
<i>To kiss in the sunlight,</i>

718
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:46,990
以响彻云霄的声音呐喊
<i>And say to the sky:</i>

719
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:50,244
"相信我们的爱"
<i>Behold and believe</i>

720
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:56,333
永远相信
<i>what you see!</i>

721
00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:59,378
'爱我"
<i>Behold</i>

722
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:04,007
我爱的人
<i>how my lover</i>

723
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:10,722
爱我
<i>loves me!</i>

724
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:16,645
什么时候我们才能成为那样呢？
When will we be together, Tuptim?

725
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:17,855
什么时候？
When?

726
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:20,148
恐怕永远都无法实现…
It can never be, Lun Tha.

727
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:22,192
永远不会
Not ever.

728
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:30,075
在阳光下拥吻
<i>To kiss in the sunlight</i>

729
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:35,122
以响彻云霄的声音呐喊
<i>And say to the sky:</i>

730
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:37,958
"相信我们的爱"
<i>Behold and believe</i>

731
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:43,005
永远相信
<i>What you see!</i>

732
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:47,134
爱我
<i>Behold</i>

733
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:53,390
我爱的人
<i>how my lover</i>

734
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:59,980
"爱我"
<i>loves me!</i>

735
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:12,576
你得走了
You must go now.

736
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:15,913
我再不回去就要被发现，那就麻烦了
I will be missed, and they will
start searching for me.

737
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,753
总有一天我要带你离开这的
When I return, it will be
to take you from here.

738
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:25,881
那是不可能的
There is no way, Lun Tha.

739
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:28,550
我们从河上逃走
There is a river. There are boats.

740
00:58:28,634 --> 00:58:30,010
我会寻找路线的
I will find a way.

741
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:32,596
如果可能的话
Oh, if it could only be.

742
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,599
绝对有可能
It will be. I swear this.

743
00:58:35,933 --> 00:58:38,435
等我安排好了，就来通知你
When all is arranged,I will get word to you.

744
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:42,064
我为你祈祷
I shall pray, Lun Tha.

745
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:53,992
当你再看到这种花落的时候
If you see a chaba flower in your
path, broken like this,

746
00:58:54,076 --> 00:58:57,329
就是我来接你的信号，记住
it will be the sign that
I have come for you. Watch for it.

747
00:58:58,163 --> 00:58:59,790
我会准备好等着你
I will be ready.

748
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:33,407
停下，停下，停下
Stop, stop, STUD!

749
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,994
陛下
什么事
- Your Majesty.
- What, what, what?

750
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:40,455
什么事
Well?

751
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:43,625
去年割让领土给法国
When Siam's richest province
was stolen by France,

752
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:46,795
我有不安的预感
I warned it was only
beginning of Western treachery.

753
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:51,258
再这样下去
If enemies of ours,
with lies such as this

754
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:54,595
英国也会象这样侵占我们的领土了
can convince British that you are
unfit to be ruler of Siam,

755
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:58,599
我国将会成为侵略者的食饵
our seas will soon be thick
with ships, greedy for conquest.

756
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:03,270
如果真是那样
So it has finally come.

757
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:06,315
后果将不堪设想
We must act quickly.

758
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:08,859
可我们应该怎么办
But how? Where?

759
01:00:09,776 --> 01:00:11,153
这时我应该
I must think.

760
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:13,405
冷静的和科学性的思考
Clearly. Scientifically.

761
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:15,365
我必须思考
I must think.

762
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:20,370
可他们这样，我无法思考
But how can I think
while being driven out of mind!

763
01:00:22,915 --> 01:00:27,586
灿烂的阳光
<i>A charm from the skies</i>

764
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:33,133
慈祥的抚慰着我们
<i>Seems to hallow us there</i>

765
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:37,930
无论我们在哪
<i>Which seek through the world,</i>

766
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:45,062
都会照射我们
<i>ls ne'er met with elsewhere.</i>

767
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:48,941
真是好极了，可以打满分
That was splendid. Very effective.

768
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:51,902
现在…
Now...

769
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:56,990
早安，陛下
你教这样的课
- Good morning.
- You think you teach king lesson!

770
01:00:57,074 --> 01:01:00,285
我无法付你高薪
This is one lesson you do not
be paid for teaching!

771
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:05,999
我不允许你教我的孩子甜蜜的家这类的书
You will stop instructing wives
and children in"Home <i>Sweet</i> House"

772
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:09,878
你总是在提醒我，没有兑现承诺，等等
in order to remind me of breaking
promises I never make, et cetera.

773
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:14,508
陛下.我在这无法养育我的儿子
Your Majesty, I do not intend to have
my boy brought up in a harem.

774
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:18,345
你答应过在皇宫旁边给我建一座房子
You did promise me a house.
"A brick residence adjoining the palace."

775
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:22,766
你在信中答应过的
我不记得有过这种事
- Those were your very words.
- I do not remember such words!

776
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:25,435
我还记得
我记得
- I remember them.
- I will do remembering!

777
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,771
在这谁是国王
Who is king here?

778
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:32,192
我提醒你,我要你记住
我不记得什么承诺
I remind you so you remember that.
I do not remember any promises.

779
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:35,946
我不记得任何事,因为你是我的仆人
I do not remember anything
except that you are my servant.

780
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:39,241
不，陛下
Oh, no, Your Majesty.

781
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:40,826
什么
What, what, what?

782
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:43,954
记住，你只是我的仆人而已
I said, you are my servant!

783
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:48,292
不，陛下，不是，我不是你的仆人
No, Your Majesty, that is not true.
I am most certainly not your servant!

784
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:51,170
如果你不照约定给我房子的话…
If you do not give me
the house you promised,

785
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:53,380
我就立刻回英国去
I shall be forced
to return to England.

786
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,924
不，不，安娜夫人
No! No! Please, Mrs. Anna.

787
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,468
我们相信老师
Please. We believe schoolteacher!

788
01:01:58,552 --> 01:02:00,304
我们相信有雪
I believe in snow!

789
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:02,097
请挽留她
Do not let her go away.

790
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:04,933
我绝对不允许有人反抗我
I let her do nothing
that is not my pleasure.

791
01:02:05,017 --> 01:02:07,978
你必须留在这…
It is my pleasure that you stay here!

792
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:11,398
必须留在皇宫里不许；离开
In palace! In palace!

793
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:13,150
不，陛下
No, Your Majesty.

794
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:18,030
你怎么忍心丢下这些孩子不管呢
Why do you wish
to leave these children,

795
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:21,575
他们是多么的喜欢你，女教师
all of whom are loving you
so extraordinarily?

796
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:26,371
我当然不希望离开他们，我也很喜欢他们
I do not wish to leave them. I love
them too, quite extraordinarily.

797
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:29,708
可我无法留在一个不守信用的国家
I cannot stay where a promise
has no meaning.

798
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:30,918
请你说话放尊重点…
I will hear no more!

799
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:33,754
你说想要把泰国发展成为
A land where there is a wish
for Siam

800
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:36,173
一个现代的国家
to take her place
in the modern world,

801
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:40,844
你只是嘴上说说而已，实际上还是保持着旧态
but where everything still remains
according to the wishes of the king!

802
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:43,055
你应该听我的
You will say no more! No more!

803
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:46,558
我不会再说什么了，该说的我都说了
I will say no more, because
there is no more to say!

804
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:47,893
我们走，路易
Come, Louis.

805
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:51,647
退下
Out, out, out!

806
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:21,760
是谁
Who is it?

807
01:03:21,844 --> 01:03:24,346
是我，张妃
Mrs. Anna, it is I, Lady Thiang.

808
01:03:25,055 --> 01:03:27,432
请进来，张妃
Oh, well, come in, Lady Thiang.

809
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:34,815
安娜夫人，请立刻去向国王报道
Mrs. Anna, you must
go to king at once.

810
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:37,276
为什么要那样做呢？
Indeed? And why must I?

811
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:40,070
我的任务已经完成了,打算坐下班船回英国
I plan to leave on the next sailing.

812
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:41,822
求求你了，安娜夫人
Please, Mrs. Anna.

813
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:44,491
是他派你来说服我的
Did he send you here to ask me?

814
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:46,994
不，是我自己来的
No. It is I who ask you.

815
01:03:47,744 --> 01:03:50,873
国王现在正面临困境
King is in terrible distress,
not knowing where to turn.

816
01:03:50,956 --> 01:03:52,249
困境
Distress?

817
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:58,005
他得到一封新加坡寄给英国政府的信
Agents in Singapore have found copies
of letters to British government

818
01:03:58,088 --> 01:04:01,133
说泰国国王是野蛮人…
which describe king as barbarian

819
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:05,846
应该归英国管才对
and suggest necessity
of making Siam a protectorate.

820
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:08,557
哦，怎么能那样
Oh, but that is outrageous!

821
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,895
虽然国王有很多缺点,可他并不是野蛮人
The king is many things I dislike,
but he is not a barbarian.

822
01:04:12,978 --> 01:04:14,771
你答应帮他了？
Then you will go to him now?

823
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:17,357
你是要我提供意见给他
You mean, to advise him?

824
01:04:18,192 --> 01:04:20,944
不是建议
It must not sound like advice.

825
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:23,739
国王不需要任何意见
King cannot take advice.

826
01:04:23,822 --> 01:04:28,285
你自己向他提出这件事
And he will not bring up subject.
You must do it for him.

827
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:34,791
不行，张妃,我也有自己的立场
No, Lady Thiang, I can't.
It's against all my principles.

828
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:38,128
他需要帮助，安娜夫人
He needs help, Mrs. Anna.

829
01:04:38,295 --> 01:04:40,130
你可以帮他
Oh, but he has you.

830
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:43,967
我无法胜任这个重任
I am not equal to his special needs.

831
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:51,391
不行，张妃
Please, Lady Thiang, I simply cannot
go to him, especially without

832
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:52,851
何况他本人没有求我
his having asked for me.

833
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:56,313
你还要我说什么呢？
What more can I say to you?

834
01:04:57,814 --> 01:05:02,569
他是个很用心思考的人
<i>This is a man
who thinks with his heart,</i>

835
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:07,824
虽然有时欠缺思考
<i>His heart is not always wise.</i>

836
01:05:08,617 --> 01:05:12,913
即使绊倒了
<i>This is a man who stumbles and falls.</i>

837
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:18,418
也会再试的
<i>But this is a man who tries.</i>

838
01:05:19,503 --> 01:05:24,591
请原谅他的过错
<i>This is a man you'll forgive and forgive,</i>

839
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:28,095
帮帮他
<i>and help and protect,</i>

840
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:35,185
只要你活着
<i>as long as you live.</i>

841
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:50,534
他就不会说
<i>He will not always say</i>

842
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:55,706
即使他没有遵守承诺
<i>What you would have him say,</i>

843
01:05:56,373 --> 01:06:00,627
可他会说些别的
<i>But now and then he'll say</i>

844
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:06,717
来讨你的欢心
<i>something wonderful.</i>

845
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:13,307
让你忘掉不快
<i>The thoughtless things he'll do</i>

846
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:18,437
忘掉对你的伤害
<i>will hurt and worry you.</i>

847
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:23,775
他会做的很好
<i>Then all at once he'll do</i>

848
01:06:23,859 --> 01:06:29,281
他有几千个
<i>something wonderful.</i>

849
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:34,578
无法实现的梦
<i>He has a thousand dreams</i>

850
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:38,957
你知道
<i>that won't come true,</i>

851
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:44,588
他很相信他们
<i>You know that he believes in them,</i>

852
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:47,841
那样对你够了
<i>And that's enough</i>

853
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:52,888
如果他错了
<i>for you</i>

854
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:59,436
有你在他身后
<i>You'll always go along,</i>

855
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:04,816
告诉他错了
<i>Defend him when he's wrong,</i>

856
01:07:05,943 --> 01:07:09,780
当需要时提醒他
<i>And tell him when he's strong,</i>

857
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:16,328
他会很出色的
<i>He is wonderful.</i>

858
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:22,709
他一直需要你的爱
<i>He'll always need your love,</i>

859
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:30,259
他要得到你的爱
<i>And so he'll get your love.</i>

860
01:07:31,802 --> 01:07:38,141
一个需要你爱的男人
<i>A man who needs your love</i>

861
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:42,604
会的
<i>can be</i>

862
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:49,319
会很出色
<i>wonderful.</i>

863
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:23,353
陛下
Your Majesty.

864
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:25,439
你是来道歉的
You have come to apologize.

865
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:28,483
对不起，陛下--
这样就足够了
- I am sorry, Your Majesty, but...
- Good! You apologize.

866
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,652
我并没有说-
我原谅你了
- I didn't say...
- I accept.

867
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:34,406
谢谢你.陛下
Thank you, Your Majesty.

868
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:38,035
是吗？
Well?

869
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:40,746
如你所见，我正在想一些事情
Do you not see I am occupied?

870
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,082
考虑一些重要的问题
My mind on very important matters.

871
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:49,713
有什么事情愿意告诉我吗？
Anything you wish to discuss with me?

872
01:08:54,218 --> 01:08:57,054
我是不会对女人谈政治的？
Why should I discuss important matter with woman?

873
01:08:57,137 --> 01:09:00,682
很好，陛下，那么晚安了
Very well, Your Majesty. In that case
I shall say good night.

874
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:02,601
晚安！
Good night!

875
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:13,695
陛下
Your Majesty...

876
01:09:13,904 --> 01:09:15,489
什么事？什么事？什么事？
我很好奇
- What, what, what?
- I wonder...

877
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:18,450
今天有艘船从新加坡来--
新加坡，是的
- When the boat came from Singapore...
- Singapore!

878
01:09:18,534 --> 01:09:21,411
带来什么消息吗？
消息！
- Was there any news from abroad?
- News!

879
01:09:21,787 --> 01:09:23,163
当然有了
There were news!

880
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:26,625
他们居然说我是野蛮人！
谁？
- They call me barbarian.
- Who?

881
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:29,878
他们正想利用这个籍口来侵略我们
Parties who would use this
as excuse to steal my country.

882
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:32,339
如果你是英国女王的话…
Now suppose
you are Queen Victoria,

883
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:36,176
有人说泰国是个野蛮的国家，你会信么？
and someone say to you king of Siam
is barbarian. Do you believe?

884
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,428
陛下--
你会
- Well, Your Majesty...
- You will!

885
01:09:38,512 --> 01:09:43,141
如果所有的人都是这么说的话
You will believe I am because
there is no one to speak otherwise.

886
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:45,060
但这是个谎言
Oh, but this is a lie!

887
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:47,437
这是个天大的谎言！
It is a false lie!

888
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:58,907
陛下，你打算怎么办？
What have you decided
to do about it?

889
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:09,501
你猜猜看
You guess.

890
01:10:13,755 --> 01:10:14,965
好吧
Well,

891
01:10:15,174 --> 01:10:18,385
如果有人在英王面前讲了我的谎话
if someone were sending a lie
about me to England,

892
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:21,430
我会努力的将事情的真相传到英国
I would do my best to send
the truth to England.

893
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:24,308
陛下，你也会这么做吧？
Is that what you have decided to do,
Your Majesty?

894
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:27,477
是的，我是这么打算的，但是怎么做呢？
Yes, that is what I have
decided to do. But how?

895
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:31,440
但是你猜猜我现在会怎么做呢
Guess how I shall do this.

896
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:35,319
我一定是想办法
Well, my guess would be
that you would seek

897
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:38,238
与英国去亲近
some kind of personal contact
with the British.

898
01:10:38,322 --> 01:10:42,242
对了！正好可以利用在这儿访问的大使
Personal contact! When British
ambassador and party arrive in Siam...

899
01:10:42,326 --> 01:10:43,952
英国大使要到这儿吗？
The ambassador, here?

900
01:10:44,203 --> 01:10:47,247
我想他会来的
他们正在做东洋的亲善访问
On quick tour of Orient.
Friendship tour, they say.

901
01:10:47,414 --> 01:10:51,502
莱杰大臣已来报告过了，那么说爱德华也会来？
I receive letters from his aide, Sir
Edward Ramsay, who accompanies him.

902
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:53,837
爱德华要来？
Edward, coming here?

903
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,633
爱德华？
"Edward"?

904
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:00,469
你这样称呼他？
You call him this?

905
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:05,224
我和爱德华是老朋友了，结婚前就认识
We are old friends. I knew him
in London before I was married.

906
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:14,358
我会对那些侵略者表示出一些想法
When they're here, I'll take
opportunity of expressing my opinion

907
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:17,152
我要让他们知道
of thieves who would try
to steal my country.

908
01:11:17,236 --> 01:11:20,614
到底谁是野蛮人，野蛮人
I will show them who is barbarian!

909
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:25,786
你的脸是怎么了？
Well, what is this face you put on?

910
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:30,832
你是不会和来宾发生冲突的吧
My guess is that you will not fight
with your distinguished visitors.

911
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:33,126
我当然不会？
是的，陛下
- I will not?
- No, Your Majesty.

912
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:36,505
我想你会举行一个盛大的宴会
You will give a banquet
in their honor.

913
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:39,967
非常热情地款待每个人让他们玩得尽兴
You will entertain them in
a particularly grand manner.

914
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:43,011
这样的话,他们就会知道你是个热心的人
You will make them all
witnesses in your favor.

915
01:11:43,095 --> 01:11:45,472
他们回到英国一定会向女王作善意的报告
They will return to England
and report to the queen

916
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:48,559
你的善意会证明你不是一个野蛮人
that you are most certainly
not a barbarian.

917
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:52,646
对！
Naturally!

918
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:58,944
太对了！当然我就是打算那么做的
Naturally! This is what
I shall have intended to do.

919
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:02,906
我想，陛下，这个时候
That's it, Your Majesty.
Stand up to them.

920
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:05,075
你得把自己最好的一面表现出来
Put your best foot forward.

921
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:09,705
不是表情，陛下
It's an expression, Your Majesty.

922
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:12,207
我的意思是你最好穿上最华丽的衣服
It means put on your best clothes,

923
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:16,003
招一些智者和美女出席
show them your most intelligent men
and most beautiful women.

924
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:20,841
但美女们如果光着脚那又会怎么样呢？
Shall it be proper for the British
to see my women without shoes?

925
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:24,845
想要加把劲改善一下也不是不可能的吧？
Shall it be proper for my women
to put their best bare feet forward?

926
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:28,765
不！我想让她们学西方贵族
No, we shall make them look
like ladies of Europe:

927
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:30,559
在脚上穿上漂亮的鞋子
Shoes on feet, dresses on bodies.

928
01:12:30,642 --> 01:12:33,687
由你来选择这些女孩子穿上洋装
You will tell me which ladies
are most like Europeans

929
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:37,316
由你来教她们西方的习惯以及礼节
and educate them in European
customs and manner for presentation.

930
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:39,693
当然，衣物也由你缝制
我缝制？
- Also, sew dresses.
- Sew dresses?

931
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:41,153
是的，女孩子们会帮你的
All women shall help.

932
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:44,031
不，陛下…我想就以贵国的
Don't you think it would
make a better impression

933
01:12:44,114 --> 01:12:46,700
服装和礼仪来迎接…
in their own manner and dress?

934
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:51,121
你说怎么样呀？我们是泰国人，一眼就看得明白
You are not being scientific.
The ambassador knows we are Siamese.

935
01:12:51,205 --> 01:12:53,665
但是想让他们看看我们也接受西方文明
I wish him to know
we are also Europeans.

936
01:12:53,749 --> 01:12:55,709
醒醒！大家到寺庙里集合，快起床吧！
Wake up! Everybody to the temple!

937
01:12:57,294 --> 01:13:00,797
醒醒！妃子，王子，等等，等等！
Wake up, wake up, wives,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

938
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:03,217
对了，我们还可以表演戏剧、杂技什么的！
We will entertain them with acrobats.

939
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,345
就表演戏剧
We could give them
a theatrical performance.

940
01:13:06,428 --> 01:13:10,849
达布堤改编的"汤姆叔叔的小屋."
Tuptim has written a play, her own
version of Uncle Tom's <i>Cabin.</i>

941
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:14,645
我们就表演戏剧，让他们知道谁才是野蛮人
We shall give them theatricals.
We'll show them who is barbarian.

942
01:13:14,728 --> 01:13:17,481
晚餐的餐具也是西式的
We could make European dishes
for dinner.

943
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:21,693
对的，要教他们坐椅子和高脚桌子
You teach. To be served
on high table. Long white tablecloth...

944
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:23,862
桌面上还要铺白桌布
还有餐巾，用最好的丝绸
- And napkins.
- Of finest silk.

945
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:26,740
用最好的黄金筷子
筷子？
- Using best gold chopsticks.
- Chopsticks?

946
01:13:26,823 --> 01:13:30,160
不认为刀叉会更合适吗，陛下？
Don't you think knives and forks
would be more suitable?

947
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:34,206
其实英国的刀叉不如筷子科学
British not scientific enough
for the use of chopsticks.

948
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:37,626
那么就订制一些金制的刀叉
You are to order finest
gold knives and forks.

949
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:42,297
还有汤勺
你怎么会忘记汤勺呢？
Also spoons.
Why do you not think of spoons?

950
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:45,384
陛下，你可真细心
An inspired idea, Your Majesty.

951
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:48,637
噢，对了，还有雪茄
英国人很喜欢雪茄的
We mustn't forget cigars.
Englishmen are fond of them.

952
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,599
路过和在曼谷的西洋人我也会全部邀请
You are to make list of all eminent
Europeans residing in Bangkok

953
01:13:52,683 --> 01:13:55,352
让他们都来参加宴会
好文章，陛下
- for sending of invitations.
- Very well.

954
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:59,022
对，你教乐队西方人的舞蹈和…
You will instruct court musicians
their learning music of Europe

955
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:02,025
音乐怎么样,让他们都学点，等等
for dancing, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

956
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:03,610
真是好主意，陛下
Excellent, Your Majesty.

957
01:14:03,694 --> 01:14:06,029
那么我有多少时间准备这些？
How much time do I have for all this?

958
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:09,950
你还有一个星期的时间去准备
British gunboat last reported off
Singkla. This give you one week.

959
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:13,120
一个星期！陛下，只有一个星期吗？！
One week? Your Majesty, one week!

960
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:15,289
摩西他曾经说过…
In this same time,

961
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:19,209
世界是一星期造成的，这可是摩西说的
whole world was created,
Moses say.

962
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:29,219
来祈求佛祖的保护，下跪吧
First, we ask help from Buddha.

963
01:14:29,303 --> 01:14:31,346
下跪吧！
Bow to him. Bow, bow, bow.

964
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:33,724
下跪
BOW!

965
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:53,785
祈祷佛祖，请赐我智慧及力量
Oh, Buddha, give us the aid
of your strength and your wisdom.

966
01:14:54,077 --> 01:14:57,497
祈祷佛祖，请赐我智慧及力量
Oh, Buddha
give us the aid of your strength

967
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:00,834
祈祷佛祖
and your wisdom.

968
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:07,049
请赐我智慧及力量向那些英国人证明
And help us to prove
to the visiting English

969
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:11,220
我们是优秀的民族
that we are extraordinary
and remarkable people.

970
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:14,973
请帮助我们向那些英国人证明
And help us
to prove to the visiting English

971
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:19,102
我们是优秀的民族
that we are extraordinary
and remarkable people.

972
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:29,279
同时也保佑老师昼夜不休尽快将衣服赶制好
Help also Mrs. Anna to keep awake
for scientific sewing of dresses

973
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:31,698
她虽是个基督教徒
even though she be only
a woman and a Christian,

974
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:34,952
又是个一无是处的女人…
and therefore unworthy
of your interest.

975
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:37,871
但请赐给她力量
Help also Mrs. Anna...

976
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:41,625
陛下，你太过份了--
别忘了，你向我承诺过！
- Your Majesty, this is really--
- A promise is a promise.

977
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:44,211
你的头不会比我高！
Head must not be higher than mine.

978
01:15:44,795 --> 01:15:46,046
承诺！
A promise!

979
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:50,592
一无是处
...and therefore
unworthy of your interest.

980
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:55,681
佛祖
And, Buddha,

981
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:57,724
当我事成之后我承诺
I promise you

982
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:01,937
我将为这个女人
that I shall give
this unworthy woman

983
01:16:03,647 --> 01:16:05,107
建一栋房子
a house.

984
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:09,653
一栋她自己想要的
We will build her a house of her own:

985
01:16:10,988 --> 01:16:12,948
一栋房子
A brick residence

986
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:16,618
就在皇宫附近
adjoining royal palace

987
01:16:16,702 --> 01:16:18,996
正如契约上所说的
according to agreement,

988
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:22,624
等等
et cetera,

989
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:25,085
等等
et cetera,

990
01:16:25,586 --> 01:16:27,379
等等
et cetera.

991
01:16:28,922 --> 01:16:31,550
陛下
- Your Majesty...
- Oh!

992
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:33,886
为这个一无事外的女人
...this unworthy woman

993
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:35,304
建一栋房子
a house.

994
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:38,098
为她建的房子
We will build her
a house of her own.

995
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:41,476
就在皇宫附近
A brick residence
adjoining royal palace...

996
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,646
正如契约上所说的
...according to agreement...

997
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:49,234
等等
...et cetera...

998
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:54,072
等等
...et cetera...

999
01:16:55,657 --> 01:17:00,495
等等
...et cetera.

1000
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:49,044
餐巾终于送来了，谢天谢地
张妃，请把它们摆列在餐桌上
The napkins finally arrived. Would
you place them on the table please?

1001
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:51,338
谢谢
不，不必客气
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

1002
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:54,508
各位，你们都准备好了吗？
客人们就要来了
Are we ready?
The guests are arriving.

1003
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:57,177
安娜夫人，会有英国人来吗
Please, do not let
Englishmen come here.

1004
01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:58,554
好可怕呀，安娜夫人
We are afraid.

1005
01:17:58,637 --> 01:18:01,181
他们能用眼睛下咒语
They cast terrible spell
on us with evil eye.

1006
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:03,475
求求你了，安娜夫人
Oh, nonsense. Nonsense!

1007
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:05,936
别胡说了,现在，让我来看看
你们准备好了没有
Step back. Let me see how you look.

1008
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:09,189
分开站着
Stand apart.

1009
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,068
很好,转圈
Very nice. Now, turn round.

1010
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:21,285
老天！
Oh, my goodness gracious!

1011
01:18:21,535 --> 01:18:22,828
怎么啦？
What is trouble now?

1012
01:18:24,663 --> 01:18:28,750
我忘记了,她们还没内衣
Oh, I forgot! They have practically
no undergarments.

1013
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:32,546
内衣？有没有穿内衣有什么关系？
Undergarments! Of what importance
are undergarments at this time?

1014
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:34,339
穿内衣是非常重要的
Of great importance.

1015
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:36,508
那么你穿了吗？
Are you wearing undergarments?

1016
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:40,721
所有的英国妇女都会穿内衣的，陛下
All properly dressed English ladies
always wear undergarments.

1017
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:44,766
照你这么说,英国实在是太落伍了
I have opinion that, in this regard,
England is very backward nation.

1018
01:18:56,612 --> 01:18:58,780
这是你今晚出
席宴会要穿的吗？
Is this what you shall be wearing?

1019
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:01,283
是的，你喜欢吗？
Why, yes. Do you like it?

1020
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:03,994
那么…
Well...

1021
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:08,665
你这样真的没有关系吗？象这些，等等，等等？
Are you certain this is customary,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?

1022
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:13,045
你是说露出胸脯？
What is so extraordinary
about bare shoulders?

1023
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:14,713
你看，大家都露了--
- Your own ladies...
- Yes.

1024
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:16,715
但这有些不同…
But is different because
of not wearing

1025
01:19:16,798 --> 01:19:20,552
因为你其它的部位都包得很严严实实
covering-ups on other parts
of body, and therefore...

1026
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:22,221
比如说这…但只有,那又怎么样呢？
Therefore what?

1027
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:24,723
不在一样
Is different.

1028
01:19:25,349 --> 01:19:27,226
很抱歉，不能得到你的认同
I'm sorry you do not approve.

1029
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:28,602
我可没有那么说
I have not said I do not approve.

1030
01:19:31,104 --> 01:19:34,316
陛下，一定是来宾到了
The ambassador and his party
must be arriving.

1031
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:37,361
安娜夫人，他们是食人族吗
Mrs. Anna, Mrs. Anna.
They are cannibals.

1032
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:38,946
会被她们吃掉的
They will eat us!

1033
01:19:39,029 --> 01:19:41,365
没那回事
They will do nothing of the kind.

1034
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:44,785
重要的是,当打招呼时
Remember, when you are
presented to the ambassador,

1035
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:47,704
切记别让人看见背后的样子
for heaven's sake, keep your backs
to the wall.

1036
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:50,749
你们明白了吗！
So!

1037
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:54,962
陛下，他是大英帝国的代表强培大使
Your Majesty, this shall be
His Excellency, Sir John Hay,

1038
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:59,216
他特意从英国来拜访你
most honorable representative
of United Kingdom in Great Britain.

1039
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:00,759
国王陛下
Your Majesty.

1040
01:20:01,218 --> 01:20:02,594
欢迎你
I am pleased.

1041
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:07,558
抽雪茄
Cigar.

1042
01:20:08,141 --> 01:20:09,601
谢谢你，陛下
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1043
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:12,604
国王陛下，
请容我介绍莱杰副使
May I introduce my aide,
Sir Edward Ramsay.

1044
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:14,147
国王陛下
Your Majesty.

1045
01:20:14,523 --> 01:20:16,567
你好，抽雪茄
I am pleased. Cigar.

1046
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:18,193
谢谢你
Thank you.

1047
01:20:18,277 --> 01:20:20,821
啊，她是老师,安娜夫人
And this is Madame Halloweens,

1048
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:24,491
在皇宫里教英语等等的
teacher of English language,
customs, et cetera, in royal household.

1049
01:20:24,575 --> 01:20:27,119
久闻大名了，夫人
We've heard of
your splendid work here.

1050
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:29,204
谢谢，大使
Thank you, Your Excellency.

1051
01:20:29,288 --> 01:20:31,623
爱德华，好久不见了
Edward, it's so good to see you.

1052
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:33,375
你好，安娜？
How are you, Anna?

1053
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:36,086
跟我来见见我的妃子们，
来吧
Come with me. Meet royal wives.

1054
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:56,899
我的妃子们
Royal wives.

1055
01:20:58,108 --> 01:20:59,651
那张脸，是山羊脸！
He has the head of a goat!

1056
01:21:03,614 --> 01:21:05,282
邪恶的眼睛！
Evil eye!

1057
01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:07,326
邪恶的眼睛
Evil eye! Evil eye!

1058
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:08,952
邪恶的眼睛
女士们
- Evil eye!
- Ladies!

1059
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:12,039
各位请回来
噢，亲爱的
Ladies, come back!
Come back. Oh, dear.

1060
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:13,999
陛下，真抱歉出了这种事
Oh, this is dreadful.

1061
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:18,128
你为什么没有教她们还有这种“侦察”眼镜呢？
Why have you not educated them
in the British custom of spying glass?

1062
01:21:18,212 --> 01:21:20,422
她们是因为这个受了惊？
Oh, is that what started the panic?

1063
01:21:20,506 --> 01:21:23,842
真抱歉，我的妃子们实在太无礼了
I regret, sir, my ladies
have not given good impression.

1064
01:21:24,009 --> 01:21:25,177
不，国王陛下
On the contrary.

1065
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:30,307
我今天真的见识到了美妙，这么短的时间里
We have rarely received so good
an impression in so short a time.

1066
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:34,978
安娜，你的学生们真有魅力
You have attractive pupils.

1067
01:21:35,103 --> 01:21:38,440
我很想为你们介绍王子和公主们
I wish you could see
His Majesty's children.

1068
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:40,484
但他们现在已经睡了
Unfortunately, they're asleep.

1069
01:21:40,651 --> 01:21:42,653
陛下，你有几个孩子呢？
How many children do you have?

1070
01:21:42,736 --> 01:21:45,948
只有106个，因为我晚婚了
Oh, I have only 106.
I am not married very long.

1071
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:50,786
下个月，我又会增加五个的
Well, next month,
expecting five more.

1072
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:54,122
安娜，我亲爱的
Anna, my dear.

1073
01:21:55,707 --> 01:21:57,668
你比以前任何时候都要美
You're looking lovelier than ever.

1074
01:21:58,043 --> 01:22:01,255
好象丝毫没受思乡之苦的折磨
I was hoping to find you wasted
away with homesickness.

1075
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:04,842
因为英国？在那儿已经没令我思念的人了
For England?
I have no one there, Edward.

1076
01:22:05,008 --> 01:22:06,468
一个也没有
Not anymore.

1077
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:08,095
一个也没有，安娜？
No one, Anna?

1078
01:22:09,847 --> 01:22:11,181
你听？
Hear that?

1079
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:13,851
这是以前我们在里士满共舞过的曲子
We danced to that once.

1080
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:17,396
还记得吗
- Richmond. Remember?
- Mm-hmm.

1081
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:18,689
现在还跳舞吗？
Still dance?

1082
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:20,274
不常跳
Not very often.

1083
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,775
那怎么行？
You should.

1084
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:32,411
你应该还记得我曾经向你求过婚？
Do you remember I asked you
to marry me?

1085
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:36,290
是的，汤姆一直以此为豪
Of course. I never allowed Tom
to forget it.

1086
01:22:36,373 --> 01:22:39,042
我还没有完全放弃
I never learned to take defeat
like a gentleman.

1087
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:40,794
爱德华
Dear Edward.

1088
01:22:43,046 --> 01:22:47,301
我要不是想见自己心爱的人…
I didn't come to Bangkok just because
I enjoy sleeping on a gunboat

1089
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:50,179
本来还不想到这儿来…
or watching Sir John
comb his beard.

1090
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:55,809
安娜，安娜你还是那么年轻…
难道要这样进坟墓吗
Anna, Anna, you're much too young
to bury your heart in a grave.

1091
01:22:55,893 --> 01:22:59,980
不，正像你见到的那样
我现在生活得非常好
Oh, but it's not buried.
It's very much alive.

1092
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:01,648
在这里？
是的

1093
01:23:02,232 --> 01:23:04,234
他们需要我
Among people who need me.

1094
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,528
因为我能给他们带来欢乐
People I can help.

1095
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:10,657
你也可以给我带来欢乐
You could help me very much, Anna.

1096
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:23,712
你还要我再等十年吗
I see another 1O years
of waiting in those eyes.

1097
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:32,179
晚餐以后才能跳舞，先生！
Dancing, after dinner!

1098
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:35,224
抱歉，陛下，我们不禁回忆起往事
I'm afraid I couldn't resist
talking over old times.

1099
01:23:35,307 --> 01:23:37,935
尽管在这跳舞吧…
I had impression that Mrs. Anna
would help

1100
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:42,397
夫人在餐宴上还有…等等，等等的事要做呢
for seating guests at dinner table,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1101
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:45,567
现在已经很晚了！大家都站在那等她
Now it is too late.
They all stand up, waiting.

1102
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:48,362
我们最好快入席吧.安娜
In that case, we'd better
be going in, Anna.

1103
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:51,281
对，我们最好赶快入席吧…
Yes. We better be going in...

1104
01:23:55,911 --> 01:23:57,287
安娜
...Anna.

1105
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,418
我忘了
I forget.

1106
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:08,465
我先告退了，陛下
If you'll excuse me, Your Majesty.

1107
01:24:10,133 --> 01:24:11,218
好吧
Huh.

1108
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:16,807
听着，要将这些话题全说出来
Now, herewith, shall be list of
subjects you try to bring up for talk.

1109
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:21,311
我还想发表一些拿手的话题，让来宾心服口服
On such subjects I am very brilliant
and will make great impression.

1110
01:24:21,812 --> 01:24:24,022
你从摩西开始

1112
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:57,699
吃啊

1113
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:07,042
各位，我记得上次陛下谈到了有关摩西的事
His Majesty made a rather interesting
point about Moses

1114
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,294
在他读《圣经》的时候
when he was reading the Bible.

1115

噢，对了
Oh, yes. Now,

1116
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:16,510
我发现了摩西很大的一个破绽…
Moses is very fine illustration
of little-known fact

1117
01:26:16,593 --> 01:26:19,513
这是宗教与科学家
that men of faith
and men of science,

1118
01:26:19,596 --> 01:26:22,391
无法相容的一个典型的例子
by contradicting each other,

1119
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:25,602
到了最后，我总会找出一些相同的东西
always manage to arrive
at same conclusion.

1120
01:26:28,897 --> 01:26:30,023
我来跟你解释

01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:06,665
快逃离塞蒙王
<i>Run from Simon</i>

1220
01:35:06,748 --> 01:35:09,418
快逃，伊莱莎
<i>Run Eliza, run, run
Run</i>

1221
01:35:09,793 --> 01:35:11,211
依莱莎来到了河过
<i>Eliza come to river</i>

1222
01:35:11,295 --> 01:35:12,880
依莱莎来到了河过
<i>Eliza come to river</i>

1223
01:35:12,963 --> 01:35:14,006
可怜的依莱莎
<i>Poor Eliza.</i>

1224
01:35:14,464 --> 01:35:15,716
谁能拯救她？
Who can save her?

1225
01:35:16,175 --> 01:35:17,384
只有佛祖
<i>Only Buddha</i>

1226
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:18,677
请快救依莱莎吧
<i>Save her, Buddha, save her.</i>

1227
01:35:19,011 --> 01:35:21,013
佛祖显灵了？
<i>What will Buddha do?</i>

1228
01:35:29,062 --> 01:35:33,025
它显灵了
Buddha make a miracle.

1229
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:40,908
佛祖派遣天使下凡来
Buddha send an angel down.

1230
01:35:42,576 --> 01:35:47,331
天使吹起冷风时…
Angel make the wind blow cold.

1231
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:54,129
河水就冰冻起来了…
Make the river water hard.

1232
01:35:56,507 --> 01:36:01,345
已凝固得可从上面走过
Hard enough to walk upon.

1233
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:07,601
佛祖造的奇迹
Buddha make a miracle.

1234
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:14,525
赞扬佛祖
<i>Praise to Buddha</i>

1235
01:36:17,903 --> 01:36:22,908
天使教她行走的方法
Angel show her
how to walk on frozen water.

1236
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:19,756
佛祖为了这伟大的恋情
Now as token of his love...

1237
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,844
又制造了一个奇迹…
...Buddha send a new miracle.

1238
01:37:24,928 --> 01:37:29,558
赞扬佛祖
<i>Praise to Buddha</i>

1239
01:37:30,601 --> 01:37:34,188
从天上飘落的是星星
还是花朵…
Send from heaven, stars...

1240
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:36,440
赞扬佛祖
...and blossoms.

1241
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:44,448
天空中到处飘着白色的蕾丝
Look like lace upon the sky.

1242
01:37:45,782 --> 01:37:50,412
赞扬佛祖
<i>Praise to Buddha</i>

1243
01:37:50,787 --> 01:37:55,083
赞扬佛祖
<i>Praise to Buddha</i>

1244
01:37:57,252 --> 01:38:00,797
有了这些遮掩
So Eliza cross the river...

1245
01:38:00,881 --> 01:38:04,051
她平安地度过了河
...hidden by this veil of lace.

1246
01:38:06,261 --> 01:38:08,889
我忘了解释这个奇迹…
Forgot to tell you name of miracle.

1247
01:38:09,681 --> 01:38:10,807
那就是雪花
Snow!

1248
01:38:17,105 --> 01:38:20,234
忽然她看见邪恶的塞蒙王
Of a sudden, she can see
Wicked Simon of Legree...

1249
01:38:20,317 --> 01:38:24,363
随后从河上追来带着他的一大群侦探狗
...sliding cross the river fast
with his bloodhounds and his slaves.

1250
01:38:34,831 --> 01:38:36,792
河上发生了什么事呢？
What has happened to the river?

1251
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:39,628
佛祖呼唤了艳阳！
Buddha has called out the sun!

1252
01:38:39,711 --> 01:38:42,548
佛祖呼唤了艳阳！
<i>Buddha has called out the sun!</i>

1253
01:38:43,006 --> 01:38:45,759
冰很快就融化
<i>Sun has made the water soft.</i>

1254
01:38:46,301 --> 01:38:49,179
塞蒙王和他的士兵
<i>Wicked Simon and his slaves</i>

1255
01:38:49,513 --> 01:38:52,474
都沉到了河底
<i>Fall in river and are drowned.</i>

1256
01:39:03,694 --> 01:39:06,488
塞蒙王的人死在河底
Everybody celebrate death of Simon.

1257
01:39:06,572 --> 01:39:10,951
依莱莎又回到怀念的汤姆叔叔的小屋
And Eliza make happy reunion
with dear old Uncle Thomas...

1258
01:39:11,034 --> 01:39:12,953
跟可爱的伊芙
...blessed little Eva...

1259
01:39:13,036 --> 01:39:14,746
她天使般的情人
...mischief maker, Topsy...

1260
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:16,832
乔治也同行
...and faithful lover George...

1261
01:39:16,915 --> 01:39:20,419
伊莱莎天使般幸福
...who is looking like Angel to Eliza.

1262
01:39:25,841 --> 01:39:29,052
塔西因为国王的死非常高兴
<i>Topsy glad that Simon die
Topsy dance forjoy.</i>

1263
01:39:30,429 --> 01:39:35,142
后来塔西也有点反省的雨…
I tell you what Harriet Beecher Stowe
say that Topsy say:

1264
01:39:36,518 --> 01:39:41,565
"我定是世界上最坏的孩子吧"
"I specks I'se de wickedest critter
in de world."

1265
01:39:42,649 --> 01:39:43,817
但是
But...

1266
01:39:44,818 --> 01:39:48,780
但我不认为塔西不对，因为我…
...I do not believe
Topsy is wicked critter...

1267
01:39:49,281 --> 01:39:52,075
对国王也有与塔西相同的心情
...because I, too,
am glad for death of king...

1268
01:39:53,785 --> 01:39:58,832
我不喜欢折磨，像试图逃跑奴隶
...of any king who pursue a slave who
is unhappy and who tried to escape.

1269
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:02,836
陛下，我想在这告诉你
And Your Majesty,
I wish to say to you:

1270
01:40:03,629 --> 01:40:05,088
我求你…
<i>I</i> beg of you!

1271
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:13,680
陛下…
Your Majesty...

1272
01:40:15,349 --> 01:40:17,392
各位贵宾…
...and honorable guests...

1273
01:40:19,061 --> 01:40:21,396
故事快结束了
...I will tell you end of stow.

1274
01:40:22,189 --> 01:40:25,984
是个悲惨的结局，牺牲很大
Is very sad ending, with sacrifice.

1275
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:31,782
可怜的小艾芙
<i>Poor little Eva</i>

1276
01:40:32,407 --> 01:40:34,910
可怜的小艾芙
<i>Poor little Eva</i>

1277
01:40:35,536 --> 01:40:39,498
她是个不幸的孩子
<i>Poor unfortunate one</i>

1278
01:40:39,581 --> 01:40:44,002
佛祖招唤，艾芙回到身过…
ls Buddha's wish
that Eva come to him...

1279
01:40:44,086 --> 01:40:46,713
感谢拯救…
...and thank him personally...

1280
01:40:46,797 --> 01:40:50,968
依莱莎母女之恩赐
...for saving of Eliza and baby.

1281
01:40:53,262 --> 01:40:55,472
所以她死去.
And so she die...

1282
01:40:56,473 --> 01:41:00,519
回到了佛祖的身边
...and go to arms of Buddha.

1283
01:41:16,368 --> 01:41:20,539
赞扬佛祖
<i>Praise to Buddha</i>

1284
01:41:20,956 --> 01:41:25,085
赞扬佛祖
<i>Praise to Buddha</i>

1285
01:41:51,069 --> 01:41:53,947
很好，非常好，国王陛下
Very clever.
Very clever, Your Majesty.

1286
01:41:54,031 --> 01:41:56,450
实在是很有创新
Author! Author!

1287
01:43:05,602 --> 01:43:06,687
很有创意
Ah.

1288
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:09,398
陛下，就寝之前我来请示还有什么要做？
Is there anything else
before I say good night?

1289
01:43:09,481 --> 01:43:10,983
坐下，坐下
Sit, sit, sit.

1290
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:14,945
请随便吃点
Plenty for two. Eat.

1291
01:43:15,028 --> 01:43:17,197
不用了，谢谢
Oh, no, thank you.

1292
01:43:19,408 --> 01:43:21,702
叉子真是一件奇妙的餐具啊
Fork is a foolhardy instrument.

1293
01:43:23,161 --> 01:43:24,872
装满食物时就会漏下来
You pick up food, and it leaks.

1294
01:43:26,707 --> 01:43:30,752
陛下，你在宴会时的谈话真风趣
Oh, your conversation at dinner
was most amusing, Your Majesty.

1295
01:43:30,836 --> 01:43:33,964
我自己也觉得，我自己非常地有趣！
I was forced to laugh myself.
I was so funny.

1296
01:43:35,299 --> 01:43:39,511
对了，爱德华和大使也很佩服你
Before leaving, Edward confided that
the ambassador was quite impressed.

1297
01:43:41,263 --> 01:43:42,472
爱德华
Edward.

1298
01:43:43,348 --> 01:43:47,644
他们一定会向女王作善意的报告的
And he will most certainly send
a glowing report to Queen Victoria.

1299
01:43:49,813 --> 01:43:51,857
这样我也就安心了，陛下
I am so pleased, Your Majesty.

1300
01:43:53,483 --> 01:43:56,486
你做得很好
I am aware of your interest.

1301
01:43:58,530 --> 01:44:00,157
我想说…
I wish to say...

1302
01:44:00,782 --> 01:44:04,036
我想说这次的
事你帮了不少忙
...you have been of great help
to me in this endeavor.

1303
01:44:06,705 --> 01:44:08,498
这是我的一点心意
I wish to make gift.

1304
01:44:11,293 --> 01:44:12,711
你收下吧
I have hope you accept.

1305
01:44:17,132 --> 01:44:18,509
戴在你的手上
Put it on.

1306
01:44:18,592 --> 01:44:20,219
戴在你的手上
Put it on finger.

1307
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:23,972
快点戴上，快点戴上
Oh, put it on,
put it on, put it on.

1308
01:44:27,351 --> 01:44:30,854
陛下，我不知道该说些什么才好
Your Majesty,
I don't know what to say.

1309
01:44:32,898 --> 01:44:35,526
当一个人不知道
说些什么的时候
When one does not know
what to say...

1310
01:44:35,651 --> 01:44:37,861
最好是什么都别说
...it is a time to be silent.

1311
01:44:46,036 --> 01:44:48,789
现在很晚了，陛下，
如果没有别的事的话，我想--
It is late, Your Majesty.
If there's nothing else--

1312
01:44:48,872 --> 01:44:51,124
不，还有一件事
There is, there is, there is else.

1313
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:53,710
有一个好消息
Have good news to tell.

1314
01:44:54,211 --> 01:44:59,007
昨天晚上在西犹塔森林发现了白象
Yesterday, a white elephant has been
discovered in forest of Ayutthaya.

1315
01:44:59,091 --> 01:45:01,218
这是个好预兆吗，陛下
And you regard this as a good omen?

1316
01:45:01,301 --> 01:45:03,428
是的，是非常好的预兆
Yes. Very good omen.

1317
01:45:06,557 --> 01:45:08,809
什么事都将会很顺利
Everything going well with us?

1318
01:45:09,977 --> 01:45:13,689
是的，一定会这样的，陛下，我们一切进展顺利
Yes, everything going well with us.

1319
01:45:21,363 --> 01:45:23,907
达布堤，你的学生！
Tuptim, your pupil.

1320
01:45:24,658 --> 01:45:25,868
她今晚编的戏
我却觉得不太好
Her play tonight.

1321
01:45:25,951 --> 01:45:28,996
但是，陛下，来宾都很喜欢
Oh, but, Your Majesty,
everyone enjoyed it immensely.

1322
01:45:29,079 --> 01:45:33,250
让追奴隶的国王淹死这是怎么回事！
It is immoral for king to drown
when pursuing slave who deceive him.

1323
01:45:33,667 --> 01:45:35,794
这是天大的不敬！
Immoral. Immoral!

1324
01:45:37,087 --> 01:45:40,007
找到她时，得好好惩罚她一下才行
Tuptim shall hear of my displeasure
when she is found.

1325
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:41,341
找她？
Found?

1326
01:45:41,425 --> 01:45:44,261
她好像藏在宫中的某个地方…
It is believed she hides
somewhere in palace...

1327
01:45:44,344 --> 01:45:47,389
以逃避国王的不悦
...to escape king's anger and...

1328
01:45:50,976 --> 01:45:52,102
安娜，我想你应该知道点什么吧
You know something of this?

1329
01:45:53,437 --> 01:45:56,440
她是个可怜的姑娘，陛下
住在宫里有什么可怜的？！
- Only that she has been unhappy.
- Why unhappy?

1330
01:45:57,274 --> 01:45:58,609
她应该感到荣幸才对
She is in palace of king!

1331
01:46:00,444 --> 01:46:03,697
年轻的女孩，没有比这更高兴的了
What is greater honor for girl
than to be in palace of king?

1332
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:08,202
但是，陛下，你有这么多的事要做
你何必在意她呢？
Oh, but, Your Majesty, of what interest
to you is one girl like Tuptim?

1333
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,829
反正她只是你几十个女人当中的一个
In your house,
she's just another woman.

1334
01:46:10,913 --> 01:46:15,292
一个碗里的大米跟另一个碗的大米没区别
As a bowl of rice is just another bowl
of rice, no different from any other.

1335
01:46:15,375 --> 01:46:17,961
你现在是站在女人的一边了！
Now you understand about women.

1336
01:46:19,087 --> 01:46:23,133
书上写得那些爱情她们竟会当真
So many English books I read
introduce strange idea...

1337
01:46:23,217 --> 01:46:27,012
天啊，好笑极了
...of love,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1338
01:46:27,804 --> 01:46:28,972
你不赞成那些观点？
You disapprove?

1339
01:46:29,056 --> 01:46:32,768
但其实她什么也不懂
But it is a silly complication
of a pleasant simplicity.

1340
01:46:33,393 --> 01:46:36,939
女人是为了取悦男人而活的，就是这样
A woman is designed for pleasing man.
That is all.

1341
01:46:37,272 --> 01:46:40,442
众多的女人要服侍男人这才是天经地义
A man is designed to be pleased
by many women.

1342
01:46:40,526 --> 01:46:42,903
这就是你的解释吗，陛下
How do you explain the fact,
Your Majesty...

1343
01:46:42,986 --> 01:46:45,781
这个世界上还有很多的男人只娶一个妻子？
...that many men remain faithful
to one wife?

1344
01:46:46,865 --> 01:46:48,367
那是有病
They are sick.

1345
01:46:49,159 --> 01:46:51,537
只有女人得守贞操吗
But you do expect women
to be faithful.

1346
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:53,664
-那当然了
-为什么？
- Naturally.
- Well, why naturally?

1347
01:46:53,747 --> 01:46:55,624
因为这是自然的事情
Because it is natural.

1348
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,378
泰国有首这样的诗…
It is like old Siamese rhyme:

1349
01:47:00,087 --> 01:47:02,965
女人是朵花
<i>A girl must be like a blossom</i>

1350
01:47:04,383 --> 01:47:06,718
只供一个男人去采蜜
<i>with honey for just one man.</i>

1351
01:47:08,387 --> 01:47:11,473
男人是蜜蜂
<i>A man must live like honeybee</i>

1352
01:47:12,182 --> 01:47:15,018
忙碌在花丛中采取花蜜
<i>and gather all he can.</i>

1353
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:19,064
在花丛中穿来穿去
<i>To fly from blossom to blossom,</i>

1354
01:47:20,274 --> 01:47:23,068
从来不受任何阻扰
<i>A honeybee must be free,</i>

1355
01:47:23,986 --> 01:47:27,614
花朵只能静候蜜蜂的来访
<i>But blossom must not ever fly</i>

1356
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:30,868
采蜜，采蜜
<i>from bee, to bee, to bee.</i>

1357
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:36,874
陛下，我的国家就完全不同了
Oh, Your Majesty, in my
country we have a far different attitude.

1358
01:47:37,374 --> 01:47:40,294
对我们来说，一个真正快乐的男人
We believe that
for a man to be truly happy...

1359
01:47:40,377 --> 01:47:43,255
他只能一心一意爱一个女人
...he must love one woman
and one woman only.

1360
01:47:43,547 --> 01:47:45,465
这是妇人之见
This idea was invented by woman.

1361
01:47:45,549 --> 01:47:48,051
但是个很美好的念头
But it's a beautiful idea,
Your Majesty.

1362
01:47:48,135 --> 01:47:50,262
我们都是相信这个长大的
In England, we're brought up with it.

1363
01:47:50,345 --> 01:47:53,473
当年轻女孩初次参加舞会时
And by the time a young girl
goes to her first dance--

1364
01:47:53,557 --> 01:47:54,892
年轻女孩
Young girl?

1365
01:47:55,142 --> 01:47:56,643
也跳舞吗？
They dance also?

1366
01:47:56,727 --> 01:47:59,354
就像我今晚看见的那样
被不是丈夫的男人搂着跳舞？
Like tonight?
In arms of man not her husband?

1367
01:47:59,438 --> 01:48:00,856
当然了
Why, of course.

1368
01:48:00,939 --> 01:48:02,316
我绝对不允许
I would not permit.

1369
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:04,735
那真让人感到兴奋
Oh, but it's very exciting.

1370
01:48:05,444 --> 01:48:06,987
当年轻人
When you're young...

1371
01:48:07,070 --> 01:48:09,156
生平参加的第一次舞会.
...at your first dance...

1372
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:11,909
你一直都坐在一把小椅子是…
...and you're sitting
on a small gilt chair...

1373
01:48:12,242 --> 01:48:13,744
低垂着眼
...with your eyes lowered...

1374
01:48:14,995 --> 01:48:17,497
内心里一直担心会没人邀请跳舞
...terrified that you'll be
a Wallflower.

1375
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:21,460
然后忽然你看见两只黑皮鞋
And suddenly you see
two black shoes...

1376
01:48:22,753 --> 01:48:24,379
和一套白背心的人
...a white waistcoat...

1377
01:48:25,631 --> 01:48:29,092
出现了，它的脸，在诉说着
...a face. It speaks.

1378
01:48:30,302 --> 01:48:32,971
刚刚才介绍过的
<i>We've just been introduced,</i>

1379
01:48:33,055 --> 01:48:35,599
我并不认识你
<i>I do not know you well.</i>

1380
01:48:35,682 --> 01:48:40,896
但当音乐响起时，不觉的被吸引到你身边
<i>But when the music started,
something drew me to your side.</i>

1381
01:48:40,979 --> 01:48:43,524
所以一对对的男男女女
<i>So many men and girls</i>

1382
01:48:43,607 --> 01:48:46,026
手臂相挽的跳着舞
<i>Are in each other's arms,</i>

1383
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,111
它让我想到
<i>It made me think</i>

1384
01:48:48,695 --> 01:48:50,948
我们也可以
<i>we might be</i>

1385
01:48:51,573 --> 01:48:56,119
加入那个圈子
<i>similarly occupied.</i>

1386
01:48:57,412 --> 01:49:01,375
我们来跳舞吧
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

1387
01:49:02,918 --> 01:49:07,130
随着轻快的音乐，舞上云霄
<i>On a bright cloud of music shall we fly?</i>

1388
01:49:07,798 --> 01:49:10,008
我们来跳舞吧？
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

1389
01:49:10,509 --> 01:49:14,972
直跳到晚安道别前
<i>Shall we then say "goodnight"
and mean "goodbye?"</i>

1390
01:49:15,848 --> 01:49:18,183
或许
<i>Oh, perchance</i>

1391
01:49:18,267 --> 01:49:22,813
舞到最后星星消失时
<i>when the last little star
has left the sky.</i>

1392
01:49:23,313 --> 01:49:28,360
我们还能手挽着手
<i>Shall we still be together
with our arms around each other,</i>

1393
01:49:28,652 --> 01:49:32,990
你就成为我的新恋人？
<i>And shall you be my new romance?</i>

1394
01:49:33,782 --> 01:49:38,829
我早就已经有了那种预感
<i>On the clear understanding
that this kind of thing can happen,</i>

1395
01:49:38,912 --> 01:49:40,163
我们来跳舞好吗？
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

1396
01:49:40,247 --> 01:49:41,415
我们来跳舞好吗？
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

1397
01:49:41,498 --> 01:49:43,083
我们来跳舞好吗？
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

1398
01:49:56,847 --> 01:49:59,349
你为什么要停下来呢？继续跳啊，跳啊
Why do you stop?
You dance pretty. Go on.

1399
01:49:59,433 --> 01:50:03,270
陛下，我没意识到，再说了，我又不是个舞娘
Your Majesty, I didn't realize.
After all, I'm not a dancing girl.

1400
01:50:03,353 --> 01:50:06,273
在英国，没有女人会
当着一个男人的面独自跳舞
In England, no woman dances alone
while a man looks on.

1401
01:50:06,356 --> 01:50:09,026
但你们和那些不认识的男人跳舞啊
手挽着手，等等
But she dances with stranger,
holding hands?

1402
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:11,195
是的，但并不经常都是陌生人--
Yes, but not always a stranger.

1403
01:50:11,278 --> 01:50:14,448
也会有我们的好朋友
很好，那我们现在就来跳吧
- Usually a very good friend.
- Then we'll dance together.

1404
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:16,575
你来教我吧
我来和你跳，怎么样？
You show me.
Teach, teach, teach.

1405
01:50:16,658 --> 01:50:18,410
好的，那是很简单的
It's quite simple, the polka.

1406
01:50:18,493 --> 01:50:21,371
数着1，2，3，就行了.1，2，3
You count, "One, two, three,
and one, two, three...

1407
01:50:21,455 --> 01:50:23,457
1，2，3…
...and one, two, three, and..."

1408
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:24,708
我们来跳舞吧
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

1409
01:50:24,791 --> 01:50:25,959
1，2，3…
One, two, three, and.

1410
01:50:26,043 --> 01:50:29,338
随着轻快的音乐飞上云霄
<i>On a bright cloud of music shall we fly?</i>

1411
01:50:29,421 --> 01:50:30,631
1，2，3…
One, two, three, and.

1412
01:50:30,714 --> 01:50:31,882
我们来跳舞吧？
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

1413
01:50:31,965 --> 01:50:33,133
1，2，3…
One, two, three, and.

1414
01:50:33,217 --> 01:50:36,345
直跳到晚安说道别前
<i>Shall we then say "goodnight"
and mean "goodbye?"</i>

1415
01:50:36,428 --> 01:50:37,721
1，2，3…
One, two, three, and.

1416
01:50:37,804 --> 01:50:39,264
或许
<i>Oh, perchance</i>

1417
01:50:40,224 --> 01:50:43,936
舞到最后的星星消失时
<i>when the last little star has left the sky.</i>

1418
01:50:44,895 --> 01:50:49,525
我们还是在一起手挽着手
<i>Shall we still be together
with our arms around each other,</i>

1419
01:50:49,608 --> 01:50:53,403
你就会成为我的新恋人
<i>And shall you be my new romance?</i>

1420
01:50:54,321 --> 01:50:58,825
我早就意识到那会发生
<i>On the clear understanding
that this kind of thing can happen,</i>

1421
01:50:58,909 --> 01:51:00,035
我们来跳舞吧？
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

1422
01:51:00,118 --> 01:51:01,328
我们来跳舞吧？
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

1423
01:51:01,411 --> 01:51:02,913
我们来跳舞吧？
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

1424
01:51:03,622 --> 01:51:08,252
现在数1，2，3，
1，2，3--
- And one, two, three--
- One, two, three, one, two, three--

1425
01:51:08,836 --> 01:51:10,212
有点怪怪的
Something wrong.

1426
01:51:10,295 --> 01:51:12,714
我忘了节拍，下次我会记得的
I know, I forgot "and."
Next time I remember.

1427
01:51:12,965 --> 01:51:14,633
1，2，3，
1，2，3
One, two, three,
and one, two, three--

1428
01:51:15,467 --> 01:51:17,344
你跳得很好，陛下
That's splendid, Your Majesty.

1429
01:51:17,427 --> 01:51:19,137
很好，很好
Splendid, splendid!

1430
01:51:20,472 --> 01:51:22,391
你把我的节奏给弄乱了
You throw me off count!

1431
01:51:23,559 --> 01:51:28,063
1，2，3
1，2，3
And, one, two, three, and
one, two, three, and...

1432
01:51:28,897 --> 01:51:30,107
有点不对
That is not right.

1433
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:32,734
不，这样就对了
就是这样
You were doing beautifully,
Your Majesty.

1434
01:51:32,818 --> 01:51:36,530
这和今晚我看到你跟那个西方人跳的不同
No, no. Not the way I see
Europeans dancing tonight.

1435
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:39,074
不，就是这样跳的
Yes, it was. It was just like that.

1436
01:51:39,157 --> 01:51:41,785
不是这样的手好像不是这样握的
Were not holding two hands like this.

1437
01:51:47,624 --> 01:51:48,709
这…
No...

1438
01:51:50,377 --> 01:51:52,296
的确不是这样的
...as a matter of fact.

1439
01:51:53,172 --> 01:51:54,339
应该是…
Was...

1440
01:52:01,513 --> 01:52:02,973
这样，不是吗
...like this?

1441
01:52:03,891 --> 01:52:04,933
是吗？
No?

1442
01:52:06,059 --> 01:52:07,227
是的
Yes.

1443
01:52:07,311 --> 01:52:08,437
跳吧
Come.

1444
01:53:05,702 --> 01:53:07,120
来
Come.

1445
01:53:07,204 --> 01:53:08,497
我们再来一次
We do it again.

1446
01:53:22,219 --> 01:53:24,137
陛下
你为什么要来打扰我呢？
- Your Majesty--
- Why do you burst in here?

1447
01:53:24,221 --> 01:53:26,056
找到达布堤了
We have found Tuptim.

1448
01:53:29,059 --> 01:53:32,145
她在哪？
现在还在调查中
- Where is she?
- Secret police are questioning her.

1449
01:53:32,229 --> 01:53:34,439
但那个男的还没抓到
Her lover has not been caught.
Not yet.

1450
01:53:34,773 --> 01:53:35,899
她的什么？
What?

1451
01:53:35,983 --> 01:53:38,694
那个要和达布堤一起私奔的就是伦塔
It is believed she was
running away with Lun Tha...

1452
01:53:38,777 --> 01:53:40,779
送她来这儿的缅甸使者
...man who bring her here
from Burma.

1453
01:53:42,072 --> 01:53:43,365
这是何等的耻辱
Dishonor.

1454
01:53:44,491 --> 01:53:46,243
这是何等的耻辱
Dishonor. Dishonor!

1455
01:53:47,327 --> 01:53:50,497
把她带上来
但是，陛下，你想对她怎么样？
- Bring her in.
- Your Majesty, what will you do?

1456
01:53:50,581 --> 01:53:52,875
我会让她知道厉害的
I shall do what is usually done
in such event.

1457
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:54,751
不，不
No. No!

1458
01:53:55,335 --> 01:53:58,839
不要，安娜夫人，让他们不要罚我！
No! Mrs. Anna,
do not let them beat me.

1459
01:53:58,922 --> 01:54:00,716
让他们不要！
Do not let them!

1460
01:54:01,508 --> 01:54:04,011
男的在那？
我不知道
- Where is this man?
- I do not know.

1461
01:54:04,094 --> 01:54:06,054
你早就和那个男的相好了
It is known you were lovers with him.

1462
01:54:06,138 --> 01:54:08,307
我是冤枉的！
I was not lovers with this man!

1463
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:09,641
不知羞耻的贱人
Dishonor!

1464
01:54:11,101 --> 01:54:14,938
会让你招供的！
住手！听见了没有？
- We will have truth of you.
- Stop that! Do you hear? Stop it!

1465
01:54:15,647 --> 01:54:17,983
你能明白就再好不过了
It is better
if you understand at once...

1466
01:54:18,066 --> 01:54:20,068
这件事与你无关
...that this does not concern you.

1467
01:54:20,152 --> 01:54:23,322
我是为陛下着想,所以不能袖手旁观…
Oh, but it does, Your Majesty.
It does, dreadfully.

1468
01:54:23,405 --> 01:54:26,200
为她，更是为您
Because of her,
and even more because of you.

1469
01:54:26,283 --> 01:54:29,161
她只是个孩子,我想她是因为不快乐才逃走的
She's a child, running away
because she was unhappy.

1470
01:54:29,244 --> 01:54:30,787
陛下，你放过她吧？
Can't you understand that?

1471
01:54:30,871 --> 01:54:32,372
你是在浪费时间！
You waste my time!

1472
01:54:32,456 --> 01:54:35,626
陛下，请您想想即使你惩罚她又能怎么样呢
I beg of you not to take revenge
on this girl.

1473
01:54:35,709 --> 01:54:40,172
那只会将你一直以来的努力全部化为乌有
You'll throw away everything you've
accomplished for yourself and country.

1474
01:54:40,255 --> 01:54:43,967
而你只是因为虚荣心受伤,她并没有伤着你的心
The girl hurt your vanity, that's all.
She didn't hurt your heart.

1475
01:54:44,051 --> 01:54:45,594
你没有爱心！
You have no heart!

1476
01:54:45,677 --> 01:54:48,472
也从来没有爱过任何人！
You've never loved anyone
and you never will.

1477
01:54:48,555 --> 01:54:50,098
把鞭子给我！给我！
I will show you. Give me.

1478
01:54:50,182 --> 01:54:53,018
我真不敢相信你真的想打她吗
I can't believe you will do
this dreadful thing!

1479
01:54:53,101 --> 01:54:57,105
不相信，是吗？等你听到哀嚎之后就会夺门而出了！
You don't? Believe when you hear
her screams as you run from here.

1480
01:54:57,189 --> 01:55:00,859
我不会逃走的，要待在这看到最后
I am not going to run. I am going
to stand here and watch you.

1481
01:55:01,318 --> 01:55:03,320
这个女人由我亲自来处罚
Hold this girl. I do this myself!

1482
01:55:03,403 --> 01:55:05,155
你是个野蛮人
You are a barbarian.

1483
01:55:06,615 --> 01:55:07,616
趴下，趴下
Down, down, down!

1484
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:11,787
当我是国王了吗？
Am I king or am I not king?

1485
01:55:12,246 --> 01:55:17,334
在我的王宫里不允许有这种事发生
我没有义务听一个教师的指示
Am I to be cuckold in my own palace,
to take orders from English teacher?

1486
01:55:17,417 --> 01:55:19,169
不，陛下，这不是指示
闭嘴！
- No, no. Not orders.
- Silence!

1487
01:55:19,586 --> 01:55:21,922
我打从娘胎里下来就是国王了
I am king as I was born to be...

1488
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:25,509
我要以自己的方式来治理我的王国--
...and Siam to be governed
in my way!

1489
01:55:25,592 --> 01:55:27,928
而不是英国或者法国或者是中国的那些方式！
Not English way, not French way,
not Chinese way!

1490
01:55:28,428 --> 01:55:29,638
以我自己的方式！
My Way!

1491
01:55:30,514 --> 01:55:32,266
你说我是个野蛮人
Barbarian, you say.

1492
01:55:33,016 --> 01:55:36,144
那总要比那个软弱的国王要好得多
There is no barbarian worse
than a weak king.

1493
01:55:36,228 --> 01:55:38,230
现在我让你见识一下我的强壮？
And I am strong, do you hear?

1494
01:55:38,313 --> 01:55:39,523
我的强壮
Strong!

1495
01:56:02,504 --> 01:56:03,589
怎么回事？
Well?

1496
01:56:03,672 --> 01:56:07,551
男人的尸体在河中被发现了
The man, the lover has been found
in river. He is dead.

1497
01:56:07,885 --> 01:56:09,011
他死了
Dead?

1498
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,096
噢，不
Oh, no!

1499
01:56:12,181 --> 01:56:13,390
噢，不
Oh, no!

1500
01:56:14,057 --> 01:56:16,018
噢，不
Oh, no!

1501
01:56:18,812 --> 01:56:22,524
我真的无法理解
你们还有国王
I don't understand you,
not you or your king.

1502
01:56:22,608 --> 01:56:24,568
我不理解你们
I'll never understand him.

1503
01:56:24,651 --> 01:56:25,944
你！
YOU!

1504
01:56:26,570 --> 01:56:29,656
我怕发生这种事故,早就警告过你
When I warn you of this
many months ago, you do not listen.

1505
01:56:30,449 --> 01:56:32,367
你毁了他
You have destroyed him.

1506
01:56:32,784 --> 01:56:34,786
陛下已不是从前的陛下了
He can never be the king
he was before.

1507
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:37,164
都是你把国王变得软弱了
You have taken all that
away from him.

1508
01:56:37,247 --> 01:56:39,124
都是因为你
You have destroyed king!

1509
01:56:39,208 --> 01:56:42,753
不管上哪都行,我要搭下班船走
The next boat that comes, no matter
where it goes, I shall be on it.

1510
01:56:45,631 --> 01:56:47,883
我要走，请把这个还给国王
Give this back to His Majesty.

1511
01:56:48,425 --> 01:56:51,094
你不应该到这儿来
I wish you have never come to Siam.

1512
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:52,846
是的
So do I.

1513
01:56:52,930 --> 01:56:54,932
我不应该到这儿来
Oh, so do I!

1514
01:57:48,318 --> 01:57:49,486
妈妈
Mother.

1515
01:57:51,405 --> 01:57:53,615
妈妈，我们的行李已经准备好了
Mother, our luggage is all loaded.

1516
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:55,826
船也快要开了
We'll be late for the boat.

1517
01:57:56,451 --> 01:57:57,828
好的，路易
Yes, Louis.

1518
01:57:58,328 --> 01:57:59,663
我立刻就去
I'm coming.

1519
01:58:03,792 --> 01:58:05,419
安娜夫人
Mrs. Anna.

1520
01:58:05,586 --> 01:58:08,130
张妃，谢谢你
Lady Thiang. Your Highness.

1521
01:58:08,213 --> 01:58:10,924
来为我送行
How nice of you
to come to say goodbye.

1522
01:58:11,008 --> 01:58:13,760
不，我不是来送行的
Mrs. Anna, I do not come for myself.

1523
01:58:13,844 --> 01:58:16,221
我是希望你立刻去见陛下
I come for one
who must see you quickly.

1524
01:58:17,264 --> 01:58:20,434
你应该告诉他我现在已经不是他的仆女
You may tell His Majesty
I am no longer subject to him.

1525
01:58:20,517 --> 01:58:22,436
你什么也不知道
You do not understand.

1526
01:58:23,187 --> 01:58:24,605
安娜夫人…
Mrs. Anna...

1527
01:58:25,147 --> 01:58:26,690
他快死了
...he is dying!

1528
01:58:28,358 --> 01:58:29,776
快死了？
Dying?

1529
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:31,111
陛下？
The king?

1530
01:58:32,196 --> 01:58:35,157
不，张妃，出什么事了？
Oh, no, Lady Thiang.
What happened?

1531
01:58:36,533 --> 01:58:39,703
没人知道是怎么回事？
Who can say what it is
that makes a man die?

1532
01:58:41,079 --> 01:58:44,833
他一定是过度忧伤而招致死亡的
A sad heart that no longer wishes
to go on beating?

1533
01:58:46,126 --> 01:58:50,297
那天晚宴后，他就避开人
Ever since night of great banquet,
he has shut himself away in palace...

1534
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:52,549
封闭在自己的世界里
...turning from all
who would speak to him...

1535
01:58:52,925 --> 01:58:56,011
不吃不睡，废寝忘食的看着书…
...unwilling to sleep
or to nourish himself...

1536
01:58:56,762 --> 01:59:00,766
并时时地叹息着
...searching through many books,
only to push them aside in despair.

1537
01:59:02,059 --> 01:59:05,354
御医劝了他很多次…
Doctors warned him he must
change his ways quickly...

1538
01:59:06,563 --> 01:59:09,066
但他都不听，安娜夫人
...but he would not listen, Mrs. Anna.

1539
01:59:10,192 --> 01:59:11,944
他完全不听别人的劝告
He would not listen.

1540
01:59:12,903 --> 01:59:14,404
我怎么什么都不知道呢
I had no idea.

1541
01:59:15,614 --> 01:59:18,534
因为他禁止将这件事张扬出去…
Everyone who knew
was forbidden to speak of it.

1542
01:59:19,868 --> 01:59:22,371
御医说这是迟早的问题
And now,
doctors have no hope for him.

1543
01:59:24,331 --> 01:59:25,541
安娜夫人
Mrs. Anna.

1544
01:59:26,333 --> 01:59:27,709
殿下
Your Highness.

1545
01:59:27,793 --> 01:59:29,503
我很害怕，安娜夫人
I am frightened, Mrs. Anna.

1546
01:59:29,878 --> 01:59:32,589
因为我很爱父王…
I am frightened
because I love my father...

1547
01:59:32,673 --> 01:59:36,385
如果他死了我就得继承王位
...and also because if he dies,
I shall be king.

1548
01:59:37,219 --> 01:59:39,346
我应该怎么样去当国王？
And I do not know how to be.

1549
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:45,936
孩子，等你当国王后再学习也不晚，真的
Many men learn this after
they become kings, Your Highness.

1550
01:59:47,104 --> 01:59:49,314
你只要把老师教过你的事再回想一下
It will be good to think back...

1551
01:59:49,398 --> 01:59:52,025
国王交给我这封信
...on all that
Mrs. Anna has taught you.

1552
01:59:55,362 --> 01:59:59,116
希望在你离开前交给你
When king heard you were sailing
tonight, he started to write letter.

1553
01:59:59,867 --> 02:00:02,411
他非常困难地
完成了这封信…
It was difficult for him, Mrs. Anna.

1554
02:00:03,245 --> 02:00:04,788
非常困难
Very difficult.

1555
02:00:05,581 --> 02:00:08,208
他要我转交给你
He has commanded
that I give it to you.

1556
02:00:16,925 --> 02:00:20,762
安娜夫人，你能把信念给我们听听吗？
Please, may I hear what
my father has said, Mrs. Anna?

1557
02:00:34,318 --> 02:00:36,320
"你好，安娜
"While I am lying here...

1558
02:00:36,695 --> 02:00:38,697
"看来我活不久了
...I think perhaps I die.

1559
02:00:39,781 --> 02:00:42,367
"虽然我从没想到
This heart which you say
I have not got...

1560
02:00:42,492 --> 02:00:44,286
"这会发生得这么快
...is matter of concern.

1561
02:00:45,954 --> 02:00:50,167
"对我来说死应该是很平常的事
"It occurs to me that there shall be
nothing wrong that men shall die.

1562
02:00:51,001 --> 02:00:53,086
"我也没有什么好遗憾的
"For all that matters about man...

1563
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:56,298
"问题在于我是否做到了最好
...is that he shall have tried
his utmost best.

1564
02:00:57,841 --> 02:01:02,095
"想想你也为本国
In looking back, I discover that
you think much on those people

1565
02:01:02,596 --> 02:01:05,432
尽了最大的努力
...who require that you live up
to best of self.

1566
02:01:07,184 --> 02:01:09,853
"因为你经常会说出实话
You have spoken truth
to me always...

1567
02:01:10,896 --> 02:01:14,066
"所以有时我会感到很气愤
...and for this I have often
lost my temper on you.

1568
02:01:15,567 --> 02:01:17,611
"但是安娜,在我死之前
But now I do not wish to die...

1569
02:01:17,694 --> 02:01:20,531
"我诚心向你表示感谢
...without saying this gratitude...

1570
02:01:21,865 --> 02:01:25,202
以及等等的
...and large respect,
et cetera, et cetera.

1571
02:01:26,954 --> 02:01:28,622
"安娜，你以女子之躯…
"I think it very strange...

1572
02:01:28,705 --> 02:01:32,000
"竟然那么能干…
...that a woman shall have been
most earnest help of all.

1573
02:01:33,710 --> 02:01:35,629
"可是，安娜，你要知道…
But, Mrs. Anna,
you must remember...

1574
02:01:35,712 --> 02:01:38,715
"你真的是个很顽固的女人…
...that you have been
a very difficult woman...

1575
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:43,053
"我认为没有别的女人会向你一样，与众不同
...and much more difficult
than generality."

1576
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:50,018
我们得回去了
We must hurry back now.

1577
02:01:51,854 --> 02:01:53,355
你会来吗？
You will come?

1578
02:02:18,338 --> 02:02:19,590
妈妈
Mother...

1579
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:22,092
现在国王快死了
...now that the king is dying...

1580
02:02:22,176 --> 02:02:24,261
你们会和好吗？
...does that make you friends again?

1581
02:02:25,137 --> 02:02:26,930
是的，路易斯
I suppose so, Louis.

1582
02:02:27,639 --> 02:02:30,058
我们不能再彼此伤害了
We can't hurt each other anymore.

1583
02:02:31,351 --> 02:02:33,312
他是个可怕的人
He always frightened me.

1584
02:02:34,771 --> 02:02:36,523
如果你了解他的话
I wish you had known him better.

1585
02:02:36,607 --> 02:02:39,067
一定会和他成为朋友的
You two could have been
such good friends.

1586
02:02:40,277 --> 02:02:43,113
他有些地方很孩子气
In many ways he was
just as young as you.

1587
02:02:45,365 --> 02:02:47,910
你认为他是个好国王吗？
Was he as good a king
as he could have been?

1588
02:02:50,329 --> 02:02:54,416
是的，我认为再也没有比他更好的国王了
I don't think any man has ever been
as good a king as he could have been.

1589
02:02:55,918 --> 02:02:57,628
他都尝试过了
But this one tried.

1590
02:02:58,545 --> 02:03:00,297
而且非常的努力
He tried very hard.

1591
02:03:03,592 --> 02:03:06,053
你喜欢国王是吗，妈妈？
You really like him,
don't you, Mother?

1592
02:03:06,803 --> 02:03:08,138
是的，路易
Yes, Louis.

1593
02:03:09,139 --> 02:03:10,933
我非常喜欢他…
I like him very much.

1594
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,727
非常喜欢
Very much indeed.

1595
02:03:46,510 --> 02:03:47,970
几个星期没见你了…
Several weeks...

1596
02:03:48,512 --> 02:03:50,138
安娜夫人
...I do not see you, Mrs. Anna.

1597
02:03:51,682 --> 02:03:53,183
我快死了
And now I die.

1598
02:03:54,017 --> 02:03:55,853
不会的，陛下
Oh, no, Your Majesty.

1599
02:03:56,270 --> 02:03:58,188
这是很不科学的回答
This is not scientific.

1600
02:03:59,982 --> 02:04:01,233
我知道…
I know...

1601
02:04:01,775 --> 02:04:03,694
自己什么时候死
...if I die or do not die.

1602
02:04:04,862 --> 02:04:07,698
你不该来的，你不回自己的寝室吗？
You shouldn't be here.
Can't we move you to your room?

1603
02:04:08,115 --> 02:04:09,157
不
No.

1604
02:04:09,867 --> 02:04:12,494
这个房间比较好，这里是知识的宝库
I wish to remain here
in room with knowledge.

1605
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:18,333
你要回国了？
You are leaving Siam?

1606
02:04:19,293 --> 02:04:20,377
什么时候走
When?

1607
02:04:20,711 --> 02:04:22,504
很快就走，陛下
Very soon, Your Majesty.

1608
02:04:22,588 --> 02:04:25,048
我只能在这儿逗留一会儿，
陛下
In fact, I can stay
only a few more minutes.

1609
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:27,342
你很高兴吗？
And you are glad of this?

1610
02:04:28,468 --> 02:04:30,095
泰国的人民…
People of Siam...

1611
02:04:30,804 --> 02:04:33,098
王子，公主们
...royal children, et cetera...

1612
02:04:33,891 --> 02:04:35,100
他们并不高兴
...are not glad.

1613
02:04:35,851 --> 02:04:38,770
大家因为你要回国…
And all are in great affliction...

1614
02:04:40,189 --> 02:04:41,565
而感到很悲伤，很难过
...of your departure.

1615
02:04:43,317 --> 02:04:44,985
我会相信他们的
I shall miss them.

1616
02:04:45,068 --> 02:04:46,904
你会相信他们的
You shall miss them...

1617
02:04:47,571 --> 02:04:49,072
但是你要走了
...but you shall be leaving.

1618
02:04:52,326 --> 02:04:53,535
我，也是
I, too...

1619
02:04:53,952 --> 02:04:55,329
要走了
...am leaving.

1620
02:04:55,913 --> 02:04:57,748
只是不用乘船…
Only I'm not walking onto a boat...

1621
02:04:57,831 --> 02:04:59,708
甚至不是我自己的意志
...with my own feet...

1622
02:05:00,083 --> 02:05:02,211
我要走了
...of my own free will.

1623
02:05:05,547 --> 02:05:07,216
是该走了
I am just leaving.

1624
02:05:10,052 --> 02:05:11,970
你的头为什么要比我高？
Why is your head higher than mine?

1625
02:05:21,063 --> 02:05:22,147
这个
Here.

1626
02:05:24,775 --> 02:05:27,611
是你的
Here is something belonging to you.

1627
02:05:27,694 --> 02:05:29,029
戴上
Put it on.

1628
02:05:29,488 --> 02:05:31,281
把它戴上！
戴上！
Put it on, put it on.

1629
02:05:34,117 --> 02:05:35,369
请你
Please...

1630
02:05:35,452 --> 02:05:36,578
戴上它
...wear it.

1631
02:05:49,466 --> 02:05:50,968
孩子们来了
The children.

1632
02:05:53,178 --> 02:05:54,388
孩子们靠近我
Let my children come in.

1633
02:06:05,399 --> 02:06:07,276
晚安，孩子们
Good evening, children.

1634
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:09,611
晚安，父皇
Good evening, my father.

1635
02:06:09,695 --> 02:06:13,156
老师，请你别走！
- Please, do not go. We'll miss you!
- Children!

1636
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:14,825
孩子们，不可以
Stop this noise.

1637
02:06:15,284 --> 02:06:17,953
你们是来探望父王还是安娜夫人
Did you come to see your father
or Mrs. Anna?

1638
02:06:18,328 --> 02:06:20,289
没关系的，张妃
It is all right, Lady Thiang.

1639
02:06:20,372 --> 02:06:21,915
难怪他们会这样
It is suitable.

1640
02:06:22,666 --> 02:06:24,001
父王
My father.

1641
02:06:25,961 --> 02:06:27,838
什么事，雅欧拉克
Princess Ying Yaowalak.

1642
02:06:28,589 --> 02:06:31,008
我想请求你…
I have wish to--

1643
02:06:32,843 --> 02:06:35,762
她是想传话给安娜夫人
She has memorized message
for Mrs. Anna.

1644
02:06:37,222 --> 02:06:38,765
你说吧
Speak message now.

1645
02:06:42,144 --> 02:06:43,645
说吧
Say it, say it, say it.

1646
02:06:43,729 --> 02:06:46,648
我们的良师良友
Dear friend and teacher...

1647
02:06:46,732 --> 02:06:49,568
拜托你
...my goodness gracious...

1648
02:06:49,651 --> 02:06:52,279
别离去
...do not go away.

1649
02:06:52,362 --> 02:06:54,907
因为我们都需要你
We are in great need of you.

1650
02:06:55,532 --> 02:06:57,367
我们就像眼睛看不见的盲人
We are like one blind.

1651
02:06:58,076 --> 02:07:01,371
求你别弃我们于黑暗不顾
Do not let us fall down in darkness.

1652
02:07:01,872 --> 02:07:05,459
再象以前般温柔的…
Continue good and sincere...

1653
02:07:05,542 --> 02:07:08,337
守护并指引
...concern for us...

1654
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:10,631
我们上正道
...and lead us in right road.

1655
02:07:11,006 --> 02:07:12,758
你的学生
Your loving pupil...

1656
02:07:12,841 --> 02:07:15,552
雅欧拉克公主
...Princess Ying Yaowalak.

1657
02:07:28,398 --> 02:07:29,566
妈妈
Mother...

1658
02:07:29,650 --> 02:07:32,194
船要开了我们走吧
...it's the boat. It's time to go.

1659
02:07:32,277 --> 02:07:35,030
请不要走，安娜夫人
- Do not go, Mrs. Anna.
- Please do not go.

1660
02:07:35,113 --> 02:07:36,907
安娜夫人，你别走
No, no, Mrs. Anna!

1661
02:07:57,469 --> 02:08:01,181
路易，马上告诉船长把行李卸下，快点拿回来
Run down to the boat and ask
Captain Orton to take our things off.

1662
02:08:01,974 --> 02:08:03,350
是的，妈妈
Yes, Mother.

1663
02:08:09,898 --> 02:08:11,108
安静
Silence!

1664
02:08:13,443 --> 02:08:16,405
这没什么好兴奋的
There's no reason
for doing of demonstration...

1665
02:08:17,197 --> 02:08:20,284
她只是尽了老师的职责而矣
...for schoolteacher
realizing her duty...

1666
02:08:21,368 --> 02:08:24,162
而且我还付给她高薪呢…
...for which I pay her
exorbitant monthly fee...

1667
02:08:25,163 --> 02:08:26,415
一个月…
...of...

1668
02:08:28,125 --> 02:08:31,378
25英磅
...twenty-five pounds.

1669
02:08:33,422 --> 02:08:34,798
还有…
Furthermore...

1670
02:08:36,884 --> 02:08:40,637
在临死国王的枕边…
...this is disorganized behavior...

1671
02:08:41,889 --> 02:08:44,016
如此的吵闹，实在是不敬
...in presence of dying king.

1672
02:08:47,311 --> 02:08:48,812
皇太子…
Chulalongkorn.

1673
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:51,106
站起来
Rise.

1674
02:08:53,317 --> 02:08:54,651
安娜夫人
Mrs. Anna...

1675
02:08:56,904 --> 02:08:58,405
你
...you...

1676
02:08:58,488 --> 02:08:59,990
来当书记
...take notes.

1677
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:04,828
记下我的笔录…
You take notes...

1678
02:09:07,164 --> 02:09:09,333
说给下一任国王
...from next king.

1679
02:09:16,006 --> 02:09:17,090
好吧
Well?

1680
02:09:17,674 --> 02:09:19,468
如果你当了国王
Suppose you are king.

1681
02:09:20,302 --> 02:09:22,471
会怎么样呢？
Is there nothing you would do?

1682
02:09:22,554 --> 02:09:24,097
我
I...

1683
02:09:24,181 --> 02:09:26,308
我会下令
...would make proclamations.

1684
02:09:26,683 --> 02:09:28,352
是的。什么令呢？
Yes. Yes?

1685
02:09:29,186 --> 02:09:32,272
首先，我会在过年时
First, I would proclaim
for coming New Year...

1686
02:09:32,648 --> 02:09:34,107
放烟火
...fireworks.

1687
02:09:34,191 --> 02:09:36,109
哈哈
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1688
02:09:36,193 --> 02:09:37,819
还要举办划舟竞赛
Also boat races.

1689
02:09:38,529 --> 02:09:39,863
划舟竞赛？
Boat races?

1690
02:09:40,364 --> 02:09:43,033
为什么要在新年举办划舟竞赛呢？
Why boat races
with New Year's celebration?

1691
02:09:44,701 --> 02:09:46,370
我喜欢划舟竞赛呢
I like boat races.

1692
02:09:46,912 --> 02:09:49,706
然后我会下第二道命令
And, Father, I would make
second proclamation.

1693
02:09:49,873 --> 02:09:52,167
好的，什么是第二道命令？
说说看
Yes, what is second proclamation?
Make it, make it.

1694
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:55,504
这种象青蛙似的向国王行礼…
Regarding custom
of bowing to king...

1695
02:09:56,213 --> 02:09:58,215
要废除掉
...in fashion of lowly toad.

1696
02:09:59,967 --> 02:10:02,010
我认为
I do not believe this is good thing.

1697
02:10:02,094 --> 02:10:04,471
勉强别人不是一件好事
Causing embarrassing fatigue
of body...

1698
02:10:04,555 --> 02:10:06,974
会让国民的心卑微
...degrading experience for soul...

1699
02:10:07,057 --> 02:10:09,142
等等，等等
...et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1700
02:10:09,226 --> 02:10:10,894
很不好…
This is bad thing.

1701
02:10:12,437 --> 02:10:14,606
我觉得应该废除掉
I believe.

1702
02:10:20,445 --> 02:10:23,073
你会对我生气吗，父王？
You are angry with me, my father?

1703
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:26,618
为什么要问这种事呢？
Oh, why do you ask question?

1704
02:10:27,744 --> 02:10:29,413
只要继续位了
If you are king...

1705
02:10:30,539 --> 02:10:32,791
你就是国王！
...you are king!

1706
02:10:34,751 --> 02:10:37,045
别问一个生病的人…
Don't ask question of sick man.

1707
02:10:39,381 --> 02:10:40,424
还有
Nor...

1708
02:10:41,216 --> 02:10:42,467
女人的意见
...of woman.

1709
02:10:44,178 --> 02:10:45,929
也想废除…
This proclamation...

1710
02:10:46,972 --> 02:10:48,932
对国王伏地下跪的事…
...against bowing to king...

1711
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:53,729
要由你来负责
...I believe to be your fault.

1712
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:57,608
要真能那样做就好了
Oh, I hope so, Your Majesty.

1713
02:10:58,942 --> 02:11:00,444
我早就盼望着有这一天了
I do hope so.

1714
02:11:02,821 --> 02:11:04,448
大家站起来
Up! Rise up!

1715
02:11:09,536 --> 02:11:10,746
父王？
Father?

1716
02:11:12,497 --> 02:11:13,874
起来，起来
Up,up,up!

1717
02:11:15,167 --> 02:11:17,419
像士兵一样排成一队
Like soldiers in lines.

1718
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:22,966
就像他刚才说的一样…
It has been said.

1719
02:11:24,593 --> 02:11:26,929
今后表示敬意时…
There shall be no more bowing...

1720
02:11:28,805 --> 02:11:30,432
不用这样
...for showing...

1721
02:11:30,974 --> 02:11:32,434
对国王
...respect...

1722
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:34,728
行礼
...for king.

1723
02:11:39,983 --> 02:11:42,027
那是治理国家的王者…
It has been said by one...

1724
02:11:44,947 --> 02:11:46,907
富有经验的智者…
...who has been trained...

1725
02:11:48,283 --> 02:11:50,035
所说的
...for royal...

1726
02:11:51,078 --> 02:11:52,579
至理明言
...government.

1727
02:12:05,759 --> 02:12:08,178
今后不必象青蛙一样行礼
There shall be no bowing like toad.

1728
02:12:08,262 --> 02:12:09,513
不再蹲伏
No crouching.

1729
02:12:09,596 --> 02:12:11,348
不再爬行
No crawling.

1730
02:12:11,431 --> 02:12:15,561
但并不是要你们不尊敬国王
This does not mean, however,
that you do not show respect for king.

1731
02:12:16,186 --> 02:12:18,814
你们要像这样挺起胸膛…
You will stand with shoulders back...

1732
02:12:18,897 --> 02:12:21,024
抬起头。就像这样
...and chin high, like this.

1733
02:12:22,359 --> 02:12:25,070
像国王一样气宇轩昂
You will face king
with proud expression...

1734
02:12:25,153 --> 02:12:28,240
像国王一样高傲
...showing pride in self
as well as in king.

1735
02:12:29,575 --> 02:12:33,161
相互尊重才是正确的礼仪
This is proper way for men
to show esteem for one another...

1736
02:12:33,412 --> 02:12:37,541
眼睛和眼睛相对才有人性的尊严
...by looking upon each other's faces
with calmness of spirit...

1737
02:12:37,833 --> 02:12:40,669
平等的凝望
...eyes meeting eyes in equal gaze...

1738
02:12:40,752 --> 02:12:44,548
像个男人般挺胸站立
...bodies upright, standing as men
were meant to stand...

1739
02:12:44,923 --> 02:12:47,593
平等尊重
...with dignity and awareness of self.

1740
02:12:48,302 --> 02:12:50,387
从现在开始
So from this day forward...

1741
02:12:52,189 --> 02:13:05,688
