Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be with thee...

8
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,500
外面为何那么吵？
What is that disturbance?

9
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,960
发生什么事了？
What has happened?

10
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,970
殿下，花园里发现一名士兵的尸体
Excuse me, Your Excellency. A dead soldier has been found in the garden.

11
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,640
什么？
What?

12
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,310
整座城市都在动乱
There's rioting in the city, everywhere.

13
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,230
这封信是刚送来的…
This letter has arrived.

14
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,980
梅维卡公爵的来信，万分火急
It's urgent. From the Duke of Malvica.

15
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,330
“亲爱的法里兹奥，看看报纸上可怕的消息”
"Dear Fabrizio, read the terrible news in the paper."

16
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
“皮埃蒙特人登陆了，我们失守了”
"The Piedmontese have landed. We are lost."

17
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,010
“我们全家今晚乘英国战船逃难”
"My family and I are taking refuge in the English ships anchored here."

18
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,350
“你可能也要赶紧逃”
"I'm sure you'll do likewise."

19
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,230
“愿主保佑我们的国王…”
"God save our beloved king."

20
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,480
懦夫！
The coward!

21
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,700
“五月十一日，武装分子登陆马沙拉…”
"An act of piracy was committed on 11th May..."

22
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,030
“将公然的侵略活动推向高潮”
...when armed men landed at Marsala."

23
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,710
“武装分子约有八百人，由加里波第率领”
"Reports say there were about 800, led by Garibaldi."

24
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,710
“他们避开了与皇家军队的正面遭遇…”
"The brigands carefully avoided any clash with royalist troops..."

25
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,050
“向卡斯特尔韦特拉诺进发…”
"...and made for Castelvetrano..."

26
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,050
“沿路胁迫居民，掠夺财产，肆意破坏”
"...threatening peaceful inhabitants and causing pillage and devastation."

27
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,730
保罗，你们今晚搬去马勒莫的宫殿，房子一空就会沦陷的
Paolo, you'll go to the house in Palermo. Empty houses are lost houses.

28
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,400
法里兹奥，这样太危险了，要打仗了！
No, please, Fabrizio. It's dangerous. This is war.

29
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,740
保罗，把米米找来
Francesco Paolo, call Mimi.

30
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
这是革命
It's the revolution.

31
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,860
喝了这个你会好点的
Drink this, you'll feel better.

32
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,790
他来了，爸爸
He's just coming, father.

33
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,000
对不起，殿下，我们在花园里发现了…
Pardon, Excellency. In the garden we've found...

34
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,760
米米，让安东尼奥备好马车，快去
Mimi, tell Don Antonio to harness the horses to the carriage.

35
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,100
吃完饭我要去巴勒莫
I'll go to Palermo after our meal.

36
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,480
皮诺神父…
Father Pirrone...

37
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,820
你跟我一起去，好吗？
...you'll accompany me, won't you?

38
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,030
愿上帝保佑我们
May the Lord protect us.

39
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,040
街上全是士兵…
But with the streets full of soldiers, bandits...

40
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,710
你能和耶稣教友们聚上几个小时，我们十一点回去
You'll spend two hours with your colleagues. We'll return at eleven.

41
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,060
半小时内吃饭
We eat in half an hour.

42
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,060
所有人都吃
All of you.

43
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,750
我们还能做什么？
What are we going to do?

44
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,420
救救我们，仁慈的圣母…
Save us, Queen of Heaven, mother of mercies...

45
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,450
这些坏蛋死后还是这么臭
These swines stink even when they're dead.

46
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,320
塞尔瓦托，你报告兵营那边了吗？
Salvatore, did you alert the barracks?

47
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,450
殿下，兵营派他们来把尸体抬走
Excellency, we've told them to come and remove him.

48
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,140
殿下，时局动荡啊
What terrible times, Excellency.

49
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,490
看看山上的战火
Look at all the fires on the mountains.

50
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,490
☆叛军的营地★我看见了，神父
☆They're the rebels' camps.★I see them, Father.

51
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,840
也许殿下是在担心塔克罗迪
Perhaps Your Excellency is worried about Don Tancredi.

52
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,470
他应该提防一下他那些狐朋狗友…
Tancredi should guard against certain friendships...

53
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,810
对他们多留一份戒心
...certain dangerous acquaintances.

54
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,820
不该怪他，社会环境使然！
Father, the fault is not Tancredi's. The fault is the times.

55
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,360
如今，出身名门的年轻人难免会交到些狐朋狗友
A young nobleman cannot even play cards without making dangerous friends.

56
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,700
够了
That's enough now.

57
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,710
不过还是该小心谨慎…
Still, a little prudence...

58
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,420
停车，爱罗迪别墅关卡检查
Halt! Villa Airoldi road-block.

59
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,050
晚上好，殿下，请见谅
Good evening Your Excellency. Excuse us.

60
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,390
给萨利纳王子殿下放行
Let the Prince of Salina through.

61
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,080
倘若没有那么多耶稣会士…
What a beautiful country this would be if...

62
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,410
我们国家将多么美好
If there weren't so many Jesuits.

63
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,100
十点钟我来接你，好好祈祷，神父
I'll come back for you in two hours. Pray well, Father.

64
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,130
☆我们去哪？★港口边的酒馆
☆Where can we go?★To the tavern, by the port.

65
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
晚上好，美男子
Good evening, handsome.

66
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,470
梅琳娜，他不适合你
Melina, that's not for you.

67
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,470
你少管闲事
Mind your own business.

68
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,810
殿下
My big prince.

69
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,520
早上好，舅舅
Good day, uncle.

70
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,150
塔克罗迪，你昨晚去哪儿了？
Tancredi. What were you up to last night?

71
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,480
没去哪儿，舅舅
Nothing at all, uncle.

72
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,150
我和几个朋友出去了，没干什么
I was with friends, a virtuous night.

73
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,860
我才不像某些人去巴勒莫…
Not like some I know, who went to amuse themselves...

74
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,160
寻欢作乐
...down in Palermo.

75
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,700
你说谁呢？
And who would they be?

76
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,160
你啊，舅舅
You yourself, uncle.

77
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,170
我亲眼看到你在爱罗迪别墅…
I saw you talking to the sergeant at the road-block.

78
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
与哨站的警官说话
A fine thing, at your age.

79
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,090
还带了个神父一起
And with a reverend father, too.

80
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,180
你这个花花公子
Such libertines.

81
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,850
我想是吧
Well, after all, it's true.

82
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,210
干嘛穿成这样？去参加舞会吗？
Why are you dressed like that? For a masked ball in the morning?

83
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,670
我一小时后就走，我是来道别的
I'm going soon, uncle. I came to say farewell.

84
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,970
怎么？你要去哪儿？不是去决斗吧？
Why? Where are you going? Not a duel...

85
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,220
没错，和国王作生死决斗
Yes. A great duel, uncle, with the king.

86
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,850
我要去法古扎山
I'm going to the mountains, to Ficuzza.

87
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,480
伟大事业正在酝酿，我可不想呆在家里
Great things are beginning and I don't want to stay at home.

88
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,690
总之，呆在家里我早晚被逮
They'd seize me here, anyway.

89
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,860
你简直疯了，那些人全是一群乌合之众
You are mad to join them. They're mafiosi, all swindlers.

90
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,780
法康利人应该与我们一起支持国王
A Falconeri should be with us, for the king.

91
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,540
支持国王，没错
Certainly, for the king.

92
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,870
但是哪个国王？你说过很多次了
But which king? You've said it yourself, uncle.

93
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,550
费迪纳德活着的话，哪会轮到小弗朗西斯？
If King Ferdinando were still alive... But Franceschiello? No, uncle.

94
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,550
你认为自诩为“绅士”的皮埃蒙特人更有治国之道？
You think the Piedmont man they call "The Gentleman" will be much better?

95
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,550
只不过将都灵方言换成那不勒斯方言而已
A Turin dialect instead of Neapolitan, that's all.

96
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,890
那你喜欢马兹尼共和国吗？
Then what about the republic of Peppino Mazzini?

97
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,230
不行动的话，他们就将共和政体强加于人
If we weren't here, that lot would soon foist the republic on you.

98
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,900
万物要保持永恒，就必须作出改变
If we want everything to remain as it is, everything has to change.

99
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,570
你明白吗？
Have I explained it?

100
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,250
再见，我会带着三色旗回来的
Good-bye, uncle. I'll return with the tricolour.

101
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,250
三色旗！你简直是一派胡言
The tricolour! You soil your lips with that word.

102
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:22,260
跟我们的金百合国旗比起来，三色旗算什么？
What is it compared with our golden lily banner?

103
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,260
那难看的颜色能给你什么希望？
What do you hope to gain from those colours?

104
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,260
舅舅，你这是自欺欺人
Wait, uncle, you're deluding yourself.

105
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,270
再见，舅舅
Good-bye, uncle.

106
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,570
再见
I'll see you soon.

107
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,280
等等，塔克罗迪！
Tancredi! Wait!

108
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
你这是干嘛？当作支持革命吗？
What are you doing? Subsidising the revolution now?

109
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,300
谢谢你了，舅舅
Thank you very much, uncle.

110
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,640
替我向舅妈问好
Kiss my aunt for me.

111
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,990
康塞塔，我很快就回来的
Concetta, I'll be back soon.

112
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,590
殿下来这里忏悔吗？
Has Your Excellency come for confession?

113
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,920
忏悔？今天不是星期天
Confession? It's not Saturday.

114
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,600
殿下，听我的话，忏悔吧
Excellency, listen to me. Make confession.

115
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,940
没这个必要，神父，你都知道的了
Father, there is no need. You know everything already.

116
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,790
忏悔不仅是说出我们的罪过，而且要将其改正
Confession is not the telling of facts, but the repentance of sins.

117
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,250
我知道
I know!

118
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,250
你要我怎样？我是个精力旺盛的男人
What do you expect of me? I'm a vigorous man.

119
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,630
一个每次拥抱前都要在胸口画十字，事后只会说“圣母玛莉亚”的女人…
Can I be content with a woman who in bed crosses herself before an embrace?

120
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,930
是不能给我任何满足感的
And who afterwards can only say: "Jesus Mary".

121
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,930
我跟她生了七个孩子…
I've had seven children by her...seven.

122
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,770
却从没见过她的肚脐！
And, Father, I've never seen her navel.

123
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,770
这公平吗？
Is that fair?

124
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,730
神父，她才是罪人
Is it, Father? She is the sinner.

125
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,290
殿下，我说话直来直去
I was too brusque.

126
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,960
在我面前请注意自己言行
Do not lose your goodwill towards me.

127
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,550
听我的劝告，来忏悔吧
But listen to me: confess.

128
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,970
我不想忏悔
I haven't any intention of confessing.

129
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,970
至少今天不想
At least, not today.

130
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,980
我发现了重大的政治问题
I've made some important political discoveries.

131
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,320
你知道国家在发生什么事吗？没什么
Do you know what's happening in our country? Nothing.

132
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,990
只不过是细微的阶级更替
A barely noticeable substitution of ruling groups.

133
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,330
中产阶级不想消灭我们，他们想取而代之
The middle class doesn't want to destroy us, but to take our place...

134
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:06,000
而且还慷慨地给我们一笔钱
...more politely, and even put thousands of ducats into our pockets.

135
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,670
然后，一切皆回复平常
And then the rest can stay as it is.

136
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,170
神父，国家的命运危在旦夕
Father, ours is a country of compromises.

137
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,680
你们贵族会以牺牲宗教为代价…
In short, you nobles will come to an agreement with the liberals...

138
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,350
与自由党人…
...even with the Masons...

139
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,810
甚至与共济会达成协议
...at our expense. Yes, at the expense of the church...

140
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,690
我们的财产…
...because it's clear that all our wealth...

141
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,690
也就是穷人的收入来源都会被叛党头目掠夺瓜分
...the patrimony of the poor, will be divided among the insolent ringleaders.

142
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:40,030
到时，宗教救济的贫苦大众要靠什么来维生？
Who then will feed the unhappy people whom the church still supports?

143
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,040
怎么安抚这些无法无天的叛党？
What will be done to placate that desperate horde?

144
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,380
先让他们一点点占有你的财产，直至完全占有
They will be given one piece of your land, then another, finally all of it.

145
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:01,390
眼睛失明，上帝能治愈…可心灵失明要靠什么拯救？
Our Lord healed the physically blind, but what about the mentally blind?

146
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,400
神父，我们的心灵并没有失明
We're not mentally blind, dear Father.

147
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,070
我们只是乱世中的凡人
Just human beings in a world of radical change.

148
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,740
我们能做什么？
What must we do?

149
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,370
宗教永垂不朽
The church has been given an explicit promise of immortality.

150
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,710
我们作为一个社会阶级不会永垂不朽
We, as a social class, have not.

151
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,710
说我们会长命百岁，只不过是种慰藉
A palliative that promises us another hundred years is the same as eternity.

152
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,380
在力所能及的范围之外，我们不需承担责任
Beyond what we can caress with our hands we have no obligations.

153
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,930
但宗教有责任，因为宗教是不朽的
The church must have obligations, because it is destined not to die.

154
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,890
宗教给人们含蓄的安慰
In its disappearance there might be some solace.

155
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,730
宗教如果靠牺牲我们…
Do you believe, Father, that if one day the church...

156
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,070
得以拯救自己的话…
...could save itself by sacrificing us it would hesitate to do so?

157
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,400
你以为它不会这样做吗？
It wouldn't hesitate, and it would do well.

158
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,750
星期天，你要为两项罪过忏悔
You'll have two sins to confess to me on Saturday.

159
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,920
一是昨晚的寻欢作乐，二是你今天的想法
A carnal sin last night and a spiritual one today.

160
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,090
看，神父，多美啊！
Look, Father, how beautiful.

161
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,430
单凭维克多·伊曼纽国王是改变不了这奇妙世界的
It will take more than King Victor Emmanuel to change this magic view.

162
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,660
加里波第军万岁！
Long live Garibaldi's men!

163
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,630
救救我！
Help me!

164
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,890
☆他是个警察，是凶手！★他罪有应得
☆He's a policeman, a murderer!★We dealt with him ourselves!

165
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
骑兵队来了
The cavalry!

166
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,320
先别急着开火！
Hold your fire!

167
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,020
冲啊，弟兄们！
Platoons, forward march!

168
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,750
护士小姐，快过来！
Hey, nurse, come here!

169
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,170
敌人往哪边跑了？
Where have they gone?

170
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
已经到港口了
By now they'll be at the port.

171
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,630
你有什么看法，神父？
What do you say, Father?

172
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,090
新时代会让我们过得更好吗？
Will these glorious new times give us better roads?

173
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,140
政府…
Well, the government...

174
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,570
让开！我们过不去！
Clear the road!

175
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,030
谁也不准过去，路被封了
Nobody can pass. It's blocked.

176
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,910
往比萨奇诺的路被封了
The road to Bisaquino is closed.

177
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:44,260
抱歉，这里严禁通过，你们不能再往前走了
I'm sorry, it's forbidden to pass. You can't go any further.

178
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,230
通行证也不行吗？
Evidently our permit is no good.

179
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,230
我可没这么说，所有平民的通行证都要暂缓
I'm not saying that. We've been told all civilian permits are suspended.

180
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,570
我让你回去，你就得回去！
If I tell you to turn back, you have to turn back!

181
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,910
把路障挪开，让马车过去
Clear the road so the carriages can proceed.

182
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,250
谁也不准过去！
Nobody gets through here!

183
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,920
我是塔克罗迪王子，和你们在巴勒莫并肩作战过！
I'm Captain Prince Tancredi Falconari. I fought at Palermo with you.

184
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,920
我有权下军令！
Captain, I have my orders.

185
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,760
这也是军令，快把路障撤走！
This is an order, too. Clear the way!

186
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,910
你和贵族住在一起
You live among the nobility.

187
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,910
他们对革命有什么看法？
What do they say about this huge conflagration?

188
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,920
那位暴躁而自大的萨利纳王子怎么说？
What does our fierce, proud Prince of Salina say?

189
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:54,930
你所说的贵族很难捉摸
The nobility, as you call them, aren't easy to understand.

190
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,930
他们所生活的那个世界…
They live in a world apart, not created by God...

191
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,270
是他们用经历了数个世纪的…
...but by themselves, during centuries of very special experiences...

192
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,940
烦恼和喜悦创造出来的
...of troubles and joys★their joys.

193
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,950
那些你我觉得微不足道的事情…
They get upset or are fascinated by things that to you and me...

194
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,290
对他们却至关重要…
...don't matter at all, but which for them are vital.

195
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,290
我并非说他们是坏人，完全不是
I don't mean the nobles are bad, on the contrary.

196
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,960
他们与众不同
They're different.

197
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,970
我们认为重要的事，他们不会在意…
They don't care about certain things which are very important to us...

198
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,300
我们觉得无所谓的事，他们反而担心
...and maybe they have fears we're ignorant of.

199
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,970
比如说，在萨利纳王子看来…
The Prince of Salina, for example.

200
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:45,600
若赶不去杜纳福卡特度假，那简直是个悲剧
He couldn't give up his holiday in Donnafugata. That's where we're going.

201
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,940
但要是问他如何看待革命…
But if you ask him what he thinks, of the revolution...

202
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,330
他会说并没有革命，一切依然如故
...he says there's no revolution, everything will go on as before.

203
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:04,960
但愿如此吧
That's the last straw.

204
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,290
我们还是来看祈祷书吧
Let's read the breviary. It's better.

205
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,960
我来看看…
Let's see...

206
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,630
《旧约·诗篇》第四十四篇
Psalm 45.

207
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,970
“我的心激情澎湃，我做的事让君主动容”
My heart overfloweth, I speak of the things I have made touching the king.

208
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,980
“我的舌头犹如作家手中之笔”
My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

209
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:27,980
“你比世人更美”
Thou art fairer than the children of men.

210
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:32,320
“在你嘴里满有恩惠，神永远赐福予你”
Grace is poured into thy lips, God hath blessed thee for ever.

211
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,060
快点
Quickly, lads.

212
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,280
铺好点，你去拿酒，你拿酒杯
Spread it neatly. You fetch the bottles, and you the glasses.

213
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,760
希望一切能合您的心意
We hope that everything is just as you want it.

214
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,090
很高兴又和您见面了，殿下
I'm delighted to see you again, Excellency.

215
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,100
现在我们稍作休息
Now we'll just rest a little.

216
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,770
你们可在树下用餐
You can eat beneath the trees.

217
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,730
一小时后继续赶赴杜纳福卡特，那些士兵经过这儿吗？
We'll leave for Donnafugata in an hour. Tell me about the soldiers...

218
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:38,070
这里比阿尔及利亚更糟
It's worse than in Algeria.

219
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,740
这里和阿尔及利亚不同，亲爱的
It's different from Algeria, my dear.

220
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,080
你不想梳洗一番吗？
Wouldn't you like to refresh yourself?

221
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,090
把额头和太阳穴擦擦
Try bathing your temples.

222
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,110
我们快去吃饭吧，不然就没东西吃了
Let's join the others, or we'll find nothing left to eat.

223
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,800
你饿吗？
Aren't you hungry?

224
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:09,240
我跟大家说：“殿下今年不会离开巴勒莫”
I told everyone: "His Excellency won't leave Palermo this year."

225
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:12,830
“时局如此动乱，怎么能旅游呢？”
"How do you expect them to travel in times like these?"

226
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,170
“殿下及其家人发生了何事？”
"Who knows what will happen to His Excellency? May God protect him!"

227
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,340
不过你们都安然无恙
But you're all safe and sound.

228
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,840
感谢上帝
I thank God.

229
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:29,180
你以为我们出什么事了？一切都很平常
What did you expect to happen to us? It was all very simple.

230
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:35,520
实际上，加里波第进入巴勒莫后不久…
In fact, a few days after Garibaldi's entry into Palermo...

231
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,860
塔克罗迪邀请一位托斯卡纳将军来家作客
...Tancredi brought home a nice Tuscan general...

232
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,860
将军想欣赏别墅里的壁画
...who wanted to admire the frescos at the villa...

233
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,200
还帮我们拿到了去杜纳福卡特的通行证
...and he proved useful in obtaining permits for Donnafugata.

234
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,870
将军能光临寒舍，我们深感荣幸
We are most happy to receive you in our home, General.

235
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
谢谢你，殿下
Thank you, Excellency.

236
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:08,550
他称呼你为殿下…这违反了加里波第的首条军规
He called you "Excellency". He's never broken Garibaldi's orders before.

237
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,230
将军，我外甥跟我说您想看看壁画
General, my nephew has told me that you would like to see the frescos.

238
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:28,030
☆是的，殿下★我们现在就看吧
☆Very much, Excellency.★Let's do it at once.

239
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,540
中间是朱庇特和朱诺，还有战神，爱神和墨丘利
In the centre, Jupiter and Juno, Mars, Venus and Mercury.

240
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,790
那边是海神和森林女神，接着是西蒂斯
On the other side, Tethys preceded by a group of tritons and dryads.

241
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:46,880
被云环绕的太阳神，所有这些都让萨利纳宫殿金壁生辉
Apollo surrounded by clouds, and all exalting the house of Salina's glory.

242
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,900
要薄荷糖吗？
Would you like another mint caramel?

243
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,900
谢谢，我最喜欢了
Thank you, they're just the sort I like.

244
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
我特地为你准备的
I brought them especially for you.

245
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:34,260
他脸色很苍白，伤得真不重吗？
How pale you are. Was your wound really not serious?

246
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,930
什么？
Pardon?

247
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:50,110
能够被提拔，受点伤也值得
It's worth being wounded to become promoted on the battlefield.

248
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,520
马车来了！
The carriages are coming!

249
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,060
欢迎您，殿下
I am happy to welcome your excellencies.

250
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,600
奥诺弗利奥，你还好吗？
Don Onofrio! How are we?

251
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,360
还好，我将把这里的宫殿…
Excellency, I hand you back the palace...

252
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,530
原封不动地交还于您
...in the exact state in which it was left.

253
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:20,220
能和巴勒莫受伤的英雄握手，我倍感荣幸
I am proud to shake the hand of the hero wounded fighting at Palermo.

254
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:24,220
受伤！我成为军官是因为有只虫子飞进了眼睛
Wounded? They made me a captain because I got a gnat in my eye.

255
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,350
卡洛吉罗，我知道你付出了很多
You've done much for the cause, Don Calogero.

256
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,230
克里斯彼对你赞誉有加
Crispi speaks very highly of you.

257
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:44,240
亲爱的特雷斯纳，再见到你真是太好了
Dear Teresina, what a pleasure to see you again.

258
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:49,580
还有你，有什么消息吗，希斯奥？
And you, of course, Don Ciccio. What news?

259
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,590
消息？我不大清楚，殿下
News? I haven't any, Excellency.

260
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,260
我先失陪一下
Will you excuse me now?

261
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:31,180
别忘了派今晚宴会的请柬，女士们都要来
Remember to invite them to dinner tonight, with their wives.

262
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,180
☆为什么？★这样最好
☆Why the wives?★It's better.

263
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,850
邀请卡洛吉罗，叫他携夫人出席
Invite Don Calogero and tell him to bring his wife.

264
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,190
公证人及其夫人
The lawyer with his wife.

265
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,530
还有希斯奥，还好他没有夫人
Don Ciccio, who thank God hasn't a wife.

266
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,530
请其他人晚餐后过来
All the others to come after dinner.

267
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,810
☆谁？★殿下，是我，米米
☆What is it?★It's Mimi, Excellency.

268
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,150
皮诺神父想即刻见您
Father Pirrone asks to see you at once.

269
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,150
好吧，让他进来
All right. Show him in.

270
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:20,250
对不起，殿下，我不知道你在沐浴
I beg your pardon, Excellency. I didn't know.

271
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,370
没关系，神父
Don't be shocked, Father.

272
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:26,420
你习惯面对赤裸的灵魂，赤裸的身体更加无罪
You're used to souls being bared. Bare bodies are much more innocent.

273
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,170
把毛巾拿给我
Just give me the towel.

274
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,980
别不好意思，神父
Go on, be brave, Father.

275
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,190
用点力，神父
Brisker, Father.

276
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,200
听我一句劝，偶尔自己洗一下澡
Take my advice: take a bath yourself now and then.

277
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,870
请坐
Take a seat, then.

278
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,550
这么急着见我有什么事？
Tell me why you wanted to talk to me so urgently.

279
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,890
有人委以我一个很棘手的任务
I have been entrusted with a very delicate mission.

280
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:22,890
您的一位宝贝向我吐露心声
A person very dear to you wanted to open her heart to me, to tell you...

281
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:28,900
看在您对我关心的份上，让我告诉你…
She has faith, perhaps mistaken, in the esteem with which you honour me.

282
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,860
不要拐弯抹角的
Can't you be more concise?

283
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,900
你说的是谁？是王妃吗？
Who are you referring to? The Princess?

284
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,240
不是，殿下，王妃很累，她正在休息
No, Excellency. The Princess is very tired and she is resting now.

285
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,250
是康塞塔小姐
It concerns signorina Concetta.

286
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,750
她堕入情网了
She is in love.

287
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,920
康塞塔？到底怎么回事？
Signorina Concetta? But how...

288
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
胡说
Oh, such foolishness.

289
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,350
对不起，让您担心了
I regret having disturbed you.

290
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,930
我觉得…
I did not think...

291
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:09,560
一个自认为很年轻的四十五岁人…
At forty-five a man may still think he's young...

292
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,900
当他意识到自己孩子已到了恋爱年龄时…
...until he realizes his children are old enough to fall in love.

293
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:17,780
突然之间，他就变得老了
Then old age suddenly comes crashing down on him.

294
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:28,580
你还没问康塞塔小姐喜欢上了哪个年轻人
You haven't asked me who the young man is, whom Concetta...

295
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,920
不用告诉我
There's no need.

296
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,930
傻孩子！她为何不亲自来告诉我？
Why didn't that stupid girl come to tell me?

297
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,600
你觉得我应该怎么说？
Well, in your opinion, what should I say?

298
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:52,560
教堂绝对支持建立基督教家庭
The desire to found a Christian family is most welcome to the church.

299
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,940
上帝对于婚姻…
The presence of Our Lord at the wedding in Cana...

300
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,950
别扯远了，神父，我说的是我女儿的婚姻
Let us not digress, Father. I intend to speak about this marriage...

301
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,620
不是宗教婚姻，也不是一般的婚姻
...not the wedding in Cana, nor marriage in general.

302
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,460
塔克罗迪有向她求婚吗？
Has Don Tancredi made a definite proposal? When?

303
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,630
没有正式求婚，殿下
Well, Excellency, not actually a proposal

304
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,420
但康塞塔小姐很坚定，他的一举一动，匆匆一瞥…
But Concetta has no doubts. His attentions, his looks...

305
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:23,140
他说的每句话，她确定他是爱她的
...certain words... she is sure he loves her...

306
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,970
觉得他很快就会向她求婚
...and feels he will propose at any moment.

307
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:30,480
别担心，神父，危险没那么快会来
Don't worry, Father, there's no immediate danger.

308
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,980
这些不过是女孩子的浪漫幻想
These are the fantasies of a romantic schoolgirl.

309
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,360
为什么说“危险”？
But why "danger", Excellency?

310
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:44,160
你能想像康塞塔成为维也纳或彼得堡的大使夫人吗
Can you imagine her as an ambassador's wife in Vienna, or St. Petersburg?

311
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,990
我喜欢康塞塔…
I love Concetta. I like her.

312
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,330
文静顺从
So placid, so submissive.

313
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:54,330
但塔克罗迪前途一片光明
But Tancredi has a great future before him.

314
00:56:56,090 --> 00:57:00,840
她那么顺从害羞，又怎么能够…
How can Concetta, so passively virtuous, so shy and reserved...

315
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:06,350
帮助雄心勃勃的丈夫登上飞黄腾达的仕途？
...help an ambitious husband ascend the slippery steps of a new society?

316
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,680
塔克罗迪需要钱
Tancredi will find money useful.

317
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,690
康塞塔当然会有嫁妆
Concetta has her dowry, of course.

318
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,690
但我的家产要分成七份…
But the Salina fortune will have to be divided into seven parts.

319
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:21,030
远远不够塔克罗迪所需要的
I repeat, seven parts. Tancredi needs something else entirely.

320
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,700
苏特拉的女孩怎么样？
One of the Sutera girls, perhaps?

321
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:32,830
是，我知道，很普通，但却很有钱！
Yes, I know. They're so ugly, poor things, but so rich.

322
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,040
不过什么？爱情？
But what? Love?

323
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:44,260
当然了，一年的热情，随后是三十年的平淡
Of course, love. Fire and flame for one year, ashes for thirty.

324
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:49,100
爱情就是这么回事
I also know what love is.

325
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:54,440
殿下，您要穿哪套衣服去参加晚宴？
Excellency, which clothes will you wear for dinner?

326
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,030
神父，跟康塞塔说我没有生气
Father, you'll tell Concetta I'm not at all annoyed...

327
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,030
如果不全是幻想，我们迟点再讨论
...but we'll discuss it when we are sure it's not romantic fantasy.

328
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,370
穿午后服
What suit? One for evening wear.

329
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:47,410
爸爸，卡洛吉罗穿着燕尾服上楼来了！
Papa! Don Calogero's coming up the stairs★in tails!

330
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,750
这比马沙拉登陆更让人吃惊
This news has impressed you more than the landing at Marsala.

331
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:05,090
卡洛吉罗打着白领结，这是革命的象征
Don Calogero in white tie. The sign of the revolution on the march.

332
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,270
他穿着晚礼服，你们仔细看看
Yes, it's true, in tails. But look at them.

333
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,110
还有鞋子
And the shoes.

334
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:34,450
☆我妻子身体抱恙，她感冒了★真遗憾
☆My wife is unwell. A slight cold.★I'm very sorry.

335
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:40,040
我带了女儿安杰莉卡来，请见谅
I hope you will excuse me if my daughter Angelica comes in her place.

336
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,460
没关系，快请
But certainly. Come in.

337
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:53,140
上个月，她一直都在说，希望接受您的接见
For a month she's talked of the pleasure it would give her to come.

338
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:58,140
我记得那时她还小，是个可爱的小姑娘
I remember her well as a very pretty little girl.

339
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,810
很高兴能再见到她
We shall be happy to see her again.

340
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:22,210
我女儿马上就到，她还没打扮好
She will be here in a moment, she wasn't quite ready.

341
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,880
我们家离这里很近
Our house is just over the road, as you know.

342
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:29,170
我们等她来
Yes, Don Calogero. We'll wait for her.

343
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,600
正如我所言，教堂急需修葺
As I told you, the church is really in a sorry state.

344
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:20,560
真美
Lovely.

345
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,900
我的安杰莉卡
My Angelica.

346
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:39,240
好久不见，你越变越美了
I haven't seen you for so long. You have changed... and not for the worse.

347
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,250
安杰莉卡小姐，我们无比荣幸…
We are very fortunate, signorina Angelica...

348
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:51,260
能邀请到如此美人光顾寒舍
...to welcome such a lovely flower into our home.

349
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:55,930
希望你有机会能常来作客
I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you very often.

350
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:02,890
谢谢你，殿下，谢谢你一直那么关照我和我父亲
Thank you, Prince. You are as kind to me as you have always been to Papa.

351
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,900
你好吗，康塞塔小姐？
How do you do, signorina Concetta?

352
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:17,570
安杰莉卡，我们跟小时候不同了
Angelica, as children we were never so formal.

353
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:33,920
伯爵，请让我介绍小女给你认识
Your Grace, allow me to present my daughter Angelica.

354
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,640
请各位入席
Dinner is served.

355
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,640
传统的千层饼
Several layers, as tradition demands.

356
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,360
☆路上累吗？★不是很累
☆Was the journey very tiring?★Not unduly.

357
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:34,320
对不起，饭菜很快就端来
They haven't served you yet, I'm sorry.

358
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:39,320
☆那姑娘真漂亮★是的，康塞塔很漂亮
☆A beautiful daughter.★Yes, Concetta.

359
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,990
我那座正在建造的乡下小屋外观虽然简陋…
The villa I'm having built outside the village will be modest, but...

360
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:49,540
不过却很舒适
...very comfortable.

361
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,340
我们饿坏了，先喝口美味的汤
How hungry we are. A good thing we didn't start with soup.

362
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:04,680
令人难忘的日子
Unforgettable days, I tell you.

363
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:08,690
只有一句暗号：武器和武装部队
Only one word of command, from mouth to mouth: arms and soldiers.

364
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:14,230
将军已经意识到西西里岛的商业价值
The General realized that when Sicilians get going, they do it well.

365
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,700
为何加入加里波第的部队
Why did you join Garibaldi?

366
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:25,910
“加里波第唯一的愿望就是和你并肩作战”
"If Garibaldi is your brother-in-arms he wants only to fight at your side."

367
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:30,920
加里波第是这样说的，不过我没想过路途会那么艰辛
Those are his own words. I did not think it would be so strenuous.

368
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:36,210
晚上在吉比罗沙行军，我从没走过那么远的路
I've never walked so much. Oh, the night march to Gibilrossa...

369
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,380
你遇到比克肖人了？
Did you meet Bixio?

370
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,220
他们很坚决
What a determined man.

371
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,050
他们信念坚定，作战勇猛
All of them determined and extraordinary.

372
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:49,060
比克肖和拉玛沙人交战时，我刚好在场
The scene between Bixio and La Masa, at which I just happened to be present.

373
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:52,650
特米尼沦陷时，我也在那儿作了短暂停留
And I was briefly at the taking of Termini.

374
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,110
当时我真是大开了眼界
I enjoyed myself enormously, believe me.

375
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,690
最有意思的是五月二十八日
We had the biggest laugh on 28th May.

376
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:42,780
将军要在修道院部署一个岗哨
The General needed a lookout post in the Origlione monastery.

377
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:47,450
我们敲门，拍门，诅咒…但她们就是不开门
We knocked, we swore★nobody answered the door.

378
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:50,790
那是隐居的修道院
It was a convent for a closed order of nuns.

379
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:57,130
对了，神父…
By the way, Reverend...

380
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:02,760
我们明天要去柯贝拉院长的坟前作祷告
...tomorrow we'll pray at the tomb of the reverend mother Corbera.

381
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:06,760
好，那些修女…
Excellent. Those good nuns...

382
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:10,770
已经获知殿下即将驾到
...have already been informed to expect your excellencies.

383
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,890
她们都在准备恭迎您的大驾
They're in a flurry of preparation for your visit.

384
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:18,770
我们都是到这里的次日就去那儿的
We've never missed going there the day after our arrival.

385
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:31,120
后来怎么样了？
And then? What happened?

386
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,460
我来告诉你
I'll tell you.

387
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:40,800
塔索尼，阿尔吉格第，我和其他几个人…
Tassoni, Aldrighetti and I and someone else...

388
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:44,260
试图破门而入，但没有工具
...tried to break down the door, to no avail.

389
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,140
我们在附近的房子里找了根木梁
So we ran to get a beam from a shelled house nearby.

390
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:52,470
最后门被打开了
Finally, with an infernal din, the door gave way.

391
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,770
我们进去，看不到一个人
We entered. Everywhere was deserted.

392
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:58,900
突然，从修道院的走廊那边…
Suddenly we heard desperate twitterings...

393
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,940
传来一阵阵尖叫声
...from around the corner of a corridor.

394
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:05,320
修女们躲在礼拜堂里，在圣坛旁挤成一团
Taking refuge in the chapel, the nuns were piled up against the altar.

395
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,580
天知道她们为何害怕年轻小伙子
Who knows what they feared from those ten fed-up young lads.

396
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:19,500
她们穿着黑色长袍，又老又丑…
It was comic to see them, old and ugly as they were...

397
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,840
眼中充满恐惧，全都做好了…
...with their black habits, startled eyes, all ready and willing...

398
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,170
殉难的准备
...for martyrdom...

399
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,220
她们像狗一样呜咽
...whining like bitches.

400
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,680
这时候塔索尼喊道…
Our handsome Tassoni yelled:

401
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:41,520
“我们没时间，修女！等这里有新修女我们再回来”
"We've no time, sisters. We'll return when you've got us some young novices."

402
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:46,530
我们大笑不止
All the boys fell about laughing.

403
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:50,530
离开修道院后，我们便去和皇家军作战了
We left the disappointed nuns and went to fire on the king's troops.

404
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:53,160
十分钟后我就受伤了
Ten minutes later I was wounded.

405
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:56,620
真希望我当时也在场
How I wish I'd been there with you all.

406
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:01,880
如果你在那儿，我们就不用等新修女了
If you'd been there, there would have been no need to wait for novices.

407
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:47,590
塔克罗迪，这些下流故事可以说给告解神父听…
Tancredi. Such crude stories should be told to your confessor.

408
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,590
而不是在饭桌上说给年轻女士听
You do not tell them to young ladies at table.

409
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,590
至少我在场时就不行
At least, not when I am present.

410
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:28,310
他说得对，我会帮他
He's right, I agree, and I'll help him, too.

411
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:39,990
不得不承认，这有点不光彩
But it can't be denied he's a little ignoble.

412
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:47,630
亲爱的吉古嘉
Oh, the lovely Gigogin.

413
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:09,310
十五岁时，她献出了贞操
At fifteen she made love.

414
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:17,660
我心中充满欢喜
Take a step forward, darling of my heart.

415
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:25,660
十六岁时，她结婚了
At sixteen she got married.

416
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:33,170
走向前一步，我心爱的宝贝
Take a step forward, darling of my heart.

417
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:40,680
十七岁时离开了丈夫
At seventeen I left.

418
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:49,020
走向前一步，我心爱的宝贝
Take a step forward, darling of my heart.

419
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:56,030
意大利万岁，加里波第万岁！
Long live Italy! Long live Garibaldi!

420
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:25,060
别愁眉苦脸的，我们不是去参加葬礼
Don't be so sad, Father. We aren't following a funeral.

421
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:29,060
风太大了
The wind... this dreadful wind.

422
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:33,730
你应该感谢上帝，没有风，空气就会充满恶臭
Thank the Lord. Without wind the air would be fetid.

423
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:05,430
按照秩序来投票，先到者先投
You must vote in an orderly fashion. The first to arrive vote first.

424
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:15,110
杜纳福卡特公民选举
The Cavour of Donnafugata.

425
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:24,070
殿下，您能来我们万分荣幸
Excellency, this is a great honour for me.

426
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,140
不用，皮诺神父不是这里的居民
No. Father Pirrone is not resident here.

427
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:51,480
投票推迟几分钟
Voting is suspended for a few minutes.

428
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,230
殿下能否赏个薄面…
May I have the honour...

429
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:57,820
进房喝杯薄酒？
...of inviting you for modest refreshment?

430
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:24,300
喝白葡萄酒酒精度应该低点
I think the white will be lighter.

431
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:26,640
向波旁皇室致敬
A late homage to the Bourbon flag.

432
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:33,480
我今天不能喝酒，我的胃很痛
I really cannot drink today. I have a most aggravating stomach upset.

433
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:37,480
今天是个大日子，你的胃痛算得了什么！
That's of secondary importance on such a day.

434
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,820
谢谢，我从不喝酒
Thank you, I never drink.

435
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:49,490
很荣幸，谢谢你的招待
Don Calogero, for my part I accept with pleasure.

436
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:58,830
我想说几句…
I'd like to say a few words...

437
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:03,840
但殿下，心中的喜悦实在无以言表
...but great joys, Prince, are silent.

438
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:39,210
我心情十分激动
It is with great emotion that I perform this task.

439
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:45,550
请允许我在此宣布…
I have the very great honour...

440
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:51,430
杜纳福卡特公民投票的结果
...to announce the result of the plebiscite of our community.

441
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:06,900
一八六〇年十月二十二日晚上六点…
In the year 1860, 22nd October, in Donnafugata...

442
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,570
在杜纳福卡特
...at six p.m...

443
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:13,240
地方选举委员会…
...the municipal electoral committee met...

444
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:17,000
核查了城里所有选民…
...to examine the votes given in the plebiscite...

445
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:20,250
进行公民投票的结果
...by the population of this community.

446
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:26,260
西西里岛人民希望意大利团结统一…
The Sicilian people want Italy to be one and indivisible...

447
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,430
维克多·伊曼纽…
...with Victor Emmanuel...

448
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:33,930
作为意大利立宪制君主，他的合法后嗣继承王位
...as constitutional monarch, and his legitimate descendants.

449
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:55,280
所有选票都已统计完毕…
All the votes having been taken and due...

450
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:14,640
投票结果亦已经过详细审核…
All the votes having been taken and due scrutiny made...

451
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:20,640
现选举结果如下…
...the following results have been obtained.

452
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:24,980
登记选民：五百一十五人
Electors registered: 515.

453
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:29,150
实际投票：五百一十二票
Votes cast: 512.

454
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,320
赞成票：五百一十二票！
Voting YES: 512.

455
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,330
反对票：零票！
Voting NO: zero.

456
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:30,400
希斯奥，二十一号你投了什么票？
And you, Don Ciccio, how did you vote on the 21st?

457
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:41,950
你怕什么？这里没有其他人，只有风和猎犬
What are you afraid of? There's only us, the wind and the dogs.

458
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,750
你这样问毫无意义
Excuse me, but your question is pointless.

459
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,750
杜纳福卡特每个人都投了赞成票
You know very well everyone in Donnafugata votes YES.

460
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:54,420
甚至有人说是你建议大家这样投票
It's even said that you advised waverers to vote that way.

461
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,090
没错
That's very true.

462
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,760
你投了赞成票？
So you voted YES?

463
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:17,110
不，殿下，我投了反对票
No, Excellency. I voted NO.

464
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:20,360
一百次反对票！
No, a hundred times no.

465
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,450
我知道你跟我说过…
All right, I know what you told me.

466
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:30,460
必要性，团结，机遇，也许你是对的
For necessity, unity and opportunity. Perhaps you were right.

467
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:34,130
我不懂政治，所以我不插足政治
I don't understand politics and I leave these things to others.

468
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,800
但我希斯奥·杜梅是个老实人…
But Ciccio Tumeo is a gentleman.

469
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:44,470
是个卑微的画家，穷困潦倒，穿着破烂不堪的裤子…
A failed artist, poor and miserable, with worn-out trousers...

470
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:51,140
但我不会忘记所受的恩惠
...but I hadn't forgotten benefits received, you know that, Excellency.

471
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:55,480
你知道，是伊莉莎白女皇…
It was Queen Isabella, the Spanish one...

472
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:59,820
是卡拉布里亚的西班牙女公爵让我有机会学习…
...who then was Duchess of Calabria★she made me study...

473
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:03,820
让我活到现在…
...and allowed me to be where I am today...

474
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:08,500
让我成为教堂的风琴师，让我承蒙殿下您的庇护
...organist at the Holy Church, paid by the kindness of Your Excellency.

475
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:17,170
在物资匮乏的年代，我母亲向法院请愿…
In the years when our need was great, my mother sent an entreaty to Court...

476
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:22,180
结果得到了五盎司金币，这千真万确
...and financial assistance arrived, as sure as death.

477
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:29,520
如果现在那些国王皇后瞧不起我们，他们会怎么说？
If those kings and queens looked down from heaven, what would they say?

478
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:36,520
说里昂纳多·杜梅的儿子背叛了他们？不
That the son of Leonardo Tomeo betrayed them? No!

479
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,230
不会，殿下
No, Excellency.

480
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:43,160
幸运的是，没人知道真相！
Thank goodness, the truth is known in paradise.

481
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:50,790
我敬佩你的忠心和虔诚
I admire your loyalty and devotion.

482
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:56,540
但你得明白加里波第的胜利让人们过度兴奋
But understand that people are over- excited by this Garibaldi's victory.

483
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,550
当前，全民公投是治愈无政府局势的唯一药方
The plebiscite was the only and urgent remedy against anarchy. Believe me.

484
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,550
我们的罪恶是次要的
For us it's only a lesser evil.

485
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:09,220
毕竟，萨瓦…
The Savoyards, basically...

486
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,560
仍然是君主制
...are a monarchy.

487
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:17,190
我承认，你所爱人们的利益…
The interests of the people you love, to whom you are devoted...

488
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,190
的确被这些事情所破坏了…
...emerge from these events thwarted, I agree...

489
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:24,860
但他们还活着，还很健康
...but still alive, still valid.

490
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:30,870
万物要保持永恒
Something had to change...

491
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:36,210
就必须作出改变
...so that everything might remain as it was before.

492
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:44,220
革命已经结束，但愿今天的意大利能繁荣昌盛
The revolution's work is done. Let's hope new Italy can live and prosper.

493
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:48,300
我不同意
But I voted NO.

494
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:53,560
市政厅的混蛋压制了我的意见，肆意对我口诛笔伐
The town hall pigs swallowed my opinion and shat it out as they chose.

495
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:59,230
我说黑，他们却让我说白
I said "black" and they've made me say "white".

496
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:05,570
我曾经是个“忠臣”，现在却成了“无耻的波旁拥党”
I was a "loyal subject" and I've become a "foul Bourbon".

497
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:09,240
他们现在都是萨瓦人
Now, they're all Savoyards.

498
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:15,250
但对我来说，萨瓦人只是棵菜！
Savoyards! I eat them for breakfast!

499
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:26,260
听我说，你很了解这里的人
Tell me something. You see so many in the district.

500
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:30,600
你觉得卡洛吉罗怎么样？
What do you really think of Don Calogero?

501
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:36,600
我想我已经清楚表达了我的意见
I thought I'd shown my opinion clearly enough.

502
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,940
我有兴趣知道他和他家的真相
I'd be quite interested to know the truth about him and his family.

503
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:50,950
殿下，真相就是，他很有钱…
The truth, Excellency, is that Don Calogero is very rich...

504
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:54,950
也很有影响力
...and also very influential.

505
01:23:56,290 --> 01:24:00,630
他是个吝啬鬼，却像魔鬼般机灵
Avaricious, and fiendishly intelligent, too.

506
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:07,970
你该看看他去年四五月的模样，他像蝙蝠一样来往穿梭
You should have seen him in April and May, swooping about like a bat.

507
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:13,640
坐马车，骑马，骑骡子，走路，风雨无阻
In a carriage, riding a mule, or on foot, rain or shine.

508
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:17,640
他经过的地方，便会结成秘密组织…
Wherever he went, secret groups were formed...

509
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:21,310
为将要来的人铺路
...preparing the way for those who were to come.

510
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:24,980
他是个灾难！
A scourge of God, Excellency.

511
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:29,650
这只是他事业的开始
We've only seen the start of Don Calogero's career.

512
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:34,660
再过几个月，他会成为都灵议会的议员
In a few months, he'll be a member of the parliament in Turin.

513
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:40,670
再过几年，当教会财产被拍卖时…
In a few years, when the church's property is auctioned off...

514
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,340
他不费分文…
...for a handful of coins...

515
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:47,670
就能占有马拉及冯达希罗的资产
...he'll pick up their land at Fondacello...

516
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:53,680
最后，他会成为全省最大的地主
...and become the biggest landowner in the province.

517
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:57,680
这就是卡洛吉罗
There, that's who Don Calogero is...

518
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:02,020
未来的主宰者
...an example of the new man.

519
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,980
这样有点可惜
It's a pity he has to be like that.

520
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:16,030
他家的其他人怎么样？
And the rest of the family? What are the others like?

521
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:20,370
这些年没人见过他妻子
Nobody has seen Calogero's wife for years.

522
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:22,920
也许只有我才见过
Except myself, perhaps.

523
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:28,050
只有做弥撒时她才会出门，都是在早上五点没人的时候
She comes out only to go to first Mass, at five, when no one's about.

524
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:33,050
我有次故意很早起床去看她
Once I got up early specially, just to see her.

525
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:38,390
她像太阳般一样美丽！
Word of honour, she's as beautiful as the sun.

526
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:45,060
你不能责怪卡洛吉罗…不让妻子与别人接触
You can't blame him, cockroach though he is, for keeping her from other men.

527
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:50,400
但天下没有不漏风的墙
But even from the best-guarded houses...

528
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:53,740
闲言碎语不时从仆人口中说出
...word trickles out, servants talk.

529
01:25:54,820 --> 01:26:00,080
唐娜·帕斯蒂安娜像只动物
It seems that Donna Bastiana is a kind of animal.

530
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:05,420
她不会看书写字，也不知道时间，她只会说话
Illiterate, can't tell the time, she hardly knows how to speak.

531
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:08,750
她甚至不会喜欢女儿
She's incapable, too, of loving her daughter.

532
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:14,090
一无是处，除了在床上
Good for bed, and that's all.

533
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:19,720
不过，你知道她是谁的女儿吗？
Besides, it can't be otherwise. Do you know whose daughter she was?

534
01:26:20,730 --> 01:26:23,390
她是伦奇一个农民的女儿
One of your share-croppers at Runci.

535
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,060
她父亲名叫派波·吉安塔
Peppe Giunta his name was.

536
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:33,610
他野蛮无耻，大家都叫他派波·牛粪
He was so foul-smelling and uncouth, everyone called him Peppe Shit.

537
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,410
请原谅我语言粗俗
Excuse the word, Excellency.

538
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:42,080
卡洛吉罗和帕斯蒂安娜私奔两年后…
Two years after Don Calogero ran off with Bastiana...

539
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:48,080
人们发现她父亲死了，背上中了十二枪
...Peppe was found dead with twelve shotgun pellets in his back.

540
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:56,430
我还指望他和康塞塔结婚呢！
And I hoped that Tancredi would marry Concetta.

541
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:00,430
他是叛党，那些自由党人都是！
He's a traitor, like all such liberals.

542
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:04,770
他先背叛国王，现在背叛我们
First he betrayed the king, and now us.

543
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:08,770
他有一副说谎者的嘴脸…
He with his false face...

544
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:13,780
甜言蜜语，道德败坏！
...with his words dripping honey and his actions dripping poison.

545
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:16,780
家里有个不同宗的亲戚…
This is what happens...

546
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:21,120
就会有这样的后果
...when you take into your house people not of your own blood.

547
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:37,470
我一直都这样说，但没人听我的！
I always said so, but nobody listens to me.

548
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:42,470
我受不了这种花花公子！他让你昏了头！
I never could stand that dandy. You alone were enamoured of him.

549
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:47,140
他居然还好意思请你这个舅舅…
And now he has the effrontery to ask you, his uncle, Prince of Salina...

550
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:51,650
请他欺骗的那个女孩的父亲，去向那个混蛋提亲…
...father of the girl he's deceived, to take his proposal to that rogue...

551
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:57,490
去向那个荡妇的父亲提亲！你不能这么做！
...the father of that trollop... Fabrizio, you shall not do it!

552
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:08,790
你知道自己在说什么吗！安杰莉卡不是荡妇
You don't know what you're saying. Angelica is not a trollop.

553
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:15,460
将来的事说不准，但现在她和其他女孩一样…
She may become one, but now she's like any other girl, only more beautiful...

554
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:19,130
比其他女孩更美丽，她只希望嫁个好男人
...who simply wants to make a good marriage.

555
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:23,350
她也可以和其他女孩一样，爱上塔克罗迪
Maybe she's a little in love with our Tancredi, as they all are, after all.

556
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:25,850
她有很多钱
And she has a lot of money, Stella.

557
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:31,190
卡洛吉罗管理着我们大部分的财产…
Our money, largely, administered well, too well even, by Don Calogero.

558
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,270
塔克罗迪需要这笔钱
Tancredi needs that money.

559
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:37,860
他是名绅士，他雄心勃勃
He's a nobleman, ambitious, spendthrift. He needs a lot of money.

560
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,990
他从未向康塞塔承诺过什么，所以不存在背叛
As for Concetta, he's never said anything to her, so he's no traitor.

561
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:48,870
他只是顺应时势…政治生涯和感情生活都是如此
He moves with his times, that's all. Both in politics and in private life.

562
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:55,210
而且，他是个招人喜欢的年轻人，这点你也知道
Besides, he's the dearest young man I know. Even you know that.

563
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:41,260
我不想在家里听到任何哭声！在我房里或是床上！
I want no whimpering in my house, either in my room or in my bed.

564
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:45,930
不要再说“你不能这样”，我决定了
No more "You shall not do it". I make the decisions.

565
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:50,270
我很早前就决定了，不要再提这件事
I decided this long ago. And now no more about it.

566
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:00,940
睡吧
Now let us sleep.

567
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:08,620
明天我去打猎，得早起
Tomorrow I am getting up early to go hunting.

568
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:50,620
你说了很多他们的事，野蛮的母亲，无耻的祖父
You've told me about them all: wild mothers and faecal grandfathers...

569
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:55,620
但我感兴趣的是…安杰莉卡小姐
...but nothing about what interests me, about Angelica.

570
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:01,300
没什么好说的，显而易见
There's nothing to say. She speaks for herself.

571
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:07,640
她继承了母亲的美貌，摒弃了祖父的恶习，是位真正的淑女
Her mother's beauty without her grandfather's stench. A real lady.

572
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:13,980
她从学校放假回来，曾邀请我去她家跳老式的玛祖卡舞
When she returned from college she played me the old mazurka I wrote.

573
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:19,310
看到她让人心情愉悦
She played badly, but to see her was a delight...

574
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:24,320
黑色的长发，漂亮的眼睛，光滑的皮肤，丰满的胸部
...with her black hair, those eyes, that skin, that bosom.

575
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:27,990
与那些凡尘女子有着天壤之别
Some difference from the stink of goats.

576
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,330
她的味道像天堂般美妙
Her sheets must have the fragrance of paradise.

577
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:34,660
冷静点
Calm down, Don Ciccio.

578
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:39,040
从现在起，不能对她有非份之想
From now on you'll have to speak of Angelica with all due respect.

579
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:45,340
今天，我会代表塔克罗迪去向卡洛吉罗提亲
This very day I'm asking Calogero for her hand for my nephew Tancredi.

580
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:50,010
你是第一个知道的，但要为这种特权付出代价
You're the first to know, but you'll pay for this privilege.

581
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:53,350
我会把你跟狗关在军械室里…
You'll be locked up in the gun-room with the dogs...

582
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:58,020
直到我见完卡洛吉罗，我不想走漏半点风声
...until after Calogero's visit. I want nothing to leak out in advance.

583
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:02,690
这样做太无耻了
This is disgraceful, obscene.

584
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:09,360
他不能娶你敌人的女儿为妻，那些人一直都反对你
He can't marry the daughter of your enemies. They've always opposed you.

585
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:16,040
引诱她也许是种征服，但娶她则是无条件投降
If he seduced her, that would be a conquest, but this is pure surrender.

586
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,630
这是法康利和萨利纳家族的终结
It's the end of the Falconeri family and the Salinas.

587
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:39,390
这并非一切的终结，而是开始
The marriage is not the end of anything, but the start.

588
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,730
婚姻是最好的解决办法
And it's in our best traditions.

589
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:48,740
有些事情你不明白
These are things you can't understand.

590
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:55,410
回家吧，你记得答应过我什么？
Let's go home. And we're agreed, aren't we?

591
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:45,790
别反客为主，区区一个吻何足大惊小怪！
Let there be no misunderstanding, or a big fuss over a little kiss.

592
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:50,470
别忘了，是我叫你来的
Remember, it was I who asked you to come here.

593
01:33:57,470 --> 01:34:02,140
我想跟你说说我外甥的信
I wish to tell you about a letter written by my nephew...

594
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:07,480
昨晚收到的
...received this very night, in fact.

595
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:14,160
他在信中表达了对令爱的钦慕之情…
In it he declares his love for your daughter...

596
01:34:16,830 --> 01:34:19,160
并请我郑重地…
...and asks me to ask you...

597
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:23,830
向您提亲
...officially, for Angelica's hand.

598
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:37,800
说说你的想法
Now it's your turn to declare your intentions.

599
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:46,810
请见谅，殿下
Excuse me, Prince.

600
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:52,490
我惊喜得都透不过气了
This lovely surprise has robbed me of speech.

601
01:34:53,150 --> 01:34:57,490
我知道安杰莉卡心里的想法…
I know well what Angelica feels in her heart and mind...

602
01:34:57,830 --> 01:35:03,160
塔克罗迪对小女的喜爱…
...and I think that Tancredi's feelings, which honour us all...

603
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:06,500
让我们受宠若惊
...are sincerely reciprocated.

604
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,730
愿上帝保佑这门亲事
We ask for God's protection for this wedding.

605
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,530
恭喜了，殿下
Your joy is mine, Excellency.

606
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:41,870
暴风雨要来了
It's turning stormy.

607
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:48,210
我不必告诉你法康利人多么杰出
No need for me to tell you how illustrious the Falconeri family is.

608
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:53,550
他们和查尔斯·安如一同来到西西里…
It came to Sicily with Charles of Anjou, flourished under the Aragons...

609
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:58,890
在阿拉贡，西班牙和波旁皇室时期发展旺盛…
...the Spanish kings and the Bourbons, if you'll allow me to mention them.

610
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:03,890
他们有世袭贵族，西班牙大公，圣地亚哥爵士…
They were peers of the realm, grandees of Spain, Knights of St. James.

611
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:12,230
我没必要告诉你法康利家族的历史…
But if there's no need to tell you of the history of the house of Falconeri...

612
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:16,900
我也没必要告诉你我外甥的实际情况…
...I need not tell you, alas, because you already know...

613
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:22,990
并不像他的名号那么优秀，这一点你也知道
...that my nephew's fortune does not match the grandeur of his name.

614
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:28,250
我姐夫不是有远见的家长
My brother-in-law was not what one calls a provident father.

615
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:33,590
他奢华的生活影响了我外甥
The sumptuousness of his life impaired my nephew's inheritance.

616
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:39,050
但卡洛吉罗，所有问题的结果…
But, Don Calogero, the result of all these troubles...

617
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:42,600
就是塔克罗迪
...of these heartbreaks, is Tancredi.

618
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,930
这些我们都明白
The two of us know these things.

619
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:51,270
也许，没人能像塔克罗迪…
Perhaps it is impossible to be as distinguished...

620
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:55,270
那么高贵，敏感，迷人…
...sensitive and charming as Tancredi...

621
01:36:55,610 --> 01:37:00,910
除非他的祖先大肆挥霍，至少在西西里是如此
...unless ancestors have squandered fortunes. That's how it is in Sicily.

622
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,280
这些我都清楚…
I know all this, and more besides.

623
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:08,290
不过，殿下，爱情就是一切…
But love, Excellency, love is all...

624
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:10,620
我是这样认为的
...as I know well.

625
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:13,500
想想看…
Now listen

626
01:37:14,290 --> 01:37:18,300
我是个通世故的人，我有话直说
I'm a man of the world and I'll put my cards on the table, too.

627
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:21,970
年轻人应该明白不能指望他们
These young people must know what they can count on.

628
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:28,980
在婚约中，我会将塞特索尼的财产所有权…
In the marriage contract, I'll assign to my daughter...

629
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,650
归到我女儿名下
...the deeds to Settesoli.

630
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:42,610
一千零一十公顷麦地
One thousand and ten hectares.

631
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:48,410
全都是一等地…
All wheat fields, first-class land...

632
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,660
凉爽通风
...cool and airy...

633
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,670
吉比多克五百公顷的葡萄园…
...and five hundred hectares of vineyards and olive groves...

634
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:57,670
还有橄榄园
...at Gibildolce.

635
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:12,690
结婚那天…
On the wedding day I'll give the bridegroom...

636
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:15,310
我会给新郎二十万盎司金币
...twenty bags, each with 10,000 uncias.

637
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,030
对我而言，家庭就是一切
My family means everything to me.

638
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:29,040
除了我，这些年没人见过他妻子
Nobody has seen Calogero's wife for years.

639
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:34,080
只有做弥撒时她才会出门
Except myself, perhaps. She comes out only to go to first Mass...

640
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:36,670
早上五点趁着教堂没人时
...at five, when no one's about.

641
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:41,010
我有次故意很早起床去看她
Once I got up early specially, just to see her.

642
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:46,180
她像太阳一样美丽！
Word of honour, she's as beautiful as the sun.

643
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:01,360
你不能责怪卡洛吉罗…
You can't blame him, cockroach though he is...

644
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:04,950
不让妻子与别人接触
...for keeping her from other men.

645
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:20,840
除了女儿之外，我只有少得可怜的财产
Of course, it leaves me a beggar, but a daughter is a daughter.

646
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:24,800
我知道我说的话…
And after all, Prince, I know what I'm telling you...

647
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:30,680
对你没什么影响，你是提图斯帝王…
...won't impress you, a descendant of Emperor Titus and Queen Berenice...

648
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:37,230
贝莱尼斯女王的后嗣，但瑟德拉家族…
...but the Sedara family, by a title granted by Ferdinand the Fourth...

649
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:40,230
也是贵族世家
...is also nobility.

650
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:49,910
文件我都还保存着，终有一天，你会知道你外甥…
I've all the papers in order. One day it will be known that your nephew...

651
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:55,910
娶的是瑟德拉女伯爵
...has married a baroness, the Baroness Sedara del Biscotto.

652
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:02,920
皮诺神父，文件我都整理好了，就差封条了
Don Pirrone, I've all the papers in order. Just one seal to get.

653
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:23,940
对不起，希斯奥，我也没办法
I'm sorry, Don Ciccio, but I had no choice.

654
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:27,950
我能理解，一切都顺利吗？
I hope at least that all went well.

655
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:32,280
很顺利，无比顺利
Yes, perfectly. It couldn't have gone better.

656
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:40,620
我们会很快见面的，请原谅我
We'll meet again soon. And forgive me.

657
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:59,890
“一月中旬寒冷的一天”
It was a cold January day.

658
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:06,150
“冷冽的北风将空气冻结…”
The atmosphere seemed even heavier when the biting north wind dropped.

659
01:41:06,490 --> 01:41:09,820
“雪已纷纷扬扬下了几个小时…”
For many hours it had been snowing great white flakes.

660
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:16,160
“在人迹罕至的道路上，一匹可怜的马背上披着张粗糙的毯子…”
On that deserted road, a poor old horse, a rough blanket on its back...

661
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:24,170
正吃力地拉着一辆马车
...wearily dragged a two-wheeled cart.

662
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:28,840
“驾！该死的”！农民口中喊着…
"Oh, you damned beast", cried the peasant...

663
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:31,430
“他平时就是这样和马说话的”
...who habitually talked to his horse.

664
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,940
殿下，塔克罗迪少爷来了！
Excellency, Don Tancredi has arrived.

665
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:54,870
他在花园里卸行李
He is in the courtyard having his luggage unloaded.

666
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:12,220
别走太近，舅舅，我全身都湿透了
Not too close, uncle. I'm as wet as a sponge.

667
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:16,550
很高兴再见到你
How pleased I am to see you again.

668
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:20,220
塔克罗迪，安杰莉卡一定很高兴的
Tancredi, think how happy Angelica will be.

669
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,230
对不起，我兴奋得都忘了
Forgive me, but my emotion caused me to forget.

670
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:28,230
这位是加里亚吉伯爵，他曾和将军一起去过别墅
My friend, Count Cavriaghi. He came to the villa with the General.

671
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:32,570
那位是我的勤务兵，兰西·莫洛尼
And there is my orderly, Lancer Moroni.

672
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:40,200
我们一直盼着你来，不过天气…
We were expecting you, but in this weather...

673
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:44,540
大雨天他们都赶回来了
They arrived in this storm.

674
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,550
听说这里从不下雨
I'd heard it never rains here.

675
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,680
前两天都是倾盆大雨
For two days it was like being in the sea. Really.

676
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:15,910
舅妈，这位是从米兰来的加里亚吉伯爵，你在巴勒莫见过他的
Aunt, here's Count Cavriaghi from Milan. You met him in Palermo.

677
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:28,460
你说这里从不下雨，你看，不下则已，一下倾盆！
You thought it never rains in Sicily. As you've seen, it pours.

678
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:34,220
别以为这里没有肺炎，当心会患上感冒哦
And don't think there's no pneumonia here, or you'll end up in bed.

679
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:40,430
把塔克罗迪和客房的火生起来
Light fires in Tancredi's room and in the visitor's room.

680
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:44,930
把隔壁房间收拾一下，给勤务兵
Get the next room ready for the soldier. Hurry!

681
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:58,990
我真不明白你们这些人
I don't understand, boys.

682
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:01,280
上次你们不是穿红军装的吗？
Last time you were lobster-red.

683
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:03,290
什么意思？
What do you mean?

684
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:08,580
加里波第的军队不穿红军装了吗？
Don't you Garibaldi fellows wear the red shirt any more?

685
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:11,420
那些人都成为过去了！
Garibaldi fellows be blowed!

686
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:14,050
我们曾经是，但现在都结束了
We were, but now that's over.

687
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:16,260
加里亚吉和我，感谢上帝…
Cavriaghi and I, thank heaven...

688
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:20,430
我们是意大利皇家军队的军官
...are officers of the regular army of His Majesty the King of Italy.

689
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:24,770
加里波第的部队解散后，我们有两个选择…
When Garibaldi's army was disbanded we had the choice:

690
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,770
要么回家，要么加入皇家军
either return home, or stay in the royal army.

691
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:31,770
我们俩，还有很多人，加入了真正的军队
We and many others decided to join the proper army.

692
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:35,110
我们不能再呆在暴民军队里了，对吧，加里亚吉
We couldn't stay with that lot, could we, Cavriaghi?

693
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:36,610
太可怕了
What rabble!

694
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:40,110
他们只会埋伏抢劫
Assault troops, good for firing guns, that's all.

695
01:44:40,450 --> 01:44:43,740
我们现在是真正的军官
Now we're proper officers.

696
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:46,790
人们不用再担心我们会偷鸡！
People no longer fear we'll steal their chickens.

697
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:49,080
我们从巴勒莫来这里时…
When we came here from Palermo...

698
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:54,550
只要说一句“国王的命令”便会有人送给我们马匹
...we had only to say: "Urgent orders for His Majesty" to get fresh horses.

699
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:59,130
迟点再跟我们说，现在去换衣服吧
Tell me everything later. Now go and change and have a bath.

700
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:11,810
先给你们看看送给安杰莉卡的戒指
First I want to show you the ring for Angelica.

701
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:31,830
我不是行家，不过看起来很值钱
I'm no judge, but it looks valuable.

702
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:36,170
是不是很漂亮？喜欢吗？
Beautiful, isn't it? Do you like it?

703
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:49,520
价格不菲吧？
Did you pay a lot for it?

704
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:54,860
我把钱都用在刀刃上了，你给我的钱没用光的
I used your money well. I confess I haven't used all you gave me.

705
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:58,860
☆剩下的钱还够买不少东西★见面礼是吗？
☆There was even enough to buy...★Some parting gifts? I understand.

706
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:03,530
中尉回来了，那是什么？
Our lieutenant is back. What is that?

707
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:06,200
给康塞塔小姐的礼物
A small present for signorina Concetta.

708
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:13,210
《亚罗迪诗集》，希望她会喜欢
"The Poems of Aleardi". I hope she likes it.

709
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:28,220
亚罗迪诗集，我最喜欢他的诗
They are poems by Aleardi, my favourite poet.

710
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:32,560
小小礼物，请笑纳
I brought it as a gift. I've had your monogram inscribed here.

711
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:39,900
“永远的聋小姐”，什么聋小姐？我听觉正常
"Always deaf"? What does it mean? I hear perfectly.

712
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:41,990
但听不到我的叹息
Deaf to my sighs.

713
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:51,870
对不起，我听说…
Excuse me, but I was told...

714
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,560
这是我送你的礼物
A gift for you from your Tancredi.

715
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,890
你得谢谢舅舅
You can thank my uncle, too.

716
01:47:58,350 --> 01:48:03,400
安杰莉卡，塔克罗迪，你们在哪？
Angelica! Tancredi! Where are you?

717
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,640
这里到处都有老鼠
It's mouse-ridden.

718
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:07,010
来啊
Come along.

719
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,370
安杰莉卡，你在哪？
Angelica, where are you?

720
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:18,080
塔克罗迪，你在哪？
Tancredi, where are you?

721
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:38,760
你吓到我了，到处都有老鼠
How frightening. Do you know there are mice here?

722
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:41,770
没有老鼠才怪，塔克罗迪呢？
I'm sure, in this house. But where is Tancredi?

723
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:44,100
我找不到他
I can't find him.

724
01:50:44,730 --> 01:50:48,070
塔克罗迪，安杰莉卡，你们在哪儿？
Tancredi! Angelica! Where are you?

725
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:54,740
吓坏你了吧？
I frightened you, didn't I?

726
01:50:58,370 --> 01:51:00,950
又是她，我们快走
There she is again. Let's run away.

727
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:05,960
不，我们去哪儿？我累死了
No. Where are we going? I'm dead tired.

728
01:51:06,290 --> 01:51:09,880
宫殿到底有多大？有多少间房？
How big the place is. How many rooms are there?

729
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:13,090
没人知道，连舅舅都不知道
No one knows, not even my uncle.

730
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:17,430
他说，住在一座自己熟悉的宫殿，是很没意思的
He says a palace where you know all the rooms isn't worth living in.

731
01:51:21,770 --> 01:51:25,020
☆我们去找她吧，可怜的女孩★其他人呢？
☆Come on, the poor thing is alone.★What about the others?

732
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,190
康塞塔回花园了
Concetta has gone back to the garden.

733
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:30,980
你舅舅让弗兰西斯科…
Francesco Paolo was sent by your uncle...

734
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,190
去迎接一位客人了
...to welcome a guest.

735
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:36,110
☆是谁？★不知道，从都灵来的
☆Who is he?★I don't know. He's from Turin.

736
01:51:37,450 --> 01:51:39,660
走吧
Then let's go.

737
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:42,870
不，我不去了
No, I don't want to see anything else

738
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:49,290
我要走了，我在这里干嘛？康塞塔根本不爱我
I'm leaving. What am I doing here? Concetta doesn't love me.

739
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:51,460
你向她表白了吗？
Have you spoken to her?

740
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:54,260
没用的，在她面前…
It's useless. I feel that for her...

741
01:51:54,470 --> 01:52:01,050
我就是一条虫，我要去找一条与我匹配的母虫
...I'm just a worm. So I must find a lady worm who'll be happy with me.

742
01:52:02,810 --> 01:52:07,480
向她表白吧，迟点下定论也不晚，没准一切都会好的
Talk to her. There'll be time later to decide. Maybe it's all for the best.

743
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:13,820
康塞塔是地道的西西里人，从没离开过这里
I'll explain: Concetta's a pure Sicilian, she's never left the island.

744
01:52:14,150 --> 01:52:19,160
在米兰，她会觉得不自在，米兰人吃面要提前一个月准备
How would she cope in Milan, where it takes a month to find real macaroni?

745
01:52:19,490 --> 01:52:24,490
我可以为她准备比这长凳还大的一箱面条
I'd have got her crates of your macaroni, bigger than this.

746
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:28,250
我们走了
We'll make our way separately, then?

747
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:58,360
可怜的伯爵，康塞塔不会看上她的
Poor Count, it's useless. Concetta does not want to know him.

748
01:52:58,530 --> 01:53:02,200
傻瓜，她还奢求什么？
She's foolish. After all, what does she want?

749
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:06,540
加里亚吉相貌英俊，荣誉和财富兼备
Cavriaghi is handsome, has a good name, owns land in Brianza.

750
01:53:06,870 --> 01:53:09,870
这就是典型的如意郎君
He's what's known as a good catch.

751
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:21,260
康塞塔还爱着你
Concetta is still in love with you.

752
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:27,600
这就是你带伯爵来的原因
That's why you brought him here.

753
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:34,270
肯定是
Yes, that's what I think.

754
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:37,940
我说了不是
No, I'll tell you.

755
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:46,620
听我说，康塞塔没错
Then listen carefully. Concetta's right.

756
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:52,170
嫁给他就好比喝白开水，而之前喝的是…
Marrying someone like him after loving you would be like water after...

757
01:53:56,300 --> 01:54:01,760
☆是什么？★葡萄酒
☆After what?★Let's say Marsala wine.

758
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:25,660
好奇怪的房子，这种地方怎么可以住人？
Strange rooms. How could anyone have lived in such apartments?

759
01:54:25,990 --> 01:54:28,330
实际上，没人住过这里
No one has ever lived here, my love.

760
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,330
前人来这里打破习俗…
My ancestors came here to commit their little breaches of the rules...

761
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:37,670
留下与众不同的甜蜜回忆
...and obtain special memories so different from ordinary mortals.

762
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:42,670
打破习俗？
Breaches of the rules?

763
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:48,680
讨厌的习俗，亲爱的
They were bored, my love.

764
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:17,790
阁下是希弗利先生吗？
Are you the Chevalier Aymone Chevalley de Monterzuolo?

765
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,790
正是
I am.

766
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:22,460
我是萨利纳王子的儿子
I am the Prince of Salina's son.

767
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:29,470
家父邀请您去宫殿小住
My father sent me to invite you to stay with us at the palace.

768
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:31,810
十分感谢
That's very kind of you.

769
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:34,310
您把帽子戴上吧，太阳很晒
Do replace your hat. Our sun is strong.

770
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:36,310
谢谢，你也戴上吧
Thank you. You, too.

771
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:42,320
我打算跟殿下见面后就动身
I did intend to leave as soon as I had talked with the Prince.

772
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:45,990
和我父亲谈的话得先去我家
In any case, to talk to my father you'll have to come home.

773
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,460
是那座宫殿吗？
Is that the palace up there?

774
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:03,550
塔克罗迪和安杰莉卡呢？
Where are Tancredi and Angelica?

775
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:07,220
他们不在楼上，肯定在花园里
Not upstairs. They must have returned to the garden.

776
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:13,430
太糟糕了，我得陪着安杰莉卡的
It's terrible. You know I must chaperone Angelica.

777
01:56:49,550 --> 01:56:51,470
你怕我不再爱你吗？
Do you think I won't love you any more?

778
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:08,900
不用担心
You're afraid.

779
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:15,540
我想拥有你，但我要等到你成为我妻子
I desire you, but I won't possess you until you are my wife.

780
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:31,890
我的腿累坏了
My poor leg, I'm afraid.

781
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:51,910
客人到了
Here's the guest.

782
01:58:47,290 --> 01:58:49,300
他想你怎么帮他？
What does he want from you?

783
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:56,640
我不知道，他来西西里一个月了，一定很可怜
I don't know. He's travelled round Sicily for a month. He must be forlorn.

784
01:58:56,970 --> 01:59:00,640
一定是这里的饭菜他吃不惯
The oil in our cooking must have sorely tried his insides.

785
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:04,640
虽然内心不安，但他仍怕别人看出来
He fears a brigand's knife in the stomach, which he still cherishes.

786
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:08,650
我想跟他打牌
I'd like to suggest we play whist.

787
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:25,580
玩牌怎么样？
What do you say to a game of cards?

788
01:59:25,790 --> 01:59:30,340
殿下，我想单独跟您谈谈，我明天就得走了
Excellency, if I could have the honour of a talk. I must leave tomorrow.

789
01:59:30,670 --> 01:59:33,670
明天？在这里住得不习惯吗？
Leave tomorrow? Are you not comfortable here?

790
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:37,680
当然不是
Yes, certainly.

791
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:40,680
亲爱的希弗利，你现在在我家…
My dear Chevalley, you are in my house...

792
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:43,680
我想扣留你多久就多久
...and I'll hold you hostage as long as I please.

793
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:50,690
你得小心皮诺神父，他总是赢
Beware of Father Pirrone, he's a terror. He always wins.

794
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:54,690
请坐，我和你一组
Please be seated. I'll be your partner.

795
02:00:00,030 --> 02:00:02,040
我来记分
I'll keep the score.

796
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:28,730
你真是米兰人？怎么会来这里的？
Excuse me, are you really from Milan? However did you end up down here?

797
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:34,400
我在殿下家里感觉很自在
Although I abuse the Prince's hospitality, I feel much at home here.

798
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:16,820
我可以做你在杜纳福卡特的导游，带你去莫托洛男爵家参观
Let me be your guide in Donnafugata. I'll show you Baron Mutolo's house.

799
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,780
弗兰西斯科，别这样说话
Francesco Paulo, don't start that.

800
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:22,370
那里没人了，自从十年前男爵的儿子被绑架…
It's empty. The family lives at Girgenti...

801
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:27,450
他们家就一直住在这里
...since brigands held the Baron's son for ransom ten years ago.

802
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:32,130
真可怜，他们花了多少钱赎回孩子？
When I think what they must have paid to free him.

803
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:37,800
没花，他们当时和其他人一样很拮据
They paid nothing. They had no ready cash, like everybody here.

804
02:01:38,130 --> 02:01:42,800
不过，那孩子最终还是回来了…分段回来
The son was returned, anyway, but in installments

805
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:47,140
分段？什么意思？
In installments? What are you saying?

806
02:01:47,470 --> 02:01:50,140
分段，一点点回来的
Yes, installments: piece by piece.

807
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:53,600
先是右手的食指
First came the index finger of his right hand.

808
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:56,980
一个星期后，是左脚
Then, a week later, his left foot.

809
02:01:57,150 --> 02:02:00,150
最后，一个篮子里放着无花果…
Finally, in a basket under a layer of figs...

810
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:03,490
下面是他的头
...they sent his head.

811
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:07,490
弗兰西斯科，别说了！
That's enough of those stories.

812
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:12,080
当时我还小，没亲眼看到，是父亲告诉我的
I never saw it because I was a child, but my father told me.

813
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:15,790
波旁皇族的警察太没用了
I'd say the Bourbon police were incompetent.

814
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:18,170
没错
Without doubt, Chevalley.

815
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:23,840
我们村里也发生过悲惨的事故，我父亲是位工头…
We had incidents in our region. My father was an overseer...

816
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:28,850
直到不久前，对于家庭来说…
...a risky job, at least until a while ago...

817
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:31,850
工头是份危险的职业
...for him and for his family.

818
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:36,190
卡宾枪手会让这一切不再发生
When our carabinieri come here, all this will end.

819
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:38,980
跟宣传内容相反的是…
So, contrary to certain propaganda...

820
02:02:39,150 --> 02:02:43,530
人们会像从前一样尊敬和捍卫教堂
...respect for the church will be restored and defended as it once was.

821
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:45,870
但愿能胜过以前
Let us hope a little better...

822
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:51,200
五年前，一位牧区牧师在做弥撒时被杀
...because five years ago a curate was murdered while he conducted Mass.

823
02:02:51,870 --> 02:02:54,870
天哪！他在教堂被开枪打死的？
How horrible. A shooting in the church?

824
02:02:55,210 --> 02:02:57,210
开枪？怎么会
Shooting, my dear Chevalley?

825
02:02:57,540 --> 02:03:00,550
我们是虔诚的天主教徒，不会这样做
We're too good Catholics to do anything so sacrilegious.

826
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:04,220
凶手只是在牧师的酒中下毒
No, they simply put poison in the communion wine.

827
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:07,890
凶手很谨慎，以宗教作幌子
More discreet, almost liturgical, I'd say.

828
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:13,560
查不出凶手是谁，牧师是个好人，从不与人树敌
But who did it? The curate was an excellent person who had no enemies.

829
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:18,230
很有意思，真好听
Very interesting, Prince, really amusing.

830
02:03:18,570 --> 02:03:21,610
你应该写小说，你故事说得很好
You should write novels. You tell these stories so well.

831
02:03:22,570 --> 02:03:26,910
没错，是在说故事，我毕竟是从米兰来的
Yes, they're all stories. Believe me, I'm from Milan.

832
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:29,580
西西里人杰地灵
Sicily is a great country.

833
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:33,250
幸福的结合之后…
After the happy annexation...

834
02:03:33,910 --> 02:03:39,590
西西里和撒丁王国合并之后…
...that is, after the happy union of Sicily and the Kingdom of Sardinia...

835
02:03:40,250 --> 02:03:42,920
都灵政府打算推荐一些
...it's the intention of the Turin government...

836
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:47,930
杰出的西西里人担任参议员
...to nominate certain illustrious Sicilians as Senators of the Kingdom.

837
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:51,930
阁下也在推荐之列
Of course, your name was among the first.

838
02:03:52,270 --> 02:03:54,930
因为历史悠久的家族…
A name made illustrious by its long history...

839
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:58,480
阁下的声望与博学…
...by the prestige of its bearer...

840
02:03:59,610 --> 02:04:06,610
在最近的事件中表现出的高贵与慷慨…
...his erudition and the dignified and liberal action taken in recent events.

841
02:04:07,950 --> 02:04:10,280
我的上司觉得在名单递交到都灵之前…
Before I send the list to Turin...

842
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:13,740
应该先知会您一声…
...my superiors thought it proper to inform you yourself...

843
02:04:14,290 --> 02:04:17,290
看看您是否赞成这项提议
...and ask if you find the proposal acceptable.

844
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:20,960
政府希望得到您的同意
The government hopes very much that you will agree.

845
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:24,420
也就是这个任务…
This is the object of my mission...

846
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:31,970
让我有幸见到您和这座宏伟的宫殿
...which has given me the honour of knowing you and this fine palace.

847
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:40,310
希弗利，告诉我…
Explain to me, Chevalley...

848
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:44,980
当参议员是什么意思？
...what does it mean to be a Senator?

849
02:04:45,650 --> 02:04:50,660
是怎么一回事？是荣誉头衔？是装饰？
What is it? An honorary title, like a decoration?

850
02:04:51,070 --> 02:04:55,330
参议院是我国最高议院
The Senate is the Upper House of our kingdom.

851
02:04:55,660 --> 02:04:59,330
参议院对政府提出的法律议案…
In it they examine and debate...

852
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:05,340
进行检查，讨论，通过或反对
...approve or reject laws proposed by government for the country's progress.

853
02:05:06,010 --> 02:05:08,880
当上参议员后…
When you are a Senator...

854
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:12,350
要帮助政府倾听人民的心声
...you'll make heard the voice of your beautiful land...

855
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:16,020
我们即将进入现代社会…
...which now faces the panorama of the modern world...

856
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:21,690
政府要医治人们的创伤，满足他们的要求
...with so many wounds to heal, so many just desires to satisfy.

857
02:05:23,690 --> 02:05:25,690
听着…
Listen, Chevalley.

858
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:30,360
我很感谢政府对我的器重
I'm grateful to the government for thinking of me for the Senate.

859
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:36,040
如果参议员仅仅只是名片上的一个头衔…
If it were a simple honorary title to put on my visiting card...

860
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:38,370
我会很乐意接受
...I'd accept with pleasure.

861
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:42,710
但它并非如此，所以我不能接受
But as it is... no, I cannot accept.

862
02:05:46,710 --> 02:05:49,510
我是旧统治阶级的一员…
I am a spokesman of the old class...

863
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:53,050
无奈与旧政权联系在一起…
...fatally compromised with the past regime...

864
02:05:53,390 --> 02:05:56,720
那是形式上的联系，而不是感情上的
...bound to it by bonds of decency, if not affection.

865
02:05:57,390 --> 02:06:03,730
我跨越两个世界，在两个世界中都觉得不安
My unhappy generation straddles two worlds and is uneasy in either.

866
02:06:04,730 --> 02:06:07,730
而且，我不抱有任何幻想
Moreover, I am completely without illusions.

867
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:12,150
参议院怎能接纳一位毫无经验的成员…
What would the Senate do with me, an inexperienced legislator...

868
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:17,080
一位不能自欺欺人…没能力指导他人的成员？
...who lacks self-deception, which is essential when seeking to guide others?

869
02:06:17,740 --> 02:06:22,080
不，我不能插手政治，那样便不能全身而退
No, I wouldn't put one finger into politics. They'd bite it off.

870
02:06:23,420 --> 02:06:26,090
难以置信
Prince, I can't believe it.

871
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:32,090
你真的不愿意尽你所能来减轻我国人民…
Are you seriously refusing to do whatever possible to alleviate...

872
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:39,100
所承受的物质贫穷和精神痛苦吗？
...the material poverty and blind moral misery in which Sicilians lie?

873
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:43,100
我们老了，希弗利，老了
We are old, Chevalley, very old.

874
02:06:43,770 --> 02:06:48,440
二十五个世纪以来，我们所肩负的伟大文明皆来自外部…
For twenty-five centuries we have borne magnificent civilizations...

875
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:53,110
而非由我们创造，不能称为我们的文明
...all from abroad, none made by us, none which started here.

876
02:06:53,450 --> 02:06:56,780
两千五百年来，除了殖民者，我们什么都不是
For 2,500 years we've been nothing but a colony.

877
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:59,790
我并非抱怨，是我们的错
I don't say that to scourge myself. It's our fault.

878
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:03,120
但我们已累得精疲力尽
But we are very tired, empty, burnt-out.

879
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:05,170
可是现在都结束了
But all that is finished now.

880
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:11,170
西西里不再是殖民地，而是自由国家的一名自由成员
Sicily is no longer a land of conquest, but a free part of a free state.

881
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:17,470
你的好意我心领了，不过太迟了
The intention is good, but it arrives late.

882
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:49,170
亲爱的希弗利，西西里人的愿望就是沉睡在梦里
A sleep, my dear Chevalley. A long sleep is what the Sicilians want...

883
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:53,510
他们憎恨将他们叫醒的人…
...and they'll always hate those who want to wake them...

884
02:07:54,170 --> 02:07:57,180
即使他们带来丰厚的礼物
...even if it is to bring them marvellous gifts.

885
02:07:58,510 --> 02:08:04,180
说句实话，我不知道新王国会给我们带来什么礼物
Between ourselves, I doubt if the new kingdom will have many gifts for us.

886
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:12,530
所有的呐喊，甚至最暴力的，都是渴望遗忘
With us, every demonstration, even violent, is a longing for oblivion.

887
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:23,870
寻欢作乐是为了遗忘
Our sensuality is a desire for oblivion.

888
02:08:24,540 --> 02:08:28,210
枪林弹雨是渴望死亡
Our shootings and our stabbings are the desire for death.

889
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:33,550
懒惰，甘甜的饮料…
Our laziness, the penetrating sweetness of our sorbets...

890
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:40,220
都是为了奢华的安宁…也就是死亡
...are a desire for voluptuous immobility, which again is death.

891
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:56,570
殿下，您太夸张了吧？
Prince, aren't you exaggerating?

892
02:08:57,240 --> 02:09:02,700
我在都灵遇到的西西里人根本没有沉睡
I've met Sicilians in Turin. They seemed anything but sluggards.

893
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:06,910
我表达得不好，对不起
I haven't explained very well. I'm sorry.

894
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:10,250
我刚刚说西西里人，应该是西西里
I said Sicilians, I meant Sicily.

895
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:15,250
危险的环境，暴力肆虐的地方…
This environment, the violence of the landscape...

896
02:09:15,590 --> 02:09:18,590
恶劣的气候，一切都充满着紧张和不安…
...the cruelty of the climate, the continuous tension in everything.

897
02:09:18,930 --> 02:09:23,600
气候可以改善，环境可以改善
But the climate can be mastered, the landscape can be modified...

898
02:09:24,260 --> 02:09:27,640
罪恶的统治也能推翻
...the record of bad governments erased.

899
02:09:28,270 --> 02:09:30,390
西西里人当然渴望改善
Of course, the Sicilians will want to improve.

900
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:35,270
我不否认，有些人一旦离开西西里就会觉醒…
I don't deny that some, away from the island, can succeed in awakening.

901
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:40,950
但必须很小时就离开，二十岁的话个性已经成形了
But they must leave very young. Even at twenty the shell has been formed.

902
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:43,620
你需要的是一位…
The man you need...

903
02:09:43,950 --> 02:09:49,290
能把个人利益和公众理想合而为一的贤能
...must know how to temper his private interests with vague public idealism.

904
02:09:52,630 --> 02:09:55,960
我可以向你上司提点建议吗？
Might I give you some advice to pass on to your superiors?

905
02:09:56,630 --> 02:10:00,300
我想推荐一个人当参议员
There's a name I'd like to suggest for the Senate.

906
02:10:05,970 --> 02:10:10,310
卡洛吉罗·瑟德拉
The name of Calogero Sedara.

907
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:14,310
他比我更适合当议员
He deserves much more than I to be elected.

908
02:10:14,650 --> 02:10:18,980
他的家族历史悠久
The family name, I'm told, is very ancient★or will be soon.

909
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:23,990
他具备你所谓的威望，他有权力
He has more than what you call prestige. He has power.

910
02:10:24,990 --> 02:10:29,660
他具备的优点很实用，可谓是才华横溢
He may not be learned, but he has almost exceptional practical merits.

911
02:10:30,330 --> 02:10:34,330
五月危机中他贡献突出
His activity was most useful during the May crisis...

912
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:36,670
至于幻想…
...as far as illusions go.

913
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:44,010
他和我一样没有幻想…
I don't think he has more than I have...

914
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:48,890
但他能在所需之时创造幻想，他是最佳人选
...but he's clever enough to create some himself. He's the man for you.

915
02:10:51,690 --> 02:10:55,350
我也听说过瑟德拉
I've heard tell about Sedara.

916
02:10:57,020 --> 02:11:00,360
但阁下这样的正直之士都退缩…
But if honest men like you withdraw...

917
02:11:00,690 --> 02:11:04,700
等于将机会拱手给毫无远见的鲁莽匹夫…
...the road will be open to people without scruples or perspective...

918
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:10,370
就像瑟德拉之类…以后一切又会和以前一样
...like Sedara, and for centuries to come all will be as it was.

919
02:11:11,370 --> 02:11:16,040
想想你的良心…而不是你说的这些丰功伟绩
Listen to your conscience, Prince, not to the proud truths you spoke.

920
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:25,300
求你了，与我们合作
I beg you to collaborate.

921
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:34,730
你是位绅士，希弗利，认识你的确是种荣幸
You're a gentleman and I consider it a privilege to have known you.

922
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,730
你说的都有道理…
You are right in everything.

923
02:11:39,730 --> 02:11:44,400
除了一句话，“西西里人当然渴望改善”
Except when you say the Sicilians will want to improve.

924
02:11:45,070 --> 02:11:48,740
他们从未渴望改善，他们觉得自己最完美
They'll never want to improve because they think themselves perfect.

925
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:51,740
虚荣比贫困更甚
Their vanity is stronger than their wretchedness.

926
02:11:55,420 --> 02:11:57,120
请坐
Sit down for a moment.

927
02:11:57,290 --> 02:11:59,420
我给你讲个故事
I want to tell you something.

928
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:05,010
加里波第进入巴勒莫之前…
A few days before Garibaldi entered Palermo...

929
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:08,760
英国战舰的军官请我允许…
...some English naval officers...

930
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:13,100
他们上去我家的房顶…
...asked me if they could go on the terrace of my house...

931
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:16,060
在那可以看到周围环绕的山丘
...where they could see the ring of mountains around the city.

932
02:12:17,770 --> 02:12:20,770
风景让他们陶醉…
They were enthusiastic about the view...

933
02:12:21,110 --> 02:12:27,320
但他们坦言说贫穷肮脏的街道让人触目惊心
...but confessed their amazement at the squalor and filth in the streets.

934
02:12:28,450 --> 02:12:33,450
我并没有像对你这样…
I didn't explain, as I did with you, that the one derived from the other.

935
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:40,460
一位军官问…
One of the officers asked:

936
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:43,550
“加里波第要来西西里干什么？”
"What are Garibaldi's men coming to do here?"

937
02:12:44,130 --> 02:12:46,670
我回答说，“他来教我们礼仪…”
I replied: "They're coming to teach us manners."

938
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:50,140
“但他不会成功，因为我们就是上帝”
"But they won't succeed, because we're gods."

939
02:12:51,470 --> 02:12:54,470
他们哈哈大笑，但他们并不明白
They laughed, but I don't think they understood.

940
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:04,730
很晚了，是时间吃饭了
It's late, almost time for dinner.

941
02:13:05,150 --> 02:13:07,150
我们得去换衣服
We must go and change.

942
02:13:07,490 --> 02:13:10,490
你可以明天一早就走
If you wish, you can leave tomorrow at dawn.

943
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:54,890
也许你不相信，这种状态不会持久
Even if you don't believe me, this state of affairs won't last.

944
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:59,890
政府有效的现代管理会将一切改变
Our efficient, modern administration will change everything.

945
02:15:00,230 --> 02:15:03,690
这一切不该持久，但还会一直继续
This state of affairs ought not to last, but it always will.

946
02:15:03,940 --> 02:15:06,560
“一直”，就是一两百年
The human element, certainly. A century or two.

947
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:10,900
一两百年后也许会变…不过是变得更糟糕
Later, perhaps everything will be different, but it will be worse.

948
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:24,870
我们是豹子，是狮子
We were the leopards, the lions.

949
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:29,920
取代我们的是豺狼，土狼
Those who replace us will be the jackals, the hyenas.

950
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:34,930
所有人，豹子，狮子，豺狼，土狼…
And all of us, leopards, lions, jackals and sheep...

951
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:38,260
我们都觉得自己很高尚
...will continue to think we're the salt of the earth.

952
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:41,600
我没听清，您说什么？
I don't quite understand. What did you say?

953
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:44,020
没什么
Nothing.

954
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:47,270
什么？我听不清
What did you say? I didn't hear.

955
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:25,040
你们来早了，没关系，客人还没到
You've arrived early. Don't worry, there's no sign of your guests yet.

956
02:17:31,710 --> 02:17:37,380
塔克罗迪也来了，我们在等阿斯普洛蒙特的英雄巴勒维西诺
Tancredi's here. We're expecting Pallavicino, the hero of Aspromonte.

957
02:17:47,060 --> 02:17:52,020
谢谢你，舅妈，请他们是很有必要的
Thank you again, aunt. It was essential to invite them.

958
02:17:52,610 --> 02:17:56,070
这是安杰莉卡首次参加社交活动
You understand. This will be Angelica's real debut in society.

959
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:58,070
卡洛吉罗穿什么燕尾服？
What about Calogero's tail-suit?

960
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:00,740
不是他在杜纳福卡特穿的那套
It's not the one he wore at Donnafugata.

961
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:04,740
我请了最好的裁缝，衣服好看，只是他衬不起来
I took him to the best tailor. It's Don Calogero who lacks style.

962
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:53,420
☆-我可以去跳舞吗，妈妈？★当然可以，宝贝
☆Mamma, may I go and dance?★Of course. Tidy yourself a little.

963
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:56,130
你像花一样美丽！
You are very beautiful, like a flower.

964
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:06,180
我不喜欢这些舞会，但为了女儿不得不来
I don't care for these balls, but one had to come for the girls.

965
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:46,840
上校！很荣幸能见到您
Colonel, I am most honoured to see you.

966
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:52,180
玛格丽特，过来，这位是巴勒维西诺上校
I have the honour to present you to Colonel Pallavicino.

967
02:19:54,350 --> 02:20:00,360
阿斯普洛蒙特的英雄光临塞舍，实在荣幸之至
I am proud and happy to receive the victor of Aspromonte in my house.

968
02:20:00,530 --> 02:20:04,530
您太客气了，谢谢您邀请我来
How kind, Princess. It is I who am happy on this occasion.

969
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:09,200
祝你们玩得开心
I hope you and your officers will spend a pleasant evening in our home.

970
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:25,220
太荣幸了，上校，整个帕勒莫都在你脚下了
It really is an honour for us. All Palermo is at your feet, Colonel.

971
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:35,230
蓝佩杜萨王妃
The Princess of Lampedusa.

972
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:39,560
苏特拉伯爵夫人
Countess Sutera.

973
02:20:48,570 --> 02:20:51,580
萨利纳的王妃
The Princess of Salina.

974
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:31,950
我去看看安杰莉卡到了没有
I'm going to see if Angelica has arrived.

975
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:02,980
上校，跟我们说说，这是真的吗？
Colonel, but tell us, is it really true?

976
02:22:05,070 --> 02:22:08,150
我当时哭得像个小孩
I was crying, Countess, like a child.

977
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:09,650
太感人了
How moving.

978
02:22:09,990 --> 02:22:11,860
加里波第长得怎么样？
But what was Garibaldi like?

979
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:15,990
他像大天使一样英俊平和
He was handsome and serene as an archangel.

980
02:22:16,330 --> 02:22:21,290
他不愧是个真正的英雄，你说呢，亲爱的？
Magnificent, a hero. A real hero. Isn't he extraordinary, my dear?

981
02:22:28,670 --> 02:22:33,340
在下令向加里波第的人开枪前，上校在试着让人们宽心
The Colonel is trying to reassure them after his men fired on Garibaldi's men.

982
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:37,350
开枪要恰到好处
Those shots were really most opportune.

983
02:22:46,690 --> 02:22:49,030
你迟到了，我在等你
You're late. I was waiting for you.

984
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:54,700
你好美，过来见过王妃
You are very beautiful. Come and greet the Princess.

985
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:14,050
这位是我的未婚妻，安杰莉卡
Permit me to present my fiance, Angelica Sedara.

986
02:23:14,390 --> 02:23:17,390
让我看看你，宝贝
My dear, let me look at you.

987
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:22,060
你比别人说的更漂亮
Yes, it's true. You are more beautiful than they say.

988
02:23:24,690 --> 02:23:28,060
☆这是什么？★意大利王冠十字勋章
☆What's this?★Knight's Cross of the Italian Crown.

989
02:23:28,730 --> 02:23:31,400
不过，这里用不着
It's out of place here.

990
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:35,740
我从不怀疑你的眼光
I've never doubted your good taste.

991
02:23:36,410 --> 02:23:40,410
这是我的准岳父，卡洛吉罗
My father-in-law, the Chevalier Don Calogero Sedara.

992
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:49,380
☆这里很美★你喜欢吗？
☆Nice here, isn't it, Princess?★You like it?

993
02:24:21,450 --> 02:24:24,790
塔克罗迪，你不介绍未婚妻给我认识吗？
Tancredi, don't you want to present me to your fiance?

994
02:24:26,170 --> 02:24:29,460
安杰莉卡，这是我的朋友，吉奥奇罗
Allow me to present a friend, Gioacchino Lanza.

995
02:24:30,130 --> 02:24:31,460
这位是弗科
And this is Fulco...

996
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:36,970
如果塔克罗迪不介意，可以请你跳支华尔兹吗？
Tancredi may protest, but may I have the honour of the next waltz?

997
02:24:37,130 --> 02:24:41,140
别着急，伙计，时间多的是
All right, boys. Don't hurry, there'll be time later.

998
02:24:44,810 --> 02:24:49,690
对不起，也不能怪我，请女士挑选舞伴
I'm sorry, I'm not to blame. The lady has to choose her partners.

999
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:53,150
华尔兹，跳舞好吗？
It's a waltz. Shall we dance?

1000
02:24:53,480 --> 02:24:56,700
☆我该和舅舅打个招呼★迟点也无妨
☆I haven't greeted your uncle yet.★Do it later. Come and dance.

1001
02:25:58,550 --> 02:26:02,220
你永远都这么美
You are very beautiful, as always. It's the truth.

1002
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:48,930
很无聊吗，法里兹奥？
Bored, Fabrizio?

1003
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:55,770
频繁的近亲结婚并没有改善血统
All these marriages between cousins do not improve the beauty of the race.

1004
02:26:55,940 --> 02:27:01,280
看看她们，活像一群猴子…
They look like monkeys, ready to climb up the chandeliers...

1005
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:06,910
准备爬上烛台摇尾巴，露出屁股
...where they'll swing by their tails, exhibiting their behinds.

1006
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:15,350
艾莉娜拉·加德娜丽…
Eleonora Giardinelli...

1007
02:28:16,350 --> 02:28:19,360
鹤立鸡群
...a white swan in a pond full of frogs.

1008
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:22,690
对了，恭喜你外甥订婚
My compliments on your nephew's engagement.

1009
02:28:22,900 --> 02:28:26,360
那女孩很美，他们会成为典范的
The girl's a beauty. Many will soon follow his example.

1010
02:28:26,700 --> 02:28:28,490
你说什么？
What did you say?

1011
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:31,700
这里太热了
I said it's hot, too hot here.

1012
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:36,710
是很热，我不该来的
Yes, it is hot. I should not have come.

1013
02:28:39,380 --> 02:28:44,710
不过，既来之，则安之
I'm somewhat tired, but now I'm here and I must stay.

1014
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:48,720
这样离场不大好
It would be discourteous to leave now.

1015
02:30:22,060 --> 02:30:26,770
晚上好，蒂娜，我都和吉奥瓦尼跳了四支舞了
Good evening. Tina, I have four dances booked with Giovanni.

1016
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:39,160
王妃，能请您跳支舞吗？
Princess, I'd be most happy if you would do me the honour...

1017
02:30:40,750 --> 02:30:47,300
上校，我多年没跳舞了，这儿有这么多漂亮女士…
Colonel, it's years since I danced... so many lovely ladies are here...

1018
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:24,540
这里真是个好地方
Nice, Prince, really beautiful.

1019
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:29,210
如今没有这种房子了，金叶子价钱太高
Places like this aren't made nowadays, with the current price of gold.

1020
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:35,090
是的，卡洛吉罗，是很漂亮
Yes, very nice, truly beautiful.

1021
02:31:36,890 --> 02:31:39,890
但没什么能和这对新人媲美
But nothing equals our two young people.

1022
02:35:15,770 --> 02:35:19,780
安杰莉卡来跟您打招呼，你怎么独自在这里？
Angelica wanted to greet you. But why are you here alone?

1023
02:35:21,110 --> 02:35:23,780
你在看什么？在感慨死亡？
Are you flirting with death?

1024
02:35:29,450 --> 02:35:31,450
你真美
You're really magnificent.

1025
02:35:38,130 --> 02:35:42,550
沉思中的帝亚哥看起来十分忧郁
Isn't it odd that Don Diego keeps this morbid picture?

1026
02:35:44,130 --> 02:35:48,140
他每年来一次的话就是奇迹了
If Don Diego enters this library once a year, it's a miracle.

1027
02:35:48,310 --> 02:35:50,470
你说得对
Yes, you're right.

1028
02:35:52,810 --> 02:35:55,480
不知道我死的时候是否也这样
I wonder if my death will resemble this.

1029
02:35:56,810 --> 02:35:59,150
亚麻布差了一点
The linen will not be so spotless.

1030
02:35:59,480 --> 02:36:03,240
临终时的床单总是很脏
The sheets of the dying are always so soiled...

1031
02:36:04,070 --> 02:36:09,080
希望我的女儿会穿得更高雅
...and I hope that Concetta and the others will be more decently dressed.

1032
02:36:09,830 --> 02:36:14,620
不过，我觉得都差不多
But I think all in all it will be the same.

1033
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:22,510
舅舅，你在说什么？你在想什么？
What are you saying, uncle? What are you thinking of?

1034
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:29,050
我经常想到死亡，但不畏惧死亡
I often think of death. The idea doesn't frighten me.

1035
02:36:30,510 --> 02:36:33,310
你们年轻人不明白
You young people cannot understand such things.

1036
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:38,850
对你们来说，死亡遥不可及，好像只会发生在别人身上
For you, death does not exist, it's something for other people.

1037
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:57,120
我们要把祖坟修葺一番
We must have repairs done to our family vault.

1038
02:37:09,890 --> 02:37:11,890
可以借你的手帕一用吗？
Give me your handkerchief, please.

1039
02:37:27,030 --> 02:37:30,240
殿下，听说您在这里，我们过来透气…
We knew you were here and we came for a rest...

1040
02:37:31,160 --> 02:37:33,580
也顺便问您一些事情
...but also to ask you something.

1041
02:37:35,910 --> 02:37:38,330
希望您不要推辞
I hope you won't refuse me.

1042
02:37:45,590 --> 02:37:49,590
我想请您和我跳下一支玛祖卡
I wanted to ask you to dance the next mazurka with me.

1043
02:37:49,930 --> 02:37:53,600
千万别拒绝我，谁都知道你舞跳得很好
Don't be lazy. Everyone knows you're a good dancer.

1044
02:37:55,270 --> 02:37:59,940
我从未听过比这更吸引的请求…
I've never had such an attractive proposal, but I must refuse.

1045
02:38:00,600 --> 02:38:03,060
求您了
Please, Prince.

1046
02:38:32,970 --> 02:38:37,640
你让我觉得自己又年轻了，不过别跳玛祖卡
You make me feel young again. I accept, but not the mazurka.

1047
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:42,310
这样会让我觉得年轻过头的，跳华尔兹吧
That would make me feel too young. Grant me the next waltz.

1048
02:38:50,650 --> 02:38:55,320
你看舅舅多好，他不像你这么没风度
See how good your uncle is. He doesn't have tantrums like you.

1049
02:38:58,330 --> 02:39:02,870
他不想我请您跳舞，他吃醋了
He didn't want me to ask you. He's jealous.

1050
02:39:08,670 --> 02:39:13,010
这也很正常，谁让舅舅那么英俊潇洒？
When one has a handsome uncle like him, it's natural to be jealous.

1051
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:17,350
不过，仅此一次，下不为例
But this time I'll make an exception.

1052
02:39:55,930 --> 02:40:01,680
华尔兹！看来乐队真是知我心意，你说呢？
A waltz, without even having to ask the orchestra. Do you like it?

1053
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:06,900
华尔兹，您不是反悔了吧？
It's a waltz. Or perhaps you have already changed your mind.

1054
02:40:07,060 --> 02:40:09,730
不，当然不是
No, of course not.

1055
02:40:42,430 --> 02:40:47,190
大家都对我很好，我太开心了，舅舅
They're all so kind and I'm so happy, uncle.

1056
02:40:47,440 --> 02:40:50,020
塔克罗迪是个天使，您也是
Tancredi is a darling, and so are you.

1057
02:40:50,440 --> 02:40:52,440
还好塔克罗迪听不见
It's as well Tancredi can't hear you.

1058
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:55,240
这一切都是您给我的
I know I owe everything to you.

1059
02:40:55,450 --> 02:40:59,410
包括塔克罗迪，要不是您同意…
So does Tancredi. Because if you had not wanted...

1060
02:40:59,570 --> 02:41:02,030
他也一样会和你结婚
He'd have married you, anyway.

1061
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:05,450
这都是你争取来的
You owe everything to yourself.

1062
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:07,460
不是这样的
No, it's not true.

1063
02:41:07,790 --> 02:41:09,460
是这样的，安杰莉卡
It is true, Angelica.

1064
02:41:13,130 --> 02:41:16,470
塔克罗迪绝对抵抗不了你的美貌
No man like Tancredi would ever have resisted your beauty.

1065
02:41:43,160 --> 02:41:45,990
别人告诉我你舞跳得好
I'd heard that you were a good dancer, Prince.

1066
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:48,500
对不起，又让你失望了
I'm sorry to have disappointed you again.

1067
02:41:48,670 --> 02:41:54,250
你跳得简直好极了，和你共舞是件乐事
You're much more than a good dancer, you're a really delightful dancer.

1068
02:41:58,630 --> 02:41:59,840
是我父亲
Yes, it's my father.

1069
02:42:00,180 --> 02:42:02,590
☆下一支舞★玛祖卡
☆The next dance.★A mazurka, then.

1070
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:05,850
大家都在看我们
They're all looking at us, Prince.

1071
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:13,190
跟你父亲跳舞的女孩真漂亮
What a beautiful girl that is, dancing with your father.

1072
02:42:47,020 --> 02:42:51,810
没人鼓掌，肯定是因为大家尊重您
The applause was muted, because a lion commands respect...

1073
02:42:51,980 --> 02:42:54,230
不过您的确值得大家喝彩
...but you deserved an ovation.

1074
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:57,320
过来跟我们一起吃饭吧
And now come to our table.

1075
02:42:57,690 --> 02:43:02,110
不，我青春的回忆还历历在目…
No, my memories of my youth are still vivid and I know very well...

1076
02:43:02,320 --> 02:43:05,240
我知道和舅舅共餐是多么无聊
...how boring it would be for you to dine with an old uncle.

1077
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:06,870
不是这样的
That's not true.

1078
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:10,580
恋人应该享受二人世界，况且，我也不饿
It is. Lovers wish to be alone. Anyway, I am not very hungry.

1079
02:43:11,580 --> 02:43:14,580
去和塔克罗迪吃吧，不用管我
Go with Tancredi and don't think of me.

1080
02:43:28,260 --> 02:43:31,310
法里兹奥，你的舞跳得还是那么好
Fabrizio, you're still a good dancer.

1081
02:44:16,310 --> 02:44:18,690
你好啊，法里兹奥
Fabrizio, how are you?

1082
02:44:22,650 --> 02:44:26,990
法里兹奥，您不吃吗？饭菜不合胃口？
Fabrizio, aren't you eating? You seem a little uncertain.

1083
02:44:27,320 --> 02:44:31,240
太多选择了，玛格丽特准备得很好
The choice is too great. Donna Margherita knows how to do things.

1084
02:44:32,660 --> 02:44:36,000
但我的胃吃不了这么多
All this calls for stomachs other than mine.

1085
02:44:39,210 --> 02:44:41,170
好漂亮的烛台！
How marvellous these candelabra are.

1086
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:47,130
穆德里的东西，是帝亚哥父亲任大使时获赠的礼物
From Madrid. A gift to Don Diego's grandfather when he was ambassador.

1087
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:51,680
真不知道这些值多少亩地
How much land would they be worth, eh?

1088
02:45:59,080 --> 02:46:02,080
我一生中最感动的时刻
The utmost emotion of my life.

1089
02:46:02,750 --> 02:46:04,750
真无聊！
What a great bore.

1090
02:46:08,130 --> 02:46:11,760
萨利纳殿下，能赏脸和我们一起吃吗？
Prince Salina. Will you do us the honour of sitting at our table?

1091
02:46:24,110 --> 02:46:27,610
左翼分子想把我钉死在十字架上…
Now the left wants to crucify me, because...

1092
02:46:27,780 --> 02:46:31,450
因为我在八月时下令向加里波第开火
...in August I ordered my lads to open fire on Garibaldi.

1093
02:46:32,450 --> 02:46:37,830
告诉我，殿下，我还能怎样呢？
But, Prince, what else could I do, with the written orders I had?

1094
02:46:38,790 --> 02:46:40,540
不过，说句实话…
I must confess, though...

1095
02:46:40,750 --> 02:46:45,460
当我在阿斯普洛蒙特面对那几百名叛党时…
...when at Aspromonte I faced those hundreds of Garibaldi's men...

1096
02:46:46,130 --> 02:46:48,800
有些是狂热者…
...some hardened veterans...

1097
02:46:48,970 --> 02:46:52,880
有些是鼓动者…
...others who looked like professional rebels...

1098
02:46:56,060 --> 02:47:01,230
所幸的是，我的行动与感情一致
I was happy those orders were so close to my own sentiments.

1099
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:09,820
在这里悄悄告诉你吧…
Then, I'll tell you in confidence...

1100
02:47:10,150 --> 02:47:14,570
我开的那几枪还算帮了加里波第一把呢
...my short burst of shooting helped Garibaldi above all.

1101
02:47:15,410 --> 02:47:19,490
我把他从身边的乌合之众当中解救出来
I liberated him from the gang that had attached itself to him...

1102
02:47:19,830 --> 02:47:25,210
那些人各怀鬼胎利用加里波第
...who were using him for ends desired perhaps by Paris or Rome.

1103
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:27,920
没错
Yes, it's true.

1104
02:47:28,500 --> 02:47:32,840
他们不像两年前在马沙登陆的那些人…
Individuals very different from those who landed at Marsala two years ago.

1105
02:47:33,180 --> 02:47:38,260
那些人相信，一八四八年的革命可让意大利获得新生
People who thought Italy could be created with revolutions like in 1848.

1106
02:47:39,180 --> 02:47:43,270
至于加里波第将军…
He... I mean General Garibaldi, as you know...

1107
02:47:43,850 --> 02:47:50,230
当我这般显赫的人向他鞠躬时，他握住我的手
...at the moment of my now famous genuflection, he shook my hand.

1108
02:47:51,070 --> 02:47:53,200
知道他低声对我说了什么吗？
Do you know what he said to me quietly?

1109
02:47:53,860 --> 02:47:55,860
“谢谢你，上校”
"Thank you, Colonel."

1110
02:47:57,530 --> 02:48:01,200
我问他谢我什么？谢我让他终生残废吗？
"For what?" I asked. "For laming you for the rest of your life?"

1111
02:48:02,460 --> 02:48:07,460
不，他谢我放他一条生路，这个懦夫…
No, but for making him understand, to see with his own eyes the swaggering...

1112
02:48:07,790 --> 02:48:11,460
也放他那些追随者一条生路
...the vile behaviour and perhaps worse of his dubious adherents.

1113
02:48:11,630 --> 02:48:13,510
不好意思，上校…
Please excuse me, dear Colonel.

1114
02:48:13,970 --> 02:48:19,810
您不觉得您所说的有点风马牛不相及吗？
Don't you think your bows and compliments overdid things a bit?

1115
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:26,980
当然不会
No. Certainly no.

1116
02:48:27,980 --> 02:48:31,650
你真应该看看那位可怜的伟人…
You should have seen him, that poor, great man...

1117
02:48:32,320 --> 02:48:37,030
从栗树下大步走远，身上伤痕累累…
...lying under a chestnut tree, suffering in his body...

1118
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:42,330
但内心伤得更深
...but even more in his spirit. Pitiful.

1119
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:47,420
登陆西西里时，他不是再次说…
Didn't he say himself, when landing again in Sicily:

1120
02:48:47,710 --> 02:48:50,340
“我们朝着未知的方向进军”
"We are going towards the unknown."

1121
02:48:51,670 --> 02:48:54,010
这话让人不感动都难…
It was difficult to resist emotion.

1122
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:58,340
况且，我有什么理由不感动呢？
Besides, why should I have resisted?

1123
02:48:59,010 --> 02:49:01,680
我只亲吻女士的手
I kiss the hand of ladies only.

1124
02:49:04,350 --> 02:49:08,650
即便在当时，殿下，我亲吻了一位女士的手…
But then, Prince, I also kissed the hand of the salvation of the kingdom...

1125
02:49:09,020 --> 02:49:14,690
我们士兵都很敬佩她的救国热情
...which is also a lady to whom we military men must pay homage.

1126
02:49:19,780 --> 02:49:21,910
帝亚哥，我失陪一下
I ask your pardon. Diego, excuse me.

1127
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:09,330
一星期三场舞会实在太频繁了
Three balls in one week, it's too much.

1128
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:14,540
我恨不得快点结束，不知道大家是否都开心
I can't wait for it to end. I can't think why everybody is so merry.

1129
02:50:14,920 --> 02:50:16,340
把发夹给我
Give me a hairpin.

1130
02:50:18,670 --> 02:50:20,340
真麻烦
How boring.

1131
02:50:26,350 --> 02:50:30,350
要是有人不断发出邀请，我们就得一直住在这里
Until we've finished with all these invitations, we must stay in the city.

1132
02:50:31,020 --> 02:50:36,730
我迫不及待想回到圣罗伦佐的家，过我们的平静生活
I can't wait to return to our villa at San Lorenzo, to our quiet life.

1133
02:50:37,360 --> 02:50:42,570
胡说，我希望舞会永远都不会结束
What are you saying? I'd like this ball to go on for ever, it's lovely.

1134
02:50:43,370 --> 02:50:45,370
不知道特帕斯的舞会是怎样的
What will the Trabias' ball be like?

1135
02:50:45,700 --> 02:50:49,370
我预订了一件绿色长裙，浅绿色的
I've ordered a green dress. Bright green.

1136
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:52,710
你开心吗？
How about you?

1137
02:50:54,710 --> 02:51:00,840
我太开心了，塔克罗迪像个天使，你们对我都很好
I'm so happy. Tancredi is so sweet. You are all so sweet to me.

1138
02:51:02,050 --> 02:51:04,050
希望你能开心一点
I wish you were happier.

1139
02:51:04,390 --> 02:51:08,390
我能怎么样？我从不喜欢参加社交活动
What can I do about it? I've never liked being among people.

1140
02:51:09,730 --> 02:51:13,730
我也不喜欢跳舞，我跳得不好
I don't even like dancing. I've never been able to dance well.

1141
02:51:16,070 --> 02:51:20,150
那要看跟谁跳，找一个喜欢的舞伴
It depends on your partner. Find a partner you like.

1142
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:22,740
我没兴趣
No, I'm not interested.

1143
02:51:24,070 --> 02:51:28,080
你知道有多少男人想得到你的青睐？
Do you know how many young men would be happy to court you?

1144
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:30,750
你全都拒绝了
You discourage them all.

1145
02:51:33,080 --> 02:51:36,750
就像可怜的加里亚吉，记得吗？
Like poor Cavriaghi, remember?

1146
02:51:38,420 --> 02:51:40,260
你是怎么对他的！
How you treated him, poor man.

1147
02:51:44,340 --> 02:51:47,680
原来你在这儿，我到处都找不到你
There you are. I couldn't find you anywhere.

1148
02:51:47,850 --> 02:51:52,770
我们在打扮，你去哪儿了？我转过头你就不见了
We're tidying ourselves. Anyway, I couldn't find you, you had vanished.

1149
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:56,100
我去听巴勒维西诺上校说话
I went to hear what the Colonel was saying.

1150
02:51:56,440 --> 02:51:59,690
他不是天才，不过说话很有道理
He's no genius, but he says many very sensible things.

1151
02:51:59,980 --> 02:52:03,780
他说得对，新政府需要法律和规则
It's true, the new kingdom needs order, legality, laws.

1152
02:52:04,450 --> 02:52:06,530
任何无政府企图都要压制
It needs to stifle, first of all...

1153
02:52:06,700 --> 02:52:10,120
不能允许冒险和动乱再次出现…
...any attempts at anarchy. No more adventures or disorders.

1154
02:52:10,790 --> 02:52:14,120
哪怕是采取残酷苛刻的手段…
Even if that entails severe or painful methods...

1155
02:52:15,460 --> 02:52:19,130
例如枪杀与加里波第逃走的狂热分子
...like shooting those hotheads who deserted to go back with Garibaldi.

1156
02:52:20,250 --> 02:52:22,460
你认为他们会遭到枪杀？
Do you think they'll shoot them?

1157
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:28,090
你不知道？今天一早他们就成了逃亡分子
Didn't you know? This morning at dawn. And it's right. They were deserters.

1158
02:52:46,160 --> 02:52:48,160
你不该这样说
You would not have spoken like that once.

1159
02:52:55,500 --> 02:52:57,170
你错了，亲爱的
My dear, you are mistaken.

1160
02:52:57,750 --> 02:52:59,500
我一直都这样说话
I've always spoken like this.

1161
02:53:00,500 --> 02:53:03,510
总之，你不会明白
Therefore, these are things you cannot understand.

1162
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:11,180
等等，康塞塔
Concetta, wait.

1163
02:53:12,180 --> 02:53:14,720
让我走！
Let me go!

1164
02:53:16,190 --> 02:53:18,520
我很明白
I think I understand very well.

1165
02:53:19,190 --> 02:53:23,530
我仍然觉得你不该那样说，我受够了
I said you wouldn't have spoken like that once. That's enough for me.

1166
02:53:43,210 --> 02:53:46,920
她很可爱，尤其是生气时
She's so sweet, especially when she becomes angry.

1167
02:53:51,220 --> 02:53:54,890
可怜的康塞塔，她还爱着你
Poor Concetta. The truth is, she's still in love with you.

1168
02:53:57,890 --> 02:54:01,560
☆那你呢，还爱着我吗？★当然
☆And are you still in love with me?★Yes.

1169
02:58:03,930 --> 02:58:05,930
看到萨利纳王子了吗？
Have you seen the Prince of Salina?

1170
02:58:38,510 --> 02:58:44,050
卡洛吉罗，是时候告辞了，整理一下衣服
Don Calogero, it's time to go. Pull yourself together.

1171
02:58:48,850 --> 02:58:51,230
请给我杯热咖啡
Coffee, please. Hot coffee.

1172
03:00:26,950 --> 03:00:29,950
谢谢你们今晚的款待
Thank you for this unforgettable evening.

1173
03:00:30,290 --> 03:00:32,250
你们真要走了吗？
Must you go already?

1174
03:00:33,250 --> 03:00:37,170
我们要直接回军营，这是军队作风
We're going straight to the barracks, as tradition demands of us soldiers.

1175
03:00:37,630 --> 03:00:39,630
是我们的职责
Our duty obliges us.

1176
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:44,300
而且，夜间工作还未结束
Moreover, our tasks for this night are not yet over.

1177
03:00:54,310 --> 03:00:57,520
清理一下，把蜡烛吹灭
Tidy up a little and extinguish the candles.

1178
03:01:06,110 --> 03:01:10,990
玛格丽特，谢谢你们今晚的款待
Dear Margherita, thank you so much for the wonderful evening. Magnificent.

1179
03:01:46,700 --> 03:01:49,740
你原来在这儿呢，舅妈到处找你
There you are. Aunt is looking for you everywhere.

1180
03:01:49,950 --> 03:01:52,870
那几个姑娘要走了
Angelica, Concetta and Carolina are ready to leave.

1181
03:01:53,580 --> 03:01:57,710
能帮我个忙吗？我已经跟主人告别了
Can you do me a favour, my boy? I've already said my farewells.

1182
03:01:58,040 --> 03:02:02,290
帮你舅妈叫辆马车，我走路回去
Will you call the carriage for your aunt? I'm walking back.

1183
03:02:02,590 --> 03:02:06,050
☆这么晚走路回去？★我想呼吸些新鲜空气
☆Walking? At this hour?★I need some air.

1184
03:02:09,890 --> 03:02:11,390
你是不是不舒服？
Don't you feel well?

1185
03:02:11,640 --> 03:02:13,640
头有点痛，透透气就没事
A slight headache. Fresh air will help.

1186
03:02:14,390 --> 03:02:16,390
一切都很顺利吧？
Everything went very well, don't you think?

1187
03:02:16,600 --> 03:02:20,520
好极了，舅舅，很快就会有好消息给你
Marvellously, uncle. You know, I'll soon have some good news for you.

1188
03:02:20,810 --> 03:02:23,440
我跟宾佐尼谈了谈，下次选举…
I just spoke to Finzori. It seems that at the next elections...

1189
03:02:23,650 --> 03:02:25,070
你会成为候选人
You'll be the candidate.

1190
03:02:25,400 --> 03:02:27,070
你已经知道了？
You knew about it?

1191
03:02:28,400 --> 03:02:30,280
失陪一下
Excuse me for a moment.

1192
03:03:34,470 --> 03:03:37,470
虔诚的星星…
O star, O faithful star!

1193
03:03:38,470 --> 03:03:42,140
何时我才能远离尘世间的一切…
When will you decide to give me a less fleeting appointment...

1194
03:03:42,480 --> 03:03:47,360
在永恒不变的世界中得到永生？
...far from everything, in your realm of perennial certainty?

1195
03:04:04,500 --> 03:04:08,290
优良部队，有军队就会有商业
An excellent army. They do things properly.

1196
03:04:14,090 --> 03:04:15,930
所有这一切…
Just what we needed...

1197
03:04:19,510 --> 03:04:21,310
就是西西里所需要的
...for Sicily.

1198
03:04:22,180 --> 03:04:25,850
现在我们能好好休息了
Now we can take it easy.
