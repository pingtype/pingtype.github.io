圣弗朗西斯在树林中独自生活了很多年

5
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,600
有一天晚上 他看到一位天使在天空中燃烧着
Then one night, he saw an angel burning in sky.

6
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,870
他醒来时…
And when he woke up...

7
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,300
有了圣痕
he had stigmata.

8
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,010
但孤独会对心智做奇怪的事
But loneliness can do strange things to the mind.

9
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,480
最终 他死于一种也会
Eventually he died of an eye condition

10
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,650
导致精神病的眼疾
that also would have caused psychosis.

11
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,250
当心

12
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,560
弗朗西斯卡
Francisca.

13
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,680
你干什么了

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,730
一. 母亲

15
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,070
我们能过去看看它们吗

16
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,420
母牛眼非常类似人眼
Cow eyes are very similar to human eyes.

17
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,220
结构几乎完全一样

18
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,750
唯一的区别是它们更大
The only difference is they're bigger.

19
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,220
在葡萄牙时 我们常用母牛练习外科手术
In Portugal, we used to practice surgery on cows.

20
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,890
而这里 他们用人来练习

21
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,030
他们是这样杀死它的
This is how they kill it.

22
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,780
我们所看到的一切…

23
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,990
都经由此物

24
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,050
- 弗朗西斯卡  - 弗朗西斯卡？
- Francisca.  - Francisca?

25
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,720

26
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,870
你的丈夫在家吗
Is your husband at home?

27
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,760
他随时会回来

28
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,500
但不管你想卖什么 我们都没兴趣
But we're not interested in whatever you're trying to sell.

29
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,570
我没想卖什么给你们
I'm not trying to sell you anything.

30
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,910
我能进去一会儿吗
May I come inside for a second?

31
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,440
就用下洗手间 一会会儿
Just to use the restroom. It'll only take a second.

32
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,990
你家很漂亮 你在这里住了很久吗
You have a lovely home. Have you lived here a long time?

33
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,130

谢谢
Thanks.

35
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,270
你的丈夫通常都迟归吗
Is your husband usually late?

36
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,110
你说你估计他随时会到

37
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,820
走过客厅 你右边就是卫生间

38

39
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,660
我觉得你该给我带路
I think you should show me the way.

40
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,210
夫人
Ma'am.

41
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,570
我在尽量有礼貌
I'm trying to be polite.

42
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,310
在我开始变得不讲理之前 我们可以再试一次
Now, we can try this one more time before I start to become unreasonable.

43
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,590
我很抱歉 先生 但我真的要你离开了
I am sorry, sir, but I really need you to leave.

44
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,570
我真不知道你要干嘛
I don't quite know what you're planning.

45
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,830
嘿 弗朗妮
Hey there, Franny.

46
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,080
我要你坐在那边的椅子上 保持安静
I'm gonna need you to sit over there on that chair and be real quiet.

47
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,400
你能做到吗
Can you do that for me?

48
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,420
现在 你不如做个好主人
Now, why don't you be a good host

49
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,410
带我去卫生间吧

50
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,830

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,060
进步很大
Onwards and upwards.

52
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,130
今天报道自州消防局长办公室的消息称

你为什么在日历上标记这个日期

听着 我希望这事发生 可并不想看到它发生
Look, I want this to happen. I don't want to see it happen.

在这里看不到绞刑
Can't see the hanging from here.

66
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,210
只能听到
Just hear it.

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,370
你在这里住了很久吗
Have you lived here a long time?

144
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,840
一辈子了
My whole life.

145
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,310
这曾是你父母家吗
Was this your parents' house?

146
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,610
是的
Yes.

147
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,050
你现在一个人住在这吗
Do you live here alone now?

148
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,300
抱歉 我问的问题太多了
I'm sorry, I'm asking so many questions.

149
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,490
我紧张时就会问很多问题
I ask a lot of questions when I'm nervous.

150
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,930
为什么紧张
Why are you nervous?

151
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,930
我不是经常这样
I don't do this very often.

152
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,100
怎样
Do what?

153
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,070
和别人回家
Go home with people.

154
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,340
我也是
Neither do I.

155
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:38,180
好吧 我们俩都有尴尬的理由了
Okay, so we both have an excuse to be awkward.

156
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,300
这是你的母亲吗
Is this your mother?

157
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,010
是的
Yes.

158
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,910
她很漂亮
She's beautiful.

159
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,240
过去的事了
She was.

160
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,660
她是个什么样的人
What was she like?

161
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,230
她是个很好的母亲
She was a wonderful mother.

162
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,970
还有呢
What else?

163
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,710
我不知道
I don't know.

164
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,510
我不知道
I don't know.

165
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,280
说嘛 随便说
Come on. Anything.

166
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,600
她是做什么的
What did she do?

167
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,000
她在葡萄牙时是一名外科医生
She was a surgeon in Portugal.

168
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,500
哪种
What kind?

169
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,570
眼科
Eyes.

170
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,300
我小时候
When I was little,

171
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,400
我们一起做外科切割
we used to do the sections together.

172
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,400
我记得我着迷于
I remember I was fascinated

173
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,320
身体内部的样子
by how the inside of the body looked.

174
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,040
她总希望有朝一日我能成为一名外科医生
She always hoped I would be a surgeon one day.

175
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,740
我以前在学校解剖过一只猫
I dissected a cat once in school.

176
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,140
那种东西总让我作呕
That sort of stuff always grossed me out.

177
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,740
她出了什么事
What happened to her?

178
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,260
抱歉
I'm sorry.

179
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,060
我不该问的
I shouldn't have asked.

180
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,400
有人杀了她
Someone killed her.

181
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,360
什么
What?

182
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,430
那你爸爸呢
What about your dad?

183
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,190
我杀了他
I killed him.

184
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,350
不是吧
No, really.

185
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,320
真的
Really.

186
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,190
什么
What?

187
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,770
你不是认真的吧
You're not serious, are you?

188
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,840
我认真的
Yeah.

189
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,280
怎么了
What's wrong?

190
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,210
没怎么
Nothing.

191
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,220
抱歉
I'm sorry.

192
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,220
这很没趣
That wasn't funny.

193
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,750
非常抱歉
So sorry.

194
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,960
不用 我…没关系的 我…
No, I'm... it's okay. I...

195
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,710
我想我也许该快点回家了
I should probably think about heading home soon.

196
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,880
为什么 请别走
Why? Please don't go.

197
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,380
- 我可以打电话给我妈妈  - 不用 不用 我开车送你回家
- I can just call my mom.  - No. No. I'll drive you home.

198
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,770
不了 没事的
No, it's okay.

199
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,480
我开车送你回家 请别走 请别走
I'll drive you home. Please don't go. Please don't go.

200
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,320
不用…没事的
No, no, it's... it's okay.

201
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,960
- 别走  - 我…听着 我只是有点累了
- No.  - I... listen, I'm just kind of tired.

202
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,070
- 我要走了  - 别走
- I'm just gonna go.  - Please.

203
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,420
- 我…要走了…  - 别走
- I'm... I'm just gonna...  - Don't go.

204
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,040
- 我要走了 好吗  - 求你了 别走
- I'm gonna go, okay?  - Please, stop.

205
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,060
我只是有点累了 好吗
I'm just a little tired, okay?

206
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,410
你说得没错…

207
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,500
这感觉…

208
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,380
…很棒

209
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,800
现在他会永远在你身边

210
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,180
妈妈 照顾好爸爸

211
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,700
我该怎么办

212
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,460
我该怎么办

213
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,340
我不能再独自一人了

214
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,090
母亲 请帮帮我

215
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,220
我该怎么办

216
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:49,220
三. 家庭

217
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,350
没事的 小家伙
It's okay, little guy.

218
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,380
他只是…他有点挑
He's just... he's a little fussy.

219
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,790
没事的
It's okay.

220
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,550
你能把那东西放回他嘴里吗
Would you mind putting that back in his mouth?

221
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,550
谢谢

222
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,000

过个愉快的下午 好吗

我能抱下安东尼奥吗

229
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:52,540
抱歉 我们…我们真的得走了
I'm sorry. We... we really have to get going.

求你了 我能就抱他一会儿吗
Please, can I hold him just for a little bit?

231

242
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,050
你在干什么 不要

别走 站住 别伤害他 求你了

246

00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,910
我不会让你出事的

251
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,810
洛伦先生…
Mr. Loren...

252
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,320
我劝你现在取消这个宴会
I advise you to call this party off now.

253
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,250
鬼魂已经在移动了 这不是个好兆头
The ghosts are already moving and that's a bad sign.

254
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,890
我代我的妻子表示歉意 她要晚点来
Let me apologize for my wife, she'll join us later.

255
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,660
- 要喝什么  - 加冰威士忌
- What do we have?  - Scotch with ice.

256
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,350
- 博士呢  - 一样
- Doctor?  - I'll have the same.

257
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:28,430
好了 在宴会开始前 我们来过下细节
Now, before the party begins, let's go over the details.

258
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,870
看门人会在午夜离开时 把我们锁在里面
The caretakers will leave at midnight locking us in here

259
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,840
一直到他们早上回来
until they come back in the morning.

260
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,040
门一旦锁上 就没办法出去了
Once the door is locked, there's no way out.

261
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,750
窗户有着监狱引以为傲的栏杆
The windows have bars that a jail would be proud of.

262
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,310
安东尼奥
Antonio?

263
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,070
吃晚餐了

264
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,520
没电力 没电话
There's no electricity, no phone.

265
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,890
数英里内都没人
No one within miles.

266
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:52,970
所以 没办法呼救
So, no way to call for help.

267
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,170
妈妈

268
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,340
你醒着吗

269
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:49,820
这只是梦 这只是梦 这只是梦 这只是梦
It's only a dream. It's only a dream. It's only a dream. It's only a dream.

270
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,380
妈妈 那是谁

271
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,790
什么
What?

272
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,170
里面有个人

273
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,240
你是不是进过谷仓了
Did you go in the barn?

274
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,100
那是谁

275
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,440
那是谁

276
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,880
我跟你说了 永远别进谷仓
I told you to never go in the barn.

277
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,830
告诉我该做什么 母亲

278
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,040
请告诉我该做什么

279
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,510
我做的一切都是为了你

280
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,810
我只想要我们在一起

281
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,150
我会不惜一切和你在一起

282
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,850
泰然自若地对待喧杂与匆忙…

283
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:07,860
…并记住 无声之中是多么安宁

284
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:11,070
不管你是否明白…

285
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,320
宇宙都按着自身规律而演变

286
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:56,950
母亲…

287
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:01,080
我好想你

288
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,420
我想让你骄傲

289
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,880
