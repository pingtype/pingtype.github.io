00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,220
苏丽夫人的房间在哪？
Where the hell is Mrs. Sulee's house!

5
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,060
这边！
This way!

6
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,630
夫人！夫人！
Mrs! Mrs!

7
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,170
夫人！快开门！苏丽夫人！
Mrs! Hurry up! Mrs. Sulee!

8
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,900
求求你开门吧！我们需要你的帮助！
Open up please! We need your help!

9
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,260
坚强点，我会救你的！
Be strong, Sulee will help you!

10
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,280
他中了高棉诅咒
lt's a Cambodian curse.

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,800
恶魔的艺术 2
ART OF THE DEVIL II

12
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,060
当人有压力的时候，大脑的负担会加重
When people are under stress, the human brain will work harder.

13
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,290
随之而来的就是焦虑症
What happens afterwards is called an anxiety disorder.

14
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,930
可以很容易观察到一系列征兆…
The symptoms will be clearly noticed...

15
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,590
…例如头痛逐渐加重，以及情绪易于激动
...when the person has mild to severe headaches, and is agitated easily.

16
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,770
患焦虑症的人手掌容易出汗以及心烦意乱
People with anxiety disorders will also have sweaty palms, and be easily distracted.

17
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,880
如果那些情况得不到治疗的话，选择自杀就没什么奇怪的了
For those that are not treated, suicides are common.

18
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,740
好吧，今天就上到这里，别忘了做作业
Okay, that's all for today, and don't forget to do your assignment.

19
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,020
嘿！如果你们想聊天的话，可以出去聊
Hey! lf you guys want to make out, do it outside the classroom.

20
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,060
有些人是要学习的
Some people in here are trying to learn.

21
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,500
喂，阿塔，是你吗？
Hello, Ta, is that you?

22
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,430
什么？
What is it?

23
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,140
说吧，你知道我抽不出一整天时间
Just spit it out. l don't have all day, you know.

24
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:31,010
我有很多书要看，而且我很累了，拜拜
l've got a lot of studying to do, and l'm tired. Goodbye.

25
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,360
阿波！你有病啊！
Por! What the heck is your problem!

26
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,830
想给你个惊喜！生日快乐！
Surprise! Happy Birthday!

27
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,970
开玩笑的啦！
lt was a joke!

28
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,710
噢，真的？开玩笑的？
Oh really? A joke huh?

29
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,010
嘿！小金，我们永远都是朋友
Hey! Kim, we've been friends forever.

30
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,650
你知道我对你的感觉
You know how l feel about you.

31
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:46,190
我想知道，我们是否能超越朋友关系
l want to know if we can be more than just friends.

32
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,000
这比朋友关系要多一点了吧
l think this is a bit more than friends.

33
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,200
喂？
Hello?

34
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,450
喂？是找你的，阿波
Hello? lt's for you, Por.

35
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,620
喂？
Hello?

36
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,620
阿塔！
Ta!

37
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,160
什么？从阿塔的爸爸死之后吗？
What? Since when did Ta's dad die?

38
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,890
是的，这主意不错
Yeah, yeah. it's actually good this way.

39
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,660
我们毕业后我就再没见过阿塔了
l haven't seen Ta since we graduated.

40
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,300
嗨！这是什么时候决定的，阿波？
Hey there! When did this happen, Por?

41
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,410
太好了…
Great...

42
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,070
我们就能像以前一样共同出游了
This way we can hang out together just like the old days!

43
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,110
什么？你说小努吗？她还和以前一样，一点都没变
What? Noot? Oh she's the same, never changes.

44
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,480
[歌词]亲爱的男孩，让我们走近，我们的真爱，没人能了解
Lover boy, let's be real close. As for true Iove, nobody knows.

45
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,460
[歌词]我爱我妻子至深
My wife I love so much.

46
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,720
我为什么要去？
Why am l going?

47
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,290
我已经跟你说过了！我正和我朋友去旅行！
l already told you! l'm going on a trip with my friends!

48
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,360
听着，如果你想让我回去的话，就来接我！
Listen, if you want me to go back, pick me up!

49
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,830
要不然就不要打电话来烦我！再见！
Otherwise, don't even bother calling! Goodbye!

50
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,910
你给谁打电话？
Who were you talking to?

51
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,100
没有谁
No one.

52
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,730
快点，我们走吧，火车来了
Come on, let's go. Our train is here.

53
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,150
闭嘴，阿柯，上车之后别再烦我了！
Shut up, Ko. Don't even bother getting aboard!

54
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,620
走开！
Go away!

55
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,590
高中毕业两年了…
Two years after our high school's graduation...

56
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,130
…我们看上去都变了，从一群遵守纪律的乡村学校的孩子
...we all seem changed somehow, from a regular group of rural school kids...

57
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,690
…变成像现在这样成熟起来
...to the grown ups we are now.

58
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:40,270
但对我而言，我们旧时走过的老路的影像…
But for me, it's as if the memories of our old path...

59
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,210
…又逐渐在眼前清晰起来
...slowly are emerging into clear sight.

60
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:52,580
如果说生命中有很多路要走的话…
lf life is filled with many paths to take...

61
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,320
…那么最重要的就是…
...then what's most important...

62
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,360
…我们应该选择好在分叉点的时候往哪走…
...are all the junctions where we choose...

63
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,190
…以及考虑好它对我们未来的影响
...and how it shapes our futures.

64
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:09,870
对我而言，这甚至使我意识到，未来是由我们的愿望所生
For me, this event made me realize that the future comes from our wishes.

65
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,130
我们的过去，其实就决定了我们的现在
As for our past, it actually defines us.

66
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
[两年前]
2 YEARS AGO

67
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,150
小金！
Kim!

68
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,150
我会尽快看完的
l'll read it as soon as l can.

69
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,850
我得走了
l better get going.

70
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,650
快上来，车开慢点！
Hurry up, slow poke!

71
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,020
终于知道你为什么总迟到了！在这里遇到漂亮MM了，是吧？
So that's why you are always late! Been hitting on the chicks here, huh?

72
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,030
你很聪明啊，走吧，快开车！
You're slick, you know that? Go ahead, drive on!

73
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,870
嘿，小金，他给了你什么啊？能给我看看吗？
Hey Kim, what is it? May l see it?

74
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,900
你无聊啊
Don't be silly.

75
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,700
他是个讨人喜欢的家伙，他还是这个区最好的运动员呢
He's a cute guy, and the district's top athlete too!

76
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,280
拜托，别说啦！
Come on, knock it off!

77
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,810
小金，小心点，小玉在那里
Kim, watch out, Kaew is right there.

78
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,490
这里到处都是学生
There are kids everywhere here.

79
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,280
噢，他们来这里只是帮老师批改学生作业的
Oh, they're just here to help the teacher check the homework.

80
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,150
钱给你
Here is the money.

81
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,620
来支烟？
You want a smoke?

82
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,470
噢，不用了，老师不喜欢抽烟的
Oh, no thanks. The teacher wouldn't like that.

83
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,500
嘿，阿波，把另一张递给我
Hey, Por, pass me another one.

84
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,940
阿柯！不要吊儿郞当了！
Ko! Stop fooling around!

85
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,010
阿柯！小心批注，你别把事情弄糟了
Ko! Careful with the marks, you're going to mess it up!

86
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,210
你搞那些乱七八糟的符号干什么？
Why the weird patterns?

87
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,410
只是一个小弯折的形状，没事的
Nothing wrong with a little zig zag.

88
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,950
什么弯折，去死吧
To heck with the zig zags.

89
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,380
弯折的形状与爱情是有关联的，宝贝
A zig zag line to love, babe.

90
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,950
不要再玩了
Cut it out.

91
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,300
我给大家拿了甜点来
l've got dessert for us.

92
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,100
喔，老师你太好了，老师！
Wow, that's so generous of you, Teacher!

93
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,160
阿柯，小心图纸！
Ko, careful there with the drawings!

94
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,910
评分进展如何？
So how is it with the grading?

95
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,640
我们快做完了
We're almost done now.

96
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,540
我能看看吗？
Can l see?

97
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,980
阿柯偷了很多懒
Ko slacked off a lot.

98
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,070
小金，你的英语很棒！
Kim, you're skilled with your English!

99
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,180
你为什么不吃呢？
Why don't you eat dear?

100
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,690
你大老远地跑来我家…
You came all the way to my house and...

101
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,620
…如果不品尝一下我做的盐渍芒果就回去的话…
...if you go back without trying my famous pickled mangos...

102
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,790
…真是太可惜了
...you're going to miss out on something good.

103
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,090
谢谢
Thank you.

104
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,130
妈，给我一千泰铢
Mom, l need 1 000 baht.

105
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,800
我马上回来，孩子们
l'll be right back, kids.

106
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,280
她真是个好老师
She is really a nice teacher.

107
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,540
他的哥哥阿塔向她要钱的时候，她不会有半点犹豫的
Her brother Ta asked for money and she didn't even hesitate.

108
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,420
那个小农是母亲的孩子
That Nong is a moma's boy.

109
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,850
而阿塔则是父亲的孩子
But Ta here, is a dady's boy.

110
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,890
在这个家庭里，女的权力大
ln this house, the mother has the upper hand.

111
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,490
嘿，谁打我的头？
Hey, who hit my head?

112
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,790
想来赛车吗？快点！
Want to race? Hurry up!

113
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,740
阿波，阿柯说阿塔是父亲的孩子，那是什么意思啊？
Por, when Ko said that Ta is a dady's boy, what did he mean by that?

114
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,410
噢，阿塔是普拉威先生的儿子
Oh, Ta is Prawaet's son.

115
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,810
阿塔的生母死后，普拉威先生与潘老师相爱了
Mr. Prawaet fell in love with Mrs. Panor after Ta's real mom died.

116
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,810
后来我们的潘老师就生下了小农
Anyway, our teacher, Panor gave birth to Nong later.

117
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,010
阿塔更爱他的生母，而不是潘老师
Ta favors his father more than our teacher, Panor.

118
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,950
你看到阿塔学习那样勤奋，他完全是为了他父亲
You see Ta being so studious, but it's all for his dad's sake.

119
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,580
- 抓紧了，小金  - 再见，阿塔！
- Hang on Kim.  - See you later, Ta!

120
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,190
小金，小金…
Kim, Kim...

121
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,730
我们到了
We're here.

122
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,100
嘿，阿塔…
Hey, Ta...

123
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,010
阿塔！
Ta!

124
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,890
阿塔！你还好吗
Ta! How are you!

125
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,510
你想我们吗？
Did you miss us or what?

126
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,090
我想你们所有人
l missed all of you guys.

127
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,420
嘿，阿塔！
Hey Ta!

128
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,520
听到你父亲的消息我很难过
Sorry about your dad and all.

129
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,090
你还好吧？
You doing all right?

130
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,460
我很好，你呢？
l'm fine, and you?

131
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,340
很久没见你了，小金，你还好吗？
Haven't seen you in a while Kim. You okay?

132
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,140
很好
l'm okay.

133
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,450
我们走吧，你爸爸在等着我们呢
Let's go guys. Your dad is waiting for us by now.

134
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,920
阿柯，你这乌鸦嘴！
Ko, you and your filthy mouth!

135
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,820
嘿，伙计，你要好好看看小努了，两年没见到她了
Hey buddy, check out Noot. Haven't seen her for two years.

136
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,920
现在她的身材很火辣，没觉得吗？
Now, she got a great body, don't you think?

137
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,430
我要是能那么丰满就好了
What l wouldn't do to get me some of that.

138
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,430
你也想吧？和我一起努力吧，肯定行的啦
You want some? l'll share. lt's all good.

139
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,640
阿塔，后来怎么样了？
Ta, so what's up with that story?

140
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,750
你打算告诉我们吗？
Are you going to fill us in or what?

141
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,610
喔，你们毕业后…
Well, after you guys graduated...

142
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,480
妈妈就一直有无穷无尽的麻烦
Mom had problem after problem.

143
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,320
我后来回了家
Actually, l just came back home.

144
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,750
等等，你一直住哪的？
Wait up, so where have you been?

145
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,090
住学校里，小农就是麻烦的根源
Disciplinary school. Nong was the one with the problems.

146
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,560
但是我不能及时解决那些问题
But l couldn't help in time.

147
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,890
他是故意溺水而死的，我被当作替罪羊抓了起来
He drowned on purpose. l got caught as the scape goat.

148
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,520
发生那事之后，爸爸开枪自杀了
After that, dad shot himself.

149
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,370
我最近刚被释放出来，所以现在才能替爸爸操办丧事
l just got released actually, so now l can take care of my father's funeral.

150
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,610
事情过去很久了，伙计
lt was a long time ago, buddy.

151
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,980
我觉得你应该忘了它
l think you should just forget about it.

152
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,640
嘿，我们不如到了阿塔家里再聊吧
Hey, why don't we talk about all this at Ta's house.

153
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,980
这里又热又闷的
lt's hot and muggy here.

154
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,420
小努，我们走吧
Noot, let's go.

155
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,760
看那里！
Look over there!

156
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,390
发生了什么事！
There's something going on over there!

157
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,090
住手！你们被捕了！
Stop! You are under arrest!

158
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,360
阿柯，你带着小农
Ko, take Nong with you.

159
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,450
趴在地上！
Get down on the ground!

160
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,030
你认识这些小流氓吗？
You know these hooligans?

161
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,030
不认识
No.

162
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,570
让你一辈子记住
Remember this 'til the day you die.

163
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,610
如果你想在哪里惹事毁了自己的将来，那就完全是你的错
lf you want to screw your life up somewhere, it's your business.

164
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,050
但是你不要把我儿子牵扯进去！你听懂没有？
Just don't bring my son into it! Do you understand me?

165
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,910
你们两个碍手碍脚的东西！你们父子俩都一样！
You retard! The both of you, father and son!

166
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,920
嘿！你侮辱我就算了，不要说我爸，他和这事没有一点关系
Hey! Insult me, not dad. He's got nothing to do with this.

167
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,150
你竟敢对我这样大声说话？
You dare raise your voice with me?

168
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,090
你竟敢对我顶嘴！你这个小混帐！
How dare you even talk back to me! You pathetic bastard!

169
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,190
阿塔！
Ta!

170
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,470
够了！过来
That's enough! Come on.

171
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,870
你冷静一点，停手吧，过来，我们走
And as for you, calm down. Stop it already. Come on, let's go.

172
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,810
好！既然你这样恨我
Fine! You hate me so much.

173
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,200
那么你给我记住：如果你将来变成一个小偷，你就会想起今天所发生的事了
Just remember, when you are a low life thief, you'll remember this day.

174
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,590
阿塔，你知道，你对我来说很重要
Ta, you are something, you know that.

175
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,260
你为什么那样恨她呢？
How come you have to hate her so much?

176
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,700
就算不是为了你，你也要为了我而有一些同情心啊
lf not for yourself, then have some sympathy for me at least.

177
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,750
擦了些药膏之后，可能就会好些了
After some rubbing ointment, you'll probably feel better.

178
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,140
记住，再也不要那样做了
Remember, just don't do it again.

179
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:18,820
还有件事：我希望你能爱小农
One more thing, l want you to love Nong.

180
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,960
至少他是你唯一的弟弟啊
He is your only brother at the very least.

181
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,940
喔，太酷了！上面的图像天堂啊
Wow, this is cool! lt's like heaven.

182
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,640
我喜欢！
l love it here!

183
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,780
放松点！放松点
Take it easy there. Easy does it.

184
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,320
看好了！老彭的纹身工具真不是盖的
Check it out! Pawn's stuff is really good.

185
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,990
他们说那些工具是从高棉宗教仪式上所得
They say it's from Cambodian rituals.

186
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,520
连小农都来这里做纹身
Nong even came here to do his tattoo.

187
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,430
他那皮肤连刀都刺不穿的
No knife or blade can cut through his skin.

188
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,130
阿塔？你已经见过了吧？
Ta? You've seen it, right?

189
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,030
你比我还先见过呢，阿柯
You first, Ko.

190
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,680
喝掉！喝掉！
Drink up! Drink up!

191
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,410
干杯！
Cheers!

192
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,550
这里有谁不是我的学生的，请出去
Everyone who's not my student, get out.

193
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,660
你们学会喝酒了是吧？是吧？
So now you are learning to drink? Are you not?

194
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,330
教练…
Coach...

195
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,810
闭嘴！谁让你说话了？
Shut up! Who said you could talk?

196
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,340
你的学号是多少？
What is your lD number?

197
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,210
嘿！
Hey!

198
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,380
想吓我是吧？
Want to be a bully?

199
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,380
你们想喝酒是吧？想喝得烂醉是吧？
You want to drink? Want to be a drunk?

200
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,780
把头伸过来！过来！
Come here! Come here!

201
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,680
叫你们喝！
Drinking!

202
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,550
醉酒学生！
Drunken students!

203
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,580
明天叫你们家长来
Tomorrow, bring your parents.

204
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,220
我要让你们记住
l'm going to make you remember this.

205
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,050
你也相信他的话？
You believe him too?

206
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,910
他的话根本不足信！
His words aren't believable!

207
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,550
他每天都在制造麻烦
He causes problems everyday.

208
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,850
他和他的那些疯朋友们才刚惹了麻烦不久…
Him and his crazy friends just got into trouble with the officials...

209
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,180
…你还没忘吧！
...if you remember!

210
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,520
你好好想想吧，你听信了他的一面之词
You think it over. lt's his word over mine!

211
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,010
阿塔，我告诉过你无数次了，不要说你继母的坏话
Ta, l've told you countless times not to bad mouth your stepmother.

212
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,600
但是爸爸！我亲眼看到他们做那事的
But dad! l saw them together.

213
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,180
不要再有下一次！
Make sure this never happens again!

214
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,950
爸爸…
Dad...

215
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,650
我们每天还要在那里屋里打扫卫生…
We still have to do our daily cleaning chores in that room...

216
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,560
…所以我觉得我们不如把摄相机偷来，以便利用
...l say lets steal that camera and put it to good use.

217
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:12,120
阿塔，听我说，如果能偷拍到的话…
Ta, listen to me man, if you do this both the coach and...

218
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:18,870
…教练和我们的潘老师两个人都要玩完了
...our teacher, Panor can kiss their futures goodbye.

219
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,410
谁在那里？
Who's there?

220
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,520
快追！你为什么还站着不动？
Hurry up! Why are you still standing here?

221
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,480
嘿！停下！
Hey! Stop it!

222
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,290
回来！
Come back here!

223
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,790
泰尔！
Tair!

224
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,610
你们都清楚，你们才刚结束见习期
You all know that you've just finished up your probation.

225
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,150
现在你们偷了学校的设备，也就意味着会被开除
And now that you have stolen school equipment, it will mean expulsion.

226
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,150
我要把你们交给警察处理
l have to hand you over to the police.

227
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,750
教练，我求你不要报警
Coach, l'm begging you not to call the police on us.

228
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,860
那么我就需要一些回报了
This would mean l need something in return.

229
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,870
答应吗？
May l?

230
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,640
不要，请停下，我求你了
No. Please stop. l'm begging you.

231
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,240
请停下，我求你了
Please, l'm begging you.

232
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,160
我们快离开这里！
Let's get out of here!

233
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,630
快点！
Go on!

234
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,860
给我站住！
Stop it right there!

235
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,430
除偷盗学校财物之外…
Other than theft of school property...

236
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,900
…你们还将背上殴打、袭击教师的罪名
...you'll be charged with battery and assault.

237
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,300
你们都想进监狱是吧？
You all want to go to jail or what?

238
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,430
你们是不是真的想进监狱？你也是吧？
You are really asking for jail time? What about you?

239
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,100
你干什么！
What the hell are you doing!

240
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,180
但是别担心，我可以有条件地把你们都放了
But don't worry, l've got just the thing to set you all free.

241
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:48,920
你这个混帐！
You bastard.

242
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,360
停下！你最好不要碰她！你连畜牲都不如！
Stop! You better not touch her! You're not human!

243
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:54,990
你不得好死！
You low life!

244
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,670
马上放开我！听到没有？停下！混帐！
You let me go this instant! You hear me? Stop it! Bastard!

245
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,870
放开我！你这个混帐！
Let me go! You bastard!

246
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,570
停下！
Stop it!

247
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,970
不要！
No!

248
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,840
你这个混帐！
You bastard!

249
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,800
放开我！
Let go of me!

250
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,850
妈的！
Damn!

251
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,920
你们来这里找我之前，都想好了吗？
Before you decided to come here to see me, you've thought it over already?

252
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,590
这就像骑虎背般危险
lt's like riding on the back of a tiger.

253
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,560
你预料不到它什么时候会回咬你一口
You never know when it will turn around and bite.

254
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,460
我只想警告你们
l'm just warning you all.

255
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:40,440
世上之事，你一旦尝试，它就会跟随着你，直到你死去的那一天
Things of this nature, once tried, it will stick with you 'til the day you die.

256
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,310
明白吗？
Understand?

257
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:55,220
要想做成功，必须要有合适的方法
The way to do this right, you have to get proper mediums.

258
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,760
生日…
Birth dates...

259
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,760
个人照片…
Personal photo...

260
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,760
个人财物…
Personal property...

261
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,570
还有最后一样：他所踩过的泥土
Lastly, you need the dirt he steps upon.

262
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,050
这些东西你们都能给我弄来吗？
Can you get me all those things?

263
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,550
绝对不要睁开你们的眼睛
Don't even think of opening your eyes.

264
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,830
早上好
Good day there.

265
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,460
早上好
Good day to you.

266
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,840
这里的东西很好吃，我是常客
The food here is good. l eat here all the time.

267
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,930
伙计们，你们听说教练的事了吧？他死了！
Hey guys, did you hear about the coach? He's dead!

268
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,180
我跟你说过多少次了，阿柯？
How many time l have to tell you, Ko?

269
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,470
不要再提那事了
No more talk about that incident.

270
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,980
有没有人看到阿塔？
Anyone seen Ta around?

271
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,720
怎么了？
What's going on?

272
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,190
发生什么事了？
What's happening?

273
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,090
嘿，你在干什么？
Hey, where are you going?

274
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,320
我们去看看
Let's go find out.

275
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,300
让开！
Get out of the way!

276
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,780
阿塔，你在听我说话吗？
Hey Ta, are you listening?

277
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,910
嗯，是的，我在听
Uh, yeah. l'm listening.

278
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,650
那么后来怎么样了？
So, what happened after that?

279
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,750
我觉得很奇怪，你继母为什么不去参加你爸爸的火葬？
l wondered, why your stepmom never went to your father's cremation.

280
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,760
她仍怀恨在心吗？
Or is she still angry about it all?

281
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,560
她又回去靠买盐渍芒果为生了
She's back making her living selling pickled mangoes again.

282
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,460
我也不清楚，我有自己的生活，她也一样
l don't know man, l just live my life, and she has her own.

283
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,060
我们很少说话的
We don't talk much.

284
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,170
上来吧，小金，小心点
Come on Kim. Careful there.

285
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,060
每人五十泰铢吗？
That's fifty baht each?

286
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,990
是的
Yes.

287
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,890
给你钱
Here's the money.

288
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,760
感谢搭载
Thanks for the ride.

289
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,970
先生，你找多钱了！
Sir, you gave us the wrong change!

290
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,310
噢，奶奶好
Oh, hello there, grandmother.

291
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,440
我们就待在这边
We'll be staying on this side.

292
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,720
除非不得已，否则不要去那边打扰奶奶
lf it isn't necessary, don't go over there and bother grandma.

293
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,360
噢，你的房子太乱了
Oh boy, your room's a mess.

294
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,200
至少还能住
lt's livable.

295
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,360
你们先把行李暂时放在这里吧
You guys just leave your stuff here for now.

296
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:42,640
你们先去拜一下神祠，我来帮你们铺床，好吗？
First go pay respects to the shrine, while l make your beds up. All right?

297
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,200
当然可以，我们走
Sure thing. Come on, let's go.

298
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,720
快点，小金
Come on, Kim.

299
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,450
阿波，你觉得潘老师看到我们会不会不高兴？
Por, do you think that teacher Panor will be happy to see us?

300
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,760
呃，我不敢确定
Um, l'm not too sure.

301
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,950
她会不会大哭起来
Oh for crying out loud.

302
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:04,290
你只需告诉小金这一点就行了：不确定潘老师是不是还会为当年的事抓狂
Just tell Kim that you're not sure if our teacher Panor is still crazy or not!

303
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,830
动作快点！动作快点！
Hurry up! Hurry up!

304
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,170
加快速度！
Quicken up the pace!

305
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,080
努力干活，加快速度
Work hard. Hurry up.

306
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,100
老师，你…
Teacher, are you...

307
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,560
我想说你还好吗？
l mean how are things?

308
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,170
你们也还好吗？你们觉得我怎么样？
And what about you kids? How do you think l am?

309
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,140
你还是那么美
You're still beautiful.

310
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,780
我老了
l'm old now.

311
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,690
呃，老师，你怎么了？
Um, what's the matter, teacher?

312
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,790
是我舅舅的电话
Oh my uncle's calling me.

313
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,700
失陪一下
Excuse me.

314
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,100
喂
Hello.

315
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,540
听说你们都搬到大城市曼谷去了
l hear that my students all moved out of here to the big city of Bangkok.

316
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,980
在那里还好吗？继续进修吗？
How is it there? Further study?

317
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,670
阿波现在学法律…
Por is a law student...

318
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,110
…而阿柯是工程专业的
...while Ko over here is an engineering student.

319
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:35,150
小努正在学英语，他准备和泰尔一起去澳大利亚深造
Noot is studying English and preparing to go to Australia with Tair.

320
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,960
你还是那样健谈
You are always the chatty girl.

321
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,860
我还记得你以前是班上第二名呢
And from the number two student of the class, too.

322
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,070
喔，您过奖了
Well, l'm flattered by that.

323
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,500
但是如果我以前是第一名的话，我会太骄傲的
But l'd be proud if l was number one instead of two.

324
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,860
你学的是什么专业？
So what field are you studying in these days?

325
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,370
医学方面的
l'm studying to be a doctor.

326
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,200
真的？是真的吗，先生？
Really? ls it true, Mister?

327
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,940
你不是故意骗我回去的吧？
You're not pulling my chain or anything like that, are you?

328
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,110
好吧，我想办法尽快赶回去
Yes, yes l'll try to find a way to go as quickly as l can.

329
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,180
喂？喂？
Hello? Hello?

330
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,750
你们的手机有信号吗？
Anyone here have a signal?

331
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,820
能借我打个电话回家吗？
Can l borrow your phone to call back home?

332
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,450
不走运啊
No luck.

333
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,020
这里没信号的
There is no signal here.

334
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,700
你只有到那个旧神祠那里才有信号
You can only get a signal by that old shrine over there.

335
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,030
唉，我该怎么办啊？
Oh great, what am l going to do?

336
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,300
小努？有什么急事吗？
Noot? What's the urgency?

337
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,970
现在我爸爸住院了…
Well, right now my dad is in the hospital...

338
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,270
我舅舅在火车站等我
And my uncle is waiting for me at the train station.

339
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,880
我想我不能在这待下去了
So l don't think l can stay.

340
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,350
喔，真的吗？
Woah, really?

341
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,380
那你真的要马上回去？
So you really have to go back right now?

342
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,590
不要生我的气，好嘛？
Don't be angry at me. Please?

343
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,380
我必须回去啊
l really have to go back. All right?

344
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,920
不要生气，不要生气
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

345
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:53,470
喔！这是干什么啊！下次记得先叫我们来
Wow! What a view! Next time, call us before things get hot!

346
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,370
阿柯，闭上你的嘴吧！
Hey Ko, shut it already!

347
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,870
伙计们…
Oh man...

348
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,460
小努！你搞定了吧？
Noot! Are you finished yet?

349
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,130
老师叫我们来找你
The teacher told us to come get you.

350
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,910
是啊，她还有些你们女孩间的事要交代你，我们走吧！
Yeah, just finish up doing what you girls do, and let's go!

351
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,170
你真恶心！
Screw you!

352
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,550
嘿，小努的舌头感觉如何？
Hey, thinking of Noot's tongue?

353
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,460
现在我把我的舌头借你用
l'll let you borrow mine for now.

354
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,990
你真是自讨苦吃！
You're really asking for it!

355
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,830
你们谁看到阿塔了吗？
Any of you guys seen Ta around?

356
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,900
我到处都找不到他
l can't find him anywhere.

357
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,540
我刚才看到他在那边的花园里
l saw him in the garden over there.

358
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,850
阿波，我觉得你和小金成双成对的，让阿塔不愉快了
Por, l think Ta is uncomfortable with you and Kim being couples and all.

359
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,810
你应该和阿塔澄清一下
You should clear it up with Ta.

360
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,790
阿塔，你想过你的未来吗？
Ta, have you thought of your future at all?

361
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,830
我一直都在想，并且付诸巨大的努力
l think of it all the time and l put great effort into it.

362
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,400
我向成为一个医生的目标而努力学习…
l made the cut for my studies as a doctor and...

363
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,340
…父母都为此很高兴
...mom and pop are really happy about it.

364
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,120
我真的想为之尽全力
l really want to give it my best shot.

365
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,250
我们应该分手了
We should split up.

366
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:29,830
小金！我不明白！
Kim! l don't understand!

367
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,590
我为你以及你所取得的成绩而高兴
l am proud of you and your grades.

368
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,400
但我不明白，为什么我们不能再见面
But l don't see why we can't still see each other.

369
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,910
你不会明白的
You don't understand.

370
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,670
你说得对，我不明白
You're right. l don't understand.

371
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,570
我不明白我们为什么要分手
l don't get why we have to break up.

372
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,110
你想知道我的一切，我都告诉你了
You wanted to know everything about me and l've told you.

373
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,140
我还能做什么？
What else do l have to do?

374
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,380
阿塔，放开我！你弄疼我了！
Ta, let me go! You're hurting me!

375
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,050
曾经发生的一切…我甚至未曾开始过！你明白吗？
Everything that happened... l didn't start it! You understand?

376
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,250
告诉我真正的原因，为什么要分手？
Tell me the real reason why. Why the breakup?

377
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,330
放开我！
Let go of me!

378
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,520
我只想选择一条对我好的路走，你不是我命中的那个人
l just want to choose what's good for me and, you're not the one for me!

379
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,000
你不是！
You're not the one!

380
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,870
妈的！
Damn!

381
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,100
阿波，如果你再那样的话，我要生气了
Por, if you keep doing that, l'll really be angry.

382
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,650
阿波，你刚才听到什么声音了吗？
Por, did you hear something just now?

383
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,390
什么声音？
What sound?

384
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,250
没什么，也许是风声吧
lt's nothing. Probably the wind.

385
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,530
呃，小金？
Um, Kim?

386
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:45,130
如果你有时间的话，我想跟你谈一下
lf you're finished, l'd like a word with you.

387
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,400
我有些话要说
l have something to say.

388
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,240
我也是
So do l.

389
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,070
阿塔…
Ta...

390
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,910
有时候我有种负罪感
Sometimes l feel that l am the guilty one.

391
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,010
你看得出来，阿波现在和我是一对
You can probably see that Por and l are a couple now.

392
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:09,280
这是我的决定，与阿波无关
lt was my decision. lt's not Por's fault.

393
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,130
如果非要说有人错的话，那也是我的错
lf it was anyone was wrong, it would be me.

394
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,060
小金…
Kim...

395
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,270
过去两年中，我一直想办法联系你
For the past two years, l've tried to get in touch with you.

396
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,740
但你根本不关心我
But you never cared for me.

397
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,540
我从未忘记过你，小金
l never forgot you, Kim.

398
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,280
不要再像以前一样了
Please don't do that again.

399
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,320
忘了过去吧
Forget the past.

400
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,120
回到朋友中去吧
Let's go back to all our friends.

401
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,860
他们都去哪了？
Where did they all go?

402
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,910
阿塔！
Ta!

403
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,590
水太冷了！
lt's freezing!

404
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,590
真有你们的！
You guys are something!

405
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,170
我赢了！
l win!

406
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,860
这个娱乐主意不错
Nice idea for fun.

407
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,810
阿塔，你觉得冷吗？
Ta, you cold or something?

408
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,810
我喝了几口水了
l swallowed some of the water.

409
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,460
我看到水下有人！
l saw someone under the water!

410
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,760
你看到的是东西，不是人，这里只有我们
You're seeing things! We're the only ones in the water.

411
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,130
阿塔，你奶奶瘦得皮包骨似的，她是不是也像芒果一样被浸渍过啊？
Hey Ta, your grandma skinny dipping?

412
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,860
去死吧！
Piss off!

413
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,440
两年过去了，一切仍依旧，真有点不可思议啊
lt's amazing that two years have past and everything is still the same.

414
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,350
我觉得有些东西变了
l think l feel something has changed.

415
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,980
很严肃地说，我真的觉得有些东西变了
No seriously, l think something has changed.

416
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,230
我看到了
l saw it.

417
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,390
阿柯，你看到了什么？
Ko, what did you see?

418
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,120
阿柯，你看到了什么？
Ko, what did you see?

419
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,960
看到了胸部！圆圆的小土墩！
Breasts! Round mounds!

420
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,900
少来了，阿柯！
Cut it out, Ko!

421
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,380
泰尔，你哪天要是不想当同志了，记得要告诉我啊
Tair, call me when you decide not to be gay.

422
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,630
老师，你在蒸什么呢？
Teacher, what's cooking?

423
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,840
闻起来真棒，辛辣鸡肉汤看起来不错啊
Smells good. Spicy chicken broth looks good.

424
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,010
觉得不错的话就全都拿去吃吧
lf it looks good, take the whole pot.

425
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,950
那里还有很多鱼咖喱馅饼
And over there is plenty of fish curry pie.

426
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,350
我们开餐去吧！
Let's setup for dinner!

427
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,050
嘿，小猫咪，小猫咪
Hey, kitty, kitty.

428
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,090
你想和我们一起吃吗，嗯？
Want to eat with us, huh?

429
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,770
你不和我们一起吃吗？
You're not going to eat with us?

430
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,240
你们自便吧，我留有自己吃的东西
Help yourself, l already had my share.

431
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,510
我要深思祈祷一会儿
l'm going to meditate and pray for a while.

432
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,950
老师，有什么不对吗？
ls there anything wrong, teacher?

433
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,650
你知不知道，每当我多看你们一眼，我就愈想回到学校去教书
You know, the more l see you kids, the more l want to go back and teach.

434
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:23,070
到我这来，小猫咪，你在哪里？
Here kitty kitty. Where are you?

435
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,300
过来吃饭喽
Come and get your dinner.

436
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,860
到我这来，小猫咪
Here kitty kitty.

437
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,300
我把吃的留在这里了
l'm going to leave it right here.

438
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,910
小金！
Kim!

439
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,020
奶奶！
Grandma!

440
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,090
奶奶！你不能吃它的，奶奶！
Grandma! You can't eat that, grandma!

441
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,890
别吃了，奶奶！
Stop eating it, grandma!

442
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,590
你们这些孩子根本不关心我！我很饿！我饿！
You kids don't care for me! l'm hungry! Hungry!

443
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,930
你们来帮下我好吗？
You guys, help me out will you?

444
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,020
她年纪太大了，甚至都不知道自己吃的是什么
She is senile. She doesn't know what she's eating!

445
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,400
奶奶，不要吃了，你需要休息，我带你去
Grandma, no. You need to get some sleep. l'll take you.

446
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,530
我快要饿死了，我不能睡觉
But l'm starving. l can't go to sleep.

447
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,630
我好饿！
l'm hungry!

448
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,880
阿塔，你奶奶怎么样了？
Hey Ta, how is your grandmother?

449
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,690
别担心，她只是年纪太大了
Don't worry, she's just senile.

450
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,030
别为这事烦心了
Don't fret over it.

451
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,610
嘿，不要急
Hey, take it easy there.

452
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,750
泰尔，你是不是吓坏了？
Tair, are you scared?

453
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,480
我吓坏了？我什么也不怕
Me, scared? l'm scared of nothing.

454
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,020
但是我怕
But l'm scared.

455
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,560
我觉得这地方从今天傍晚后就怪怪的
l think there's something weird about this place. Ever since this evening.

456
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,330
今天屋里来了很多客人
Today, we have many guests in the house.

457
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:39,540
妈妈要打扮得漂漂亮亮的
Mother will have to dress up nice and pretty.

458
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,340
你也要和我一样，我的儿子
You should too, my son.

459
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,110
你也要清洁一下了
You will probably need to clean up a bit as well.

460
00:44:52,120 --> 00:45:00,320
[印度三大主神之一的毁灭神]
可能你与湿婆同在，但我还是有点不放心
You may be with the three eyed god, but l'm still worried for you.

461
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:06,900
你得明白我的用心，我这样做是为你好
You have to understand. l'm doing this for your own good.

462
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,640
去和湿婆待在一起吧，你就会变得圣洁
Go stay with the three eyed god. So you will be clean.

463
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,660
妈妈现在要帮你清洁一下
Mother will have to clean you up now.

464
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,290
你就会变干净了，亲爱的
So that you will be clean, my dear.

465
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,050
我们已经拜过了该地的众神灵
We've already paid our respects to the gods of these grounds.

466
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,380
我想现在不会再出其他问题了吧
l don't think there will be any more problems from now on.

467
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:04,290
我们去吃点东西吧
Let's go eat.

468
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,150
嗯，真好吃！
Um, this is delicious!

469
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,590
阿柯，不要像猪一样，用勺子吃好不好
Hey Ko, stop being a pig. Use a spoon.

470
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,520
说什么呢？我太饿了
What? l'm starving.

471
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,400
是木地板的声音
lt's just the sound of the wooden floor.

472
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,280
阿柯！你真恶心！
Ko! That's disgusting!

473
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:17,880
你就不能不打饱嗝吗？还有一个呢
You can't handle a burp? Here, have another one.

474
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,200
你们这些怪异的贱小孩，你们不圣洁！
You freaking bastard child. You're unclean!

475
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,860
泰尔？你刚才说什么？
Tair? What did you just say?

476
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,330
什么？我什么也没说啊
What? l didn't say anything.

477
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,400
鸡汤很好喝！
This chicken soup is delicious!

478
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:41,680
谢谢
Thank you.

479
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,220
阿柯，不要把食物搅得一团乱
Hey Ko. Stop hogging up the food.

480
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,280
嘿，尝尝这个吧
Hey, try some of this.

481
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,470
是小努！汤里的肉是小努的肉！
Noot! The meat in the soup is Noot's!

482
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,220
阿塔！你继母现在还没完全恢复正常吧？
Ta! Your stepmom isn't completely sane yet, is she?

483
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,670
阿塔，她去哪了？
Ta, where is she?

484
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,330
我下楼找找，她可能在楼下
l'm going to see downstairs. She might be downstairs.

485
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,670
小金？
Kim?

486
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:32,520
小金！
Hey Kim!

487
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,180
小金！
Kim!

488
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,350
把小金叫醒！
Wake up Kim!

489
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,360
她怎么了？
What's wrong with her?

490
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,050
小金！
Kim!

491
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,290
小金！
Kim!

492
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,910
你们来看这个
You guys check this out.

493
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:37,950
潘老师为什么要这样干？
Why is Teacher Panor doing this?

494
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,850
你们还记得彭先生那天跟我们说过的话吗？
You guys remember what Mr. Pawn told us that day?

495
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,960
你们要吃掉你们所超度的人的肉
You must eat the flesh of those you release.

496
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,530
以从他们身上获得力量
ln order to gain the powers from them.

497
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,970
那么她为什么要那样干呢？
And why did she do that?

498
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:04,080
是因为她还没忘记那段往事吗？
Or is it because she hasn't forgotten about the past.

499
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:09,950
你们应该把她的录像拍下来给你爸爸作为证据
l think you should get her on video for your dad as proof.

500
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,990
没错，我觉得那是个好主意！
Yeah, l think that's a great idea!

501
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,060
那样爸爸就会相信我一次了
That way, dad will finally believe me for once.

502
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:19,220
我们还可以把录像放给全校人看
Plus, while we're at it, might as well show the whole school.

503
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,230
你们说呢？
What do you think?

504
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,730
太好了！那就是你们想看到的…
Good! The visions you want...

505
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,440
我会让你们看看，你们的满足所带来的后果
l'll let you see to your satisfaction.

506
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,570
阿塔？你说话啊
Ta? Say something.

507
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,780
你对你妈妈一无所知吗？
Your mom doesn't know anything?

508
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,320
我已经跟你们说过了，在过去两年中…
l already told you that for the past 2 years...

509
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,080
我没跟她住在这里
l wasn't here with her.

510
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:06,050
泰尔？你怎么了？
Tair? What's wrong?

511
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,900
泰尔？怎么了？
Tair? What's the matter?

512
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,160
冷静点，泰尔！
Calm down, Tair!

513
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,500
泰尔！
Tair!

514
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:35,240
阿波！我们离开这里吧！求你了！
Por! Let's all get out of here! Please!

515
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,040
快！我们走！
Come on! Let's go!

516
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:51,190
有只船！帮帮我们！
A boat! Help us!

517
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:57,460
救命！！帮帮我们！在这里！
Help!! Help us! Over here!

518
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,800
该死！
Damn!

519
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,800
在那里！
Over there!

520
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,470
帮帮我们！救救我们！这里！救救我们！
Help us! Save us! Over here! Save us!

521
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:26,250
不要妨碍我的事！
Don't interfere!

522
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:35,890
小金！
Kim!

523
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,360
阿塔！
Ta!

524
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,500
小金！
Kim!

525
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,980
你想离开我是吧？嗯？
You want to leave me? Huh?

526
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,890
我觉得你办不到
l think you won't be able to do that.

527
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:02,990
如果你走不了路了，你就不能离开我了，对吗？
lf you can't walk away, then you won't leave me. ls that correct?

528
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,790
你说呢？
What do you think?

529
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,230
小金
Kim.

530
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,240
小金，你没事吧？
Kim, are you all right?

531
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,540
快上来！
Hurry up!

532
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,310
小金？她怎么样了？
Kim? How is she?

533
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,490
小金？她怎么样了？
Kim? How is she?

534
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,720
阿塔，刚才我看到了一些东西
Ta. Just now l saw something.

535
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,400
小金？
Kim?

536
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,490
那是我爸爸的枪啊
That's my dad's gun.

537
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,530
小金，你怎么知道枪放在哪的？
Kim. How did you know where to find that?

538
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:19,130
我不知道
l don't know.

539
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,670
但是在幻像中，我看到这把枪，从他爸爸的手里掉到了这地上
But in my visions, l saw it falling out of his father's hand and land here.

540
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,080
里面有人！
There's someone in there!

541
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,870
阿塔！那是你爸爸！阿塔！
Ta! That's your dad! Ta!

542
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,810
这里究竟发生过什么事？
What the hell is going on here?

543
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,470
怎么会这样？
How can this be?

544
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,280
你爸爸火葬的时候我们都去了的，不是吗？
We went to your father's cremation, didn't we?

545
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,380
可能我像你们一样，都被骗了
I was probably fooled the same way you guys got fooled.

546
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:52,910
泰尔，你到底看到了什么？
Tair. What exactly are you seeing?

547
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:02,330
快点，大家抓住她！泰尔！别怕！
Quickly, everyone hold her down! Tair! Calm down.

548
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,900
我们带她去祭祀间里！
Let's take her to the sacred room!

549
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,840
伙计们，快点！
Hey guys, hurry up!

550
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,140
泰尔！你怎么了！
Tair! What's wrong?

551
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,120
别怕，别紧张！
Calm down. Get a grip of yourself!

552
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,450
我不去！
l'm not going!

553
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,560
我们走！
Let's go!

554
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,130
放开我！
Let me go!

555
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,320
放开我！
Let me go!

556
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:41,060
泰尔!！泰尔!！泰尔！
Tair! Tair! Tair!

557
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:43,500
小金！
Kim!

558
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,830
救我！阿波，快救我！
Help me! Por, help me please!

559
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:46,900
小金！
Kim!

560
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:47,770
小金！
Kim!

561
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:53,580
快救我啊！
Help me please!

562
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,810
小金！
Kim!

563
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:02,050
救我出去！快开门！
Get me out of here! Open up the doors!

564
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,120
小金！
Kim!

565
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,920
我忘了告诉你，还有个门可以进祭祀间的
l forgot to tell you there is another way into the sacred room.

566
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,220
小金！
Kim!

567
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,920
没事了，小金，你现在安全了
lt's okay Kim. You're safe now.

568
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,330
我们待在这里应该安全了
lf we stay in here, we should be safe.

569
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,770
我希望你们从实招来！
l want you to confess!

570
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:27,010
你们这些人之中谁是主谋？
Out of all you people here, who is the mastermind?

571
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:31,150
我打算给你们这些人上一节课
l'm going to teach you all a lesson.

572
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,350
到底是谁？
Who?

573
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,250
是不是你？
You?

574
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:37,950
还是你？
Or you?

575
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:47,630
救救我吧，我不想死
Please help me. l don't want to die.

576
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,490
我承认我错了
l confess l was wrong.

577
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,300
我还不想死，求求你救救我好吗？
l don't want to die yet. Help me, please?

578
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,970
泰尔，冷静一下
Tair calm down.

579
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:56,900
泰尔？
Tair?

580
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,510
泰尔，冷静一下
Tair calm down.

581
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,020
我不应该卷进这事的
l shouldn't have been involved.

582
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,220
我不应该卷进这事的！
l shouldn't have been involved!

583
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,080
泰尔…
Tair...

584
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:12,820
你不如再哭大声点！说一次就够了！
For crying out loud! Shut up for once!

585
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,150
哭有什么用！
What good is crying going to do!

586
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,820
我们现在已经够麻烦的了，根本没时间管你哭来哭去的！
We already have enough to deal with, let alone your crying!

587
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:18,630
你个疯子给我安静点，阿柯！
You freaking shut your mouth, Ko!

588
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,460
闭上你的乌鸦嘴！
You and your filthy mouth!

589
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:26,400
我想知道，我和你谁会先死！
l want to know, between me and you, who's going to die first!

590
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:29,600
我刚才跟你说过闭嘴了吧！
Didn't l tell you to shut it?

591
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,740
你是说过，但是我凭什么听你的
That's right, l'm not going to shut up.

592
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:32,680
我叫你闭上你的臭嘴！
l said shut your hole!

593
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,270
你想怎么样，阿柯？
What are you going to do about it, Ko?

594
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,780
你们不要碰我！
You guys stay away from me too!

595
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:44,150
如果我以前不认识你们的话，今天我也不会在这里碰上这些鬼事情！
lf l hadn't known all of you, today l wouldn't be here to see shit like this!

596
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:45,320
我叫你闭嘴，泰尔！
l said, shut up Tair!

597
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,550
我们当时不应该搞什么计划的！不应该去偷拍的！
We wouldn't have planned it out! We wouldn't have to shoot that video!

598
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,790
就不会惹这些麻烦了！
We wouldn't have gotten into trouble!

599
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,860
也不会被那个死教练随意玩弄了！
We wouldn't have been sexually abused by that damn coach!

600
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,800
也不会吃下小努的肉了！
We wouldn't have to eat Noot's flesh!

601
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,530
泰尔！泰尔！泰尔！
Tair! Tair! Tair!

602
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,540
够了！
That's enough!

603
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:01,740
现在你可以闭嘴了吗？
Now will you shut up?

604
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:06,600
我们不是都说好，不再提那事了吗？
Didn't we all agree to never mention that incident ever again?

605
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,310
泰尔，你听我说！
Tair, you listen up!

606
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,020
现在每个人都和你一样害怕
Right now, everyone is scared just as you are.

607
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:19,920
但是你现在需要做的就是冷静，集中你的精神！
But what you have to do now is calm down. Focus!

608
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,260
明白吗？
Do you understand?

609
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,830
我们一起来祈祷吧
Come on, let's all pray.

610
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:33,100
我们祈祷佛祖会保佑我们
Let's pray that Buddha will protect us.

611
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,890
泰尔，你他妈的笑什么？
Tair, what the hell are you laughing about?

612
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,320
你们他妈的又在祈祷什么！
What the hell are you all praying about!

613
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,370
什么都不会保佑像你们一样的坏人！
Nothing can protect bad people like you!

614
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,160
泰尔！你他妈的怎么回事！
Tair! What the heck is the matter with you?

615
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,460
我叫你停下！你听到没有！
l told you to stop it! You hear me!

616
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:40,190
阿波，开枪！她已经不再是泰尔了！
Por, shoot her! She's not Tair anymore!

617
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:41,600
阿波！不要开枪！
Por! Don't do it!

618
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,470
潘老师，求求你…不要伤害我们，我好害怕
Teacher Panor, please...don't hurt us. l'm afraid!

619
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,010
放了我们吧！
Let us go please!

620
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:49,470
开枪！开枪啊！
Shoot her! Shoot her!

621
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,210
你真他妈没用！
Damn you!

622
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,710
阿柯！冷静啊，不要开枪！
Ko! Get a grip, don't do it!

623
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:55,410
你竟敢对我这样大声说话！
You dare raise your voice to me!

624
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,550
阿柯！
Ko!

625
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:06,720
我让你说！我让你的乌鸦嘴再说话！
Talk! You and your filthy mouth of yours!

626
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:10,230
现在让你说了！说啊！你怎么不说了？
Now is your chance to talk! Talk! Why don't you talk?

627
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,270
阿柯！你怎么了？
Ko! What the hell is wrong!

628
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:19,200
阿柯！你怎么了？
Hey Ko! What's the matter with you?

629
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,700
阿柯！你能听到我说话吗？
Ko! Can you hear me?

630
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:23,510
阿柯！该死的！
Ko! Damn!

631
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,280
阿柯！阿柯！伙计！
Ko! Ko! Hey man!

632
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,920
泰尔！醒醒啊！泰尔！
Tair! Wake up! Tair!

633
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:32,090
泰尔！快醒醒啊！泰尔！
Tair! Wake up please! Tair!

634
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,060
嘿！阿柯！
Hey! Ko!

635
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,720
阿柯！
Ko!

636
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,360
阿柯！
Ko!

637
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,370
阿柯！
Ko!

638
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,680
阿柯！
Ko!

639
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,170
阿柯！
Ko!

640
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,340
阿柯！
Ko!

641
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,860
你们现在打算怎么办？
What are we going to do now?

642
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,270
我们走不了，也就是说…
Since we can't get out of here, that means...

643
01:06:55,710 --> 01:07:04,540
…那个怪人老师就在这附近某处，对我们施以符咒
...that wacked out teacher is somewhere around here, placing spells on us!

644
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:07,940
阿波，你的意思是我们要…
Por, you mean, you want us to...

645
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,540
没错，轮到我们反击了！
That's right. lt's our turn to mess with her!

646
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:14,550
我不去！我哪也不去！
l'm not going! l'm not going anywhere!

647
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,060
我们就应该待在这里！
We should stay right here!

648
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,520
小金，你留下来照看她
Kim, you stay and look after her.

649
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:24,130
阿塔，你和我一起去
Ta, you're coming with me.

650
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:31,700
等一下！
Wait!

651
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,700
要小心啊！
Be careful!

652
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:39,070
你们俩都一样
The both of you.

653
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:54,480
小金，你不要离开我
Kim, don't you leave me here.

654
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,530
他们无处不在！
They are all around us!

655
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:01,900
我不想看到他们！
l don't want to see them!

656
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,970
泰尔！你看到了什么？
Tair! What do you see?

657
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:06,070
看到了什么？
Who do you see?

658
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,340
你真的看到了他们吗？他们在哪？
You really see them, don't you? Where are they?

659
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:15,650
他们在哪？泰尔！他们在哪？
Where are they? Tair! Where are they?

660
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:20,590
泰尔，你要去哪？
Tair, where are you going?

661
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:29,860
我们去那里找一下！
Let's check over there!

662
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:42,270
泰尔！你在哪里？
Tair! Where are you?

663
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:45,610
泰尔，等我一下！
Tair, wait!

664
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,010
小金！
Kim!

665
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,520
阿塔，等一下！
Ta, wait up man!

666
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,720
阿塔！
Ta!

667
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:27,550
出来，给我现身！
Come out, show yourself!

668
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,070
小金！
Kim!

669
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,080
小金！
Kim!

670
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:06,060
小金！你还好吗？
Kim! You okay?

671
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,300
我拉你上来！
l've got you!

672
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,950
现在没事了
You're ok now.

673
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:37,610
可能会有点疼！
This is gonna hurt!

674
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,200
坐一下吧
Sit for a while.

675

阿塔，你快去找阿波
Ta, you go check on Por.

676
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,380
我再也走不动了
l can't walk anymore.

677
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,550
你在这里真的没事吗？
You sure you're going to be all right here?

678
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:32,340
不要靠近我！
Stay away from me!

679
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:37,750
离我远点！
Keep away from me!

680

我不想看见你们！
l don't want to see any of you!

681

686
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,130
泰尔，你怎么了啊？

689
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:07,580
你不要过来！
Don't you come closer!

690
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,870
泰尔，别害怕
Tair. lt's okay.

691
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,650
泰尔！别跑了！
Tair! Stop it!

692
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,240
你不要过来！
Don't you come closer!

693
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,620
泰尔！你要去哪啊，泰尔？
Tair! Where are you going, Tair?

694
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,120
离我远点！
Get away from me!

695
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:19,660

698
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:25,920
泰尔

01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,430
我不想再看到你们了！

这样我就再也看不到你们了！

701
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:48,180
泰尔，不要啊！
Tair, stop!

702
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:56,050
我再也看不到你们了！看不到了！
l won't see you anymore! l can't see!

703
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,150
泰尔！泰尔！
Tair! Tair!

704
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:22,610
泰尔！
Tair!

705
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,430
小金！
Kim!

706
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,760
泰尔？
Tair?

707
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,070
小金！
Kim!

708
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:41,510
小金！小金！
Kim! Kim!

709
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:46,010
先坐下，小金
There you go, Kim.

710
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:52,450
没事了，小金，没什么好怕的
lt's all right Kim. There's nothing to be afraid of.

711
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,950
我和你在一起
l'm right here with you now.

712
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,450
那么你就不会再离开我了吗？
So now, you don't love me anymore?

713
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:03,860
阿波，你干什么啊？
Por, what's wrong with you?

714
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:05,990
现在你怎么了？
What's the matter now?

715
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:08,760
你刚才是不是拿枪指着我？
Didn't you just point a gun at me?

716
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:12,030
你觉得你真的能开枪打我吗？
You really think you can shoot me?

717
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:15,110
阿波！阿波！不要啊！
Por! Por! Don't do it!

718
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:17,540
开枪啊！
Shoot me!

719
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:19,510
开枪！
Shoot!

720
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,170
我叫你开枪！
l said shoot me!

721
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:24,980
扣扳机！
Pull the trigger!

722
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:27,950
阿波！不要！
Por! No!

723
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,660
阿塔，你他妈的干什么！走开！我要杀了她！
Damn you Ta! Get out of the way! l'm going to kill her!

724
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,100
你疯了吗？
Are you nuts?

725
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,030
离她远点！你疯了吗？
Get away from her! Are you nuts?

726
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:39,630
快点，小金！
Come on Kim!

727
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:35,340
你不愿招是吧？
So you don't want to confess, huh?

728
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:53,990
你这是要到哪去？
Where do you think you are going?

729
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,390
为什么不告诉我真相？
Why don't you tell me the truth?

730
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,470
你是爱我的
You love me.

731
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:07,540
我会让你招的
l'm going to make you confess.

732
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:13,100
还是不愿招吗？
Still don't want to confess?

733
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,790
你真的要这样做？
Are you sure about this?

734
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:52,140
嗯，看来你吸引了不少男人啊
Hmm, you seem to attract a lot of men.

735
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:02,890
阿塔，我看到你继母和欧教练鬼混
Ta, l saw your stepmom fooling around with that coach O-Larn.

736
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,400
他们正在体育馆里
They're in the gym.

737
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:23,510
我想让她被狠狠地折磨！
l want her to be brutally tortured!

738
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,130
你一定要帮我！
You have to help me!

739
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:43,690
我不知道还能找谁帮忙了
l don't know who else to turn to.

740
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,230
听好了，潘老师
Listen well, Mrs. Panor.

741
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:52,540
你想战胜所遭受到的残酷折磨，只有一个办法
There is only one way that you will be able to win over this ordeal.

742
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:14,370
你要吃掉那些诅咒你的人的肉
You must eat the flesh of those that cursed you.

743
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,000
但它也可能会同时致你疯狂
But it may make you insane.

744
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:22,070
因为他的所有力量都会流入你的体内
Because all of his powers will flow in your veins.

745
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:35,550
现在你能想起些什么了吧？
Can you remember anything now?

746
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,330
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

747
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:53,200
无论你的过去有多么肮脏，我都会为你洗干净的
No matter how dirty your past is, l'll clean you up good.

748
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:08,680
我想现在时间到了
l think, it is about time.

749
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:46,760
求你了！不要伤害我，老师！
Please! Don't hurt me, teacher!

750
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:49,660
我招了！我全都招了！
l'll confess! l'll confess everything!

751
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:53,030
就是我鼓动阿塔…
l was the one that encouraged Ta and...

752
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:55,190
…和他的朋友偷拍你和欧教练的
...his friends to tape you and coach O-Larn together.

753
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,460
就是我对你施加诅咒的
l was the one that put a curse on you.

754
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,540
我不应该那样对你的！
l shouldn't have had that affair with you!

755
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:09,010
我不应该那样看待你的！
l shouldn't have thought of you that way.

756
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,080
老师求求你放了我吧！
Teacher let me go please!

757
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:22,030
老师，求求你放了我吧！
Teacher, let me go please!

758
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:24,830
阿波
Por.

759
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,000
小金？阿塔？
Kim? Ta?

760
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,610
这都是真的吗，阿塔？
Is it true, Ta?

761
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:51,080
你怎么能这样？
How could you?

762
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:58,090
小金，求求你救我！小金，我犯了错！
Kim, help me please! Kim, l made a mistake!

763
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:06,600
我以为我们会永远相爱的，小金！
l thought that we would love each other forever, Kim!

764
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:11,570
我根本想不到你会这样冷血，我从没想到…
l never thought you could be so cruel. l never thought...

765
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:17,120
阿塔！阿塔，不要把我丢在这里！
Ta! Ta, don't leave me like this!

766
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:20,850
你不能和她在一起！不要把我丢在这里！
You can have her! Just don't leave me here!

767
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,280
我们走，阿塔
Let's get out of here, Ta.

768
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:26,150
阿塔，你个混帐，给我回来！
Ta, you bastard, come back here!

769
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:29,890
阿塔，你回来！
Ta, come back!

770
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,430
不要丢下我！
Don't leave me.

771
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:02,060
我不会让你死得那么舒服的，亲爱的
l'm not going to let you get away that easy, my dear.

772
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:04,990
开枪！
Shoot it!

773
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:28,620
老师！放开我吧！
Teacher! Let me go!

774

775
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:40,300

Teacher, l'm begging for you to let me go.

786
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:45,330
让你看清楚我的脸
You shall see my face clearly.

787
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,430
等下你就要去拜访湿婆了
And then you will pay a visit to the three eyed god.

788
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,600
但我得先给你清洁一下…
However, l have to clean you up first...

789
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,240
不要怕…
Don't worry...

790
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:23,430
现在你不紧张了吧
There, now you are at ease.

791

现在该彻底地给你清洁一下了
lt is time to clean you up from the inside out.

792
01:29:57,490 --> 01:30:02,390
阿塔！你继续走吧，我走不动了
Ta! You go on ahead. l can't go on.

793
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:10,260
不行，小金，我不会丢下你的
No Kim, l won't leave you!

794
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,940
你是不是打算不采取任何行动？
Listen, you're not going to do anything about it?

795
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:33,450
好吧，我自己搞定
Fine, l'll do something about it!

796
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:44,330
喂？喂？
Hello? Hello?

797

805
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:12,150
别动！小姐，你最好放下它！
Freeze! Miss, you better drop it!

806

01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,440
小金，挺住啊
Kim, hang on.

813
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:07,960
在我们的生命之路上，会有诸多选择…
On the path of life with many choices...

814
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:14,050
…有时，你根本不知道你的选择会带来怎样的结果
...sometimes we never know what the outcome of our choices will be.

815
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:19,640
但是，许多次我们知道应该或不应该做一件事情的时候
But then again, many times we know what we should or shouldn't do.

816
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:22,150
我们却没能做出明智的选择
We just neglect to chose wisely.

817
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:26,360
但是，这样说却是对的…
However, you may be correct in saying...

818
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:30,400
…有时，如果我们一开始就做出了正确的选择…
...sometimes if we had made the right choices from the start...

819
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:33,390
…死神就不会离我们如此之近
...death wouldn't be so close.

820
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,470
我和阿塔都能幸存下来…
Our lives, both mine and Ta's, were spared...

821
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:46,510
…所以，也许我们都能体会到我们生命的最终意义
...so that we may know what our purpose in life would ultimately be.

822
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,780
既不是为了未来，也不是为了过去
Not for the future, or for the past.

823
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:53,380
而是现在
But for the present.

824
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:59,850
我们在任何时刻，都要为自己选择正确的道路
We must choose the correct path at all times for our own sake.

825
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:06,360
我希望我能时刻看到那些选择
And l hope to see those choices at all times.

826
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:07,770
我好多了，爸爸
l'm better, Dad.

827
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:10,360
休息好了吧！我给你带了些吃的
Rest up! Here l brought you some treats.

828
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:12,100
谢谢妈妈
Thank you mother.

829
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:43,260
谢谢你来陪我
Thank you for staying with me.

830
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:50,200
阿塔，我们重新开始，好吗？
Ta, let's start all over again.

831
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:54,240
好
Yes.

832
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:14,730
我们现在正在潘老师的犯罪现场
We are now at the crime scene of the teacher, Panor.

833
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:18,570
警方搜索了潘老师的房子
Police have searched Mrs. Panor's house.

834
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:19,930
小金…
Kim...

835
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,440
我有些事要告诉你
l have something l have to tell you.

836
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:28,680
关于我在寄宿学校上学的事，我对你撒了谎
l lied to you about my time at boarding school.

837
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:31,280
其实我从没有在那里待过
l never stayed there.

838
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:36,150
我一直没告诉你是因为…
l never told you because...

839
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:39,320
…我觉得你不会理解我的
...l didn't think you could understand.

840
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:45,530
在河里找到的最后一具尸体是…
And the last body to be found in the river was...

841
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:49,130
…阿塔，也就是她的继子的尸体
...Ta, her stepson.

842
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:57,880
事情过去很久了，我觉得你应该忘了它
lt's been a long time already, l think you should just forget about it.

843
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,300
谢谢
Thank you.

844
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:05,540
好的，我会帮你收拾好
All right, l'll help you sweep up the place.

845
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,100
回到我身边，好吗？
Come back to me, please?

846
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:22,630
听着，如果你们要说甜言蜜语，不要在上课时间聊！
Listen, if you guys want to sweet talk each other, do it outside of school time!

847
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:25,170
打扰他人知道吗
lt's distracting.

848
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:36,250
我想告诉你，你毕业后我就发现了
l want to tell you what l've discovered after you graduated.

849
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,730
我想让你看到我所看到的一切
l wanted you to see what l've seen.

850
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:52,720
让其他人体验我所检验过的痛苦
To let others experience the pain, as l've experienced it.

851
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,560
她虐待我们，小金
She treated us badly, Kim.

852
01:36:55,770 --> 01:36:57,740
每个人都死得很恐怖
Everyone died a horrible death.

853
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:07,640
奶奶是被关在屋里饿死的
Grandma was locked up in the closet, and was starved to death.

854
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:17,560
而我呢，尽管那不是我的错，我却承担了所有的痛苦
As for me, even though it wasn't my fault, l carried all the pain.

855
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:20,990
每个人都应该帮我分担痛苦
Everyone should help me bear the pain.

856
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:26,270
阿波不应该成为你命中的那个人
Por should not be the one for you.

857
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:28,590
阿波不应该和你在一起，小金
Por wasn't meant for you, Kim.

858
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:44,880
小金！
Kim!

859
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:46,820
小金！
Kim!

860
01:37:56,230 --> 01:38:08,230
小金，你还记得吗，你总是想让我靠近你一些
Kim, do you remember, you always wanted me close. Didn't you?

861
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:11,470
小金，看到那个人了吗？
Hey Kim, you see that guy?

862
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:14,980
他是校队的明星，我喜欢他
He is star of the school team. l like him.

863
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:20,580
那你跟我说干嘛？我能把他从你那里抢过来
Why tell me then? I could steal him from you.

864
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:26,490
别忘了你总是第二名
Don't forget you're always number two in this school.

865
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,530
敢打赌吗？
Want to bet?

866
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:35,070
如果一周之内他不和我约会的话，我就永远都作第二名
lf in one week, he won't date me, l'll always be second to you.

867
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:45,770
这种事你一旦尝试…
Things like this, if you try it, and do it...

868
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:52,850
…它就将终生与你相伴
...it will be with you 'til the day you die!

869
01:38:57,650 --> 01:39:02,850
