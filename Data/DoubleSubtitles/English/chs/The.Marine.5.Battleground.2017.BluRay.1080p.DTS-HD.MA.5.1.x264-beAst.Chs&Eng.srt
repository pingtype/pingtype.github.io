不，没有其他出口
No. There's no other exits.

278
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,000
这里也没有讯号
And there's no signal down there,

279
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,400
所以他们不会报警的
so they can't call the cops.

280
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,640
要我再找后援吗？
You want me to get some back up?

281
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,610
不，我们困住他们了
No. We've got 'em trapped.

282
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,810
嘿，我们没事了
Hey. Hey. We're okay now.

283
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,880
- 他们走了  - 好
- They're gone.  - Okay. Okay.

284
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,700
我没机会给你打麻药
I didn't get a chance to administer morphine

285
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,890
因为我们的急救箱在卡车里
because our kit's in the truck,

286
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,320
他的脉搏跟电动钻一样快，他要休克了
and his pulse is racing like a jackhammer. He's going into shock.

287
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,170
我们必须现在就把他送到创伤外科那
We need to get him to a trauma surgeon, right now.

288
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,880
为什么那些家伙找你？
Why are these guys after you?

289
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,400
我跟你说过了，因为我们误闯禁区，他们就朝我们开枪
I told you. We just rolled up in the wrong hood. They jumped us.

290
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,760
带着机关枪误闯禁区？
Rolled up in the wrong hood with a machine gun?

291
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,960
最好是
Sure.

292
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,760
你被卷入枪战，还拖我们下水来救你
You got hit in a gunfight and dragged us down here to save you.

293
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,930
警察才不会为了心脏病来，你杀了谁？
Cops don't show up for heart attacks. Who'd you kill?

294
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,240
- 有差吗？ - 有差吗？
- What does it matter?  - What does it matter?

295
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,130
我想知道那些家伙会有多想抓住我们
I want to know how far these guys will go to see this through.

296
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,850
你杀了谁？
Who did you kill?

297
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,880
他们的头头，罗锥勾
The head of this biker gang. Their leader. Rodrigo.

298
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,760
我是被逼的，我别无选择
Look, I was forced to, I had no choice.

299
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,880
连开枪的都不是我，我只负责开车
I didn't even pull the trigger. I just drove the truck.

300
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,480
他们哪都不会去，是吗？
They're not going anywhere, are they?

301
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,920
他妈的没错
Hell yeah.

302
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,200
[地下五楼]
[地下六楼]

303
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,800
主说：“要有光”
And the good Lord said, "Let there be light."

304
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,330
那手机呢？
And what about the cell phones?

305
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,200
如果他们来这，他们还是可以报警
Look, if they get up here, they can still call the cops.

306
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,320
往东十条街就有个讯号台
There's a cell tower 10 blocks east.

307
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,080
如果我们把那弄坏，我们就能完全把他们制伏了
If we knock that out, we have them on total lock-down.

308
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,960
- 动手吧  - 嘿，我的摩托车还在那边
- Do it.  - Hey, man, my bike's still down there.

309
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,560
骑她的
Well, take her bike.

310
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,480
说的对
Right on.

311
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,480
电梯还是不动，可能是用别的发电机
Elevator's still out. Must be on a different power supply.

312
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,480
好，我们从楼梯走去公园
Okay. We can take the stairs and make it to the park.

313
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,720
我们不可能绕过他们的，而且还有他在
We'll never get past them, especially carrying him.

314
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,250
喂，救护人员！
Yo, paramedics!

315
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,240
我们不要再玩躲猫猫了
We ain't playing no more hide and seek.

316
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,210
我们也不会走的
And we ain't leaving neither.

317
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,800
除非你们把那小丑给我们
Not till you give me that clown

318
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,480
你们一定是躲在下面！
you've got hiding down there!

319
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,450
你们还有三分钟可以交出他
You have three minutes to hand him over,

320
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,520
不然我们就要来杀了你
or we're coming down to kill you.

321
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,680
你自己选吧
Your choice.

322
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,560
不
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

323
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,530
- 嘿  - 怎么会这样，这太疯狂了
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.  - This can't be happening. This is crazy.

324
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,760
- 我会想办法的  - 想什么办法？
- I'll work this out.  - Work what out?

325
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,960
他已经失血至少一小时了
Look, he's been hemorrhaging blood for at least an hour.

326
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,850
他可能都已经没了百分之十的血
He's lost probably 10% already.

327
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,000
- 我可以让他稳定  - 用什么？
- I can stabilize him.  - With what?

328
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,810
我们没有工具
Look, we don't have the equipment.

329
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,040
他需要输血
He needs a blood transfusion.

330
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,560
卡特，我们能做的都做了
Carter, there's nothing more that we can do.

331
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,840
我们不会交出他的
We're not handing him over.

332
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,680
我能听到你说话
You know, I can hear you.

333
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,250
我们上次要求遣派是何时？
When did we last contact dispatch?

334
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,800
- 凌晨一点五十分  - 那就是四十分钟前
- 1:50 AM.  - So that's 40 minutes ago.

335
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,290
若我们二十分钟内不回应
If we don't respond in the next 20 minutes,

336
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,600
他们就会派警车到我们上次的地点，对吗？
they'll send a cop car to our last location, right?

337
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,240
- 规矩是那样  - 好
- That's protocol.  - Okay.

338
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,130
所以我们找个地方躲起来，直到他们来到这
So we find a place to hide, and hole up till they get here.

339
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,250
那个管理门，我们躲在那没人会看见
That maintenance door, we'll be out of sight in there.

340
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,900
我们需要紧急救护箱来稳定他
We need our kit to stabilize him,

341
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,000
不然他会没命的
or he's not gonna make it.

342
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,110
我去卡车那拿箱子，你把他带到门那
I'll get the kit from the truck, you get him to the door.

343
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,490
如果我们这样做，警察会来的
Look, if we do this, it's gonna be cops coming.

344
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,050
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

345
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,130
我只想再见我女儿一面
I just wanna see my baby girl again.

346
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,920
好，我们开始吧
Okay. Let's do this.

347
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:58,000
好，我们走！对，我来照顾他，走
Okay. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. I got him. I got him. Let's go.

348
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,200
别停
Don't stop.

349
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,880
二七四队，进来
Medic 274, come in.

350
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,560
拜托，大伙们，状况如何？
Come on, guys. What's the status of that Code 3?

351
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,600
快接无线电，卓
Pick up the radio, Zoe, or it's your ass

352
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,900
不然我就要报警了
if I have to haul in a black-and-white.

353
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,960
靠
Shit.

354
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,480
我们必须找到他们，现在，看楼梯！上！
We need to find 'em, right now! Check the stairs! Go!

355
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,120
阿龙卓
Alonzo.

356
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,920
去下面把他们赶出来
Get down there and flush them out.

357
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,280
别动
Don't move!

358
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,040
把手举起来
Show me your hands.

359
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,120
我只是救护人员，不用这样
I'm just a medic.

360
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,320
开启，能量选择▲充电▲电击
You don't have to do this.

361
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,800
我说，把手举起来！
I said, show me your hands!

362
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,720
别那样，别…
Don't do it. Don't...

363
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,050
我们快到了
We're nearly there. Nearly there.

364
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,200
好
Okay.

365
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,170
- 去柱子后面  - 干
- Behind the pillar.  - Behind the pillar. Fuck.

366
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,640
他回来了
He's coming back around.

367
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,320
柯尔…
Cole...

368
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,010
你可以自己走到门吗？
Can you make it to the door by yourself?

369
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,960
可以
Yeah. Yeah.

370
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,400
- 我来让他们分心  - 不，等一下
- I'll create a diversion.  - No. Wait.

371
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,960
杰克！杰克，救命！
Jake! Jake, help!

372
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,360
杰克！
Jake! Jake!

373
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,970
- 卓在哪？ - 他们抓到她了
- Where's Zoe?  - They got her.

374
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,280
靠
Shit.

375
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,090
嘿，有什么可以止痛的吗？
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You think I could get something for the pain?

376
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,320
拜托
Please. Please, man.

377
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,560
二七四队，重复，你现在情况如何？
274, again, what's your status?

378
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,970
时机刚好，给我起来
Well, you're just in time. Get off your ass.

379
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,450
二七四队，立刻回复
274, report immediately.

380
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,840
跟他们说你没事
Open it up and tell them you're okay.

381
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,640
我没钥匙
I don't have the key.

382
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,010
拜托，大伙们，我需要你们回答
Come on, you guys. I need you to check in.

383
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,730
告诉他们你没事
Tell them you're okay.

384
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,720
卓，我已经受不了了
Zoe, I'm getting really tired of this.

385
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,520
这值得拼命吗？
Is it worth dying for?

386
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,010
- 告诉他们  - 够了
- Tell them.  - That's it.

387
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,890
我要派警车了
I'm sending in a black and white.

388
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,280
二七四队回覆
Medic 274 responding.

389
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,730
终于，威廉斯
Well, about time, Williams.

390
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,530
你跑去哪了？需要支援吗？
Where have you been? Do you need assistance?

391
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,330
跟他们说没事
Tell them it was nothing.

392
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,280
说只是个恶作剧，没什么好汇报的
It was just a prank. Nothing to report.

393
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,680
收到，二七四队，留线待命，完毕
Copy, 274. Stay on the air in the future. Out.

394
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,080
没人会来救你了
No one's coming to save your ass now.

395
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,160
你确定吗？
Are you sure about that?

396
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,320
闭嘴！
Shut up!

397
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,000
我的伙伴，他不是一般的救护人员
My partner, he's not just some kind of paramedic.

398
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,250
他以前还是海军陆战队，受训过的杀手
He's an ex-Marine, a trained killer.

399
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,000
他会在放弃那孩子之前
And he'll send every last one of you guys

400
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,360
先把你们一个个送进地狱
to hell before he deserts that kid.

401
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,640
- 靠，放松  - 你到底想不想要吗啡？
- Ah! Shit. Take it easy.  - You want morphine, or not?

402
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,720
你叫什么名字？
What's your name, man?

403
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,200
卡特，杰克卡特
Carter. Jake Carter.

404
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,130
我们需要换一下这个
We need to change this.

405
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,500
我很抱歉我把你们叫来
Look, I'm sorry I called you down here.

406
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,000
我为这一切道歉
Sorry any of this happened.

407
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,240
把这压好
Put pressure here.

408
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,050
我只是在保护我的女儿
I was just protecting my daughter.

409
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,690
我想要她好好长大
I wanted her to grow up safe.

410
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,160
现在看来我也活不了多久了
Now it looks like I'm not even gonna be around.

411
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,080
你会活的
You'll be around.

412
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,520
振作点
Hold it together.

413
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,680
我的宝贝五岁了
My baby girl's five now.

414
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,370
我在蹲时每天都拿着这个
I had this with me every day when I was on the inside.

415
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,680
你坐过牢？
You were in prison?

416
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,960
我在人生中做过一些错事
Look, man, I've done some dumb things in my life,

417
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,160
但我不是坏人
but I ain't a bad person.

418
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,440
今晚以前我从没拿过枪
I never even held a gun before tonight.

419
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,080
现在别想那个了，想想这个
Don't think about that now. Think about this.

420
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,480
为这个活着
Live for this.

421
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,490
现在我要去看看我伙伴了
Now, I gotta go see about my partner.

422
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,840
嘿，锅盖头
Hey, jarhead.

423
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,610
你在听吗？
You listening?

424
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,840
你朋友在我们手上，她有话要跟你说
We got your girl, and she's got something she has to tell you.

425
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,920
跟他说，他必须知道你还活着
Tell him. He has to know you're still alive.

426
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,130
他们让我撤遣派，杰克，没人要来了
They made me reply to dispatch, Jake. No one's coming.

427
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,720
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

428
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,970
你听到了吗？
You hear that?

429
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:35,680
风水轮流转，要换我们占上风了
The odds are stacked, and we've got the winning hand.

430
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,170
问题是，谁的命你比较在乎？
The only question is, which life do you value most?

431
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,400
她的？还是你在下面保护的那斓货？
Hers? Or that cockroach you got down there with you?

432
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,920
别把我交出去，拜托
Don't give me in, man, please.

433
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,240
该做出选择了，混帐！
Time to make a choice, asshole!

434
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,120
拜托，锅盖头
Come on, jarhead.

435
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,840
那孤僻鬼杀了我们的人
That lone wolf killed one of our own.

436
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,680
正义是我们的！以牙还牙！
We deserve justice! Blood for blood!

437
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,090
孤僻鬼？
Lone wolf?

438
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,480
我数到三
I'm gonna count to three.

439
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,960
- 一！ - 他们认识你吗？
- One!  - Do they know you?

440
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,280
- 什么？ - 他们认得你吗？
- What?  - Do they know your face?

441
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,440
- 我不知道  - 二
- I don't know.  - Two.

442
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,210
他们看过你吗？他们有看过你吗？
Did they see you? Did they actually see you?

443
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,440
没有，只有会长
No. No, just the president.

444
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,000
三
Three.

445
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,760
停！别开枪！
Stop! Don't shoot!

446
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,040
别杀她！我同意！
Don't kill her! I'll do it!

447
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,160
- 我会交换  - 不
- I'll make the trade.  - No.

448
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,480
我在楼下！快来找他！
I'm on the bottom level! Come and get him!

449
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,560
- 我需要你的外套  - 什么？
- I need your jacket.  - What?

450
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,000
- 你在干嘛？ - 他们以为只有一个人
- What are you doing?  - They think it's one guy.

451
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,240
快骑上摩托车，给我你的手
Get your ass on the bike. Give me your hands.

452
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,120
你知道要做什么
You know what to do.

453
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,930
文森，我是阿龙卓
Vincent, it's Alonzo.

454
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,480
我们在游乐场的地下车库
We're at the underground garage at the amusement park.

455
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,720
完事了
Job's done.

456
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,520
他死了！
He's dead!

457
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,520
是你吗，锅盖头？
That you, jarhead?

458
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,640
现身
Show yourself.

459
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,880
你有你想要的了
You got what you wanted.

460
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,280
现在放开我的伙伴后走吧
Now let my partner go, and leave.

461
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,560
对
Yeah.

462
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,490
要不然我杀了你的婊子伙伴，把你剁了喂狗如何？
How about I blast your bitch partner, carve you up for my dogs?

463
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,360
然后我再走
And then I'll leave.

464
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,640
听见了吗？
Hear that?

465
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,640
这是一把直径点三五七的枪弄出来的声音
That's the first noise a .357 makes.

466
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,840
想在这待会儿吗？
Wanna hang around for the second?

467
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,400
鬼扯
Bullshit.

468
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,040
干！他他妈的从哪拿来的？
Fuck! Where the hell did he get that?

469
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,500
从你朋友那
From your friend.

470
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,640
在我将刀插进她肚子后
After I stuck a knife in her gut.

471
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,210
我刚说什么了？
What did I say?

472
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,320
你这混帐！
You son of a bitch!

473
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:57,080
迪康，你会得到正义的
Deacon. You will get justice.

474
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,610
你想要正义？
You want justice?

475
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,920
他偷袭了我们
He flanked us.

476
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,730
在这
There it is.

477
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,200
正义，在你脚边
Justice. At your feet.

478
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,040
上面有刺青吗？
There ain't no ink on that body?

479
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,800
那才不是摩托车帮的
That ain't no biker.

480
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,490
他什么时候死的？
When did he die?

481
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,840
二十分钟前
Twenty minutes ago.

482
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,490
我做了一切我能做的
I did all I could.

483
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,640
为什么你之前不交出他
Why didn't you give him up before?

484
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,280
因为我觉得就算我交出他，你也不会放了我伙伴
'Cause I didn't think you'd let my partner go even if I did.

485
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,050
谁说我现在就会？
Who's to say I will now?

486
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,240
值得一试
Me being a good shot.

487
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,400
他他妈的在哪？
Where the fuck is he?

488
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,560
好了，锅盖头
All right, jarhead.

489
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,840
换你了
Your round.

490
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,360
把那鬼东西照起来
Photograph that piece of shit.

491
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,290
想把我从这堆弄出来吗？
Wanna help me get out of these?

492
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,440
不！
No!

493
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:14,010
你真的以为我们就会这样离开吗，锅盖头？
You really think we'll just walk away, jarhead?

494
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,010
你不知道你闯了什么祸
You don't know what you just started.

495
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,720
都被困住了还敢讲大话
Big words for a cornered rat.

496
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:55,290
文森随时都会到，我们找到我们来找的那家伙了
Vince will be here soon. We got the guy we came here for.

497
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:58,690
- 锅盖头怎办？ - 我们到楼上后解决他
- What about the jarhead?  - We'll cut him off at the top.

498
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,560
走吧
Let's go.

499
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,760
你说你这边都完事了？
You said you were done here?

500
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:57,210
结束了
We are done. It's over.

501
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,610
今天对我们帮派来说真糟
It's a dark day for our club.

502
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:06,000
但正义与我们同在，我恭喜你
But justice has been dealt. I congratulate you.

503
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,160
我们抓到那混帐了
We got that son of a bitch.

504
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,000
他死了
He's dead.

505
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,080
- 那另一个呢？ - 什么另一个
- What about the other one?  - What other one?

506
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,880
- 有两个家伙来闹事  - 什么？
- There were two guys who did the hit.  - What?

507
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,530
不，就一个人，我看见他了
No, it was a lone wolf, I saw him.

508
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,680
- 什么时候？ - 我们到这的时候
- When?  - When we got here.

509
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,500
紧急救护队来试着把他救出去
The EMTs tried to bust him out with the pickup.

510
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,800
后头还有个家伙受伤
There was one wounded guy in the back.

511
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,450
我看了警卫室监视器了，阿龙卓！
I watched the security tapes, Alonzo!

512
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,320
卡车里有两个人，两个！
There were two guys in that truck. Two!

513
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:35,920
一个开车，一个开枪，你蠢吗？
A driver and a shooter. Are you stupid?

514
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:38,970
意思就是有一个还在外头！
That means one of them bastards is still out there!

515
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,500
嗯
Huh.

516
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:22,680
没子弹了吧？
Out of bullets, huh?

517
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,000
我还有很多子弹
I got lots of bullets.

518
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,720
斧头兵降临
The axeman cometh.

519
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:14,280
拜托
Oh, please.

520
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,640
- 谢谢你来帮忙  - 谢谢你给我吗啡
- Thanks for the help.  - Thanks for the morphine.

521
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,810
嘿，救护人员
Hey, paramedic!

522
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:39,640
我们知道那混球不是自己一个人在下面！
We know that motherfucker wasn't alone down there!

523
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:41,480
叫支援
Call for backup.

524
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,520
我有枪，子弹，和无线电
All right? I want guns, ammo, and radios.

525
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:49,890
我会把这混帐赶出来的
I'll flush this bastard out.

526
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:51,200
走！
Go on!

527
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,320
有人在骗我们他有很多子弹，是吗？
Someone was lying about having lots of ammo, weren't they?

528
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:15,840
柯尔
Cole.

529
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:18,000
柯尔，嘿，柯尔
Cole. Hey. Cole.

530
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,700
你还醒着吗？
You still with me?

531
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:21,160
嗯
Yeah.

532
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,640
你的伙伴在哪？
Where's your partner?

533
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,440
她死了，他们杀了她
She's dead. They killed her.

534
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,120
干
Fuck.

535
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,960
嘿！
Hey!

536
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,090
嘿！
Hey!

537
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,210
救护人员先生！
Mr. Paramedic man!

538
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:42,320
你不认识我
You don't know me,

539
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:45,320
但看看，我一支独秀！
but see here, I run this show!

540
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,320
我有更多人和枪在路上
I got more men and more guns coming.

541
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:51,200
就算我们把这整个停车场翻遍
And we're gonna sweep every inch

542
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,500
也要找到你
of this place until we find you.

543
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,850
我会找到你
And I will find you!

544
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,810
我没用了，兄弟，你已经尽你所能了
Look, I'm wasted, man, you've done all you can.

545
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,320
就走吧
Just go.

546
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:05,760
你自己一个人更有机会从这出去
You got a better chance of making it out of here alone.

547
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,700
这些家伙杀了我同伴
These guys killed my partner.

548
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:11,040
我们同病相怜，来吧
We're in this together now. Come on.

549

Gotta get some blood into you.

Let's go!

我找到他了
I got him.

Let's go.

- We can do this.  - We can. Do it for Rodrigo.

561
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,640
- 我们在哪？ - 在电梯里
- Where are we?  - In the elevator.

562
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,840
你刚刚心膊要停止了
You were going into cardiac arrest.

563

这是战斗输血，我是0型血，没事的
It's combat transfusion. I'm O positive. It's safe.

564

战斗什么？
Combat what?

565
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,320
在海陆是基本训练
It's standard practice in the Marines.

566
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,440
- 你是海军陆战队的？ - 是
- You're a Marine?  - Yes, sir.

567
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,160
难怪你这么勇猛
No wonder you're such a badass.

Oh, God.

569

噢！
Oh.

你干嘛这样？
Why did you do all this?

571
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,840
这是笔债
It was a debt.

572
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,880
我在牢里时，有个家伙给我和泰勒庇护
When I was in jail, some guy offered me and my buddy Taylor protection.

573
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,800
当我们出来时，我们说我们欠他的
When we got out, said we owed him.

574
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:55,040
他让你替他杀人？
He told you to kill somebody for him?

575
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:58,290
对，跟他曾有不合的摩托车帮头头
Yeah, head of some biker gang he had beef with.

576
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,100
我们不要，但他伤害了泰勒的兄弟
We said no, but then he came after Taylor's brother,

577
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,800
至今未醒
put him in a coma.

578
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:07,040
他说我的女儿就是下一个，天哪
He told me my baby girl was next. God.

579
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,600
我别无选择，我必须这样
I had no choice, I had to do it.

580
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,080
我向罗锥勾发过誓
I made a promise to Rodrigo

581
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,040
我会替他报仇
that I'd avenge his death.

582
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,250
而作为你们的新头头
And as your new leader,

583
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:36,960
我会把这当作我第一个政绩
I am making this my first order of business.

- God.  - I'm gonna get this thing working.

Do you know what you're doing?

你爬楼梯，我们走坡道
You take the stairs. We'll take the ramps.

593
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,530
你知道怎么给车起火吗？
You know how to hot-wire a car?

594
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:13,680
干嘛，就因为我蹲过，我就要知道怎么帮车起火吗？
What, just because I've been to jail, I know how to hot-wire a car?

595
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,880
好，我知道，但那不一样
Okay, I do, but it's not the same.

596
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,760
这是我们唯一的机会，快跟我说要怎么做
It's our only chance. Talk me through it quick.

597
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,890
要拿出黄线，但别剪
You wanna take out the yellow wire, but don't cut it.

598

把它绑到白线上
Tie it to the white one.

599

黄线？没有黄线啊
Yellow? There is, there is no yellow.

600
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:36,000
来吧，大伙们，该赢得那些了
Come on, boys. Time to earn those patches.

Got eyes on the jarhead. But where the fuck is the kid?

691
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,320
在那！
There!

692
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:37,840
来吧！
Come on!

693
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:15,570
我们让他跑了
We got him running.

694
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,280
- 去右侧切断他去路  - 好
- Take the right flank, cut him off.  - All right.

695
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:18,720
你跟我来！
You, with me!

696
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,730
你完蛋了，混帐！
You're finished, asshole!

697
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,080
告诉我们他在哪！
Tell us where he is!

698
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,760
来吧，现在！
Come on, now!

699
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:18,240
该是时候结束一切了！把他交出来！
It's time to end this! Hand him over!

700
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:19,600
来抓他！
Come get him!

701
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:48,440
我抓到他了
I got him, man.

702
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:50,930
他他妈的玩完了
He's fucking done.

703
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:53,400
我们要来抓的混帐在哪？
Where's the son of a bitch we came for?

704
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,360
我抓到了，活的
I got him. Alive.

705
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:24,120
我们现在搞清楚是谁送你来的
Now we find out who sent you.

706
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:32,000
没刺青，就跟另一个家伙一样
No ink, just like that other guy.

707
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:33,500
啊！
Ah!

708
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:34,640
你是谁？
Who are you?

709
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:42,250
- 哪个帮派来的？ - 我没有帮派
- What gang are you from?  - I am not from any gang.

710
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:43,500
那你干嘛干这种活？
Then why you'd do it?

711
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,460
我别无选择，他们逼我的
I had no choice. I was forced to.

712
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:46,960
谁逼你的？
By who?

713
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,730
杀了那条狗
Put that dog down.

714
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,760
他！就是他！
Him! It was him.

715
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:55,440
- 他让我干的  - 滚到一边，阿龙卓
- He made me do it.  - Step aside, Alonzo.

716
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:58,250
- 他在说什么？ - 他在说谎！滚到一边
- What's he talking about?  - He's lying! Step aside.

717
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:59,600
- 他在说什么？ - 我他妈的射你！
- What's he talking about?  - I'll fucking shoot you!

718
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,080
我没在说谎！
I am not lying!

719
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,890
我们之前一起在圣昆汀州立监狱，E区
We were in San Quentin together, E block.

720
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:07,920
我一出狱他就逼我这样做，他威胁了我的家人
He forced me to do it once I got out. He threatened my family.

721
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:11,160
你之前就在E区
You were in E block.

722
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:13,290
暗杀是你计划的？
You ordered the hit?

723
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:15,480
- 是不是你计划的？ - 我必须那样！
- Did you order a hit?  - I had to!

724
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,050
你必须那样？
You had to?

725
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:18,520
为什么？
Why?

726
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,200
罗锥勾很懦弱
Rodrigo was weak.

727
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:25,000
跟其他帮派结党营私
Making alliances with other gangs.

728
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:28,400
军团团员不分享，我们抢！
Legionnaires don't share, we take!

729
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:29,720
他在扼杀我们的帮派！
He was killing this club!

730
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:32,720
你们要是没看见就是他妈的瞎了
And y'all are fucking blind if you don't see it!

731
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:37,040
你要管管吗，阿龙卓？
Are you gonna take charge, Alonzo?

732
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:40,280
你他妈的垃圾叛徒！
You traitor piece of shit!

733
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:44,080
干！
Fuck!

734
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:47,760
混帐，我杀了你们每个人
Son of a bitch, I'll fucking kill every one of you!

735
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,000
不！
No!

736
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:53,370
他是我的血亲，放了他
He's my blood. Leave him.

737
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:01,090
我为了你这么做，我为了我们！
I did this for you, I did it for us!

738
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,880
大哥，这是为了失踪军团
This is for the Legion, big brother.

739
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:09,320
哦，天哪，不！
Oh, God, no! No!

740
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,040
换你了
You're next.

741
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:39,170
天，该死！
Oh, God! Damn!

742
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,200
感觉如何？
How's that feel, huh?

743
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:42,910
嗯？
Huh?

744
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,640
- 让他血流干！ - 不
- Let him bleed out!  - No.

745
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:50,880
不，把汽油拿来
No. Get that gasoline.

746
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:54,160
什么？不
What? No. No.

747
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:55,800
- 没错  - 不
- Yeah.  - No, no, no, no.

748
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:57,690
今晚
Tonight,

749
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:03,240
我们要来点小烤肉派对
we're gonna have ourselves a little barbecue, huh?

750
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:07,160
听着，我有个女儿，好吗？
Listen, man, I have a daughter. Okay?

751
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,570
我有个小女儿
Oh. I got a little girl.

752
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:15,040
那是警察吗？
Is that cops?

753
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:18,840
是他
It's him.

754
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:26,960
滚开！
Move!

755
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,440
来吧！滚开！
Come on! Move your ass!

756
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:42,500
啊！
Argh!

757
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:43,600
该死！
God damn!

758
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:47,120
他是我的
He's mine, man. He's mine.

759
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,080
快走
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

760
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,080
去你的！
Fuck you!

761
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,760
嘿，卡特，可以让海陆帮个忙吗？
Yo, Carter, I could really use some Marine shit.

762
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:23,650
用绳索谄死他
Use the strap, choke him out!

763
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:30,560
卡特
Carter.

764
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:32,880
卡特，转轮子
Carter, turn the wheel.

765
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:44,960
你还好吗？
You okay?

766
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:55,440
拜托，给我个讯号
Come on, give me a signal.

767
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,320
干
Oh, fuck.

768
01:18:57,410 --> 01:18:59,840
- 现在怎么办？ - 他要来了
- Now what?  - He's coming, he's coming.

769
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:05,040
救护车坏了，抓好
Ambulance is dead. Grab on to something.

770
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:30,330
高处没人，我们走，来
Come on. High ground, it's clear. Let's go, come on.

771
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:50,560
来，就是这样
Come on. That's it.

772
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,760
没讯号
No signal.

773
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:09,360
靠
Oh, shit.

774
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,920
我们必须继续前进
We gotta keep moving, come on.

775
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,850
快来
Come on.

776
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:44,600
靠，快来
Shit. Come on, come on, come on.

777
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,080
你要他吗？
You want him?

778
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:57,410
得先经过我
You'll have to go through me.

779
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:21,320
靠
Shit.

780
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:27,560
快，我们快走，快来
Come on, here we go, we gotta move. Come on. Come on!

781
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:38,560
继续走
Keep going.

782
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:41,170
快
Come on.

783
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:44,480
我们有讯号了
We got a signal. We got a signal.

784
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:50,520
杰克卡特，二七四队
Jake Carter, Medic 274.

785
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:53,250
我有个伤患，枪伤，大失血
I've got a wounded man, GSW, severe hemorrhaging.

786
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,890
立即遣派医疗和警方援护
Request immediate medical assistance and police backup.

787
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:01,500
我们在施工区
We're at the construction site,

788
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:03,590
圣卡洛斯大道的西边
west of San Carlos Boulevard...

789
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:09,880
上屋顶，去！
Get to the roof. Go!

790
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:27,440
我要杀了那小子，锅盖头
I'm gonna kill that kid, jarhead.

791
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,890
嘿，死人
Hey, dead man!

792
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:31,760
嘿，你，死人
Yeah, you, dead man.

793
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:33,880
你听见了吗？
You hear me?

794
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:40,010
我要来找你了
I'm coming for you.

795
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,960
你再跑也没用了
There ain't no sense in running no more.

796
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:23,880
报应的时候到了，混帐
It's the hour of reckoning, you son of a bitch.

797
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:25,290
别动
Stop.

798
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:26,920
警察要来了
The cops are coming.

799
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,920
是吗？那就让他们看着
Yeah? Well, let's give them a show.

800
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:34,000
你准备好飞了吗？
You ready to fly?

801
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:39,240
首先，你跳下这楝楼
First, you go off this building,

802
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:41,360
然后我就去找你家人
then I'm gonna come find your family.

803
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:45,500
我会把他们锁在屋里
I'm gonna lock them in a house,

804
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,100
一把火把他们烧成灰！
and then I'm gonna burn it to the ground!

805
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:49,530
听见了吗？
Do you hear me?

806
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:57,680
干！
Fuck!

807
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:05,560
你的大腿动脉爆裂了
Your femoral artery is ruptured.

808
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:09,250
必须得有个止血带，不然你再几分钟就会流血身亡的
You need a tourniquet, or you're gonna bleed to death in minutes.

809
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:13,250
快帮我
Yeah. Well, do it.

810
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:14,720
快啊！
Do it! Come on!

811
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,720
你杀了我同伴
You murdered my partner.

812
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:23,840
不
No, no. No, no, no.

813
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:26,730
不，别走
No, no, no. Don't go. No, no, no.

814
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:31,570
你是个救护人员，那是你的工作
You're a paramedic. It's your job.

815
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,680
做好你的工作
Do what's right.

816
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:02,800
啊！
Ahhh!

817
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:06,920
我会像杀了你婊子同伴一样杀了你
I'm gonna kill you like I killed your bitch partner.

818
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:48,440
天杀的
Oh, God damn.

819
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:15,690
这样才像海陆
Now, that's some Marine shit.

820
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:25,440
谢了，说的对
Thanks for your statement. Yeah, thanks.

821
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,440
可以给我点时间吗？
Can you give me a minute?

822
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,000
他会没事吧？
He gonna be all right?

823
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:39,600
你输的血应该救了他的命
That transfusion you did probably saved his life.

824
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:41,600
他会没事的
He'll be fine.

825
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:49,520
你之前掉了这个，我想你会想要留着的
You dropped this earlier. I didn't think you'd wanna leave it behind.

826
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:55,730
我得告诉警方所有事
I'm gonna have to tell the cops everything.

827
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:59,520
- 你知道那件事？ - 嗯，我猜到了
- You know that?  - Yeah, I figured.

828
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:02,320
意思就是你得回去蹲了
Means you're going back to jail.

829
01:28:04,410 --> 01:28:06,680
至少我能看见我女儿长大
At least I get to see my baby girl grow up.

830
