I Can't Wait - 等不及
Tim Reimherr

There’s a place I’ve been more real than what I’ve seen
似曾相識之處 真實過於眼所見
You lead me by the hand into the chamber of the King
祢親手帶領我 進入大君王居所
Take me away to the place that I never want to leave
帶我進入 榮耀之處 使我永遠不離開
I’ve tasted and I’ve known of a love that’s better than wine
我嘗過主恩滋味遠比酒更加甜美
Come to me, my Lord Only You can satisfy
主啊願祢來 滿足我心只有祢的愛

I can’t wait for our wedding day to come
等不及 我們的婚禮來臨
Let me see Your face Let me feel Your arms of love
讓我見祢榮面 在你愛的膀臂中

I have been betrothed to the King above all Kings
我已經許配 給那萬王之王
I am not my own and You pledged Yourself to me
不再屬自己 全心全人都獻上

Come, Jesus Come for us, Lord
願祢來 願祢快來
