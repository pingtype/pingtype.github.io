Magnificent - 榮美輝煌HillsongWho compares to You? Who set the stars in their place誰與祢相比使眾星遍滿夜空You who calmed the raging seas that came crashing over me 當風雨向我靠近祢使浪靜風平息Who compares to You? You who bring the morning light誰與祢相比在⿊暗綻放晨光The hope of all the earth is rest assured in Your great love全地的盼望隱藏在祢奇妙⼤愛You're magnificent, eternally, wonderful, glorious祢是榮美輝煌永遠同在奇妙神榮耀主Jesus, no one ever will compare to You, Jesus耶穌無⼈能與祢相比我主耶穌Where the evening fades, You call forth the song of joy當⿊夜過去祢使我⼼歡唱As the morning awakes, We, Your children give You praise當清晨來到祢兒女獻上讚美
