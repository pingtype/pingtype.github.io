There Is None Like You - 無⼈能像祢Lenny LeBlanc  There is none like You無⼈能像祢No one else can touch my heart like You do惟有祢能摸著我靈深處I could search for all eternity long我雖⽤盡⼀⽣來追求and find there is none like You哦～主無⼈能像祢Your mercy flows like a river wide祢的憐憫如江河湧流and healing comes from Your hands祢的⼿充滿醫治Suffering children are safe in Your arms受苦者在祢懷裡得安息There is none like You無⼈能像祢
