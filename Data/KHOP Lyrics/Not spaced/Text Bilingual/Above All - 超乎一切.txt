Above All 超乎⼀切Paul BalocheAbove all powers, above all kings超乎眾權能超乎眾王above all nature and all created things超乎眾受造和宇宙眾萬物Above all wisdom and all the ways of men超乎眾智慧和眾⼈的道路You are here before the world began 是祢創造天地和萬物Above all kingdoms, above all thrones超乎眾國度超乎權位above all wonders the world has ever known超乎這世界所知和所想像Above all wealth and treasures of the earth超乎這世上的財富和珍寶there's no way to measure what You're worth 無⼀事物能與祢相比Crucified, laid behind the stone釘⼗架埋葬在⽯洞You lived to die, rejected and alone祢捨⽣命被拒絕和孤單Like a rose, trampled on the ground像玫瑰遭踐踏在地You took the fall and thought of me above all勝過死亡祢顧念我超乎⼀切
