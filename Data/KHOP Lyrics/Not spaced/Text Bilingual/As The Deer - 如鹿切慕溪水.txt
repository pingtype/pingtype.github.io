As The Deer 如鹿切慕溪⽔Martin Nystrom As the deer panteth for the water so my soul longeth after You神啊我的⼼切慕祢如鹿切慕溪⽔You a lone are my heart's desire and I long to worship You唯有祢是我⼼所愛我渴慕來敬拜祢You alone are my strength, my shield祢是我的⼒量盾牌To You alone may my spirit yield我靈單單降服於祢You a lone are my heart's desire and I long to worship You唯有祢是我⼼所愛我渴慕來敬拜祢You're my friend and You are my brother even though You are a king雖祢是我君王卻稱我是祢的朋友弟兄I love You more than any other so much more than any thing我愛祢勝過⼀切供應勝過這世上所有I want You more than gold or silver only You can satisfy我需要祢勝過⾦銀唯有祢能滿⾜我You a lone are the real joy giver and the apple of my eyes唯有祢能賞賜真正喜樂是我⽣命的泉源
