Dove's Eyes - 鴿⼦的眼Misty Edwards  I don't wanna talk about You like You're not in the room我不願意談論著祢如祢不在這裡I wanna look right at You I wanna sing right to You我只想注視著祢單單來向祢歌唱I believe You are listening我相信祢正在耹聽I believe that You move at the sound of my voice我相信祢⼼因我聲⾳⽽觸動Give me dove's eyes賜我鴿⼦的眼Give me undistracted devotion for only You只能注視著祢往前看無法分⼼
