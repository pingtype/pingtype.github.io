Lion Of Judah - 猶⼤獅⼦Jason Upton No one knows the hour, no one knows the day Jesus is coming soon無⼈知道何時？也不知曉何⽇？耶穌即將要再來All creation trembles, longing for the day Jesus is coming soon萬物恐懼戰驚等候那⼀⽇耶穌即將要再來There will be judgment There will be mercy On that terrible day將要有審判也會有憐憫在那可畏之⽇Leaders will bow down Kingdoms will fall down君王將俯伏列國要羞愧Have you felt your world begin to shake?這世界已開始被震動Hear the sound of the lion of Judah聽那猶⼤獅⼦的怒吼See the fire and the fear in the enemy's camp⾒那仇敵的陣營正著火畏懼From the sound of the lion of Judah roaring again當那猶⼤獅⼦的怒吼再次響起There's a new generation arising A nameless, faceless, placeless tribe⼀個新世代正被興起無名、無份、無位的⽀派All they fear is the fear of the Lord All they hear is the Lion of Judah在⼼中有對神的敬畏耳中聽⾒猶⼤的獅吼All I saw were bones breaking in the darkness Then I walked into the light我⾒遍地枯骨破碎在⿊暗中求帶我走進光中There I saw an army coming from the river With five stones (they're) ready to fight我⼜⾒那軍隊從⽣命河中出來握五⽯正預備爭戰Raise up an army, raise up an army Raise up an army like Joel saw興起祢的⼤軍興起祢的⼤軍如約珥所⾒的⼤軍
