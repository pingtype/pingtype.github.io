主的喜樂是我⼒量讚美之泉主的喜樂是我⼒量You are my joy, You are my strength 祢的救恩是我盼望My hope in in salvation's song雖然橄欖樹不效⼒也許葡萄樹不結果I will cling to You when I'm lost I will trust in You in the dark我仍因救我的神歡欣快樂I will sing and dance, rejoice in You, my God我要讚美無論得時或不得時I will praise Your name in times of sorrow or in joy我要讚美每天從⽇出到⽇落I will praise Your name with the rising and the setting sun我⼼堅定於祢每天讚美不停I worship You, my God My praise will never cease我要讚美跳舞讚美I dance and sing to You, my King我要讚美⾃由讚美I dance and sing and freely praise⼤聲歡呼祢是永遠得勝君王I shout to You You are my God, my glorious King
