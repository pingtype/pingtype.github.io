It Is Well - 我⼼靈得安寧Horstio G. DpaffordWhen peace, like a river, attendeth my way有時享平安如江河平⼜穩When sorrows like sea billows roll有時憂傷來似浪滾Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say不論何環境主⼰教導我說It is well, it is well with my soul我⼼靈得安寧得安寧It is well (It is well)我⼼靈with my soul (with my soul)得安寧It is well, it is well with my soul我⼼靈得安寧得安寧Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come撒但雖來侵眾試煉雖來臨Let this blest assurance control但有主美証在我⼼That Christ has regarded my helpless estate基督已看清我乏助之困境And hath shed His own blood for my soul⽢流⾎救贖我賜安寧My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought回想我眾罪全釘在⼗架上My sin, not in part but the whole每念此衷⼼極歡暢Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more主擔我重擔何奇妙⼤恩情Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul讚美主我⼼靈得安寧And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight求主快再來使信⼼得親⾒The clouds be rolled back as a scroll雲彩將捲起在主前The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend號筒聲吹嚮主再臨掌權柄Even so, it is well with my soul願主來我⼼靈必安寧
