Still - 安靜Reuben MorganHide me now under Your wings 藏我在翅膀蔭下Cover me with in Your mighty hand遮蓋我在祢⼤能⼿中When the oceans rise and thunders roar當⼤海翻騰波濤洶湧I will soar with You above the storm我與祢展翅暴風上空Father, You are King over the flood ⽗祢仍做王在洪⽔中I will be still and know You are God我要安靜知祢是神Find rest my soul in Christ alone我靈安靜在基督裡Know His power in quietness and trust祢⼤能使我安然信靠
