No Higher Calling - 沒有更⾼的呼召Jonathan ButlerDown at Your feet, oh Lord is the most high place俯伏祢腳前是我⾄⾼之處主In Your presence, Lord I seek Your face, seek Your face在祢同在中我尋求祢尋求祢There is no higher calling, no greater honor沒有更⾼的呼召更⼤的尊榮Then to bow and kneel before Your throne能與俯伏祢腳前相比I'm amazed at Your glory, embraced by Your mercy我讚嘆祢的榮耀環抱在祢憐憫Oh Lord, I live to worship You我活著為要來敬拜祢
