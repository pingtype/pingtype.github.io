When I Look Into Your Holiness - 每當我瞻仰祢⾄聖榮⾯Wayne PerrinWhen I look into Your holiness每當我瞻仰祢⾄聖榮⾯When I gaze into Your loveliness每當我在愛中仰望祢When all things that surround become shadows in the light of You 
在祢榮耀光中所有⼀切都失去光彩When I found the joy of reaching Your heart何等喜樂當我進入祢⼼意When my will becomes enthralled in Your Love我全⼼成為祢愛的寶座When all things that surround become shadows in the light of You在祢榮耀光中所有⼀切都失去光彩I worship You, I worship You 我敬拜祢我敬拜祢The reason I live is to worship You我⼀⽣活著為要敬拜祢
