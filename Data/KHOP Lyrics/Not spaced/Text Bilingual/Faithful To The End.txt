Faithful To The EndCory AsburyThe promise of Your coming light 祢應許亮光會到來It burns so brightly in my mind 明亮的燃燒在腦海All creation longs and waits 萬物都渴望等待For the dawning of that day那天來臨的期待And He will come riding on the clouds祂將要駕著⽩雲來With Justice in His he art and a sword upon His side祂腰上束著劍祂要施⾏公義And all will see the glory of this Man全地將看⾒祂榮耀With fire in His eyes He's jealous for His bride眼⽬中的火焰對新婦的渴望He's faithful to the end He's faithful to my he art祂信實到最後對我的⼼承諾He's faithful to the end He will come and marry me祂信實到最後祂必要回來娶我Glory to the righteous One 榮耀歸於公義主
