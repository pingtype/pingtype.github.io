O For a thousand tongues to sing
My dear Redeemer's praise!
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the world abroad
The honors of Thy name.

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
Praise to our God

To God all glory, praise, and love
be now and ever given
by saints below and saints above,
the Church in earth and heaven.

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
Praise to our God
