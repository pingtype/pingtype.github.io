Instead you smear *soil* all over the important bits ("income" / "marital status") to cover them, and then pretend you dropped it. Amazingly the plan works - but you know the *dirty truth*.\<br></br>The job of a reporter is to# FILL IN# the world on what is happening. Often the reporter will stand on the DIRT where an event is happening and fill the world in on the TRUTH of the situation.\<br></br>One has to #fill in# all the #dirty# #truth# in one's life.\<br></br>The dirty truth about china - many university students pass tests by filling in their answers by cheating!

The fact is that neither you know wheather you filled the key questions correctly as well as the instituition can never be sure if you give them the real *truth*. But as long as the institution works and you gets what you ask for the *truth* doesn't matter. And this is the *soil* out of which grows modern society.

寸	Wow, my penis is exactly *ten* #Chinese inches#. Bigger if I put a *drop* of *glue* on it and stick stuff to the end..\<br></br>#Chinese inch# is one *tenth* of chinese foot. Although all these traditional measurments are *little bit* odd (and that's why the vertical line is *hooked*), the people still do *stick* to them. Maybe because this is one of the unseen ways in which the society is *glued* together.\<br></br>Wow!

堯	Emperor# Yao# ruled *many many lands*, but he only had *one pair of human legs* to walk them.\<br></br>This primitive will mean a *strawman* (scarecrow), to keep it consistent with the kanji site.

墨	There's a huge patch of *black on the ground / soil*. Looks like someone's spilt# black ink# everywhere..\<br></br>While remembering the character for# black ink#, you need to get rid of the idea that ink have something to do with water - because in China it is probably made out of something that is extracted from the *soil* - maybe from *black* petroleum that spring up from the *soil*?\<br></br>Use# BLACK INK# (in SLASHES on your COMPUTER) to depict SOIL in artwork.

At# nighttime# I sit alone in my *house* at my desk with a lit *candle*, pulling an all-nighter, studying all these damn characters..\<br></br>A man uses CANDLES under his ROOF as he works into# NIGHTTIME#.\<br></br>A HOUSE over a TELEVISION that the residents are watching in the# NIGHTTIME#.
安	As with other chinese characters, even this one shows a traditional meaning of what# peaceful# life is: it is a family life symbolised by a *woman* in a *house*, relaxing there and taking care of it.\<br></br>After a hard weeks work, *women* who want some #peace# and quiet prefer to just relax inside their *house*. Theres no where more# peaceful# than *home* for them! Men of course prefer to go to the pub.
宴	The *woman* spent the entire *day* in her *house* preparing the family# banquet#.\<br></br>A whole *day* of making a #banquet# stands between a *woman* having *peaceful* time alone in her *house*.\<br></br>Under a ROOF, you can see a WINDOW OF SUNSHINE over a WOMAN who's cooking a# BANQUET#.\<br></br>Under the *roof*, all *day* long, the *woman* prepares for the# banquet# for her husband and his pub mates. She has no time to be *peaceful* this weekend..(thanks to PeterJD).
寄	There is a *strange* *house* where all the #mail# just piles up and no one ever takes it.\<br></br>To# mail# your letters or #send parcels#, you have to take them to this *strange house* and push them all through the door. It's pretty spooky, like a huge haunted house - wonder why this town doesn't just have a post office..\<br></br>When the# mail# gets delivered to your HOME, CAN the# mail#man escape the BIG ST. BERNARD? Or will it bite him? Hmmm? Is he ABLE TO?\<br></br>Simplified 邮 (郵)# Mail# these days is *strange*. It just fills up my *house* with *strange* junk. Also means send or transmit; rely on.\<br></br>All kinds of strange things get# mail#ed to my house-- junk# mail#, chain letters, pictures of my neighbors...\<br></br>#MAIL# never goes to the STRANGE HOUSE on the hill.\<br></br>How can the *strange* things enter the *house*? By a# mail#! In older days, imagine for example Victorian England, before radio and screens appeared, most of the *strange* came via# mail#: newspapers and letters from your friends in distant lands.
富	#Wealthy# is the *house* where *one mouth* eats all from the *rice field*. primitive may lose the house.\<br></br>Remember Ducktales? The insanely# wealthy# Scrooge McDuck had a room in his *house* where he kept all of his *wealth* ! He had so much in that *house* he could even swim in it - but he never took any out (thanks to sutebun).\<br></br>A# WEALTHY# ONE fills his MOUTH from his RICE FIELD.
貯	It's the Zombie Apocalypse! My plan is to stockpile (#store up#) a load of *shellfish* inside my *house* for food, and then *nail* it all shut from the inside.\<br></br>I'm gonna #store up# all these *clams* in front of the left side my house and *nail* them down so no one steals them (they are bound by invisible threads - that explains why the *clams* are out while *nails* in the *house*).\<br></br>I'm gonna #store up# all these *clams* in my house and *nail* them down so no one steals them.\<br></br>#STORE UP# your SHELLFISH beside your ROOF, using a NAIL/SPIKE to fasten them securely down.\<br></br>(Heisig), except note that *shells* is on the left and that *house* covers only the spike.\<br></br>You# STORE UP# MONEY to buy a HOUSE on the STREET.
木	This looks like a# TREE#.\<br></br>Pictograph of a# tree#. Write it out a few times, you won't forget it.
林	Think of that phrase "can't see the #woods# through the trees". Imagine trying to peek through the gap between *two trees* to find those illusive# woods#.\<br></br>A TREE by another TREE is what you'll find in the# WOODS#.
森	#Forest# is bigger than a small *woods* - it's almost like there are *trees* everywhere.\<br></br>TREE upon TREE after TREE — a# FOREST#!
植	A *tree* is a #plant# that grows *straight* up.\<br></br>If you get a new *tree* it is of course best to go# plant# it in the soil *straight*-away and make sure it's pointing *straight* upwards. Without following these instructions, the roots won't have enough time to be healthy and strong like the *tree* needs; it might die..(thanks to sutebun).\<br></br>With modern mechanized farming techniques, a farmer #plants# row after row of *trees* in *straight* lines.\<br></br>A TREE grows STRAIGHT and is a# PLANT#, tight?\<br></br>A# plant# is a *tree* and other things that grow *straight*. Imagine teaching biology 101 to kindergarteners.
杏	The reason why the *mouth* is on the bottom of the hanzi for# apricot# is because the person who invented this hanzi was camping when he made it. He was laying in his *cot* one night underneath an# apricot# *tree* when one fell off of the tree into his *mouth*. He then discovered how delicious the fruit was and realized it deserved its own hanzi. (thanks to igordesu).\<br></br>The best way to eat an# apricot# to let it fall right off the *tree* into your *mouth*.\<br></br>What the TREE dropped into my MOUTH was an# APRICOT#. Yum!
呆	A# dim-witted# guy heard the story of <a href="/study/kanji/195">apricot</a> <span class="index">(#195)</span>, and decided to climb to the *top* of a *tree*, face the sky with his *mouth agape* and wait for an apricot to fall into his *open mouth* from there. He's so# dim-witted#, he's got it completely the wrong way round! He even broke the tree branches off climbing up (in Taiwanese kai font, the branches are detached).\<br></br>This# dim-witted# *mouth* climbed to the top of a *tree* and is waiting for the fruits to fall into it. But we know what will fall into it...\<br></br>A# DIM-WITTED# person would think there's a MOUTH on a TREE.\<br></br>A# DIM-WITTED# man on the MTV Show "Jackass" screams as he jumps off of a tree, hurting himself.\<br></br>This #dim-witted# kid climbed up a TREE and now he can't go back and cries on the top of his voice (MOUTH).
枯	A *tree* that is *ancient* goes all leafless and# withered#.\<br></br>A TREE that is ANCIENT is# WITHERED#.
村	In olden times, houses were strictly made out of wood. They took these *trees* and *glued* them together to make# village#s.\<br></br>The# village# is bordered by *tree*s *glue*d together.\<br></br>Make this TREE sticky with GLUE to build csbins for your# VILLAGE#.\<br></br>#Village# in this hanzi means that it is *glued* to a *tree* - that# village#rs are still close to the nature. Maybe some chinese citizens even think that# village#rs are so backward that they still live on trees ...\<br></br>I saw this documentary about a tribal# village#, where a tribe all lived in mud-huts and wore loincloths. To eat, they used to boil up sticky *tree* sap, and then cover all the surrounding *trees* in this natural *glue*, to catch birds and monkeys.
相	This hanzi is often used to say a couple get along or love# one another#. Story: Me and my girlfriend love# one another# so much, I carved our names into a *tree* with a big heart around it! When my gf saw, her *eyes* buldged out and she said "*Eye* love you too..".\<br></br>Behind that *tree*, I see with my *eye*, 2 people are doing horrible things to #one another#!!!\<br></br>Look through a TREE (with your EYE) to see# ONE ANOTHER#.\<br></br>Here’s a cruel and inhuman game in which people throw entire *trees* at# one another#, trying to strike# one another# in the *eye*.
本	#Notebook#s are made of paper, paper made of wood. So# notebook# is *one* slice of *tree*. And since you need to cut the tree down, also the *one* line goes through the trunk.\<br></br>A tree (木) with lines (一) on it.\<br></br>A TREE can make ONE huge# NOTEBOOK#.\<br></br>ONE TREE is able to make a large# NOTEBOOK#.\<br></br>Pictograph of what happened when someone used a *tree* pencil to write in a #notebook# and ended up piercing it.
案	My favorite detective story "The# Case# of the Missing Woman" She vanished from inside her house. They ended up finding her up in the tree outside her house.\<br></br>Since# case# is a bit hard to remember, think of this as a frivolous court# case#. Your peaceful life was destroyed when your tree suddenly fell into your house and ruined the property. It was an act of God, so your insurance won't handle it... so you decide to sue God. What a ridiculous# case#!\<br></br>A judge judy type presides over the odd court# case# in her home. to elevate herself above everyone else, she sits on top of a huge tree growing in the lounge. whenever she bangs her gavel, another branch falls off.\<br></br>Imagine that something unexpectedly disturbs your *peaceful* life at home - its like when a *tree* falls down into the house. That becomes really a# case#! Even your neighbours talks about it for months!\<br></br>Our woman from <a href="/study/kanji/186">peaceful</a> <span class="index">(#186)</span> is trying to enjoy a *peaceful* weekend at home, but this time she has to go to court, as she's opened a #legal# case## against a neighbour who *broke her tree* (tree with branches coming off).\<br></br>A ROOF over a PEACEful WOMAN on top of a TREE would really be a# CASE# of things out of place.\<br></br>Famous (legal)# CASE# , *Ann*(tone 4) vs Timber*R*Us-TreeSurgeons , of a WOMAN being struck by TREE crashing thru' her ROOF whilst peacefully resting.\<br></br>The WOODEN# CASE# contains certain substances that helps one RELAX.\<br></br>Solving problems thru legal# case#s keeps the peace (安) but kills a lot of trees (木).
未	This *tree* is# not yet# fully grown: it's only *one* year old (thanks to DeadLugosi).\<br></br>This TREE,# NOT YET# GROWN, puts out ONE new branch.
末	The# last# few branches of a *tree* grow really long and thin and tend to droop over the rest of the *tree*. This marks the #end#, it stops growing.\<br></br>When a tree is <a href="/study/kanji/202">not yet</a> <span class="index">(#202)</span> fully grown, it's top branches are still small. When even the top branches grow up, it is at# last# mature.\<br></br>The# LAST#-grown branch on this ONE TREE is longer than the rest.
沫	#Foam# is the *last* bit of *water* that remains from a sudsy bath, or drying up pond or tide water.\<br></br>[JPN: splash] End of water is the# foam#.\<br></br>DROPS OF WATER leave their LAST traces as# FOAM#.\<br></br>The *water* has reached its *last* destination — now it's just splashing everywhere and making a lot of# foam#.\<br></br>If you want the# foam# in your bubble-bath to *last*, make sure the *water* is clean and free of soap scum. Otherwise the# foam# will *last* 2 minutes max, leaving you with nothing but murky *wetness*.
味	The Fresh chef tastes with his *mouth*, and then in a thick French accent says, "*Not Yet*" in disgust - "this food has no #flavour# (thanks to Wahlin).\<br></br>The only time you know the# flavor# of food is when it is in your *mouth*, but *not yet* swallowed.\<br></br>When something's in my MOUTH, do I swallow it? NOT YET — not till I know its# FLAVOR#.\<br></br>The maple syrup that you put into your *mouth* will have the best# flavor# when it’s *not yet* summer.\<br></br>A brilliant #flavor# is usually something your *mouth* has *not yet* tasted.
妹	Is your# younger sister# a *woman*? *Not yet*! uh-oh..Damn! (thanks to Istvan).\<br></br>#Younger sister# is a *woman* that has *not yet* grown enough. She is like a *tree* that still grows!\<br></br>A young lady who is not yet a woman.
查	To# investigate#, you may need to sit in the tree (木) until daybreak (旦) to get a glimpse of the perp.\<br></br>I have a little potted bonzai *tree* on a shelf at home, and tonight I found a note under it that said "You will die at *daybreak*." So, naturally I started to# investigate#..(thanks to Tzadeck).\<br></br>Isaac Newton is lying under a *tree*, fallen asleep while #investigating# the nature of the universe, when suddenly *daybreak* arrives and prompts the *tree* to stretch and welcome the sun, causing an apple to drop and hit Isaac square on the head. (taken from Heisig directly).\<br></br>At #daybreak# the police# investigate# reports of drug abuse ..... they surround a #tree# ....beneath it they discover Sherlock Holmes smoking his opium pipe and sipping his cup of *cha*. "Mr Holmes , what is it that you are smoking ?" --- " A mighty fine *shag*.......\<br></br>Sun below the trees, most investigations for missing persons etc start at dawn or first light.\<br></br>#Investigation# is all about finding clues. Now, dear Dr. Watson, just look under that *tree* where our case of "murder under the tree" started. Is it really *sun* above a *needle*? This is going to bring a *daybreak* even into the case!\<br></br>I find a note from a man saying: meet me under the tree at daybreak for our duel, so naturally I# investigate# who he is.\<br></br>#Investigate# the whole #tree# of possibilities starting at #daybreak#.
渣	If you investigate water you find# sediment# at the bottom.\<br></br>#SEDIMENT# - is washed in WATER and INVESTIGATED by gold panners.\<br></br>The drinking water has some disgusting# sediment# in it... is it safe to drink? Or is it... poison?! Who did this? We must investigate...\<br></br>If you *investigate water* you find# sediment# at the bottom. It probably consist of leafs of that *tree* that is leaning above the *water* that mirrors on its surface the morning *sun*.
染	The #dye# on the #tree# disappears after #nine# times of washing with #water#.\<br></br>This *baseball player* always #dyes# his hair on the top of a *tree*, using nothing but drops of *water*. No wonder his hair color never changes.\<br></br>Imagine a new MLB scandal develops in which it turns out that some players have been using metal *baseball* bats, but by #dye#-ing them in brown *water*, they make them look as though they are wooden bats that came from a *tree*.\<br></br>The# dye# comes from the #Water##nine# #tree#.\<br></br>*Water* fell from cloud *nine* upon the *tree*, energizing it, causing the leaves to turn from brown to green, as if the water had *dyed* it.\<br></br>The baseball player# dye#s his hair with *water* and colours extracted from a *tree*.\<br></br>Tye# dye# t-shirts. NINE different WATER color paints. And what else do hippies with tye# dye# do? Hug TREES and smoke WEED, of course! {I use the TREE primitive to mean any kind of vivid flora}.\<br></br>Imagine a# dye# that looks like simple *water*, but when applied to *wood* turns *nine* different colors. The *water* can be *nine* different colors depending on what type of *wood* you spray it on.\<br></br>You need to splash the *wet*# dye# on *nine* times to stain the *broken dead wood* below.
李	This time, a *child* is sitting under a *tree*, waiting for the apricots to fall into its mouth - however, as the child is still very little, it can't see all the way up and doesn't realize that it is sitting under a# plum# tree instead - and the# plum#s aren't even ripe at this time of year...\<br></br>Like the apricot, the# plum#s fall into the hand of a child from the tree,# plum#s are a synonym for children, think about the William Carlos Williams poem.\<br></br>When explaining the birds and bees, Dad tells his kid "Son, every man has 2 #plums#". *Child* misunderstands and is seen here waiting under the nearby# plum# *tree*, trying to catch a# plum# or two and become a grown-up.\<br></br>When I was a *child* we used to collect the# plum#s that fell from *trees* and throw them at each other!\<br></br>"...while visions of sugar# plum#s danced in their heads." The head of the CHILD on the night before Christmas. But this precocious little CHILD, having thought about the existence of Santa earlier that day, also thought about the TREE the sugar# plum#s came from.
桌	Group of *magicans* make a# table# out of a *dead tree* stump, and carve a *sun* into the top. When all seated, the carving starts to glow like the real *sun*.\<br></br>He made the# table# from a *tree* in one *day* using only *magic* (he didn't use any tools).\<br></br>To make a# table# is a *magic* that takes exactly a *day* and you need for that only a *tree*.\<br></br>The MAGICIAN takes ONE DAY to turn a TREE into a# TABLE#.\<br></br>The eminent magician is not on a sunflower anymore, two poles have been added making it a# table#.\<br></br>Ikea# table#: In the box is a a magic wand. It can only be assembled in the *day*. Wave wand while sitting in a tree and voila!\<br></br>A# table# so wonderful, so EMINENT, that it belongs in the Chinese character for# table#? That could only King Arthur and the Knights of the Round# Table#. EMINENT indeed, and humbly made from TREES. If you look closely, you can even see the swords of King Author's knights.\<br></br>Because he memorized the Periodic# Table#, his parents got him the number *one* *radio* in the world and put it under his *Christmas tree*. (The *one* is inserted into the *mouth* of *radio* -- *radio* is my personal primitive for ‘tell fortunes’.).\<br></br>The *eminent* Son is soon to be nailed to the wooden (tree)# table#.
若	Ugly male approaches a hot female with big bunch of *flowers* in his *right* hand. He thinks it's the *right* way to pick up a woman! As soon as she sees him she says "#as if# you have a chance with me, buddy. #AS IF#!".\<br></br>#As if# giving a flower will make it right!\<br></br>#As if# *flowers* with make it all *right*.\<br></br>It #seems# as if## the *flower* is just *right* - sez the fly *right* before the *venus flytrap* closes...
草	Water your# grass# (艹) early (早) for best results.\<br></br>My gardener is here to mow the# grass#, but he's arrived *early* as he wants to also trim the *flowers* (most importantly the tall *sunflowers*).\<br></br>#grass# is the plant (*flower* 艹) that comes up *earliest* (早) in spring.\<br></br>I'm too poor so when I went to give a gift to the Son, I gave him a crown of# grass#.
苦	You bring *flowers* for your *ancient* grandparents, who are# suffering# in hospital.\<br></br>*Flowers* on an *ancient* tomb reminds us of a# suffering# of some *ancient* hero who died there. But today, you can see there only romantic poets,# suffering# of being alone.\<br></br>The *ancient* King Tut takes a bath in *flowers* to soothe his# suffering# body.
寬	This hanzi often used to mean "spacious / roomy". Story: When taking photos inside your *house*, an estate agent will often use a# wide#-angle lens to make it look more #spacious#. You also fill your *house* with *flowers*, so prospective buyers won't *see* all the *drops* of blood and food stained into your floor..\<br></br>Cuando *ves* el jardín de una *casa* lleno de *flores* se te #ensancha# (#ancho#) el corazón y te cae una *lágrima* de los ojos. #kuān#.\<br></br>The sky *roofing* (宀) the *flower* (艹) covered land as far as the eye can *see* (見).

葉	Let *generation* + *broken tree* = *Tarzan*, whose family has lived at the top of a tree for generations. Story: *Tarzan* stands naked in a *flower* shop, trying on various# leaf#-s to cover his modesty..(thanks to Katsuo).\<br></br>Over *generations* the *tree*# leaf# evolved into *flowers*.\<br></br>It all began with a# leaf# , a particular# leaf# from a single species of mulberry #tree# together with #generations# of silk farmers ......add the #flower# of the opium poppy - and finally Marco Polo and the rest is ...cont'd <a href="/study/kanji/1625">espionage</a> <span class="index">(#1625)</span>.\<br></br>*Tree* must *generate*# leaf#s in order to produce anything else, even *flowers* (blossoms), which later becomes seeds.

莫	For primitive *graveyard* - Imagine carrying *flowers* to put on the grave of *sunny*, your *big st. bernard dog*. He really was the *sunshine* of your life. For# nobody# - you visit the *graveyard* to see your dead dog, but it's spooky as there's# nobody# around. then when you get to the grave, you get a shock - there's a huge hole in the ground and #no body#..\<br></br>A *graveyard* full of *flowers* where the *sun* shines fully but #nobody# is allowed to enter — a *St. Bernard dog* in the entrance prevents it.\<br></br>"My name is# nobody#" - Terence Hill & Henry Fonda in *graveyard* @ 30'.\<br></br>For remembering the primitive for *graveyard* you need to put together *flower*, *day* and *large* (which is actually a strange *st. Bernard dog*). *Graveyards* are *large* places with *flowers*, where# nobody# really comes often (just people with dogs). Some of them are so *large* that it takes you a whole *day* to go through them!\<br></br>#NOBODY# comes back from the haunted graveyard filled with skeletons and monsters.\<br></br>#Nobody# can avoid graveyard.\<br></br>#Nobody# goes to a *graveyard* without any soil...
模	Nobody wants to# imitate# a tree in the school play...\<br></br>For some reason this makes me think of the movie Beetlejuice, where they're shrunk and all the little *trees* in the model *graveyard* are made of plastic, to accurately# imitate# the real *graveyard* in town. Meanwhile Beetlejuice #imitates# a cowboy, a monster and then one of the Maitlands voices.\<br></br>To# imitate# a *tree* you really need to act completely still and motionless, like the (dead!) people at the *graveyard*.\<br></br>A clumsy *tree* tried to #imitate# a flower in order to enter the *graveyard* but the St. Bernard dog protecting the entrance wasn't fooled.\<br></br>In the future, they'll be able to do nothing but# imitate# old *graveyards* (think a post-apocalyptic future. Even the *trees* are *imitation* *trees*!
漠	Graveyard of water is the# desert#.\<br></br>#Desert# - nobody, no water.\<br></br>Without #water# or #wetness#, the# desert# is just one huge *graveyard*.\<br></br>*Nobody* comes out of the #desert# alive without *water*. See <a href="/study/kanji/217">nobody</a> <span class="index">(#217)</span>.\<br></br>In the# desert# with no water, come across water in vases in a grave yard and drink from the vases.\<br></br>There was this boy, eager for *water*, dragging himself across the Sahara #desert#, but there was none for him to quench his thirst — so that place ended up being his *graveyard*.
墓	You make a# grave# in the *soil* in the *graveyard*.\<br></br>Heisig's story is fine -- just note that the two diagonal lines of *big* separate themselves to make room for *soil*. This sort of shift will happen a lot in characters to come.\<br></br>This word is a basic element to make many others-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------From the bottom up, SOIL, it it where a married couple are barried----------------------------------------------------------------A TREE is growing on top, very romantic----------------------The SUN is above the tree, keeping it beautiful and light---- And two FLOWERS are looking down from above the sun, these are their souls... they are observing the# GRAVE#YARD with approval.
苗	Crap! There are *flowers* in the *rice field*... Who let those #seedlings# get in there?! (thanks to sammyB).\<br></br>*Flowers* in the *rice field* - these are actually the rice #seedlings#!
瞄	This more accurately means "Take# aim# at" (verb). Story: In the American Army, solders have to #aim at# and shoot tiny *tomato seedlings* to prove they have good *eyesight*. To #take# aim##, they concentrate hard with one *eye* looking down the gun-sight, then fire at the *seedlings*, repeating 5 times.\<br></br>Are your *eyes* good enough to #aim at# and hit a single *seedling*?\<br></br>*Miao,Miao ....

On the left we have the *eye* peering through it to take# aim#!
兆	The actual derivation of this Kanji is a pictograph of the cracks on a heated *turtle* shell which was used in divination. The way the cracks occur on this turtle are a# portent# (omen) of evil bad luck. This fortune-telling *turtle* is extra strange, as it has *hairy human legs*. (thanks to jabberwockychortles).\<br></br>I dislike Heisig's "turtle shell" image. I prefer "human-legs" and "bow-tie": "If your *bow-tie* keeps slipping down around your *legs*, it is a# PORTENT# that you need to gain some weight ... fast".\<br></br>English definition- similar to an Omen---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A turtle's head has such patterns, like reading palms, these may tell your future, if read by a fortune teller.\<br></br>#Portents# usually predict unhappy things, but this character is a happy# portent#. If you see *snowflakes* beginning to cover up your *human legs* in the evening, that's a happy# portent# that school (at least where I'm from) may be cancelled tomorrow!
桃	Princess# Peach# is using a *tree* to escape those weird things with *turtle shells* (thanks to WeTsTICK).\<br></br>#Peach#es are called "tree omens" (木) (兆)　bc the wrinkles on their pits can foretell the future.\<br></br>Up a *tree* throwing# peach#es at those ferocious creatures with *turtle shells* Splat!

犬	A #POOCH/SMALL DOG# is like a *drop* compared to the *large St Bernard*.\<br></br>"Get that little# pooch# (a chihuahua) away from my *big st bernard* - he keeps yapping and scaring him". The little chihuahua appears to be a little *drop* compared to the *bigger* dog. (In our stories, this is just going to be *dog* from now on, as it comes up often).
尤	#Remarkable# - this *dog* has one *human leg*.
默	Black dog of depression silenced Churchill.\<br></br>Silence -> sounds of silence -> hello *darkness* my old *friend*.\<br></br>Wish the little *black* *pooch* would be# silent# for a change.\<br></br>The crowd was# silent# in awe when the *black* *pooch* sang.\<br></br>I imagine (cherish) the sound of silence as the *black* darkness where not even a *dog* is heard barking.\<br></br>Dogs are confused by computers, my dog will bark at everything passing down the street but when she hears the whirring of a computer she whimpers and goes# silent#.\<br></br>If my girlfriend must get a *chihuahua*, then it should be *black* and, above all else, it must be #SILENT#!\<br></br>*Black dogs* are often kept as pets as they're totally #silent# - they never bark! And even when they do, no sound comes out of their mouths...
然	The *flesh* of a *dog* roasting over a *cooking* fire is the# sort of thing# you'll be expected to eat if you go to Korea, and some parts of mainland China. Imagine protesting about eating *dog*, but in a polite way "Sorry, i don't eat that #sort of thing#".\<br></br>Just a note on the top left primitive: I call this *slow-cooked flesh*. It’s meat cooked for *two evenings* (see how the primitive is essentially ‘evening’ with two lines in the middle, rather than just one?
哭	2 mouths = new primitive *spoilt kid* (who can also be a *chatterbox*). One of those children who's parents just give them everything they want - I'm sure you all know the type. Story: A *spoilt kid* is having a# cry# *over* his dead *dog*. Of course their parents have already bought them a new one, but they're acting spoilt over it "i dont want this one, go away it's not FAIR, I want fluffy back".\<br></br>Nothing makes me# cry# more than a *chatterbox* *chihuahua*.

器	Four hungry *mouths* sit at the four corners of the table, banging their# utensil#s (knifes and forks) together, ready to devour the spread eagled *chihuahua dog* stretched out on the table!\<br></br>Four dribbling *mouths* eager to eat the baked *Chihuahua*, just waiting for the #utensils#.
臭	Imagine trying to work out what's causing the# stinking# bad smell in the room, using your *nose*. Eventually you bury your *nose* into your *dogs*# stinking# wet fur, Eww so smelly..\<br></br>Using your *nose* to smell around and discover that #stinking#smell is your *chihuahua* shit awww.\<br></br>What is# stinking#? Press *yourself* (your whole face) on top of a big *dog* and you will know what# stinking# means.\<br></br>A nose pressed up against a dog naturally is# stinking#.\<br></br>Image *yourself* as a *dog* - perhaps a *St. Bernard*. You are running around, rolling in dirt, chasing animals, and# stinking# like the animal you are.
狗	You're walking your *dog* in the woods, when a *pack of wild# dog#s* approaches. You shout "STOP, GO AWAY" but before you even reach the end of the *sentence* they pounce and attack your *dog*!\<br></br>My# dog# and I exchange a lot of phrases, he barks, I shout "enough!".\<br></br>Movie Wag the# Dog# - press hounds (=*dogs*) are fed *sentences* of misinformation.
厭	Out by the *cliff* lives a *pooch* who# detest#s everything. The *sun* the *moon*, everything!\<br></br>Whilst walking your *dog* near the bottom of a *cliff*, you come across a huge pile of *flesh* from animals that have fallen over the edge and died. The *flesh* has been in the *sun* too long, so its all rotten and smelly - your *dog* #detest#-s as they hate bad meat! They can smell it a mile off!\<br></br>What I# detest# the most is a *dog* high up on a *cliff* howling *day and evening*.\<br></br>Simplified 厌 : (Like the pigs that have been thrown into the Shanghai river lately) I# detest# the people who throw poorly dogs off a cliff with no regard.\<br></br>Out by the shadow of the *cliff* lives a *pooch* who# detest#s the *sun* and the *moon*!\<br></br>This *pooch*, in a manner very similar to gollum, hides under the *cliff*,# detest#ing any light from the *sun* or the *moon*.\<br></br>Myths are all about duality. There are two mythical dogs-- one of the sun, one of the moon-- and they# detest# each other, standing off at a cliff at the end of the world, always fighting. Sometimes the sun dog wins, and we get daylight; other times the moon dog wins and we get night..\<br></br>Under the *cliff* lives a big *chihuahua* who# detest#s ( = nenávidět, hnusit si) light. The *sun*, the *moon* ... that's why he never leaves its lair.\<br></br>Outside of ancient Israel, there was a trash heap called "Gehenna," where garbage was thrown and burned. The FLESH of those that were# DETEST#ED was thrown off the CLIFF into Gehenna where the DOGS would consume and the SUN would scorch their# DETEST#ABLE flesh.
壓	Simplified to 圧 or 压.# Pressure# *detests* *soil* because solids dont transmit# pressure# like gasses or liquids.\<br></br>Based on astridtops' RtK story for "despondent": the *chihuahua* who had fallen down a *cliff* during a landslide was totally *despondent* about his position. He saw the *sun* and the *moon* pass by, but expected no rescue any more. He lost all hope when the# pressure# of the *soil* that fell on him started crushing him.\<br></br>Continuing from <a href="/study/kanji/232">dog</a> <span class="index">(#232)</span> - there's suddenly a landslide, and the# pressure# of all the *soil* means we can't move. We're then forced to eat the flesh we *detest* so much..\<br></br>I *detest* *soil*. So much so that I try to put as much# pressure# on it as possible - trying to kill it.\<br></br>#Pressure# = force/area ~ repulsive stuff/some terrain ~ *detest* / *soil*.\<br></br>The weight of our *detester* (the small *dog*) combined with the weight of the *sun* and the *moon* has put immense# pressure# on the ground, causing a massive rift. This rift is now called the Grand Canyon.\<br></br>Continuing on a story from *detest*: in our big *chihuahua*'s lair under the cliff, there suddenly the soil starts to go up! Our *chihuahua* is really under# pressure#: to remain in the lair or face the *sun* and *moon* that it *detests*? What a dilemma! ... so he just starts to hum the famous Queen's: "Mm ba ba de ...".\<br></br>The weight of all of the discarded flesh in Gehenna has put# PRESSURE# on the GROUND, causing it to become very fruitful soil (It is down to this day).\<br></br>Press the soil in a dig hole.

But it can't, because it doesn't have *human legs*, meaning it can't actually kneel..\<br></br>#Before# the *beginning* 元, there was a *cow*!\<br></br>If 元 is the beginning, then we put a *stroke or two* #before# the *beginning* to show that is comes #prior#, #early#.

"hello hi ni hao" he says to everyone as he walks grinning around Beijing, amazed at this# world# that has opened up before him..\<br></br>Our# world# consists of nothing more than all the things we can *introduce* to our *brains*.\<br></br>The# world# is invited to a #field# in Glastonbury that each year #introduces# a new generation of music lovers to the# world# of mud and blocked portaloos....and rock bands of yesteryear..
茶	In Taiwan they make# tea# more sexy by decorating the cup with little *flowers* and with a cocktail *umbrella*, attached to a *wooden* stick, and then selling it in bars. I'm talking of course about the phenomenon that is Bubble# Tea# - google it if you need a better image.\<br></br>#Tea# is a *flower* but you drink it under a *pointed roof* - in a# tea# house.

At this point Nelson walks up and says# ha!## ha!#\<br></br>Hahahaha....you think you can *mouth* off at that *fit* guy? hahaha.\<br></br>When the joke is good, you can *say* it *fits*, that the others got it. And when the chinese laugh they really say# ha!## ha!# It is so funny to hear it :-).
塔	In ancient China# pagoda# were made from mashed up *soil* and *flowers*, packed together into bricks. But these dirty structures don't really *fit* with modern China, so now they're made of concrete.\<br></br>A# pagoda# is first made from *soil* and then *flowers* carefully *fit* together.\<br></br>Someone has covered the roof of this# pagoda# with *soil* and grew *flowers* on it that *fit* the# pagoda# really well.\<br></br>*Flowers* *fit* well in a# pagoda# (made of *dirt* here).

A *pack of wild dogs* turning into a *king* who then starts singing, "We are a little, just a little,# crazy#" by Seal!\<br></br>When a *pack of wild dogs* goes batshit-#crazy#, you know there must be a squeaky *ball* in the play... ("a pack of wild dogs" in my head always just stands for a group of dogs).\<br></br>The *King* of France, overburdened with stress, goes absolutely# crazy# and runs off to live with the *wild dogs*.\<br></br>This playboy king is now whooping it up like a wild dog. Imagine a serious king who is a secret playboy and goes# crazy# in secret, like Prince Harry.\<br></br>*King* Robert Baratheon hunted with a* pack of wild dogs*. He is pretty# crazy#.
皇	Ancient Rome had #Emperors# instead of *Kings*, and they wore *white* robes. Thus an# emperor# is a *white king*. (make sure you picture a roman# emperor# not a japanese one and you'll be ok). (thanks to mameha1977).\<br></br>There are many *kings* in this land, but only the *king* on whom the *white* bird sits may proclaim himself# emperor#.\<br></br>#Emperor# is a *white king*. I don't know why but at the same time came into my mind an# emperor# Palpatine from Star Wars and Saruman the *White* from LoTR ... What a strange character ... I shouldn't have watched those movies that much ...
煌	*roman emperors* used to light huge# resplendent# (bright, brilliant) *fires* at the start of the Roman games, by setting *fire* to a bunch of slaves. Just imagine them watching from the balcony of the Coliseum and saying "#resplendent#..." in the same voice as Mr Burns from The Simpsons.\<br></br>#Resplendent#, all these colours, all these shades of ... red - muhaha, *arson* is my middle name sez *emperor* Nero.\<br></br>*Fire emperor* is# resplendent# (bright, brilliant, splendour), he not only glares, but imagining emperor Palpatine from Star Wars, he is really able to put you on *fire* that is coming out of his hands ... it is not glorious at all ... and that reminds you that all the# resplendent# of emperors is only superficial - something for the masses.\<br></br>#Resplendent# like the FIREY images of Christ, the KING OF KINGS {and what is an EMPERER but a KING OF KINGS?}, with all of His glory radiating from Him, alive with the# resplendent# light of the Holy Spirit.\<br></br>El *emperador* Nerón siempre quiso que Roma fuera la ciudad más #resplandeciente#.

全	The fat *king* hogs the# whole# space under his *umbrella*. (thanks to dwhitman).\<br></br>that is, giving orders to one's own life.\<br></br>Our king hates direct sunlight and rain very much and therefore wants the# whole# space around him to always be under an *umbrella*. Imagine putting the# whole# *king*dom under one *umbrella* because of this!\<br></br>"He's got the# whole# world in His hands..." goes the song referring to the creator/KING. But this KING in our hanzi, this earthly sinner KING is far too short sighted. Our KING here only has what's under his own earthly dominion/UMBRELLA. The Creator has everything outside the UMBRELLA, too.

主	A# lord# is a little drop down from King in hierarchy (thanks to sethimayne).\<br></br>A# lord# is similar to a *king* in that he rules over something, but he is still just a drop compared to the *king*.\<br></br>Due to my charm and great skill in battle, *King* Robb Stark has promoted me *a drop* from himself - the# lord# of Queenscrown. Too bad it's empty.\<br></br>A# lord# is a *little drop* down (but actually above) from King in hierarchy.

釣	At my local funfair, there's a sidestall called #go fishin'#, where you have one swing to catch a *gold*fish with a giant *golden ladle*.

You were young, and you felt a little CRAZY? Your heart, your head, your body, and most your... --ahem--. Can you feel those CRAZY feelings all inside you as you walked down the PATHS of a park, the STREETS of your town, the ROAD by the beach? Do you even remember which WAY you went?\<br></br>We're not running, walking, or marching, we're just chilling and# stroll#ing, I guess to the Chinese that does seem pretty *crazy* considering how purposeful they are about everything.\<br></br>*Crazy* King Baratheon# stroll#s around the *road* nowadays, because he's fat. At least when he was alive....\<br></br>The people that just freely# stroll# on the streets and parks, no hurry and stress at all, dressed like hippies, seems to the majority as being *crazy*. But they just live in their particular *way* and *crazy* is the world running around at high speed :-).\<br></br>There are many CRAZY people that live down a particular ROAD, and to save some time you# STROLL# down it one evening, much to your regret.\<br></br>You'd have to be crazy to take a# stroll# down this path!
車	Axles jutting in the front and back, giant needles off the front and rear bumper, and a *brainy* seating area - yea, my# car# is ready for some DESTRUCTION DERBY BABY!\<br></br>Rather than hobbling along with a *walking stick* to cross through a long *span*, it's much better to use a# car#. (Imagine an old man with a walking stick creeping along a span of road, and you, in a# car#, whizzing right by him. It's funny 'cause it's true.) Also, it's important to include the word "through," so you know the walking stick goes right THROUGH the span. (thanks to dukelexon).\<br></br>Sound: che1 After Che launched an uprising, the *Americans* launched an embargo, and that’s why Cuba doesn’t have many new# car#s.

連	There are so many *cars* on this *road*,# one after another#... It's the biggest traffic jam ever!\<br></br>#One after another#, the *cars* in the destruction derby tournament line the *road* to the arena.\<br></br>This is a one-lane *road*, *cars* can only go# one after another#.\<br></br>The funfair is in town! The huge *lorries* form a huge snaking convoy on the *road*, passing continuously# one after another# all day long.\<br></br>Cars on the road pass by# one after another#.
蓮	The grand prize for winning the destruction derby tournament are# lotus#'s. *One after another*, beautiful women will walk up and hand you a nice, plump, ugly# lotus#. I shall risk my life to win!\<br></br>Look at the# lotus#'s in the pond: *one after another* they open up and show us their beautiful *flowers*.\<br></br>It's national# lotus# day! In Asia they give out and decorate everything with# lotus# *flowers*. In the UK this holiday has a different meaning - all the British# Lotus# *car* owners gather in London, and form a long convoy on the *road*, driving their# Lotus# Espirits and APXs *one after another*.\<br></br>The# LOTUS# CAR drives down the ROAD with a# lotus# flower on top of it.
前	*Animal horns* are the inedible part# in front# of the animal that a *butcher* has to remove first. (thanks to Valiant). This process is done# in front# of the *butchers shop*, to stop it getting too bloody (we can use *butchers shop* as a primitive from now on).\<br></br>#In front# of the *butchers shop* the butcher displays *animal horns* to let you know what he sells. 刖 = uncommon hanzi meaning cutting off feet as form of punishment which we can associate with butchering. Grade 2 Kanji = before.
剪	At the *butchers shop*, they don't bother using# shears# to remove an animals fur, as its already dead - better to just use a *dagger* and slice its pelt off in one go..\<br></br>Using a SAMURAI SWORD as# SHEARS# you cut the plants IN FRONT OF you.\<br></br>Changing keyword to #scissors# - try them *before* using a *dagger* or knife (it's safer)# shears# ->wool coat ->Macbeth-> Is this a *dagger* which I see *in front of* me, er before me.
輸	Right primitive = *slughterhouse* (where the butchers meet once a week to gather all their livestock and kill it). Story: a huge *lorry* is used to# transport# livestock to the *slaughterhouse*. Imagine the animals braying and mooing, all packed in there..\<br></br>After the destruction derby, my awesome *car* is used to# transport# bodies to the *slaughterhouse* (*meeting* of *butchers*)... maybe I shouldn't be so destructive...\<br></br>This *car* is used to# transport# meat from the *slaughter house* to the butchers shop and other sundry bulk meat clients.
逾	The butcher woke up late, and now has to# exceed# the speed-limit on the *road*, so he can get to the *slaughterhouse* before it closes.\<br></br>Imagine# exceed#ing the speed limit on the *road*, driving faster than you've ever driven before - why? You're escaping on the *road* leading away from the *slaughterhouse*.\<br></br>On the *road* to the *slaughterhouse*, I often# exceed# the speed limit in order to create more bodies to take there. (I am sick, I know).\<br></br>#Exceed# on the road and you will meet with the butchers!\<br></br>#Exceed#ing the speed limit is likely to turn the *road* into an open-air *slaughterhouse*.\<br></br>Can't# exceed# your weight limit! Just one of the reasons flying is so miserable. And of course, the BUTCHERS fresh from the SLAUGHTERHOUSE with all of the heavy carcasses far# exceed# the weight limit. Thus, they can only travel by ROAD. And look, there they are, out of the airport and holding their MEETING on the ROAD!\<br></br>Sometimes the *slaughter house* clients need the meat in a hurry (like the time the zoo got a whole pack of wolves), in which case the speed limit on the *road* is# exceed#ed.\<br></br>On the *road* to the *slaughterhouse* (*meeting* of *butchers*), you can't# exceed# the speed limit because of the herds of animals on the road (third world *slaughterhouse*).\<br></br>The meeting of butchers has spilled out on the road, all the flesh and sabers inside caused them to# exceed# capacity.\<br></br>When too much people on the highway# exceed#s the speed limits, the *road* is becoming really dangerous, so just pray that its not going to become a *slaughterhouse* of cars in one big crash.\<br></br>Trailer for a horror movie: After# EXCEED#ING the speed limit, a group of friends crash their car on a country ROAD, only to seek refuge in a SLAUGHTERHOUSE.
各	#Each# and every one of us came out of a pair of *walking legs*, with screaming *mouth* wide open.\<br></br>Imagine a Head Park Ranger talking to his squad - "I want# each# of you to take a *walkie talkie* and radio back to the base at regular intervals...now move it men!!" (each is too vague, so I use #walkie-talkie# (walking legs + mouth) as a primitive from now on).\<br></br>Having a *mouth* (an opening of a cave or huge chasm) under your *walking legs* means that while walking on this narrow rocky path you must be carefull with# each# step you make.\<br></br>#Each# tyrant shall fall. Picture someone’s *walking legs* stepping over the *mouth* of a tyrant. (Inspired by the state flag of Virginia, my home state.) Just as a heads-up, you may get this character confused with that for every – so do your best to form a concrete image for# each#.
格	"Ranger! I want you to go check the #pattern# of bark on *each* tree, and report back on your *walky-talkie*" "Errr, *Each* tree sir?" replies the ranger looking out over the vast forest. "That's Right, I want the #pattern# of *each* tree! Move out!" (thanks to Istvan).\<br></br>*Trees* + *each* =# pattern#. *Each tree* species is distinguished by a# pattern# of its leaves, bark and branches. This is how you recognize them.
客	*Each*# guest# is welcome under this *roof*. This can be a motto of the Hospitality club or Couchsurfing.\<br></br>It make sense that a# Guest# would be staying under a *roof*. But why would a rude# guest# be carrying around a *walkie-talkie*? Perhaps they're a secret spy agent for Lonely planet or some other tourist book, checking out how good your hotel is!(thanks to meganesia).\<br></br>The# guest#s in the# guest# *house* have a room *each*.\<br></br>This hostel has a special *roof* for *each*# guest#.
額	All the *guests* sign the hotel *guest*book *page* with their #forehead#. (Picture a guestbook full of# forehead# prints like thumbprints) (thanks to Kurisu).\<br></br>The *head* of a household instructs his family members to kiss each *guest* who enters their home on the# forehead# as a sign of welcome.\<br></br>Picture someone with a little yellow (sticky) *page* with the text "Be my *guest*!" stuck to his# forehead#.
夏	I think have the image of a hot# summer# and you want to keep *oneself* indoors under an air conditioned *ceiling* not out *walking* around in the blazing sun (thanks to ouroborosatx).\<br></br>In# summer# one keeps *oneself* under the *ceiling* in the shade, as one checks out all the sexy the *walking legs* going by...\<br></br>#Summer# that means# summer# holidays - so everyone having vacation put *oneself* on his *walking legs* and starts moving around the country, friends, planet ...
洛	EACH person wants to go to# L.A.# and see the WATER of the Pacific Ocean.\<br></br>Picture an# L.A.# drugs bust - *sweat* is *dripping* down a cops forehead and body, as he shouts into a *walkie-talkie* "backup, I need BACKUP". But then he drops the *walkie-talkie* into the toilet, making it all *wet* and broken...uh-oh..\<br></br>Water, plus the mouth between the walking legs, sounds like a commercial for Baywatch, who patrolled the beaches of Los Angeles.\<br></br>Remember the 80s song: " From LA to each water and each water to LA, in my life I've been dreaming of blah blah blah...".\<br></br>*Each* person wants to take route 66 to# L.A.# and see the *water*.\<br></br>#L.A.# is a dry place so *each* drop of *water* is to be conserved.

The poliemans backup finally arrives, but they find him dead after a# fall# from a 5 story building. Was it an accident or murder?

In L.A. our shit doesn't# fall# down. Our boobs don't# fall#, our skin doesn't# fall#, our tans don't go down, our hair doesn't# fall# out. We've got our plastic surgeons, dude! Heck, even our FLOWERS don't# fall# down and droop, because they're plastic too!\<br></br>Our Baywatch babe headed north and is now a drugged out hippie in San Francisco with flowers in her hair, what a# fall#.

冗	The king's *crown* was blown up and away by the *wind*. "Oh well," he said, "it's just a# superfluous# symbol anyway. I don't need it, I still have the riches and power!" (thanks to Raichu).
沉	In Taiwan, this is actually written as *water* + *crown* + *human legs* (In printed form only it uses *wind*). New primitive - *crown* + *human legs* = *Japanese schoolgirl in miniskirt* (pictograph). Story: I go to the cinema to watch a new art film that just came out - I tell all my friends and family that it's really# profound# and has an amazing hidden meaning! but in reality I'm only watching it because it features a *japanese schoolgirl* splashing around in *water* and getting *wet* for 2 hours..\<br></br>(沉) Just add *water* to go from the *superfluous* to the# profound#!\<br></br>If you think that you have found something# profound#, that you are real philosopher, just wash your head with *water* - and you will probably see that it was just so *superfluous*.\<br></br>#Profound# -> deep well -> *trinket* #sinking# into the *water*.\<br></br>(沉) If you wash, with *water*, away the *superfluous* you may uncover the# profound#.\<br></br>I like the "schoolgirl" primitive. A SCHOOLGIRL sits near WATER, hoping to achieve a# PROFOUND# sense of enlightenment.
軍	The# army# has *cars* and *tanks* that are under the command of the *crown* - in ancient days these would have been *chariots*. (use "under" to help remember placement of the primitives.) (thanks to Cirion).\<br></br>Imagine a victorious# army#, having liberated a city, parading through the streets in open top *cars* and wearing *crowns*.\<br></br>When we think of the# army#, we can also think of tanks-- which are a type of chariot (crowned car).
輝	Rays shining of the crown of a chariot are definitely radiant.\<br></br>When I think of# radiance# I think of the greek god Zeus - picture him throwing *rays* of sun and lightning (hence the extra jaggedness of the character) from atop his #radiant# *chariot* riding through the heavens! (thanks to sethimayne).\<br></br>True# radiance# requires a *ray army* to display all the glory.\<br></br>Radiant chariots riding the rays (of the moon) mythology or ancient UFOs?

冠	Remember the <a href="/study/kanji/288">superfluous</a> <span class="index">(#288)</span> *crown* that flew away in the *wind*? Well now the king is saying "damn...from the *beginning* i should have had the thing *glued* to my head" (thanks to wasurenaide).\<br></br>*Beginnings* of contemporary social order are symbolically *glued* to the present by a# crown# that symbolize them.\<br></br>Picture Prince William literally *gluing* the# crown# to his child, as has been done in his family since the *beginning*.
夢	Last night's date with Miss Sweden was like a# dream#. She gave me *flowers* which made me go all *cross-eyed*, to *crown* the perfect *evening*. (thanks to mameha1977).\<br></br>It looks like a# dream#catcher, and reminds me of A Midsummer Night's# Dream#, flowers over the sleeping eyes, a crown, and pale moon.\<br></br>The flower petals over the eyes: the crown to a per­fect evening.\<br></br>During a long day of royal ceremonies, the *flowers* make the king's *eyes* feel tired, he falls asleep, his *crown* falls off, and he spends the *evening*# dream#ing of tax increases. But his courtiers cover for him. [my problem is getting the first three elements in the correct order].\<br></br>Simplified to 梦. Imagine a native american# dream#catcher: *flowers* placed on a *net*, held up by a *crown* to catch the# dream#s during *evening* when the moon is up.

Sadly he had no *angel* looking over his shoulder this time.\<br></br>Oh yes, I'm the great# pretend#er - Freddy Mercury sitting on a cloud (=*angel*) and going ploing ploing on a harp.\<br></br>To# pretend# to be someone you're not is a *tall* order, and can cause you so much trouble and stress that you'll *die young*.
橋	A small 5 year old child has lost her mother in a tragic death. Her family tells her, "Don't worry, your mom is an *angel* now, in heaven, watching over you." The small girl takes this very literally and is found one day, gathering pieces of *wood*. Her dad asks her, "What are you doing with that *wood*?" "I'm trying to build a #bridge# to heaven to visit the *angels*." (thanks to sutebun).\<br></br>I imagine running along a large ravine, running away to escape from the people trying to kill me. I'm figuring out how to cross the ravine, when I suddenly find a toppled *tree* lying across it to form a perfect# bridge#. It's like an *angel* is protecting me!\<br></br>A# bridge# is a sort of artificial *pretend* *tree*.\<br></br>#Bridge# building is serious business. They're expensive and will fall apart if not made correctly. I can imagine the Chinese PRETENDING to build a good# bridge# out of just a TREE. Oh yea, just lay it across the river, chabuduo! You can drive trucks, tanks, heck, probably airplanes across this TREE# bridge#!
嬌	The perfect *woman* is not just# attractive#, but she behaves like an *angel* as well.\<br></br>A little girl likes to play pretend, but she doesn't just pretend she's a princess, she pretends she's the most# attractive# woman in the world, who'll get ALL the boys!\<br></br>#Attractive# *women* are often compared to *angels*. Just imagine guy saying "phwaor, that *girl* is *heavenly*".\<br></br>#Attractive#? Are you kidding? All WOMEN are just PRETENDING. Makeup, hair, clothes, yea, they look# attractive# on the street... but they all look the same in the morning.

See <a href="/study/kanji/408">standing up</a> <span class="index">(#408)</span>.\<br></br>I was meant to *stand up* and give a speech but was so nervous I started# weep#ing (*tears*).\<br></br>My mom #wept# uncontrollably after I broke that flower *vase*.

Bloody beggars..their stories are getting more and more elaborate..\<br></br>I'm *standing* at the train #station# looking into the timetables and asking them to *tell me the fortune*: when is the train about to come?\<br></br>They've replaced the timetable at the# station# with a fortune teller who just stands there telling the next train times.\<br></br>The *fortune teller* approaches the guard *standing* at the# station# and offers to tell his fortune in exchange for a free ticket. "No, you have to *stand* in line and buy a ticket like everyone else".\<br></br>Story: it’s so annoying when you’re *standing* at the train# station#, waiting for the train to come, and someone is blaring music from their *radio*. It’s too loud to think!\<br></br>I'm *standing* at the train #station# looking into the timetables and asking them to *tell me the fortune*: when is the train about to come?
章	One #chapter# of the Karma Sutra is all about sex in public, with an entire #section# about "doing it" whilst *standing* in a field of *sunflowers*. Kinky book! (thanks to Evangelo).\<br></br>The first# chapter# of this book starts in media res with the protagonist standing alone in the early morning in a field of sunflowers. Who is he? How did he get here? What is he doing, just standing there? You must read more# chapter#s to find out!\<br></br>In this book on Vincent van Gogh, a whole# chapter# is about his *vases* with *sunflowers*.

帝	How embarrassing it would be to meet the# Sovereign# King of England by stumbling into him when he’s *standing up* in the Buckingham Palace bathroom, wearing nothing but a *crown* and a *towel,* having just gotten out of the shower. “You must have taken a wrong turn during the tour!” he says.\<br></br>Imagine a totally# sovereign# state where the supreme ruler can *stand* in his cooking *apron* and it's perfectly normal. Why would he do that? Probably because the# sovereign# state is just his house and he is cooking food for himself.\<br></br>Picture a chef *standing* in his kitchen with an *apron*, treating it like it's his own# sovereign# state with its own hierarchy and special rules. "MY KITCHEN, MY RULES!!!".\<br></br>Crazy UK rapper Lady# Sovereign# tells everyone to *stand-up* in her new video, whilst wearing nothing except an *apron*. The video is now banned from MTV..

鐘	Remember that show, Saved by the# Bell#? It had a bunch of *juveniles* in it, and in one episode they actually tried stealing the# bell# because it was made of *gold*! (thanks to CSBarnes).\<br></br>The school# bell# is used to make sure that *juveniles* stay on the *Golden* path to knowledge.\<br></br>Some *juveniles* tried to steal the *golden*# bell#.\<br></br>Ancient Chinese threw *juveniles* into the melted *metal* to improve the sound of the# bell#.\<br></br>Simplified: 钟# bell# = *metal*, *middle*.\<br></br>A 15-year-old explains: "'Jingle# Bell#s' is pretty *juvenile* music. I listen instead to heavy *metal*.".
商	Slick Willy the #salesman# is *standing* on a motorcycle *helmet* he's trying to sell you to demonstrate how rugged it is. His *legs* crash through the top of it and after a moment of awkward silence his *mouth* opens in pain and says, "hey, we can still make a deal?". (thanks to scottamus).
適	Think of the term from televison "suitable for all audiences" to get the sense of the word. What program could be more# suitable# for the whole family than the "*antiques* *road*(show)". (thanks to fredde79).\<br></br>Most# suitable# place to show your *antiques* is in the middle of a *road*. Otherwise no one would care.\<br></br>Simplified 适# Suitable# = *tongue*, *road*. Story: Comedians with a loose *tongues* are not considered# suitable# for US audiences, so they must take their show on the *road* to countries that are less prude.
敵	As WW2 came to a close a close, German was so low on resources that *Hitler* ordered the army use *antique* weapons from private collections and museums on the advancing Russian# enemy#! Imagine Germans firing rusty cannon and swing *antique* swords.\<br></br>Haha! Look at that laughable# enemy#. They fight with *ancient* weapons and their *taskmaster* is all dressed up funny. They are no match for our modern army.\<br></br>*Hitler* is the# enemy# of humanity, destroying *antique* treasures across Europe.\<br></br>You can have a tiff or a scuff or a tissy or a fight. Or maybe even a war. But and# enemy#? That's an ANTIQUE TASKMASTER, relative to one's life. A TASKMASTER from ANTIQUITY. And why is he such an# enemy#, you might ask? Because he broke your VASE, of course!

背	At the *north pole*, two people sit# back# to# back#, their *flesh* touching to keep warm..\<br></br>The# back# side of the *moon* is its *north* pole. (note: this is a completely fictitious and nonsensical made up fact).\<br></br>Comrade Mao was in his NORTH capital, BEIjing, smiling over all his little comrades of all China.

But *compared* to the *White* Album, it was too poppy and didn't fit with the rest of their songs enough, so they left it off the album..
此	Ah a beautiful park on a beautify sunny day. Good place to *stop*, *sit down* and start reading #this (literary)# book I've got to write an essay on for homework.\<br></br>#This# dirty *spoon* *stop*ped me from eating.\<br></br>"Is# this# (literary) a dagger I see before me?" Asks Shakespeare's Macbeth. "Cut! STOP! No no no,# this# (literary) is not a dagger you see before you, but an ANTIQUE SPOON. Daggers are sooo 16th century." Says the director.
些	This actually means #some# or #several# (i.e. a small number greater than 1) and is very common, so I'm changing keyword to #several#. Story: continuing from <a href="/study/kanji/426">this (literary)</a> <span class="index">(#426)</span> - you *stop* and *sit down* to read your literary book in the book, but turns out you've accidently brought #several# (actually *two*). Oh well, you start reading them both, one in each hand!\<br></br>Using *two* *spoons* will *stop* your sled only# somewhat#; I suggest you find a better way to brake!\<br></br>THIS (lit) is the hanzi for TWO, it is# SOMEWHAT# easy to remember.\<br></br>Continuing from <a href="/study/kanji/426">this (literary)</a> <span class="index">(#426)</span>, and using aphasiac's keyword #several#, we have the story of our angry director: "Macbeth, you're going to need to do this #several# times, it's: 'Is <a href="/study/kanji/426">this (literary)</a> <span class="index">(#426)</span> an ANCIENT SPOON I see before me?' No daggers, okay? Take TWO!".\<br></br>Also means some -> change the keyword from# somewhat# to #some#. Ditty about porridge: #Some# like it hot, some like it cold, some like it in the pot *two* days old (so you *stop* eating it, let it *sit* and wait *two* days (you could also wait nine days as in the ditty...).\<br></br>Stop and sit down and rest a while, a few more steps to go!
它	Inside your *house* you *spoon* your partner in bed, after you finished "doing #it#" (having sex).\<br></br>#IT# *sits down* in the *house* of your subconsciousness.\<br></br>"This is# IT#"! Mickael Jackson was found dead in his *house*, *sitting on the ground*.
旨	Mmmm this Ben and Jerrys ice-cream is so delicious, I could *spoon* it in all *day*. Sadly, ice-cream gives my life# purpose#..\<br></br>Here we have a buddhist monk meditating on the# purpose# of life: he's *sitting on the ground* all *day* long.\<br></br>In ancient China *sitting down* relaxing all *day* was the goal /# purpose# of life.\<br></br>The# purpose# of working all *day* is to put food in your mouth with *spoon*.\<br></br>Imagine someone who thinks that her# purpose# in life is to give out *spoon*-fuls of *sunshine* to people who are feeling down in the dumps. She would probably be a pretty cheery person!\<br></br>Intention/purpose - if you are #intent# on finding out the meaning of life - do some Delicious Donut Research, *spooning* in the good stuff all *day*.\<br></br>For some people their only# purpose# in life is eating delicious food, imagine a fat dude in restaurant stuffing his face# purpose#fully.\<br></br>[En attendant Godot]# Purpose# of life--spoon out the endless days, said Estragon.
脂	The #grease# that comes from the *flesh* of an animal has one *purpose*: making us fat.\<br></br>In ancient times, having a thick layer of #fat# (grease) on your *flesh* served a clear *purpose*: to prepare for hard times.\<br></br>The *purpose* of having a *body* like Arnold Schwazenegger is to put fatty# grease# all over it and show it off.\<br></br>This means FAT (the fatty part of meat), not# grease#. I suggest changing this keyword to #fat# and frame 909 to #plump#. Story: Fat - the *part of the body* on an animal that is *delicious*.
每	Typical playground insult - #Every# guy gets to *recline* with your *momma*..\<br></br>Typical playground insult - #Every# guy gets to *recline* with your *momma*. Inspired by aphasiac's story, let this primitive be *Yo' momma*! It's also part of 侮 <a href="/study/kanji/2018">insult</a> <span class="index">(#2018)</span>.
梅	Bad choice of keyword by Heisig - I'm changing this to #plum blossom# (as thats this Hanzi is often used for). Story: In Asia (japanese especially) the #plum blossom# on the plum *trees* in spring is *every*-where and admired by *every*-one. Do a Google image search for 梅, it's so beautiful!\<br></br>From *every*# small plum# you're eating you can grow a plum *tree*, if you treat the seed well!\<br></br>You are walking through a plum orchard but it isn't harvesting season yet. From *every* *tree* you see at least one #small plum# that isn't ready to be picked yet. So frustrating! See <a href="/study/kanji/191">tree</a> <span class="index">(#191)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/431">every</a> <span class="index">(#431)</span>.\<br></br>*Yo' momma's* so dumb, she dressed up in purple, climbed a *tree*, and thought she was a plum blossom.
海	The# sea# is literally *water* *every*-where.\<br></br>*Yo' momma's* so fat, she needs all the *water* in the# sea# to take a bath.\<br></br>*Every* *drop of water* eventually ends up in the# sea#.\<br></br>*Every* *drop* of water eventually ends up in the# sea#.\<br></br>*Every* drop of *water* eventually ends up in the# sea#.\<br></br>Early people thought the# sea# was the bounty (breasts) of life.
乞	To# beg# is to *recline* on the streets with arm out like a big *fish hook* to collect whatever you can.\<br></br>Imagine an old poor fisherman who's now a# beg#gar. When he goes to# beg#, he *reclines* on the ground near the seafront, stinking of *fishguts*, his clothing covered in his old *fishhooks*. What a sorry sight.
吃	Our #beggar# from the previous frame is so hungry, he often lays there with his *mouth* wide open, begging for something to *eat*, hoping someone will just throw some food straight in. But then when someone does, hes bad mannered and #eats# with his *mouth wide open* - it's a pretty disgusting sight.\<br></br>MOUTHS BEGGING to# EAT#.\<br></br>Sound: chi1 *Americans* want to# eat# chi-rry pie more than anything else. (In my stories *America* denotes 1st tone, *China* denotes second, *Germany* denotes third and *Japan* denotes fourth.).
乾	Look at that pitiful sight: *ten sunflowers* all# dry# and drooping under the scorching sun, *begging* for a little moisture.\<br></br>When the land is extra# dry# and there's a drought on, even a little *mist* is begged for by the people..\<br></br>The *beggar* drops off his# dry# cleaning before *ten* to get the *early* bird rates.\<br></br>In my dictionary is says this character is associated with the heavens and cosmos, I imagine in the early days of earth there was only mist, begging for life to populate it, which would in turn# dry# up the mist.
複	My girlfiend saw someone wearing the exact same (duplicate) *cloak* at a party, so she *doubled back* to change! (thanks to akimoto).\<br></br>Imagine Superman setting out to rescue someone, only to discover that the *cape* he is wearing is a cheap #duplicate# without the special powers that enable him to fly. Now he has to *double back* and change to the real thing.\<br></br>Simplified to 复. Our duplicating machine needs to *recline* every *day* after all the hard running, *walking legs*. In Taiwan they put some *clothing* in front so you dont see the absurdity of this very modern image.
腹	*part of the body* that *doubles over* when you get punched in it - or get food poisoning..
欠	To me, this kanji looks like a person with two arms and two legs, but who# lack#s a head. (thanks to ihatobu).\<br></br>Looks like a person who is #yawning# because he# lack#s interest in the boring stories you're making up.
吹	#Blow#-job. See the *mouth* and *lack* of condom (thanks to usis35).\<br></br>A boy using his *mouth* to# blow# up a balloon until he *lacks* air.\<br></br>How can I# BLOW# if I LACK a MOUTH?
歌	*can-can* dancers *lack* a good range of# song#s to dance to - they always seem to use that same one (im sure you all know it!).\<br></br>Your *older brother* is supposed to babysit you and keep you busy. So when it seems like you *lack* anything to do, he makes up a #song#. See <a href="/study/kanji/89">older brother</a> <span class="index">(#89)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/439">lack</a> <span class="index">(#439)</span>.\<br></br>*older brothers* often *lack* a good range of# song#s to sing at karaoke.\<br></br>The #song# these *can-can* girls are singing for my *older brother* is so boring I'm going to *yawn*.
軟	My *car* is made for racing, so it *lacks* all comforts like# soft# seats. In fact it *lacks* everything - its just an engine, frame and 4 wheels.\<br></br>If your *car* has really# soft# seats, you may start *yawning* and eventually fall asleep at the wheel (imagine that this seat is a huge# soft# beanbag that nearly swallows the driver, and it will be easier to remember).\<br></br>CARS are things that LACK# SOFT#NESS because they are made of metals and stuff.\<br></br>My *car*'s seat is too# soft# so I'm *yawning* all the time, eager to sleep on it.\<br></br>Detroit princess and the pea - the bed was too# soft# for her because there was no car underneath it. Only a (Detroit) princess would notice that.
次	In traditional handwriting, this hanzi is *two* and *lack*. In printed form it's *ice* and *lack*. Story: It's blazing hot 40c day, and you *lack* *ice* so you go to the shops. But there's a huge queue! Imagine getting nearer to the front, with the shopkeeper saying# NEXT#...NEXT until finally you're *next* in line! Finally you get there and the shopkeeper gives you *two* ice-cubes - what a pointless wait!
資	The first *money* you earn you use to pay your liabilities, the *next* *money* you earn you store as *assets* below.\<br></br>Imagine a topless model, who's *next* in line at the surgery clinic. She's about to hand over a big pile of money (*clams*) to have her# assets# increased in size.\<br></br>From out of no where comes the next shell and then next shell and the next shell- asset inflation the curse of every economy.
姿	I'm married, but when queuing I always admire the# looks# of the *next* *woman* in line to me. its ok if its just window shopping, right?
諮	To# consult with# is literally to have *words* with the *next* *mouth*.\<br></br>Simplified to 咨 and 谘. The first opinion *mouth*ed is usually banal. You should always# consult with# the *next* *mouth* if you want a decent opinion. Traditionally this comes with *words*, go figure.
賠	After Tianamen Square, the government had two things it could do with the remaining protestors: it could *muzzle* them or #compensate# with *shells* to buy their allegiance. I think they did both. See <a href="/study/kanji/51">shellfish</a> <span class="index">(#51)</span>.\<br></br>To# compensate# for his smaller size the man tried stretching it with a *shellfish*. You can imagine what *sound* he made: "AAAAAAAAHHHHH".\<br></br>In preparation for the 2008 Beijing Olympic games, many people were forcibly removed from their homes to make way for new architectural projects. They were suppose to be# compensate#d with clams, of course, but corrupt officials often just took their piece and *muzzled* any protesters.\<br></br>#Compensate# - with payments (=*shells*), to# compensate# for first trying to *muzzle* the critics.\<br></br>Because you lost all your *shells* and were *muzzled* wrongly, we are going to# compensate# you.\<br></br>Apple are always paying out *money* (clams) to# compensate# other companies - truth is, it's more to do with *muzzling* them over Apples stolen ideas / technology.\<br></br>Muzzled clam -another victim of the compo culture.
培	In China a *land* owner #cultivates# the *soil* by hiring a load of slave workers and *muzzling* them all.\<br></br>Anyone who doesn't want to #cultivate# this *soil* will be *muzzled*!\<br></br>In Qin dynasty the focus was farming and commerce was discouraged. Anyone not willing to# cultivate# the *soil* was *muzzled*.\<br></br>To# cultivate# the earth you must muzzle it first.
音	If you *stand* on the *sun* you're sure to make a huge# sound#! "AAAAAH, IT'S SO HOT".\<br></br>A nearby *vase* has been broken by the loud# sound# produced by a *tongue wagging in the mouth* of an opera singer.
暗	Imagine the *sun* exploding - there would be a gigantic *sound* and then...nothing. You'd just be left standing in the #dark# (thanks to DrWarrior12).\<br></br>Phew, it's# dark# in here - the lightbulb (=sun) must have blown, yes now I remember to have heard that characteristic hissing *sound*...\<br></br>The collapse of the *sun* into a# dark# black hole makes a big *sound* like a Big Bang!\<br></br>The *sun* makes a yelping, panicking *sound* when it goes# dark#.
韻	#Rhyme# is the *sound* closely associated with hip-hop. Imagine Dr Dre setting up a rap-factory, where all the *employees* are paid to make up #rhymes# all day, producing a ridiculous *sound*.\<br></br>Simplified - 韵 -# Rhyme# = SOUND of words or the endings of words at the ends of lines of poetry are UNIFORM.
識	A person of# knowledge# knows many languages (*words*), how to play music (*sound*), and how to *party*.\<br></br>Imagine being at a *kazoo fiesta* (big street party where everyone plays kazoos) and having *words* with the worlds most# knowledge#-able *kazoo* expert. He's got a huge colection and could bore you talking about them all day! he even *tells* you how to play one, imparting his# knowledge# on making it sound nice.\<br></br>Simplified: 识# Knowledge# = *words*, *only*. Story: Wittgenstein's philosophy of language basically said that# knowledge# consists of *words* *only*.\<br></br>There is no greater# knowledge# than the profound *words* of a *kazoo*.\<br></br>#Knowledge# is not just knowing *words* but applying it. Here we're applying our# knowledge# of how to play the *kazoo*!
幟	A man dressed in only a TOWEL blows his KAZOO amid many# STREAMER#S, something not uncommon during Mardi Gras.\<br></br>Its the big finale of of the *kazoo fiesta*, and a guy is up on stage playing a *kazoo* wearing only a *towel*. When it gets to the end of the performance, he gives a big blow on the *kazoo*, #streamers# blast out of the end into the crowd, and then he whips the towel off!
竟	For *mirror* primitive, image a girl *standing* at her #mirror# all *day*, admiring her *legs*. Story: Imagine looking into your *mirror*, and# unexpectedly# you see a different person in the reflection looking back. spooky..\<br></br>One of the most unexpected things I can imagine is if a bunch of speakers suddenly sprouted shapely human legs and started scampering about the room! (Thus, we get sound on human legs.).\<br></br>I looked in the mirror and# unexpectedly# saw a *sound speaker* on my *human legs*.\<br></br>A #fart# is an #unexpected# #sound# . #Fart# is the primitive of# unexpectedly# . Here we have someone# unexpectedly# having a #fart# -a #sound# issuing from the top of his #legs#.\<br></br>While relaxing, you were expecting the radio to put out a soothing sound.# Unexpectedly#, what came out was a screeching *sound* that made your *human legs* shoot straight up.\<br></br>I use the "Mirror Mirror on the wall" story, and Snow White's stepmother# unexpectedly# saw Snow White in the mirror when she was expecting to see herself.\<br></br>After playing the game "Mirror's Edge," I cannot help but associate this with "Faith," the female protagonist. Soldiers STAND shooting as Faith's LEGS break the mirror-like glass windows of office buildings, causing a great deal of SUN lens-flare.\<br></br>The creature was *standing* in front of the audience when,# unexpectedly#, *wags his tongue in the mouth* and shows his *human legs*.
鏡	Gold# mirror# of the wicked queen unexpectedly showed Snow White's face.\<br></br>A *golden* *mirror* is the best type of #mirror#. Its all yellow and bright and hides your blemishes.\<br></br>The blacksmith is heating up the #metal# silver for a# mirror#. The smithy bellows have broken so he has his trousers around his ankles and #farting# (unexpected sound) to smelt the #metal#.\<br></br>Early# mirror#s were made out of polished pieces of *metal* - *unexpectedly*, this worked quite well!
境	A superstitious farmer lines the #boundaries# of his *land* with *mirrors* facing outwards - to ward off demons and evil spirits.\<br></br>A small *land* owner who puts *mirrors* on the# boundary# of his property to make it seem much bigger.\<br></br>Gardener lines the #boundary# of his *land* with *mirrors*, to make the space appear larger.\<br></br>The mole creates molehills to form his# boundary# by #farting# (unexpected sound from top of legs)- the #dirt# rises up like a volcano !

望	Our *destitute king* looks out of his window, and sees the *deceased* *flesh* of his army and servants laying around the courtyard - the result of the peasant uprising. He now #expects# the worst - "they found me - I #expect# i'll be dead by morning".\<br></br>*kings*# EXPECT# to *die (become deceased)* under the *moon*.\<br></br>It's the beginning of the French Revolution! And you can# expect# the streets to be littered with the *deceased* and random *flesh/parts of the body*. As for grand finale, well, you know what to# expect#: *King* Louis getting his head chopped off by the guillotine.
方	Heisig’s story is OK, but because *dagger* is so different here I’m going to make this a pictogram. We have a little kid (the 1st two strokes are the head and arms) here running around – the 3rd stroke is his left leg and the 4th is his right foot, as sharp (accurate) as a dagger’s blade. You can never tell what# direction# a kid will run in next, so give him a *compass* to make sure he can find his way back.\<br></br>Filling a *top hat* with water and then floating a *dagger* inside makes a good *compass*.

Here's why: the first Chinese settlers in the United States were sheep farmers who landed in California. [This story is completely fictional.] When they saw how *large* the California *sheep* are, they exclaimed, "what a# beautiful# country!" Thus, the character for# beautiful# is made of the *large* *sheep* that the Cantonese saw.
洋	This kanji refers to the *water*s of the Pa*sheep*hic# ocean# (thanks to PepeSeco).\<br></br>A farmer with an environmentalist side decides that to counter rising# ocean# levels, he will siphon off *water* from the# ocean# and give it to his *sheep* to drink, hoping they won’t mind the salty taste.\<br></br>Imagine a soaking *wet* *sheep* trying to swim out in the open #ocean#.

(Japan = 4th tone in my stories).\<br></br>If you want to wait for the# appearance# of *trees* in a field full of *sheep*, you can wait for all *eternity*, because the sheep will eat them before they get a chance to grow.\<br></br>#Appearance#, meaning outer shape or form - two typical examples are *trees* (whose# appearance# is determined by their bark) and *sheep* (whose# appearance# is determined by their type of wool). You can try to change your# appearance# - but only temporarily, it actually stays with you forever (=*eternity*).\<br></br>That tree over there, it the one that Trevor the sheep lived in.

Today he gets a shock - he finds a load of *turkeys* shivering all *wet* and dripping with *sweat* -they're ill with fever! So he takes the #standard# approach from his book "Turkey-Farming 101" - he pulls out a big *needle*. and injects them all with strong disgusting-smelling animal antibiotics.\<br></br>The avian# standard# specifies each turkey must be provided with *10* drops of *water* an hour.\<br></br>A *needle* in a mad scientist's lair measures whether a huge vat of *water* and *turkeys* measures up to the #standard#.
誰	A Chinese man once heard human WORDS coming from his big flock of TURKEYS. When he heard this, he asked "WHO is speaking!?" This freaked him out so much he made a character about it.\<br></br>One possible etymology of this word could be the flock of birds represent the vastness of the Chinese population, so *words* to a *flock* could seem like a logical pictograph for #who?#.\<br></br>Our *turkey* farmer from <a href="/study/kanji/504">standard</a> <span class="index">(#504)</span> is annoyed, and has *words* with the local townsfolk, so try and find out #who?# made his *turkeys* ill! Imagine him shouting "#WHO# DID THIS TO MY *TURKEYS*?". Apparently it was local kids,# who# like to *shout words* over the farm fences at night and scare the *turkeys* for kicks..\<br></br>Our *turkey* farmer from <a href="/study/kanji/504">standard</a> <span class="index">(#504)</span> is annoyed, and has *words* with the local townsfolk, so as to try and find out #who?# killed his *turkeys*! Apparently it was local kids,# who# threw bibles (*words*) over the farm fences at the turkeys.. (based on aphasiac).\<br></br>The farmer goes to check on her turkeys. She looks up and sees that words have been tied around all the turkeys. She then says# who#?# who#? did this?
售	Based on epsilondelta's RtK story: The *turkeys* they #vend# are hanging upside down with their *mouth* at the bottom.\<br></br>A special# VEND#ING machine in the shape of a TURKEY, and the goods come out of the turkey's MOUTH.\<br></br>Think of the street# vend#ors in China who sell their birds for dinner (turkeys) by hanging them upside down with the mouth at the bottom.\<br></br>A large# vend#ing machine is out of order. Turkeys are coming out of the open mouth at the bottom of the machine.
雖	I've never seen a insect talk,# Although# I have seen turkeys fly.\<br></br>I find #even though# more memorable, not sure why as it means the same thing! Story: #even though# our *turkey* farmer from <a href="/study/kanji/504">standard</a> <span class="index">(#504)</span> found his stock dead the next day, and the *turkeys* open *mouths* were crawling with wriggly maggoty *insects*, he still took the *turkeys* to market and sold them! gross!\<br></br>He says he won't put in his *mouth* those *insects*,# although# he knows they are edible. He prefers *turkey*.\<br></br>#Although# it is very convenient to take a taxi, in China you have to share it with a talking cockroach (as the driver) and an annoying turkey (gobble-gobble).\<br></br>Helen Keller reportedly said (according to brainyquote.com), “Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.” Well, suppose Helen Keller also said, “although the world is full of *insects* that fly into your *mouth*, it is also full of *turkey*.
確	Our *turkey*-famer soon found out that a *stone* *turkeyhouse* is more #reliable# than one made from wood and wire. It keeps foxes out better you see!\<br></br>Simplified-[确]-[972]: This shows the story of the *screwdriver* *bound up* in the *stone*: only a truly #reliable# carpenter will be able to pull it out and claim the honourable title of King Carpenter! (Thx anon).\<br></br>#Reliable# Joe stuffs his chicken side in a stone chicken coop to make sure that he has the rock-hard will that everyone else can rely on.\<br></br>#Reliable# -> assured -> rock solid -> turkey shelter from the big bad wolf.
午	#Noon# is a good time to *recline* for *10* minutes after lunch...mm so sleepy. Think of high #noon# in a Western, so remember this as *horse*.
許	If *horses* could *speak*, you would have to ask their permission before they #permit# you to mount and ride them! just imagine a *horse whisperer* doing just that..(thanks to fuaburisu).\<br></br>The sign *says* need a# permit# to put your *wooden horse* here after *noon*.\<br></br>A cartoon strip mom with *word* bubbles coming out of her mouth# permit#s the children to play with a toy *stick horse*.\<br></br>If that# permit# has the correct words, you can park your horse over there.
羽	Birds surely don't want any *ice* to *hook* onto their two# feathers#.\<br></br>Pictograph - just memorise it!\<br></br>Two #feathers# being plucked from each of the two bird wings.
習	Imagine a WHITE BIRD losing a couple FEATHERS as it is# LEARN#ing to fly. You# learn# a lesson as you watch it doing so, maybe you# learn# that “nothing comes for free” or that “one has to be prepared to lose in order to gain.”--(thanks to fuaburisu).\<br></br>#Learn#; white board to explain the# learn#ings and a feather duster to wipe out the previous explanations.\<br></br>#Learn#ing is all about adding more *feathers* to your cap and the most prestigious of all is the beautiful pure *white* feather you'll receive when you have# learn#ed the hanji!(thanks to Howdoken).\<br></br>Whenever you# learn# a new skill, you're rewarded with a feather of a white bird. Imagine being judged by your collection at the end of your life...
翔	Imagine a small *sheep* with its *sides* covered in *feathers*, #soar#-ing through the sky! Some Bird watchers look on in confusion, they cant believe what theyve just seen..(imagine feathers on its side, to help remember primitive placement).\<br></br>It's a *sheep* with *feathers* instead of *wool*, that's why it is# soar#ing through the sky.\<br></br>When counting SHEEP, it can be tough sometimes to get them over the fence. So, slap a pair of WINGS on them and watch them# SOAR#!\<br></br>When FEATHERS grow on SHEEP, they can# SOAR# through the sky.\<br></br>Only when the Wright Brothers used *wool* for their planes’ *wings* did their planes truly# soar# over the sand dunes of North Carolina. [I use wool as a primitive in my story rather than sheep because that helps me remember that the tail of sheep bends to the left.].\<br></br>I made super light wings from *wool* and *feathers* to# soar# through the sky.\<br></br>A *sheep* equipped with *feather*ed wings# soar#ing through the skies.\<br></br>A sheep attaches feathers to his side so that he can# soar# like Icarus. Vanglorious, he flies too close to the sun, and the inevitable happens - he is sucked into the turbines of a Lufthansa jetliner. (Yellow is my code for second tone).\<br></br>The *sheep* puts on her *feather wings* and #soars# up to the heights.\<br></br>One day a sheep sees the birds flying in the sky and decides he will fly himself so he gets a pair of wings and off he# soar#s.
困	The worst form of being #trapped# is being #trapped# in a coffin. Imagine being *pent* in inside a tiny *wooden* box, ready to buried...what a nightmare..\<br></br>When you *pent in* a *tree* in an enclosure, it looks# trapped#, but it is actually meant to protect it and guide its growth.\<br></br>Merlin was pent into a tree,# trapped# for all of eternity.\<br></br>We look at the time before the Fall as a kind of paradise, but humanity was actually# TRAPPED#, PENT IN within the Garden of Eden with the TREE of the knowledge of good and evil.\<br></br>The only way to control an Ent is to trap it in a pen of some sort-- you can't defeat giant walking trees!\<br></br>This poor *tree* was *pent in* and# trapped# for life!
固	Fossils are *ancient* things that have been *pent in* so long they have turned completely #solid# - almost to #solid# stone! (thanks to synewave).
國	Some #countries#, like North Korea, have to be kept *pent in* and locked down, *or else* they could do great harm to the rest of the world.\<br></br>Ok continuing the story from <a href="/study/kanji/336">or</a> <span class="index">(#336)</span> - the kid still defies his parents by licking up sweets. So dad says "right, get your *mouth* off the *ground* this instant, *or* else I'm shipping you off to boarding school in another #country#, where you'll be *pent in* studying day and night". Kid finally takes notice..but he still ends up getting sent away..\<br></br>the mouth kissing the ground affirms that his is his# country#.\<br></br>You can either stay in the traditional# COUNTRY#...

圓	The *employee* is *pent in* his cubicle, walking# round# and# round# in circles, unable to get out.\<br></br>Wheels go# round# and# round# -> hamster wheel -> employée pent in.\<br></br>Imagine a boss who keeps his office *employees* *pent in* all weekend at work! On Saturday night he holds a meeting, and on seeing #round# meeting table, he decides to give a terrible impromptu motivational speech! "We're like King Arthur and his Knights of the #Round# Table - now who's with me!!". Naturally everybody leaves..\<br></br>If your *employees* are *pent in* all day in office cubicles, you can expect them to become #round# very shortly, due either to lack of exercise or to depression. (Imagine the transition to ‘roundness’ happening very quickly, preferably with sound effects.) Perhaps this explains America’s obesity crisis . . .\<br></br>The elite *employees* of the firm are *pent in* a #round# office at the top.
因	We had to *pent in* our *St. Bernard dog* because he was the #cause# of too much trouble.\<br></br>Why is your *big St Bernard* *pent in* in a pen in your garden? Oh, it's because he went mental and #caused# £1000 worth of damage to the house. Now we're selling him and giving all the money to charity - it's for a good #cause#.
園	Why is this# park# almost completely *pent in* by a large fence? Well, it's designed by Mr *Yuan*, the suspicious politician, so that he can easily check who's going in or out.\<br></br>Someone found a *fake bomb* in the# park#, so now it's *pent in* by police-tape - no ones allowed in!
回	Forget the elements, I see this as a primitive stone *wheel*. Imagine the caveman who invented it rolling it up an incline, and then waiting for it to #return#. He also finds he can throw it as a boomerang, and it will #return# to him! What a great invention - the caveman #returns# to his cave in triumph!\<br></br>When food has passed your *mouth* and is *pent in* by your body, it has reached the point of no# return#.\<br></br>Two pipes like a coaxial cable. one is the# return#.\<br></br>Mercury’s orbit is tiny, and Neptune’s orbit is giant, but in time both planets will #return# to where they started. (Think of the two squares in this character as Mercury’s little orbit and Neptune’s large orbit.).\<br></br>Cover your mouth to pent in the food you are about to# RETURN# to the dinner table because of food poisoning.
迴	The caveman who invented the *stone wheel* finds it #revolves# perfectly when placed on a road - strap 4 together, and he's just invented the first car!\<br></br>The wheels on your automobile have stopped #revolving# due to a transmission problem (which forced you to park on the grass off the road). You are desperate for the mechanic to come and fix your transmission so you can get the wheels to# revolve# again, allowing you to *return* to the *road*.\<br></br>A *stone wheel* #revolves# best on a smooth *road*.\<br></br>Revolving means you are going along a path (*way*) that *returns* you to where you started.\<br></br>We decided to return the Prius to the car dealer because the wheels did not# revolve# on the road smoothly.\<br></br>The earth# revolve#s around the sun. That means that it moves along an invisible *road* and *returns* to its original position after exactly one year.
圖	Think of this hanzi as literally a #picture#, the *pent in* primitive being the border. Story: an old Archaeology professor is arguing with his colleague about a dig site. "You'll never find anything at this site - if you do I'll *eat* my *hat*"! Later that day the professor digs up a *primitive stone wheel*. Well true to his word his colleague stuffs his *top hat* into his *mouth* and eats it, and the professor decides to take a #picture# of the occasion, showing everything that happened that day.\<br></br>In this# picture# we see a man with a TALKING TOPHAT and a MOUTH WITHIN A MOUTH, a bizarre Dali-esque painting.\<br></br>This is an abstract# picture#, not a <a href="/study/kanji/312">drawing</a> <span class="index">(#312)</span>. There is a big square around the outside (*pent in*), then a little square (*mouth*), several lines (*top hat*) and then two squares inside each other (*return*) -- but nothing that could be found in nature.\<br></br>See the Picasso# picture#/gestalt diagram. What's in the# picture#. You see a mouth on top of a top hat, rotated.\<br></br>The caveman who invented the stone wheel is now rich. Here he's# picture#d blabbing his mouth while warring his top hat, describing how he came to invent the stone wheel.\<br></br>When you were a teenager, did you ever aim a video camera at a TV screen showing what that camera saw? What you end up with is a mind-boggling feedback loop: a #picture# within a #picture# within a #picture# into infinity. Ultimately it *returns* you to the same place where you started: just you, represented by a *mouth*, *pent in* your room with your *top hat*, wondering where this all leads.\<br></br>*Pent in* a stylish frame is this abstract# picture# called the *Return* of the *Top Hat*. Unfortunately it was badly damaged and has a gaping *hole* near the top.\<br></br>Pieter bruegel winter landscape - burgers chit-chatting (=*mouth*) in their *top hats*, they soon have to return home because it is so cold.
店	A *fortune teller* goes into a 7-11 #store# and buys a lottery ticket so she can move out of her smelly *cave* (thanks to bodhisamaya).\<br></br>There's this really cool new# store# called the *Fortune Teller's* *Cave*, which sells all kinds of things related to fortune telling.\<br></br>Seven-eleven# store#s are now offering a fortune telling service.\<br></br>Someone once tried to put a *radio*# store# in a *cave* (so that it would keep cool and they wouldn’t have to spend money on AC), but this was a terrible idea, because none of the radios get any reception! Hence, I never go to the *radio*# store# located in the *cave*; I go to Radio Shack instead.\<br></br>The lady who *tells fortunes* decided to open her new fortune-telling# store# in a *cave* next to Batman's.
庫	Bruce Wayne keeps the bat car in a cave, not a# WAREHOUSE#.\<br></br>The bat *car* is kept in a# warehouse# built into the bat *cave*.\<br></br>Have you ever worked in a# warehouse#? It's like a giant metal cave. Watch out for that forklift! (thanks to dizzwave).\<br></br>See the cave with all the cars driving around bringing crates hither and thither. That is the# warehouse# that holds the lost ark, the Roswell alien, and all sorts of things.
褲	Can't help thinking of that short film Wallace and Gromit - the Wrong #Trousers#, which is about a pair of robot legs. I'm imagining someone going to work wearing a *cloak* to hide their metal #trousers#. Once they get to the *warehouse* they work at, they use them to reach high boxes - no need for a forklift.\<br></br>You must find a pair of# TROUSERS# inside of a WAREHOUSE full of COATS.\<br></br>I'm reminded of Edna from the movie The Incredibles, where she convinces Bob to wear# trousers# instead of a *cape*. This would be especially true in a loaded *warehouse*, where a cape can get you stuck easily.\<br></br>Garment + batcave, refers to the spandex tights or pants that Batman and Robin wore.\<br></br>It takes a long time to find the perfect pair of# TROUSERS# in a warehouse full of clothing.\<br></br>You're in a huge *warehouse* looking for #trousers#, but there are none to be seen. Instead, you find a *cloak*.
廠	Spacious cave, the secret Japanese# factory# in Bond's "You only live twice".\<br></br>Nowdays a good# factory# (simplified to 厂) is well covered and tall like a *cliff*. But traditionally it is an *extensive* 广 cave, protecting the *spacious* place of the *esteemed* *taskmaster*.\<br></br>Iran's nuclear warhead# FACTORY# is located in a spacious cave.\<br></br>There's a# factory# built into the bat *cave* where Bruce Wayne makes his goodies. It is very *spacious* as he needs to be able to do test drives there.\<br></br>The# factory# is in a #spacious# *cave* because it is secret and to protect it from air raids.
床	Just imagine collecting soft *tree* branches with lots of leaves on, to use as a soft #bed# in a hard cold cave.\<br></br>#Bed#s evolved from primitive man sleeping on planks of wood in caves.\<br></br>Bruce Wayne does not sleep in a# bed#. He hangs from a *tree* in his bat *cave*.\<br></br>In the Jungle Book, the bear liked to make a *tree* his# bed#, but bears usually sleep in *caves*. They can't have both; they have to choose.\<br></br>The *tree* is sleeping in her #bed#, inside a *cave*.
麻	In traditional Taiwanese kai font, the trees are written with *human legs* primitive. Story: Imagine going to the local *woods* with your friends to smoke #hemp#. You find a warm cave, and starting blazing away until the trees all look like they have *human legs* instead of branches. Woah man..heavy..\<br></br>To avoid detection by the authorities, your friend is growing marijuana plants, which look like little *trees*, in a *cave*. They will be cultivated and turned into #hemp#.\<br></br>Smoke some# hemp# and retreat to the caves and forests of the primordial psyche.
心	A# heart# has four chambers, which corresponds with the four strokes in this character. Three of them are dots, while the bottom one has a curve and a hook to better illustrate the shape.\<br></br>Just memorize this - it's quite common!
忘	You only truly# forget# your girlfriend when she has * deceased* in your *heart*. (thanks to dingomick).\<br></br>A widow comes up to you and says, “I can never #forget# that my husband is *deceased*, as it weighs on my *heart* every day.” Indeed, this character shows his *‘deceased’* status on top of her *‘heart’,* weighing it down and causing the pain that makes his loss impossible to #forget#.
忍	A ninja must be able to# endure# the pain of clinging to a ceiling, motionless, for hours at a time, waiting for just the right moment to drop down and thrust the *blade* of his sword into the *hearts* of his enemies. By the way, this character is used in the compound 忍者 (*ninja*) which is why you should use *ninja* as its primitive meaning. (thanks to matticus).\<br></br>Those who can# endure# a *blade* to their *heart* can# endure# anything.\<br></br>Saint Sebastian is depicted in many paintings with numerous arrows stuck in his body. To remember this character, imagine that the *blades* of those many arrows were shot down from above and pierced his *heart*, and that he not only #endured# that pain, but he even ran an #endurance# race with the arrows still in his heart.
認	Some words are forgotten as soon as they are said, but other *words* #endure# for generations. You# recognize# them when you hear them.\<br></br>One night on the way to bed you hear a whispered japanese haiku behind you. You #recognize# this as the *words* of the *ninja*, who is behind you about to stab you in the *heart* with his *blade*.\<br></br>In psychanalyse, you# recognize# your past sufferings : you put words on what you have endured.\<br></br>Words are just words; but until you've *endur*ed what they actually *say*, you wouldn't recognise what it means.\<br></br>Simplified #认# - blind people can# recognize# a #person# from their #words# ........ #voice recognition# is something we all use.\<br></br>You# recognize# the power of words once you *endure* balancing a giant *dictionary* on your head for an hour.\<br></br>Simplified-[认]-[794]: The boors *words* of *Mr T* and its catchphrases are one of his most memorable features that make him easy to #recognize#.
志	This *soldier's*# aspiration# is to get a *heart*, just like the Tin Woodman from Wizard of Oz.\<br></br>The# aspiration# of an aspiring officer is to prove the value of his heart / spirit.\<br></br>James Blunt - a *solder* with a big *heart*, who had #aspirations# to become a famous singer!\<br></br>If your# aspiration# is to become a *soldier*, you must not be afraid to put a bullet through your enemy's *heart*.
誌	The# annals# record the *words* of people's #aspirations#.\<br></br>The *words* of James Blunt (*solder* with a big *heart*) wont exactly go down in the# annals# of history. Have you heard his lyrics, they're terrible. But he's very anal about them..(anal / annal - gettit?).\<br></br>The strangest# annals# you ever read were the *words* of a *soldier* written on his *heart*. Literally! After a heart transplant he took a permanent marker and wrote a chronological history of his life on his former heart—something he had the aspiration to do for a long time. [I include ‘aspiration’ here as a reminder of the stroke order of ‘soldier’ and ‘heart’.].\<br></br>The# annals# of history are merely the aspirational words of the ruling classes, said Mr. Marx.\<br></br>Tacitus wrote the #Annals# of the Roman Empire. It is the *aspiration* of many college freshmen to read these *words*.
思	Imagine #considering# dumping your girlfriend - you love her, but the relationship just isn't working right. *brain* or *heart*, which should you go with? Eventually you make a list of things to #consider#, and you make a decision - to go with your *brain over your heart*.\<br></br>Part of each “Bill Nye the Science Guy” show was a segment called ‘consider the following’. The scientific information in this segment filled my *brain* with facts, but it also filled my *heart* with a love for science.\<br></br>When# consider#ing something, you need to apply balance to *brain* vs *heart*. (Here u're# consider#ing whether u should get the Mitsubishi; from the old ad line: please# consider#...).
意	When you get a good #idea# you get excited and you can hear the *sound* of your *heart*, it's pounding so hard. (thanks to onsen_monkey).\<br></br>Sound: yi4: Imagine that when a *Japanese* (stands for 4th tone in my stories) electronics firm has a great# idea# for a new product (like the original Walkman, or the Wii), all the executives channel their inner child and go “Yiiiii!”.\<br></br>At the sound of the bell struck by the Zen master, an# idea# arises from the heart of the disciple.\<br></br>When you have an inspiring# idea#, you can hear the voice (*sound*) of *heart* that convinces you to go for it.\<br></br>Whenever I have an# idea#, a little "ding!" sound goes off in my heart.\<br></br>The stethoscope (used for listening to the *sound* of your thumping *heart*) was definitely a great# idea#.\<br></br>#Idea# comes and stands in your mind. Is this Cartesian or Kantian?
想	This hazni describes being in love! when you love *one another*, you #think# about the person all day, and whenever you #think# of them your *heart* starts pounding like crazy. great isnt it!\<br></br>Imagine your wise father walking into the operating room where you and your girlfriend/boyfriend are lying down and saying,# think# before you exchange *one another’s* *hearts* in a transplant. When you do# think# about it, you realize that giving *one another* your *hearts* is actually pretty dumb and not as romantic as you thought, so you promptly follow your dad out the door.\<br></br>Winnie the Pooh. he likes to: "think# think## think## think#". he is considerate of *one another* and full of *heart*.
息	Imagine taking a long deep #breath# in through your *nose*, and feeling the oxygen coursing around your body and into your *heart*. Mmmm, feels good!\<br></br>As a top athlete who needs to stay atop the competition, you choose to undergo a novel medical procedure in which a pipe is installed in your body that takes each# breath# of air directly from your *nose* to your *heart* to give you extra oxygen. It’s not illegal yet!
恐	I #fear# my boss at *work* - he always shouts at me, saying im an *ordinary* worker and my work is too *ordinary*. Everytime he enters our office, my *heart* starts pounding..\<br></br>Im such a nerd, my biggest# fear# that my *work* is *ordinary* it disturbs me to my *heart*.\<br></br>You work as a toll booth operator, a job you find terribly dull. You say to yourself each day, “I# fear# that if I do *work* this *ordinary* any longer, my *heart* will stop out of boredom.”.\<br></br>Ordinary people have the most mundane, ordinary# fear#s in their hearts-- their# fear#s are all about work!\<br></br>I# fear# that at *work* I'm just an average, *ordinary* *worker* because my *work* isn't my passion (I'm not following my *heart*).\<br></br>You should not# fear# anything for your health as long as you practice regularly your *heart* through daily *work* as an *ordinary* task like brushing your teeth.
感	Raver takes an XTC pill - "Man I #feel# so much love in this room, I just watch to touch everyone with my loving *heart*. I# FEEL# GREAT!". then he has a *heart* attack..\<br></br>Everybody has# feel#ings in their heart.\<br></br>Simplified :# feel# good about your #heart# – eat less #salty# foods.\<br></br>*Everybody* needs somebody to love with all their *heart*, so they can# feel# alive.\<br></br>I# feel# like vomiting at the sight of all the "I (*heart*) Backstreet Boys" shirts that *everybody* is wearing at the Backstreet Boys march.\<br></br>“Some people say great God come from the sky take away everything and make *everybody*# feel# high, but if you know what life is worth, you will look for yours on earth (home is where the *heart* is).” - Bob Marley.\<br></br>How you# FEEL# at an *event* that *everybody* attends is how much they all participate together, how much their *hearts* are into it.
憾	Let the left primitive = *Commander Data from Star Trek*. You know, cos he has a logical blank *state of mind*. Story: *Data* *feels*# regret# for stealing the human *emotion* chip. He yanks it out, so he doesn't have to *feel* anymore. Then his# regret# is gone so he puts it back in.. Then he takes it out. This could go on for a while, couldn't it? (thanks to Shibo).\<br></br>You are watching an interview of someone who tried to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge (but lived). He says to the reporter, “as I fell off the bridge, I felt deep# regret# that I never told anyone how I *felt* when I was in a suicidal *state of mind*.”.
憂	As a king you have always been# worried# about the structural integrity of your castle; it seems very unsafe after 1,000 years. Your worries are confirmed when one day in the dining room, a piece of the *ceiling* falls off and breaks your *nose*. You look up and another piece falls on your *crown* and knocks it off. You are suddenly so# worried# that you have a *heart* attack, which cripples your *walking legs* due to the lack of blood flow.\<br></br>Imagine a melancholy old king, suffering from depression. With his *head* bowed, and his *crown* held over his *heart* (to hide his feelings) he walks (on *walking legs*) around the palace making everyone see how sad he is. Everybody is #worried# about him (thanks to rizzo).\<br></br>The *crown* prince and his sweet *heart* are on their *summer* vacation free of all #worries# except the papparrazzis hounding them..\<br></br>Simplified #忧# : My doctor said that I had a #remarkable heart# - it was just the rest of me that I had to be# worried# !\<br></br>Think of King Joffrey: Arrogant (*nose* at the *ceiling*) and with getting the *crown*, his *heart* ran away (*walking legs*).\<br></br>Simplified 忧. if your *life giving heart* is doing something *remarkable*, then it is time to be# worried#. Traditionally in Taiwan, if you use your *head/page* instead of claw to pick your *love* you should be# worried#.\<br></br>Simplified 忧# Worried# = *Data/state of mind*, *frankenpooch*. Story: *Data* is# worried# that his pet *frankenpooch* won't get along with the other dogs.\<br></br>It's *summer* and you are# worried# when you come home to your air-conditioned apartment to find someone has left a human *heart* and *crown* under your air-conditioner. Who could it have been? Time to use those *walking legs* and get the hell out of there!
怕	While normal humans turn *white* with# dread#, *Data* is always *white* - so it looks like he's in serious# dread# (like he's just seen a ghost) 24/7.\<br></br>#Dread# is the *state of mind* in which you turn *white* in fear—*Data* experienced this when he saw a giant *dove*.\<br></br>Data is usually passive and unmoved but the one thing he# dread#s more than anything is the white powder cocaine. It is with cocaine that his human buddies, those genius wizards he works with on the Enterprise, become alien and horrible to him.

One person's *genius* allows him to earn a lot of #riches#, as often represented by *shells*. That in turn lets the next generation get a higher education, find their *genius*, which leads to more #riches#. See <a href="/study/kanji/51">shellfish</a> <span class="index">(#51)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/578">genius</a> <span class="index">(#578)</span>.\<br></br>The *genius* with tree chopping idea now earned many *seashells*.\<br></br>The# riches# of Nobel Prize are *shells* given for bing a *genius*.\<br></br>In the past, the path to# riches# was imagined to be a *genie* who could offer you a mountain of *clams*. But in the U.S., the path to# riches# is often having a *genius* for computers, or baseball, or corporate management, that still gets you many *clams*. But often those *clams* are located on the West Coast, in California (which is why *clams* is on the left here).
存	The only way to# DEPOSIT# a GENIE IN A BOTTLE into the bottle is to put him in there when he is a CHILD.\<br></br>A villager on a little remote island one day finds a *bottle* washed out by the sea onto the beach. After wiping the bottle and taking a closer look, he is amazed to see a (very small) *child* in it. The villagers supposes that the *child* is a *genie in a bottle*, and must be very valuable - so he immediately takes it to his bank and #desposits# it in a security box, for safe keeping! (thanks to fuaburisu).\<br></br>A *child* found a bottle and was headed to the supermarket to redeem the 5 cent #deposit#, but he accidentally rubbed it and out came a *genie in a bottle*!\<br></br>You make a# deposit# by reserving *on the side* for when you are old *walking stick* and your *children*.\<br></br>the child is learning from the genius figure skater, it is costing the parents a fortune, they hope the# deposit# will pay off later.\<br></br>Imagine that you are the head babysitter at “*Genius* for *Children* babysitters”. Many parents# deposit# their children into your care when they go see a movie or have a romantic dinner, since you have a *genius* for taking care of *children*.
在	A *genie in a bottle* usually causes a lot of trouble. The best location to keep the bottle# at# is buried in the *soil*, so we can all be# at# peace.\<br></br>Imagine that your brother is “at peace” in his life. His *genius* for semiconductor manufacturing has earned him a small fortune, allowing him to put that *genius* off to the left and just relax on the *ground*. Where exactly is he# at# peace?# At# an exclusive 5-star beach hotel.\<br></br>Where you# at# (said in a dark alley)? On the *ground*, *by your side*...holding a big, walking *stick*. 8th most common Hanzi.\<br></br>Villager from previous frame retrieves the *bottle* from his safety *deposit* box, but now it's just full of *soil*. Where's the *child* #at#?? Did it even #exist# in the first place, or was it a figment of his imagination??\<br></br>Where you# at# (said in a dark alley)? In swoops your helpful Genie to save the day - and you, by smashing your opponents to the *ground* (thx jsnyder).\<br></br>People skate# at# (on) the ground.
乃	First *clench your fist*, and# only then# punch'em.\<br></br>Put boxing gloves over your *fist*, and# only then# are you allowed to enter a boxing ring. (*fist* primitive: imagine that someone brags that their *fist* can produce hooked *strokes* (the first stroke of fist) at 33 miles an hour – 33 because that’s what the second stroke sort of looks like.).\<br></br>Imagine your mate who's a boxer and good with his *fists* telling you about a fight he got into. "I flattened these 10 guys, and #only then# did i realise they were secret service agents, and black belts in karate! so i legged it!".\<br></br>When physically attacked,# only then# may you responds with *fists*.
奶	A *woman* using her *fists* to take #milk# from her breasts and putting it into a feeding bottle.\<br></br>When you take# milk# from a cow you make a fist, we're not quite that forceful taking# milk# from woman.\<br></br>So that her baby can drink her# milk# in safety and peace, a *woman* punches away all the intruders in her residence with her *fists*.\<br></br>Our *boxer* has a secret to using his *fists* well - he buys and then drinks *womens* breast #milk#! it makes his *fists* stronger and allows him to punch harder.\<br></br>A *woman* must wait for the onset of lactation and #only then# she becomes a mother who can start feeding her newborn with its breast*milk*.\<br></br>Lactation when they get as hard as fists.
及	Fist turns to outstretched hands as the extremists# catch up with# changed realities and embrace their earstwhile enemies. When people# catch up with# reality they always go from fists to reaching out.\<br></br>As you finally *catch up with* the toddler running away, you *reach out* to the littl'un who shakes the fists (doesn't want to be caught).\<br></br>This is the shoryu-ken from street fighter! You're behind in a game but if you land on of these, you'll surely #catch up#.\<br></br>A *pregnant woman* needs to #extend# her *crotch legs* (with an extra stroke) to #catch up with# everyone else and #reach# her destination. #and#. 260 most common.\<br></br>Consider 585 "suck in" when defining this primitive. First of all, it looks like a fist. A macho wrestler has this finishing move: he uses his powerful mouth to suck in tons of air like a vacuum cleaner, also sucking his opponent in towards him. As the opponent flies in at high speed, the wrestler just holds his fist out until the opponent catches up to him and slams into the fist, for the knockout!
吸	Breathing exercise: #inhale# with your *mouth* wide open while your *hands are outstretched*.\<br></br>Imagine that for a newborn baby to# inhale#, the doctor has to first pry open its *mouth* with *outstretched hands*.\<br></br>Imagine the *boxer who's had a stroke* from the previous frame, desperate for a cigarette. *mouth* open, *arms reaching out* for that cancer stick, wanting to #suck in# / #inhale# that cool sweet smoke.
史	Imagine cheating on your #history# test by hiding a little *mouth* *tucked in under your arm*, which whispers the facts to you.\<br></br>This is like 100 Chinese inches, but with a mouth. When an old person tells a story, the report of what comes out of their mouth could definitely be 100 Chinese inches long.\<br></br>#HISTORY# is a voice from the past, a MOUTH in the form of a book, TUCKED UNDER THE ARM.\<br></br>He found a *mouth* *tucked under his arm*, and the rest is# history#.
更	You've been partying all day, until the *sun* sets beneath the *horizon* and it grows late. But you want to keep going, so you tuck your bottle of vodka *under your arm* to hide it, and go into the nearby club for #even more# drunken crazy partying!!\<br></br>Primitive = #Mrs T#.

硬	Viagra commercial: "Get *stone*# hard#! and have *even more* endurance than when you were a teenager!".\<br></br>Stones are the# hard#est naturally occuring objects on earth, you can't go even more than that.\<br></br>Someone who can’t hear very well can be described as “hard of hearing”. Well, a *stone* is *even more*# hard# of hearing than someone who is# hard# of hearing!\<br></br>Breaking rocks into *stones* is# hard# work, and there will be *even more* tomorrow, as you have a life sentence with# hard# labour.\<br></br>Remember the #hard# labor while grinding away the flour with the mill*stone*. Ease now this #hard# work ! And It is *even more* true if you substitute your# hard# work with an animal or a water wheel.\<br></br>You're still partying and want *even more* fun, but you're starting to tire..until someone offers you a *rock* of crack. It looks like and feels #hard# like a little *stone*..it's #hard to say no..what happens next is up to your imagination.\<br></br>Even more stones means even more fossilization means even# hard#er.

Second def: A# friend# is "at your right hand side".\<br></br>A# friend# is someone whose *right hand* is always *by your side* -- to give you encouragement, support, etc.
雙	A# pair# of turkeys pecking my crotch. Thanks hissatsu!\<br></br>Here we have a# pair# of *two turkeys* who are joined to each other at the *right hand* (or in this case, the right wing). In other words, they are Siamese turkeys. Picture it and you’ll recognize how hard life must be for these poor turkeys, who must indeed be a# pair# for life!\<br></br>Simplified #双# : Those lovestuck lovers are a# pair# - their #crotches# are inseperable !
隻	One turkey of a pair still pecking my crotch.\<br></br>This character shows part of a family photo, which I'll explain. One turkey is sufficient for most Christmas dinners, but your family gathering will be so large this year that you will need two. So here we see you holding only# one of a pair# of *turkeys* for your Christmas dinner in your *right hand*, with your spouse (not shown) holding the other, and a relative taking a photo of the two of you.
護	Let the right primitive mean *parrot*. Just imagine a tropical bird with bright ploomage like a *flower*, the body of a tiny *turkey*, and bald crotch, like a chimpanzee or baboon. Story: We need to# protect# this rare breed of *parrot*, as they're so *talkative* - *words* fly out of their mouths 24/7.\<br></br>There are laws to# protect# *birds of paradise*, but they are mere *words* on paper. In reality, poachers are still hunting the poor birds.\<br></br>Simplified-[护]-[899]:# Protect# your privacy - deter cold callers - when the next unwelcome peddlar proffers his #finger# to your #door# bell just imagine their surprise when they realize you've connected it up to the grid - shock and awe.....\<br></br>The first amendment #protects# the *words* of your *bird of paradise* (who happens to say some very non-PC things) as it guarantees freedom of speech.\<br></br>Let the right primitive be a rare, endangered bird-- a dodo (pretend some still exist...) The words of the law# protect# the endangered dodo.\<br></br>Simplified-[护]-[899]: Edward Scissor*fingers* doesn't need extra precautionary to avoid his *fingers* being pinched in the *doors*.

觀	In our country, you can# observe# *storks* everywhere. But it's also the other way around. Perched on his nest high up on a pole, the *stork* can *see* everyone for miles around.\<br></br>Most people see *storks* carrying children just as the baby has been born. But you are in a special #observe#-atory that has a very powerful telescope that lets you# observe# *storks* (that is, *see* the *storks* through the telescope) far, far away, many years before they arrive. In other words, at the observatory, you can see newborn babies, perhaps even your own, many years before they are even born!\<br></br>At a Wildlife sanctuary - We've taken this *stork* in to# observe# him. He keeps crashing into trees and the ground - we don't think he can *see* properly! We'll keep him under #observation# for a week, then he'll be let go or put down.\<br></br>Simplified [观] - A perve on the# observe# – #CROTCH SEE#-ing.\<br></br>Let the left primitive be a phoenix-- a wise, mystical bird very different from the Dodo.

投	Picture an anti-American dictator (your choice) who relaxes by #throwing# tiny *missiles* with his *fingers* at a flag of the U.S.\<br></br>Imaging being at the back of a boring Science class, and using your *fingers* to #throw# a paper *missle* at the heads of the next rows. You kind of pull your *finger* back like a catapult, and let go - PING - it's a new school craze.\<br></br>Edward Scissor*fingers* has enhanced his mechanical hands by allowing him to #throw# his *fingers* like deadly flying *missile*.

The leader Kim Jong Eun is crying (*tears*) because does# not have# his *missiles* any more.\<br></br>We will# not have# any fireworks this New Year because all the *missiles* we have are *water*logged.
設	All the countries of the world call a conference, to have *words* and #establish# rules governing nuclear *missles*. N.Korea *says* NO!\<br></br>In order to #establish# the peace, *words* have proven to be very inefficient. Instead, nuclear *missile* are more effective than *words*.\<br></br>To# establish# guilt, a prosecutor must break through any lies the defendant is telling. This character shows the prosecutor #establishing# guilt by firing *missiles* at the defendant’s false and misleading *words* until they are destroyed and guilt is clearly #established#.\<br></br>To# establish# a new world order will need *words* backed by nuclear *missiles*.
股	The# thigh# is the best *part of the body* for absorbing the impact of *missles*. Remember when someone chucked a stone or tennis ball at you at school? I used to get my leg up high and let it hit my #thigh#..didn't hurt then.\<br></br>Imagine throwing the chicken #thighs# your mother has cooked you for lunch during a food fight at school, effectively turning the chicken #thighs# into *missiles* of *flesh*.\<br></br>Imagine sprinters competing in the Olympics.

To remember *branch*, imagine falling from the top of a tree, and hitting your *crotch* *ten* times on the way down..ouch!\<br></br>Wait, what is that *ten* inch# offshoot# coming out of her *crotch*?\<br></br>You worked for “Quality Oil Rigs” but agreed to transfer to a new# offshoot# of the company, “Motherland Oil Rigs”, that is based in Uzbekistan.

Primitive: BRANCH.
技	Someone with big *fingers* showing off his# skill# of using *branches* as chopsticks.\<br></br>Balancing a *branch* on your *finger* is the prototypical example of a# skill# that is nothing more than a# skill# (i.e., it is completely useless).

叔	My (paternal older)# uncle# is a creepy pervert who towers *above* the *little* ones while touching his *crotch*. *Creepy# uncle#* will be the primitive from now on.\<br></br>Building on raharney: #Uncle# Joe (Stalin) is saluting for the news media, *right hand* raised *above* a comically *small* podium.\<br></br>Imagine a grisly news broadcast of a violent# uncle# who was found sitting *above* the *small* *right hand* of his nephew, which the television zooms in on (so that a *small* object is shown under the# uncle#, but the zoomed-in picture of the *right hand* is on the right of the screen, with the# uncle# on the left). Only an# uncle#, and never a parent, could do such an awful thing, you imagine.\<br></br>Think about #Uncle# Joe, aka Staline. He thinks about himself as greater and *above* all men. Maybe a way to compensate its *small* size: 1m60. Furthermore he was not called the iron man (Stahl-ine) for nothing. It was because of his balls of steel in his *crotch*.\<br></br>Above, small, right hand: Think of# Uncle# Joe (Stalin) saluting on the podium, right hand raised, looking up but what petty nastiness lurks underneath.

The loneliness of the long distance tyrant.
反	To keep in sync with the kanji site, lets make this a new primitive - *Clint Eastwood*, the *Anti-hero*.

板	You have been captured by pirates who force you to walk the# plank#. But you’re close enough to the shore that you just lean the# plank# *against* a *tree* and run back to safety from the ship. Stupid pirates!\<br></br>*Clint Eastwood the anit-hero* uses his illegal tactics again - he makes a criminal walk the #plank# (or at least a piece of *wood*) to extract information.\<br></br>Trees are against the making# plank#s of wood they are very against this...if only they could rise up and rail against the injustice of it.....\<br></br>*Trees* protest *against* being chopped down for# plank#s of wood.\<br></br>What is a# plank#?

Imagine him weaving all over the *road* in his car, slamming the criminal into the sides and roof to soften him up even more..\<br></br>Driving on the road, realising that you are going against the traffic...you are going the wrong way and you have to# go back#..\<br></br>Tom went to the supermarket to get a gallon of milk but forgot to get doughnuts!

脈	Veins are the flesh's tributaries, carrying blood to the heart from the rest of the body.\<br></br>Continuing from last frame - the *part of the body* that gets injured when you get *dragged* by a *motorcycle gang* is your #blood vessels# - they end up all burst, and your face and eyes go red.\<br></br>Imagine your doctor tells you about a potentially fatal disease you have: your# blood vessels# are filled with tiny *bandanas* made out of *flesh* that could form a giant knot in your heart and kill you.

爪	The character makes me think of a dreaded# Claw# Volcano, with the first stroke being smoke coming out of the top, and the second, third and fourth strokes being the left, middle and right of the volcano, making the whole mountain look like a giant smoky# claw#.\<br></br>Pictograph of a big# claw# - kind of like Vega's from Street Fighter 2.

Just make sure to *pluck* this# vegetable# out of the ground before *flowers* appear out of those *flower* buds; otherwise, you’ll have a decorative item, not a# vegetable#! [Actually, you'll still have a# vegetable#, and I'm not sure when to pluck the broccoli out of the ground; this story is only here to help you learn Hanzi, not gardening nor botany!].\<br></br>Pluck the flowers to find the# vegetable#s.
受	Let *birdhouse* primitive = * whorehouse* (makes for better stories!). Story: This *whorehouse* is filthy and will #accept# any *crotch*, even ones with STDs. yuck! (thanks to gorgon).\<br></br>Your beloved pet parrot tells you it is time for him to go to Panama after living with you for 20 years. You tearfully# accept# the *birdhouse* he has made into your *right hand* (it’s his parting gift), a sign of your# accept#ance that it’s time for him to move on in life, and then wave him goodbye with your left hand.\<br></br>You feel true <a href="/study/kanji/619">love</a> <span class="index">(#619)</span> (let top *claw* + *crown* be primitive for *love*) for a friend, but if your friend is just a *crotch* to you then you #accept# not love.\<br></br>The vultures in the *birdhouse* have not been fed for a while, so they will# accept# any flesh, even someone's *right hand*.

Said another way, the wind can #confer# upon you the privilege of going with it. You merely need to *accept* its direction by raising one *finger*.\<br></br>At the brothel they accept any crotch and# confer# you the privilege of doing disgusting things with your finger as well.\<br></br>Edward Scissor*fingers* cannot be #confered# of dirty habits because his decency prevents him from going to the *whorehouse*.
愛	The man is about to enter a '*birdhouse*' (brothel) when he remembers his true #love# at home, and, has a change of *heart*, so uses his *walking legs* to go straight to meet her. (thanks to szreter).\<br></br>To# love# someone, you don’t need a fancy *birdhouse* (symbolizing material possessions). You don’t need rock-solid *walking legs* (symbolizing a great body). All you need is a *heart*.
雄	Makes me think of that Monty Python sketch - "nudge nudge wink wink". Imagine the guy *elbowing* his reluctant drinking partner in the *side* and saying "phwoar, what's that you got there, a *Turkey*? Bet you and your wife are going to have a #grand# time with that tonight eh, nudge nudge wink wink say no more..".\<br></br>You’re at Carnegie Hall, playing the# grand# finale of your concerto on the# grand# piano, when suddenly you discover a turkey *by your side* who is pecking the keys. You *elbow* the *turkey* out of the way so it doesn’t interfere with your beautiful music. The PETA members in the audience don’t think your gesture is too# grand# . . .\<br></br>For the #grand# opening of the new super-*turkey*-market, the *turkey'* mascot welcomes you with all the employees by his *side* sticking their *elbows* together in a row at the main entrance.\<br></br>it means "pistallate". So imagine a strutting male turkey elbowing people out of the way to get to the lady turkeys (who stop and sit down).
台	Be careful standing on the #platform# at a station in #Taiwan# (this hanzi can also mean Taiwan). It's so busy and everyone is in such a rush, that you're likely to regularly get an *elbow* in the *mouth*. In fact the only way to counter this is to wear high #platform# shoes, so you're out of everyones way.\<br></br>On holidays in Taiwan you attend a fitness session with the teacher in front of you standing on a #platform# so that everyone can see her moves. She is shouting at you with her *mouth* the first move: 1. 2. Raise your *elbow*! Higher !
治	Taiwan would love to# govern# their own *wet platform* (the island) forever.\<br></br>I also use "platform" to mean Taiwan. Those across the waters from Taiwan would love to be the ones# govern#ing it.\<br></br>Imagine the water is on the brow of the person# govern#ing. He is standing on a platform trying to address all of the people in his power fully aware that if he is bad at his job, the people will rise up and tear down the platform like a flood. This is what it feels like every day to# govern#.\<br></br>Sound: zhi4 The *Japanese* lawyer Phoenix Wright knows that there’s no #Zhi#-ry (Jury) in the courtroom, meaning that the judge #governs# who wins or loses the case.

去	Imagine a soap powder commercial - "you want those *soil* stains on your clothes to #GO# - no need for *elbow* grease like scrubbing, just use SOIL# GO# powder"! from now on, this will mean *soap powder*.\<br></br>said the gravedigger as he shoveled SOIL onto the body's protruding ELBOW, the last bit left to cover. (thanks to Katsuo).\<br></br>Here is a man who knows what it means to “go broke.” Some people are merely ‘up to their arms’ in debt, but this poor guy is in so much debt that the debt (pictured here as *soil*) has risen over his *elbows*. All he can do is yell “I’d like to file for bankruptcy!” before the debt swallows his head too. (Inspired by myoshiquick, who says “thanks to Katsuo”).
法	Continuing from last frame - the #method# of using the *soap powder* is simple! Just *wet* clothes with *water*, then add cleaner to make *soil* stains *GO*!\<br></br>Imagine a dam. It's a# method# to make water go where you want it to.\<br></br>One# method# to remember the hanzi for *France* is to imagine a beautiful mademoiselle ..... your thoughts go too *fa* .....dirty,naughty thoughts .....pour cold #water# over yourself and make your *dirty elbow jerking* thoughts #go#.\<br></br>You use your *elbow* and some *soil* to plug a hole in the dam. Hey, it's one #method# for keeping the *water* away.\<br></br>Over the centuries, the Dutch have perfected their# method# to make the *water* *go* (and stay) away.\<br></br>In the past, the best# method# people had for immigrating into the United States was to *go* by *water* (in a big boat). Now the best# method# is to fly above that water in an A380, but this character reminds us of our seafaring past.\<br></br>Do you feel it's hard to find a# method# to remember this hanzi? 灋 (fa3) also means law, 㳒 (fa3) also. Three glass of WATER and SOIL soup is the diet# METHOD# to shrink your FAt ass. (fa3).
至	An arrogant East German general remarks to the media regarding the Berlin *wall*, “until the end of time, this *wall* will stand over the *soil* of Germany!” But Freiheit prevailed and the *wall* stood over the *soil* merely# until# around 1990. [By the way: to remember *wall*, I think of the horizontal line being the top edge of a long wall that’s under construction, with an elbow there to hammer in the last few nails.].\<br></br>I'm actually scared to have sex or look at porn. You see, when I *climax* it keeps going and going #until# the *wall* if covered in "stuff" and I've *soiled* myself..(thanks to playadom ). (from now on let this primitive mean *climax* / *orgasm*).\<br></br>The *ground* extends# until# it meets the *wall*.\<br></br>The nights are scary, so# until# dawn I hide within the *walls* of my home, terrified of the unspeakable things outside crawling over the *soil*.\<br></br>Imagine a woman sitting on a protrusion# until# she reaches climax (this character can also mean to reach or arrive).
室	A# room# is the place in a *house* where little kids have to stay *until* their parents let them out.\<br></br>Couple are making out till you shout "oh for god sake, get a #room#". So they take your advice, go *home* and *climax* all night..\<br></br>Imagine your spouse wants to have an eco-room in your new *house*, which this character shows. The *wall* is made out of organic bamboo, the *roof* and chimney over the# room# will be made of glass to let the sun in, and the floor will be *soil*, so you can be with nature all the time.
	Alternate: you save money in The Sims by building# room#s that are simply *roofs* and *walls*, with merely *soil* for the floor.
室	Reaching climax from the comfort and privacy of your# room# (in your house, of course!).

The departing soldiers have to wait UNTIL their replacements# ARRIVE# #dao#(wn) Pall Mall with their SABRES drawn - they're so sweet. Elroy thinks they have an empty milk bottle strapped to their inside leg in case they can't wait no longer...\<br></br>“Arrive on time,” your extremely intimidating doctor tells you, “or I will poke you with my *saber* *until* you have to go to the emergency room!” [Sorry for another grisly story, everyone.].
互	Imagine your financial advisor tells you about a “great# mutual# fund that has *wall*-to-*wall* coverage of the S&P 500!” What he’s actually saying is that this fund has the top *Wall* Street companies to invest in, but also the bottom *Wall* Street companies; *two* halves (note the top and bottom stroke) of the market.\<br></br>Write it a few times - it's so symmetrical, you easily memorise it from the unusual stroke order.
充	Imagine attaching a brand new pair of adult sized *human legs* to a tiny *infant*. Ok so they're a bit big but they should be# sufficient# - anyway he'll grow into them.\<br></br>Once an infant has grown legs, that's# sufficient#, they can take care of themselves now.\<br></br>For an *infant* having *human legs* is not# sufficient#. He also needs his arms to crawl around.\<br></br>When an *infant* can walk on their *human legs* they are self# sufficient#.\<br></br>Let tophat on elbow = *educated*. If you are *educated* enough to control *human legs* below. that is #sufficient# to #fill# basic duties.
育	You and your partner are a vegan, so naturally you #bring up# and #educate# your *infant* from birth not to ever want to eat the *flesh* of an animal.\<br></br>If we gave *infants* health# education# at an early age, teaching these *infants* not to put excess *flesh* on their body, then maybe we could begin to solve the obesity crisis going on in the U.S.\<br></br>Think of Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal-- it's a very# education#al piece that we even learn about in school as part of our# education#. Swift supposedly educates the public that the way to solve problems of poverty is to have the rich eat the flesh of infants!\<br></br>To check the quality of# education# *infants* have a test every *month*.\<br></br>If your entire *body* is *educated* (covered in# education#), then you have received a full# education#.\<br></br>Sportive #education# allows *infant*s to train their *flesh*es to higher levels in stadiums.

Put a nappy on him to stop the #flow# of urine..yuck, there's so much it's# flow#ing out and making a stream on the bus..\<br></br>Go with the# flow#, they say. Well, that's what *baby Moses* did. He was put in the *water* and went with the# flow# until he was found by the Pharaoh's daughter.\<br></br>Here we have a #flow#-chart from Biblical times. It's very simple: Box 1: take *Baby Moses*. Box 2: put *Baby Moses* in the *water* (in a basket). Box 3: the *water* will# flow# *Baby Moses* to safety.\<br></br>The *water* in an *educated* *river*# flow#s.

Now I'm using a #comb# to fix my hair, but it aint sitting straight...and oh boy the smell...\<br></br>Take the primitive on the right to be "peeing baby." The baby peed so much that it formed a river, and a tree got knocked loose and carried downstream. Fortunately, there was a giant# comb# in the middle of the stream that acted as a sieve that caught the tree.\<br></br>The *trees* in an *flowing*, *educated river* do not disturb the flow, only acting as a# comb#.
山	Imagine that this character shows the world’s three tallest# mountain#s all next to one another: Everest with the first stroke, K2 with the second stroke, and Kangchenjunga as the third. If you have a moment, go on Wiktionary, copy and paste in the character and see how it’s evolved!\<br></br>Pictograph of a #mountain#. You should be able to remember this one.
出	Imagine Gollum from LOTR telling you the way to #exit# Mordor is to go between 2 stacked mountains. (thanks to andresito).
擊	James Bond’s *car* is now atop the *mountain*. To his right is a person about to fire a nuclear *missile* into Kabul. James #beats# him with multiple uppercuts from his *hand*, knocking him unconscious and saving the city from destruction.\<br></br>My special all terrain vehicle (a *car* with tank-tracks that can climb *mountains*) also has a * missile* launcher on top! That# beat#s your car *hands down* (thanks to inuki).\<br></br>Simplified-[击]-[1236]: Once you harvest the corn, it's time to #beat# the *cornstalks* before letting those dry in the *mountains*. This process to obtain fodder, avoids the *cornstalks* to rotten, thanks the shortage of oxygen.\<br></br>I can# beat# anyone in video games. Whether it's a driving game; driving cars up a mountain or launching missiles in a FPS. But my favourite is hand to hand fighting games like street fighter!\<br></br>Simplified-[击]-If you #beat# the the *mountains* down you just get some *soil* above. Traditionally the soil is used for farming *rice fields* and the *weapon* of choice was the *hand*. to hit or strike.
密	Imagine that the American generals believed that Osama Bin Laden’s# secret# *house* was *certainly* in the *mountains* somewhere. Well, imagine that this house was actually built into K2, making it a super-#secret# house that *certainly* only a *mountain* climber could find.\<br></br>My #secret# *house* in the *mountains* will *certainly* be discovered soon - cos the builders made it bright white and neon blue, against a green mountainous backdrop. it stands out a mile - doh!\<br></br>The location of the *house* she bought is still a# secret#, but it's *certainly* on top of a *mountain*.\<br></br>NOTE: 宓 (mì) is a character meaning "still, silent, quiet". In the Arkham Horror boardgame and expansions, one of the most# secret# places is the High House on the Hill, a still place on a mountain.\<br></br>You have prepared for nuclear holocaust by setting up a #secret# hideout (*house*) in the *mountain*s. Nuclear war is a *certainity* but the #secret# has to be preserved at any cost otherwise you want have any place left for yourself in your *house* of *certainity* in the *mountain*.
入	For me it looks like a pictograph of a ladies high-heeled shoe. So imagine a woman in short skirt and *stiletto heels* #entering# a room, making a huge noise and everyone (especially the guys) turning to look!! Draw the heel first, as thats the noisy bit..
內	Error in book; primitive is *belt* as it intersects another primitive - *glass cover* only covers things. Story: For surgeons to access a persons #internal# organs, the best way is to *enter* the body in the area just below your *belt* (i.e. your waist).\<br></br>If you don’t pay your taxes, a man from the (United States)# Internal# Revenue Service who drives a speedy IRS motorcycle will *enter* your residence, take off his motorcycle *helmet* (which is why it’s a little below the top of ‘enter’ here) and demand an explanation. [I find it better to use “glass cover” or “helmet” than “belt”, since the belts in the characters always seem to be pretty short, whereas this covering is long like the other helmets/glass covers we’ve seen.].\<br></br>Simplified-[内]-[840]: Same error in RSH! *glass cover* => *belt* (Thx aphasiac). A *person* needs to develop an abdominal belt* to protect its #internal# organs.\<br></br>Getting access to your# internal# organs can be tricky. Imagine a glass covering over your belly that acted as an entrance to your# internal# organs. It would make operations so much easier!
吶	Continuing from last frame. You scream and #holler# from your wide *mouth* in horror after you wake up on the operating table, your *internal* organs exposed and being rummaged through.\<br></br>Ever hear Janis Joplin# holler#? It comes out of her mouth from deep within. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBJnoMP1Uyc.\<br></br>You scream and# holler# from your *mouth* as *Internal* Revenue Service agent takes you away in handcuffs.\<br></br>PINYIN: nà.\<br></br>Octocat# holler#s until his *insides* come out.
分	I #divide# my birthday cake into *eight* #parts# using a *dagger*. Everyone gets a slice, yay!

And a dagger is not enough to hunt a 鳻 (fen1), does not matter how many (eight?!) dagger you have.
貧	The *eight* famous bandits who robbed all of your *shells* by threatening you with a *dagger* have divided the loot into *eight* *part*s and have left you #impoverished#.\<br></br>The #impoverished# fishermen of southern Taiwan *divide* up all the *shellfish* they've caught that day, and share it out equally amongst them. Sticking together like this is the only way they can make enough *money* to survive, day to day (if one fails to catch anything, they can still take something home).\<br></br>So# impoverished# only have parts of shells (money).\<br></br>It’s good for the government to take *part* of people’s *shells* to help the# impoverished# at home and abroad, as long as what they give them actually helps the poor and their children.\<br></br>We're so# impoverished# we only have one shell for all of us and need to divide it up.

谷	Imagine going to a beautify nature reserve, set in a #valley#. At the *mouth* (enterance) of the #valley#, there's a long walkway covered with an *umbrella* of netting and canvas canopies, to stop *animals* falling on top of you from the mountains either side. As you're walking through, you can hear *animal legs* trampling above..weird/creepy!

慾	The strongest *desire* in any man's *heart* is #lust#.\<br></br>Here we have a man who became a monk; he chose what he *desired* with his *heart* -- poverty, contemplation and communion with God -- instead of the things he merely had# lust# for. [Perhaps helpful for remembering the placement of the primitives: as you imagine "desired with his heart," place your hand over your head for "desired," and then your hand over your heart for heart, a reminder that your brain-centered desires are above your heart, as they are in the character.].\<br></br>Jimmy Carter said to Playboy magazine: "I've looked on a lot of women with# lust#.

Well, that means that you# work as# a guy who dumps the content of *outhouses* onto *rice fields* to boost crop yield.\<br></br>Wondering what to# work as# - in the *outhouse* and racking your *brains*.
檔	If you *work as* a bureaucrat your work requires a lot of# files#, folders and papers. That way you indirectly contribute to the destruction of *trees*.\<br></br>When you *work as* a rice farmer, filing consists of stuffing all your paper-work and #files# into a nearby *tree*. Yep, thats how a farmers filing-system works..\<br></br>Simplified-[#档#] - The #tree acts as# a a repository of# files# - its growth or annual rings are# files# of its age,the years climate. rainfall,sunshine hours......\<br></br>When you *work as* a horticulturalist you keep# files# on *trees*.\<br></br>My whole job is just printing out# files# and putting them in a file cabinet.

黨	The BNP are regarding as a #political party# with *toilet / outhouse* politics. You see, their main objective is to get rid of all *black* people from Britain.\<br></br>A #political party# is like being blocked halfway in the opening hole of a *outhouse*.

Any decent *outhouse*, of course, is a place with a window and a *towel*.\<br></br>Think of the phrase “vote early and vote# often#.” Imagine a guy sitting in an *outhouse* and wearing only a *towel* who is filling out dozens of fake voter registration cards, so he can indeed “vote# often#” for a corrupt candidate.\<br></br>You visit the *outhouse* so# often# that you decide to leave a nice luxury *towel* in there, to wipe your hands, the seats, and other "bits"..
堂	My *outhouse* is a deluxe model - it has a small waiting room which has a sink and towels, and then there's the #main room# for doing your "business" - which consists of a *soil* floor with a hole dug in it..\<br></br>The# main room# and in fact only room of an *outhouse* consists of a hold in the *soil*.
皮	The #covering# on my bed is made from *animal pelt*. It's so thick and fluffy and warm, even on those cold English nights. It gets quite smelly though, so once a week I wash it and then let it dry by hanging it from a *hook* on a nearby *tree-branch*. (For me #covering# is too generic, so from now on this primitive will be *animal pelt*, which this hanzi also means).
波	The typical *covering* for a large body of *water* is, of course,# waves#.\<br></br>The Inuit used *water*-proof seal *pelts* for their kayaks, to travel the# waves#. (thanks to alanj).\<br></br>#Waves# are *water* shaped into *cliffs* that can *support* (<a href="/study/kanji/601">offshoot</a> <span class="index">(#601)</span>) even big ships. notice the offshoot goes trough and becomes part of the cliff. The# waves# are calm in 宁波 Ningbo.
婆	An# old woman# is seen here as a *woman* with *waves* on her face (i.e. wrinkles, creases). (thanks to fuaburisu).\<br></br>An# old woman# hitting the *waves* on her surfboard, trying to impress other *women*.\<br></br>Here we have an# old woman# sitting by the waters of Japan on March 11, 2011. She was tragically, like many others, a *woman* washed under the *waves* of the disastrous tsunami that hit Japan on that day, killing at least 15,867 people. May she and all the other victims rest in peace.
破	Before the invention of scissors or knives, cavemen used sharp *stones* were used to cut /bash the *pelts* off animals. However, they had to be extra-careful - removing the skin takes strikes of great strength, but hit too hard or in the wrong place and the *stone* will #break# through the *pelt*, making a huge hole and rendering it useless. (thanks to johnskb).\<br></br>To# break# or smash in a window use a *stone* covered in *animal pelt* - less damage to the *stone*.\<br></br>Picture yourself #break#dancing in your father’s home office when your shoe #breaks# off some of the colored *stones* that serve as a *covering* for his precious antique mosaic, causing him to #break# out in tears when he comes home.\<br></br>The *stone* wheel of the mill is sensitive to weather change. Thus, every night, the mill*stone* is *covered* with an *animal pelt* to prevent it to crack and finally to #break# up completly.\<br></br>Pelt with stones, rend and# break# it in two, the covering.\<br></br>If my clothes were made from *stone* they could# break# when dropped - lucky they are made from *animal pelt* instead.\<br></br>The *covering* of this house is made up of glass, which means it is easy to# break# by throwing *stones* at it.
被	My bed-#quilt# is made of *animal pelt*, and it's so big and luxuriant, than my girlfriend sometimes wears it on special occasions as a *cloak*.\<br></br>Your church makes a giant “quilt” for the homeless in which people sow together old clothes to make a# quilt#, then cut it up into 100 *coverings* for the homeless on cold winter nights.
歹	The sun has set below the *horizon* in the *evening*, when a guy approaches me holding and chewing on what looks like a *human bone*. He looks pretty #malicious#, I'd better run..\<br></br>This character is a pictograph of a bone attached to a piece of flesh. Think of Hannibal Lecter, malice incarnate who, having# MALICIOUS#ly murdered his cell guard, is munching on a femur. Primitive: BONES.\<br></br>In the *evening* when the moon goes below the *horizon* is the prime time for# malicious# activity.\<br></br>Here we have a truly# malicious# person who covers the entire *evening* sky with a *ceiling* so that no planes can land on the ground and everyone currently in the air dies. [I hope this story is absurd enough to let you remember the character!].
列	The *skeleton army* (solders made of *bone* clutching *sabres*) #line up# in a long #row# before marching into battle (thanks to synewave).\<br></br>This year's starting lineup for the St. Louis Cardinals is a bit strange: a gaggle of skeletons equipped with SABERS. See all their BONES and SABERS shining in the sunlight as they# LINE UP# for the national anthem before the game.\<br></br>The *malicious* one with the *sword* wants everyone to# line up# for their abuse.\<br></br>(inspired by suurishoujo) A terrorist who has taken a group of you hostage orders you to# line up# against the wall so you can “die an honorable death”. But in the spirit of United 93, you all subdue the terrorist with *bones* and *sabers* and escape. No one can tell you to# line up#.\<br></br>Cruella De Vil (malicious primitive) makes all the puppies# line up# to have their heads chopped off by the saber.
烈	Remember the scene in Schindler's List where all the Jews had to line up to be thrown into the furnace (flames)? That was the most# intense# part of the movie!\<br></br>The only way to kill the *skeleton army* is to start an# intense# white-hot *fire* between them. At they step on in, the flames go blue and they start to glow red and them burn into powder..just imagine the scene!\<br></br>What’s# intense#? A 747 takeoff. First, the plane *lines up* on the runway, and then the throttle is pushed forward and the four engines together produce four powerful *fires* that propel it down the runway. Imagine witnessing this sight not far from the runway and being pushed backward by the# intense# jet of exhaust coming from the plane.# Intense# indeed!\<br></br>The only way to destroy an undead army (saber rattling skeleton soldiers) is to cast an# intense# AoE spell of *fire* from under them.\<br></br>A team of skeletons LINED UP and dancing over a COOKING FIRE is a vivid image of hell. What could be more# INTENSE# than that?
死	Imagine the grim reaper (the embodiment of #death#), carrying a *spoon* made of human *bones* instead of a scythe. (thanks to pacersfan218).\<br></br>In this comic representation of# death#, we see a dancing skeleton playing the xylophone by banging a *spoon* on his own *bones*.\<br></br>Imagine that in forensics labs,# death#s are investigated by holding up fragments of *bone* with a *spoon* in order to determine whether the person truly died from ‘natural causes’ or was actually poisoned, beaten to# death#, etc.
葬	Not only did I have to buy *flowers* for the *dead*, but I had to dig the grave with my own *two hands* and# inter# them in the ground myself!\<br></br>Not only did I have to buy flowers for the dead, but I had to dig the grave with my own two hands and# inter# them in the ground myself!\<br></br>Before his wife was #interred#, he held this person who had met her *death* in his *two hands* one last time before allowing her to be placed in a flower-filled coffin and *interred* under the grass.\<br></br>Easy to visualize---Flowers held in both hands surrounding the death.# Inter#ring the dead. (Visualize Lazarous being# inter#red. See the dead spring back out to astonish the flower holders).
耳	Pictograph of an #ear# (if you squint hard). Just write it out a few times, you'll learn it due to new stroke order.\<br></br>First you have the top of your# ear#, followed by the left side and the longer right side (as it contains the lobe). Then you have two# ear# hairs (admit it!) and finally the bottom, which is longer than the top since you stretch on it when you’re nervous (OK, maybe you don’t).
取	You know that classic trick where someone pretends to #take# something out of an someone else's *ear* (such as a coin)? Well that gets old quick, especially for adults, so the magician starts pretending to pull a coin a woman's *crotch* instead. oh the laughs! (thanks to cjon256).\<br></br>#Take# your *right hand* out of your *ear*! Stop digging up earwax! Or: Here you are ordering (quite appropriately) Chinese #take#-out. You press the phone in your *right hand* to your *ear* so you can make out how much your order amounts to (her accent is difficult to understand—is she saying 15 dollars or 50 dollars?).\<br></br>#TAKE# both her EAR and her CROTCH virginity.\<br></br>An old man always# take#s things because he misses the sound of the sea. He lifts them with his right hand and places them next to his ear in order to listen to the sounds he misses.
趣	I've developed a new# interest# in nature *walks*. The hobby means I go for a *walk* in the forest or on the beach, and if I see something #interesting# (like a shell or special leaf) I *take* it home.\<br></br>This girl is very whimsical. When she is #interest#ed in a boy, it's all the time! But whenever she loses #interest#, she becomes very impolite: she tells them to *take* a *walk*!.\<br></br>You should *take* your camera with you when going for a *walk* in the nature reserve as you will find many# interest#ing photo opportunities.\<br></br>When I take an# interest# in a new gadget, I'm prepared to *walk* a long way to *take* it from the store.\<br></br>Buddha *walking* *takes* and# interest# in everything he sees.\<br></br>There's a very pretty young woman whom I take# interest# in, so I offer to *take* her for a *walk* along the little creek behind my house.\<br></br>I recently took an# interest# in walking. It's good for your health!
最	Perhaps you’ve heard of the show “America’s# Most# Wanted,” in which stories are shown about dangerous fugitives whom the government wants to capture. It turns out in this episode that the ‘#Most#’ ‘#most#’ wanted person is a man who has *taken* the *sun* by pulling it from the sky (which is why it’s above ‘take’). If you see a very bright light on the ground somewhere, let the police know!\<br></br>Two bank robbers both wearing *balaclavas* (a hood with 2 eye slits) have a competition to see who can *take* the #most# loot from the bank-vault! One is packing gold coins and jewels into his pockets and backpack, the other is shovelling them into a wheelbarrow! Who wins? You imagine it..\<br></br>You *take* the *day* off to make the# most# of the sunny weather.\<br></br>*sunrise* over *take*. Carpe diem make the# most# of life. The# most# trouble to Zeus was when Phaeton *takes* the *sunrise* away with his foolish chariot ride.

It's pretty unusual - I've got to go to a local *kazoo fiesta* (big street party where everyone plays kazoos) and *listen* with my *ears*, to make sure they're not playing too loud and disturbing the peace. It's quite boring, and at the end of the day my *ears* were ringing from the sound!\<br></br>Simplified 职# Job# = *ear*, *only*. Story: Van Gogh couldn't find a# job#, so he cut off his *ear*.

環	I designated the element on the right as a primitive I call "kidnap victim": you have someone in a net tied to the roof, and to prevent them from screaming, you have wrapped a scarf around her mouth. The story for this hanzi becomes: the# ring# with the huge jewel is the ransom you must pay for the kidnap victim.\<br></br>I designated the element on the right as a primitive I call "kidnap victim": you have someone in a *net* tied to the *roof*, and to prevent them from screaming, you have wrapped a *scarf* around her *mouth*. Story: The *king's* #ring# is the random for the kidnap victim.\<br></br>Here is a story about a man who stole the world’s most expensive# ring# from a museum. First, this# ring# has the world’s most valuable *jewel* on it, and it’s the new *jewel* of this robber’s collection. Second, he stole the# ring# by letting down a *net* from above the *ceiling* of the museum.

夫	Let's use a really famous# husband# for this primitive - *Homer Simpson*!\<br></br>Imagine a jovial# husband# who weighs in at over 500 pounds. He’s affectionately referred to as “the *big* *one* (see the *one* crossing through *big*?).
規	Imagine an emotional political advertisement that you watch while cooking dinner. The lady in the video says, “my *husband* was laid off from work due to new federal *regulations*, and I could *see* how much it hurt him.” Then there are pictures of many *husbands* holding their heads while their wives *see* into their eyes. She concludes the video by saying, “tell Congress to stop the# regulations# so our *husbands* can *see* a better future.” Hanzi 2012!\<br></br>*Homer Simpson* doesn't follow the #regulations# at the Nuclear Power Plant he works at.

They keep pulling down on it but nothing happens! Finally the wife comes home and twists it out in seconds, making them both pretty embarrassed.\<br></br>The husband# replace#ment market is always held during the day so the wives can clearly see the merchandise.
失	My husband is notorious for losing things. Here he is obliviously holding his glasses while asking me if I have seen them.\<br></br>Whenever the *husband* Homer Simpson wants to behave like a noble or an aristocrat, he wears a monocle (the *drop*) on his right eye. But as a once-standard comedic device exploits this, he soon makes a shocked expression in response to some event at the party for the riches, then he #loses# his monocle which falls into his drink or smashes into pieces on the floor.
臣	To make stories easier (and to keep consistant with the kanji site), let's make this primitive *shackled servant* rather than *underling*. This is a picograph of a shackled servant*'s shackles / retainer. Story: In Ancient China, a #feudal official# (an agent for a land owner) always brought a *shackled servant* along with them, to do carrying, paperwork etc.
臨	That official looks like he# be about to# knock the crap out of that lazy guy sleeping on those boxes of goods.\<br></br>The *feudel official* can't find his *shackled servant* anywhere! Eventually he finds him in the back room, *reclining* asleep on *boxes of goods*. He's angry, as he's #about to# go out and collect money...so he's about to hit him.,.\<br></br>That *feudal official* looks like he# be about to# knock the crap out of that lazy guy lay *reclining* on those boxes of *goods*.\<br></br>An *underling* recognizes that three explosive boxes – the *goods* James Bond has planted there – “be about to” explode, and the evil genius whom Bond has been trying to kill is *reclining* right on top of them, finding them surprisingly comfortable! But the underling is too late to stop it and the boxes explode.\<br></br>A lazy *underling* *reclining* on boxes of *goods* is #about to# fall asleep.
賢	For top primitive *Scrooge* - *Scrooge* is not a *servant* to his *crotch* like all other men - he's more interested in money. Story: *Scrooge* thinks the only #worthly# things to do with his time and the only #worthy# people are those that can make him money (*clams*). Everything else is not #worthy#..it's a waste of time.\<br></br>*Scrooge* believes himself to be a# worthy# candidate for Vice President in this 2020 presidential election, mainly because of all the *clams* he has stored up over the years from exploiting the poor—but also because of his genius for austerity. Here is *Scrooge* spreading those *clams* out below him in front of the presidential candidate.\<br></br>There are many qualifications of# worthy#-ness to becoming an official. For one, you can't pay money (clams) to get in someone's crotch!
堅	*Scrooge* is so# firm# with his employees, on Christmas day he just gives them all a pot of *soil* from his front garden as a present. "That's all they deserve - and if i gave them money at xmas time, they might not work as hard the rest of the year".\<br></br>Here is *Scrooge* looking down at the *dirt* in which he will be buried one day. He recognizes how his life will eventually end and how he is wasting it by doing evil. So it is here that *Scrooge* makes a# firm# resolution to stop exploiting the poor.\<br></br>Simplified-[坚]-[1013]: The Templars have been anointed with a sacred *fencing foil* on the *holy* *soil* in order to bless their strong and #firm# dedication.\<br></br>In *Scrooge's*# firm# people sit on the *soil* - chairs are an unnecessary cost.
力	Will use this primitive to mean general# power# or *big rippling muscles*. Hanzi is simple enough to memorise.\<br></br>In this character I see a charging elephant--which has more# power# than any other animal. The first stroke is its head (the horizontal section) and its tusks (the hooked vertical section). The second stroke are its# power#ful front legs.\<br></br>Will specialize the #power# primitive with #Star Wars# universe (as in the Force #power#) when it appears in *second* position (i.e. neither on top nor on the left). I will keep the #muscle# primitive for top or left positions.
另	Remember the Queen song “#Another# one bites the dust?” Here is# another# person who has bitten the dust. His open *mouth* is lying in the dust, and he didn’t have enough *power* to succeed (which is why *power* is lying below him; it was below the minimum level required to succeed).\<br></br>[from Harbaugh] you don't want to rely on# another#'s support, so everything that goes into your #mouth# comes from your own #power#.\<br></br>You don't need to always use your *power* to convince people. There is# another# way: by using your *mouth*. In a battle between *mouth* and *muscle*, the mouth eventually comes out on top.\<br></br>Ever hear the song "Drunken driving is so much fun, knock it back have# another# one" Imagine a hopeless drunk knocking back drinks, one after# another#, driving along.

He has yet# another# one and then smashes his car into a tree turning him into a pictograph of a body slumped at the wheel.# Another# foolish victim.\<br></br>Talking diplomatically is# another# way of settling disputes. The flexing of muscles isn't always productive.\<br></br>In *Star Wars*, there exists #another# side of the Force: the dark side of the Force.

With that logic, an amateur swordsman decides that more must be better, but at some point his master gets fed up. "Don't add another sword!" he cries out exasperatedly, at each time the amateur decides he wants to start practicing n+1-sword style.\<br></br>“#Don’t# buy *another* antique Samurai *saber*!” your exasperated wife tells you. “You already own five and we’re running out of savings.”.\<br></br>#DON'T# mess with *muscle mouth*, trust me.

Does its success mean that America is in desperate need of# morality#, or that# morality# is alive and well in the U.S. of A.?\<br></br>The right side, "10 eyes, one heart," reminds me of a Big Brother, totalitarian kind of thing.

保	Did you know before he became famous, *Mr. T* worked as a bouncer? To #safeguard# the club and party-goers, he had an interesting tactic - he would stand on a *wooden* platform at the door, shouting with his *mouth* open as loud as possible "NO FOO'S ALLOWED IN - AH I PITY ANYONE WHO TRIES TO MAKE TROUBLE HERE".\<br></br>Mr. T has to# safeguard# against the *dim-witted*, "I be watchin' you, foo!".\<br></br>Mr. T opens his mouth from the top of the tree saying "I pitty da foo who don't# safeguard# the trees!".\<br></br>As the 2012 Republican Convention approaches, everyone wants *Mitt Romney* to# safeguard# the event from allowing a *dim-witted* person to give a speech.
堡	#Fort#s safeguard the sacred soil of our land.\<br></br>Mr T *safeguards* the# FORT# and and the *soil* of this sacred soil--look out foo!\<br></br>At a campaign stop in# Fort# Worth, Texas, the Secret Service must *safeguard* Mitt Romney from a person who tries to attack him and shouts that Texas is truly Mexican *soil*. Mitt Romney jokes that he doesn’t see any Mexican# fort#s around, so how could that be true?
付	Mr. T wants you to# pay# him he's money: "pay me foo or I'm going to stick to you like GLUE". (foo gives a nice hint of the pronunciation fù).\<br></br>When the A-Team #pays# the ransom to the criminals, *Mr T* is *glued* to his van's seat just in case of troubles.\<br></br>*Mr. T* is trying to earn a little extra# pay# on the side by selling ad space on his body. When you ask him where it goes he says, "*glue* it here, fool! $100 per *inch* of ad space!".\<br></br>Mitt Romney *pays* a worker at a fast food place $1 for a soft drink. The worker happens to be a huge Mitt fan and is so excited that he adds super *glue* to the dollar bill and puts it on his arm so he’ll remember it forever. This is not safe . . .
府	This hanzi can also mean government archive. Story: This #government office# is actually an #archive# of all wage-slips and tax receipts of all civil-servants since 1920. So, it holds records of how everyone in government gets *paid*. There are now so many records that they had to move the whole department into a nearby massive *cave*.\<br></br>I am trying to find the nearest Department of Motor Vehicles (#government office#) so I can *pay* my registration fee. But, oddly enough, it is in a *cave*! See <a href="/study/kanji/766">pay</a> <span class="index">(#766)</span>.\<br></br>This# government office# takes care of collecting taxes. It doesn't matter where you live. Even if it's in a *cave*, you still have to *pay*.\<br></br>Batman paid to have all the# government office#s moved into the Batcave where he can keep an eye on them. It's good to be rich.\<br></br>To many, the# government office# is where they pick up money, in the form of welfare or unemployment. This# government office# is a cave where one comes to get paid.
俯	Everyone has to #bow one's head# when visiting a government office - except *Mr. T*, who just walks right in and shouts "What you all doin' foo's, where's my tax money bein' spent?".\<br></br>Mr. T bows one's head in order to fit into the GOVERNMENT OFFICE (small cave where he's paid his reward money). As for pronunciation, just remember Mr. T going "foo" while bowing his head down and up again (fǔ).\<br></br>Imagine *Mitt Romney* #bowing his head# before entering the highest secular *government office* in the world, the White House.

It's an *arrow* with a seringe at the extremity. It's a long distance weapon more suitable for a surprise shot.\<br></br>You need to make a substitution in your play. Since you don't have a big hook like in the days of Vaudeville, you instead shoot a suction cup arrow at the person you wish to replace and use it to haul them off.
袋	A bin-#bag# or potato #sack# makes a decent * substitute for* your normal *garments*, if you lose them at a music festival. Imagine walking around naked, just covered by a bin-#bag# - embarrassing (and memorable).\<br></br>"A# bag# is not a *substitute* for *clothing*!" poverty activists say.\<br></br>Have you ever had to SUBSTITUTE a plastic# bag# for a piece of CLOTHING?

Because I'm gonna whoop yo ass with it!".\<br></br>Has Mr. T gone mad? Why is he attacking# transform#ers with a SPOON.\<br></br>Barack Obama has had limited success in #transforming# money into jobs. But imagine that *Mitt Romney* is able to# transform# a *spoon* into jobs, a feat he often demonstrates at campaign events. First you just see a *spoon*, and that’s# transform#ed into dozens and dozens of jobs! (It’s not magic, it’s just *Mitt Romney*.).\<br></br>The waiter forgot to bring a fork so *Mr. T* uses his mind powers to# transform# the *spoon* into a fork!\<br></br>If a person (亻) does yoga, (s)he can# transform# their body and do spoon (匕) shapes.\<br></br>Mr. T plays with *one fishhook* - and he actually# transform#s it in an *ancient spoon*!
花	The process by which #flowers# grow is extraordinary: they slowly *transform* from little seeds into full, tall *flowers*!\<br></br>Here is Mitt Romney showing off his gardening skills (in another attempt to attract the mothers’ vote – see {frame 758}. *Mitt Romney* scattered many *flower* seeds with a *spoon* earlier in the year, and now they have burst into beautiful #flowers# that spell – what else? “Romney 2012”. The #flowers# are red, white and blue.\<br></br>Transformers for the fairer sex? Transformers that TRANSFORM to# flower#s.\<br></br>This hanzi has three radicals: grass (above), human (left) and spoon (right). These elements represent a man planting a# flower# on the soil with a gardening tool. The "grass" radical represent a fertile ground (the# flower#s are not planted in stones or tiles). And the "spoon" radical represent the spatula used to plant the# flower#. Although the grass should be placed under the "human" radical, the grass radical is always above the hanzi and the human on the left. For example: 草 and 你.
貨	Best way to beat inflation is to * transform* your cash (*shells*) into physical #commodities# like gold, silver or rare gems.\<br></br>We do this every day: TRANSFORM our (hard-earned) SHELLS for# commodities#.\<br></br>[JPN: freight] Shellification---Change shells/money for# commodities#- the difference between the# commodities# market and financial market-commodities the shells are being converted into something, financial the shells are simply multiplying ex-nihilo.\<br></br>(Thanks aphasiac for the inspiration) If you decide to invest all your *shells* into# commodities#, this will likely *transform* your bank account; either you’ll get tons of *shells* or lose all your *shells*.

Now imagine the TV commercial for it: "#whatwhichwhowherewhy?# Who can answer all of your questions - *Mr. T* *can* (FOO')!!".\<br></br>For all those questions, *Mr. T can* answer them.\<br></br>There's one thing every *person* *can* do: ask lots and lots of questions:# whatwhichwhowherewhy#? There's no end to it, hence the saying: one fool *can* ask more than a thousand wise man *can* answer.\<br></br>The journalists are badgering *Mitt Romney* to dig up facts about his past. What cereal did you eat in high school? Which cell phone company did you first use? Who taught you to ride a bike? Where were you during the Watergate trials? Why did your father decide to live in Michigan? *Mitt Romney* protests, “I’m only a person; how *can* I remember the answers to all these #whatwhichwhowherewhy# questions???”.\<br></br>*Mr T* and the A-Team *can* ... but #whatwhichwhowherewhy?# You will soon discover it by watching our next episode on W5 next saturday!\<br></br>#Whatwhichwhowherewhy# is *Mr. T* dancing *can-can*?\<br></br>What CAN't Mr. T do?

丈	This guy has *one* huge wang - a full #100 chinese inches# long. It's so big he has to carry it *tucked under his arm*.\<br></br>Suppose you’re in need of toilet paper in the bathroom. There’s only *one* Chinese inch of paper on the roll (1 being the first stroke). But fortunately, you have 99 Chinese inches of toilet paper with you, *tucked under the arm*. So ultimately, you have #100 Chinese inches#; that’s plenty!\<br></br>New potential keyword for this character would be "ten feet". We can see a person ENTERING TEN feet. Or if you prefer the original keyword, then this is just a weird way of writing 100. 十 times 十 = 丈 (zhàng,# 100 chinese inches#). Other characters with similar logic: 十 + 十 = 廿(niàn twenty) and 十 + 十 + 十 = 卅 (sà thirty).
使	*Mr. T* is on a trashy talk-show (Stern or Springer), and is amazed by the next guest - an Asian pornstar - who claims to be packing *100 chinese inches*. "Shut yo *mouth* foo', no way any guy can be that big - and even if you were, you wouldn' be able to #use# it"..\<br></br>The authorities are #using# *person* to deliver a message, but all they get in response is a hit in the *mouth* with a *100 inch* pole. Maybe they didn't like the message. Maybe they fell# use#d.\<br></br>Know the phrase# use# it or lose it? That’s what *Mitt Romney* thinks regarding his basketball skills. *Mitt Romney* dreams of *using* his epic basketball skills to dunk over President Obama on a 100 Chinese inch hoop (in China, of course), leaving the President open-*mouthed* and leaning on the hoop (about halfway up, where his mouth is) in amazement. Then Ann *uses* him to get the newspaper and make coffee and he forgets these lofty goals . . .
久	Me looove you #long time#. Primitive = *Thai hooker*. Written as *bound-up* + *person*, cos she's bound up for some kinky S&M fun.\<br></br>Think of it in the sense of “long time no see,” e.g. two people who haven’t seen each other for a while.
畝	Suppose that for a *long time*, the length of a# Chinese acre# was simply the distance that China’s best athlete could throw a *top hat* over a *rice field* (squared, of course); the athlete was strong enough that the *top hat* could fly over that *rice field* for a long, *long time*. Then the Jesuits arrived with their fancy measuring equipment and the athletes were suddenly out of a job . . .\<br></br>The inspector in the *top hat* is there to check the boundaries of the #rice fields# so they contain the same number of #Chinese acres# as they have for a #long time#. No midnight moving of boundary markers allowed.\<br></br>Our *Thai Hooker* formerly worked in the *rice fields* where she used to wear a bamboo *sun-hat*. She was forced to irrigate one #Chinese acre# of rice-fields per day - her new profession is so much easier.\<br></br>In ancient China, land was only given to the top-hat-wearing nobility, so people who owned rice paddies probably had them in their families for a very long time.\<br></br>A Chinese picture brings to mind images of a rice paddy, where the workers often wore those conical hats for protection from the elements, giving the left side of the hanzi. This# Chinese acre# in particular, though, is run by a mummy.
丙	*Mr T*. hates flying# third#-class. His head always hits the *ceiling*, and the buckle on the seatbelts scratch his shiny gold *belt* (thanks to Penguin).
柄	This is the character that gave me the most grief so far, so since the idea of third class as per the provided story wasn't working, I interpreted it visually: Instead of a human carrying a case made of wood, here we have a #tree# carrying a case made out of a #person#. The top right line is the# handle#, and the *belt* represents the case. The person element there signifies the case is made out of human flesh.\<br></br>The worst thing about flying *third*-class is that all the door-#handles# in that section of the plane are made from cheap rotting *wood*! So you try to open the luggage bin above your head, or go to the toilet, and end up with a handful of splinters!\<br></br>Tom’s parents have just given him a new car, but he’s a terrible driver (he’s 17 – just started), and he hits the *third* *tree* his new car passes, which breaks off the door# handle#. Obviously he hasn’t yet gotten a# handle# on driving . . .\<br></br>A first class tree is used to build a house. A second class tree is used to build the door, and a third class tree is only fit to become the# handle#.
肉	This *person* is eating #meat# made of... another *person*! And he's loosening his *belt* because he's eating a lot!
腐	Two of the most# rotten# things in the world are rotting meat and the corrupt government offices.\<br></br>The residents of a city believe the people governing the city are all# rotten#, and they express this view by placing a heap of# rotten# *meat* at the bottom entrance to the city *government office*.\<br></br>Everybody has a skeleton hidden in their closet. Well GOVERNMENT OFFICEs have# rotten# MEAT hidden in their file cabinets. And it really stinks!\<br></br>As if waiting for a free clerk at *government office* (think: Department of Motor Vehicles) wasn't bad enough, this time, I'm waiting my turn and another citizen comes in carrying a case of *meat*, but it's horribly #rotten# and stinking up the place! See <a href="/study/kanji/767">government office</a> <span class="index">(#767)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/782">meat</a> <span class="index">(#782)</span>.\<br></br>The *government office* has a department dedicated to track down the restaurants that do not comply with sanitation and hygiene procedures. Thus the *government office* makes surprise raids in restaurants to check if their *meat* is #rotten# or not.\<br></br>Insurgents leaving #rotten# *meat* in the *government office* to show their discontentment.\<br></br>Continuing the story from <a href="/study/kanji/767">government office</a> <span class="index">(#767)</span> - our *office* also keeps an archive of what civil servants eat. But instead of just saving the food-receipts, all left-over food is bagged up and kept in filing cabinets for "tax-purposes".

But then a# multitude# of workers on the *assembly line* start questioning Mitt about his giant *net* worth.

I'm going down in a blaze of #glory#!!!" He then lights the nearest *tree* on fire! (This helps make his point that the firehouse is a necessary government service.) But the rest of *firehouse* comes out and puts out the *tree*. See <a href="/study/kanji/191">tree</a> <span class="index">(#191)</span>.\<br></br>but slips, falls, and is impaled by a giant pole right through the chest.\<br></br>En un *parque de bomberos* nadie se llena de #gloria# por rescatar gatitos de un *árbol*. #róng#.\<br></br>The folks at the *firehouse* love buying a Christmas *tree* each year and dressing it up in all its# glory# with hundreds of lights, ornaments and even a fire hose that wraps around it. They then stick it on top of a fire truck and drive around the city, singing that wonderful tune “#Glory#,# glory# hallelujah!” to celebrate the coming of Christ.\<br></br>The tree was crowned and set on fire twice. Not a very# glory#-ous end for the tree.
勞	Being a *fire-fighter* and putting out a fire requires a serious amount of hard #labor#. that's why there are no female *fire-men* - the job requires serious *strength* and *power*.\<br></br>A woman goes into labour in the middle of a power cut. Then the building catches on fire - this is less than perfect.\<br></br>Simplified 劳 : A greenhouse is a real labour of love for most old people, and takes an enormous amount of strength to continue.\<br></br>The government feels that the organized# labor# at the *firehouse* has gotten too *power*-ful; they’ve succeeded in gaining higher wages, more days off and a shiny new fire truck. So the government decides to cut the *power* to the fire house as a result.\<br></br>I'm going to let the top part mean Texas A&M from now on, since they like setting things on fire. If you go to A&M, you better be powerful since you'll likely get stuck in a manual# labor# job.
營	Simplified 营 : when you go to# camp#, it's all about nature: flowers, and a house that is made up of just a spine (tent)..\<br></br>Kids are at band #camp# for summer vacation. Some of the boys start messing around with a #camp#-fire - to prove they had a *spine* (brave) they're had to run through it barefoot! of course their messing around causes several tents to catch fire, and *fire-fighters* are called - then the boys are sent home in shame!\<br></br>A poor fireman fell off the roof of the *firehouse* while doing repairs and injured his *spine*, so the city government sends him to ‘#Camp# Spine Repair’ (actually located in some military barracks) where he can make a full recovery.\<br></br>A&M hazing ritual: anyone with a spine has to sleep in# camp# on school grounds for their entire freshman year.
善	if you know what I mean! BUT he kept his *mouth* closed, so no one was ever the wiser. So the moral of this story is...if you do something bad, keep your *mouth* shut!\<br></br>It sounds as if it were a Bible proverb: the# virtuous# *sheep* will always trample down the *horns* and *mouth* of evil.\<br></br>The #horny devil# is left speechless as the# virtuous# *holy lamb* aka #celestial sheep# descends upon him from high and squats on his face....

夜	After the sun-sets and #night# comes, *Mr . T* transforms into a creature of the #night# - a vampire! He puts on a large *top-hat* to hide his fangs, and then walks around on his *walking legs*, searching for a *drop* of blood..\<br></br>At# night#, wearing a *top hat*, *Mr. T* goes out searching for those who have a *drop* in between their *walking legs*.\<br></br>*Mr T* and *Hitler* are going to a *top hat* gala event this #night#. Nothing unusual about that, except for the drop of blood on Hitlers mouth. Oh dear...\<br></br>It’s Election# Night# 2012. *Mitt Romney* puts on a *top hat* and squirts a *drop* of lotion onto his sore *walking legs*, then ventures over to the television in order to see if this will be a triumphant# night# or a very, very long# night#.

By the end of the *night* after multiple #liquid#-meals, he's absolutely *dripping wet* covered in the stuff, and needs to wash it all off with *water*.\<br></br>It's not polite to talk about night emissions... so we'll just call it# liquid#...
喚	I #call out# to anyone in the way of my *sled* and *sled dogs* loudly with my *mouth* - GET OUT OF THE WAY - MUSH, MUSH.\<br></br>I tried to# call out#, but four big men had bound up my mouth.\<br></br>You’re in northern Alaska with your *sled dogs* when you recognize that your breath is horrible and your teeth are probably yellow. So you# call out# for one of your *sled dogs* to lick your *mouth* clean with its big, slobbery tongue.

Out of hunger you’re forced to# exchange# your favorite *sled dog* for a large pack of fish *fingers*.
旅	The# travel# agency, to keep control of the tour party, issues each tourist with an identical *bandana* with the tour group's logo and gets the tour guide to hold up a large *banner* for the tourists to follow.\<br></br>You decided to #travel# to a nearby city for the weekend. BUT on the way there, you see *banners* on the road, saying "*motorcycle gang* rally / festival being held here tonight". Immediately you turn back and go home..\<br></br>You get out your *compass* to find your way, but before you #travel# you *lie down* to take a nap. These *motorcycle gang* rallies can be so very tiring...yawn. Maybe I''ll meet some chick!\<br></br>The bandana reminds me of Ryoga from Ranma 1/2. He's known for# travel#ing the world and has gone to all kinds of places. But he always# travel#s without a compass (not that it would help him anyway, which is why "WHERE IN THE WORLD AM I?!" is practically his catchphrase!\<br></br>There's a fearsome bunch of pirates who# travel# the seas, wearing their *bandana's* under a black *banner* with skull and bones.\<br></br>Your little university has #traveled# all the way to the NCAA basketball championship.

Unfortunately, you *travel* with the basketball (a foul) and thus lose the game for your team, meaning the other team will get the championship banner. In your shame you cover your head with your own *bandana*, having lost the *banner* to your opponents.
施	To #execute# our evil plan (a public prank) we need 3 things - a video camera, a banner that says "Cute Bunny Rabbits - pet them here" and a bucket of *scorpions*..mwahhaa..\<br></br>A dreaded band of pirates known as the “scorpions” sail the high seas (*scorpions* because they are ready to attack you like a scorpion might in order to seize your goods). When the pirates are ready to# execute# a raid, they fly a large *banner* with an images of a *scorpion* on their own ship and then hop on board. The fear this *scorpion* *banner* inspires means they successfully# execute# their plundering each time without resistance.\<br></br>The officer received a fancy *compass* with a *sleeping scorpion* etched on its back--all because he was to #execute# 100 innocents...This is why, to this day, he is referred to as the *sleeping scorpion* Many have found out the hard way not to ask him for *directions*!\<br></br>They# execute# the *scorpion* by cutting off its head with a large *banner*.\<br></br>The Mummy's army of evil march with scorpion banners to# execute# their evil plans.
游	Here’s a revolution in how people #go swimming# in the local pool: if a yellow *banner* is up, that means that a *child* has peed in the *water* and you shouldn’t *go swimming* in the water then!\<br></br>I just imagine deciding to #go swimming# at my local swimming pool - cos there are *banners* up everywhere saying "NOW OPEN" and "FREE ENTRY TODAY"! But once I get to the water, it's madness, the staff have totally lost control - bad *children* have come in, and are splashing *water* everywhere, and swinging from the *banners* above the pool from slide-tower to diving boards. help!\<br></br>"The *water* is in which *direction*" he asked the *reclined child* who replied, "oh my, you have a *wet compass*. Why don't you #go swimming# to cool off before I scream for help you old letch!".\<br></br>To# go swimming# is a form of play 遊 for kids, but you do it in water instead of on the road.\<br></br>There banner + child is a banner saying "no children" allowed, in this case because they're splashing too much in the pool.\<br></br>Time to #go swimming#! Just enter the *water* and let go of the *banner* — don't be such a *child*!
遊	Did you know the #Tour# De France is an adult only event? There are *banners* up all along the *roads* of the routes, saying "No *children* allowed". Apparently they get bored easily and distract the cyclists..\<br></br>Imagine a parent who *tours* Harvard with their *children* (who are waving Harvard *banners* that their parents gave them) because they think going to Harvard is the *road* to riches.\<br></br>The letch with the now big *compass* picked up the *reclined boy* and started to run down the *road*. "I'm going to give you a "#tour#" you will never forget".\<br></br>Think of a family going down the *road* on a long bicycle #tour#.

忽	My Father #suddenly# collapsed and turned blue last night - had to be rushed to hospital.

易	Imagine a boy-scout going for his "daytime" and "nighttime" "un-tying" badges. Under the *sun*, it is #easy# to untie a *knot*. Under a pitch-dark sky, it is *knot* so# easy#. (thanks to saranich ).\<br></br>What an# easy# day... just relaxing under the SUN... NOT doing anything.

屍	When a U.S. soldier met his *death* in combat, they put an American *flag* over the coffin containing the# corpse#.\<br></br>Many# corpse#s have been created under the guise of a flag.

Moments later, a pile of *dirt* falls on him from the ceiling and he suddenly finds himself, covered in *dirt*, at an *altar*. See <a href="/study/kanji/147">soil</a> <span class="index">(#147)</span>.
視	Reminds me of that Simpsons episode about Praiseland. People have been having crazy visions at the local *shrine*. A health# inspect#or is sent to #inspect# it, and once he has a good hard *look*, he *sees* that the visions are actually causing by a smell-less gas leak..\<br></br>Your job is to# inspect# the "eye-doll idols" (giant eyes with human legs) being made for the church.\<br></br>A cop is up at the *altar*, receiving communion, when he *sees* evidence of wrongdoing. He comes back after the service to #inspect# the place. See <a href="/study/kanji/55">see</a> <span class="index">(#55)</span>.\<br></br>When the Gods come around to# inspect# things on earth, you had better put some offerings on the *altar* in plain *sight*.\<br></br>Hey it's *inspector gadget*, with his special *seeing eye* to help# inspect# things. Maybe he'll notice he's missing his nub and has turned into a *shrine*.\<br></br>A Chinese priest# inspect#s the congregation behind the *altar* before every service to *see* if there are any government spies *seeing* him. Sound: shi4 The *Japanese*# inspect# every toaster they make at least 20 times – because they’re so obsessive with quality control. (In my stories: “shi” is so common that I have it stand for toaster; *Japanese* stands in for *fourth tone*, US for *1st tone*, China for *2nd tone*, *Germany* for *3rd tone*.\<br></br>God# inspect#s from time to time the *altars* of their flock (human beings) and *see* their offerings. On this *altar*, a virgin is lying and God who *sees* everything in this world, #inspects# her soul.\<br></br>To# inspect# the miraculous statue (is it genuine?), you need to #see# the *altar* yourself.
福	Visit the *shrine* daily to bring *wealth* and #happiness#.\<br></br>Picture a man who finds# happiness# by taking all his *wealth* and giving it to God by placing it before the *altar*.\<br></br>Some people find# happiness# by praying at the *altar*, others just need material *wealth*.\<br></br>When people are really happy with their financial situation they donate to the church, then they achieve full# happiness# in that their financial and spiritual needs are taken care of.\<br></br>Pray at the altar to become wealthy, for it will surely bring you# happiness#.
禁	If you live in Asia, your main exposure to this hanji is probably "no smoking" signs. So I imagine the government deciding to# prohibit# tobacco, and burning entire *woods* of tobacco plants on a HUGE *altar* (the altar of public health, or self-righteousness, if you will). (thanks to snallygaster).\<br></br>Some religions in China are strictly# prohibit#ed. But people will always find a way to do what they want, in this case, they'll just hide an *altar* somewhere deep in the *woods*.\<br></br>Do not eat the #prohibited# (forbidden) fruit from the *woods*, the priest preaches from the altar.\<br></br>From time to time countries try to persecute Christianity. Here is a country that has #prohibited# public Christian worship. Thus the faithful worship at secret *crypt altars* placed below the *woods* where the authorities could never find them.\<br></br>You are# prohibit#ed to put groves of trees on the dais.
襟	In Singapore the law if very strict - it is *prohibited* for a woman to leave the #front of a garment# open and show her #bosom# in public. If she's going out like this, she must wear a small *cloak* in front of her, to cover her chest..\<br></br>A sexy girl opens up the front of her cloak (the front of her garment), but instead of seeing her naked body, there's just a giant sign that says FORBIDDEN.\<br></br>You can't wear a cloak as the# front of a garment#. It's prohibited. It would just look silly.
宗	The creepy# religion# requires people to have daises in their houses for animal sacrifices.\<br></br>An *altar* in a *house* of worship is a sure sign of #religion#. See <a href="/study/kanji/834">show</a> <span class="index">(#834)</span>.
崇	Many *religions* build their monasteries in the *mountains*. They are remote areas close to god, so they are very suitable for# worship#ping.\<br></br>The local *mountainous* Hakka people in Taiwan #worship# the *mountains* - it is the basis of their *religion*.\<br></br>Mountain religion = volcano# worship#.
祭	What we see here is the rite of circumcision: where a piece of FLESH from your CROTCH is offered as a sacrifice on the ALTAR for the God.\<br></br>When these gods ask you to #offer sacrifice#, they mean bringing to the *altar* the *part of you body* that makes you sin. That part can be your *right hand*, if it's always in your *crotch*.\<br></br>Aquí tienen a una virgen sobre el *altar* para #ofrecer un sacrificio#. Pero claro tanta *carne* de una joven virgen hace que los curas, que son unos pervertidos, decidan probar la *entrepierna* de la virgen. Y ya no será virgen y necesitarán a otra para #ofrecer el sacrificio#. Y vuelta a empezar. #jì, zhài#.\<br></br>Imagine someone in Old Testament/Hebrew Bible times on a very, very hot day in Israel holding up the *flesh* of an animal in their *right hand* in order to# offer sacrifice# to God before a *crypt altar*. They decided to offer it underground because it’s much cooler downstairs than upstairs .\<br></br>Strips of flesh on the dais to# offer sacrifice#.

由	"Sprouteo, Sprouteo, #Wherefore# art thou, Sprouteo?" (Juliet has fallen in love with a brussel sprout). A tiny *sprout* pops up out of the *rice field* and says "here I am!". (thanks to Katsuo, kansaigaijin).
抽	As a kid did you ever make your *fingers* into a pistol-shape, and then #draw out# quickly and fire, As if you're a cowboy doing a quick draw? Now imagine a kid doing that and then firing at the disgusting *brussell sprouts* you're made to eat on Xmas day..\<br></br>You’ll want to# take out# that rusty screw from inside your *finger* before a massive infection *sprouts*.\<br></br>You go to buy# take out# at your local KFC but unfortunately they're out of *finger* lickin' KFC.

油	#oil# - The *liquid* that *sprouts* from the ground..\<br></br>An# oil# company allows lots of# oil# to spill from a burst pipeline into the *water* of a rice paddy, killing all the new *sprouts* of rice.\<br></br>History has given short shrift to the crew of wildcatters comprised of Hip-Hop & R&B artists on their day jobs who discovered the famous Texas Spindletop #oil# gusher in the 1930s. Fortunately, we have an audio recording of the discovery, which should also help with pronunciation of this Hanzi: "Hey, yo! YO!! We've got a black *liquid* *sprouting* out of the ground! YO!!

You take this *radish* down to your nearest #pawn# shop, but they say it has little value and is not worth trying to #pawn#. So you eat it. See <a href="/study/kanji/848">first</a> <span class="index">(#848)</span>.\<br></br>Imagine that instead of a tulip bubble in the Netherlands way back, there was instead a radish bubble – meaning, prized and rare *radish* breeds were sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars until the bubble collapsed. Here a man *pawns* his entire fish *finger* company for one prized, purple-and-white *radish* that loses 99% of its value within a week once the bubble has collapsed.\<br></br>I would go so far as to# pawn# my *finger* for Formula 1 (*checkered flag*) tickets!\<br></br>Poking your finger in armor to see if it's real, imagine a guy trying to# pawn# armor at a# pawn# show, which they often do on# Pawn# Stars.

果	In Taiwan, rice doesn't make any money anymore - #fruit# is more profitable and can be sold worldwide. Therefore there's now a trend to drain *rice-fields* and replace them with fields of #fruit#-*trees*.\<br></br>The# fruit# of this *tree* is really weird: it looks like the tree is full of *brains*! (Actually it's an osage orange or hedge apple).\<br></br>Is this a rice field growing in a tree? No, it’s a Hanzifruit – let me explain! Here is the *fruit* of a biologist’s decades of labor: he has bred a perfectly square# fruit# that grows on the top of the *tree* (making them easy to pick) and divides itself into fourths when ripe, saving you from the hassle of cutting it! As you can imagine, these special# fruit#s look exactly like *rice fields* sitting on top of a *tree*. The only problem is, they also taste like *rice fields*.\<br></br>*Rice field* = food, that is growing up on a *tree* is# fruit#. How simple!
課	When teaching English in Asia, generally 90% of your #lessons# and your #lesson#-plans will be based around teaching the kids *words* for *fruits* in English. A is for APPLE, B is for BANANA, C is for CHERRY etc etc..\<br></br>You are forced to learn an entire page of the *dictionary* as one of your school# lesson#s, but this tough# lesson# produces much *fruit* when you do great on the SATs.

[And this definitely isn't true].\<br></br>The# lesson# is the fruit plucked from the words taught to you in class. Or, the# lesson# was taught by someone fruity that used a lot of words.
顆	This new health drink has #granules# of dried *fruit* in it. It's mean to make your *head* clearer, your thoughts sharper and reduce *head*-aches - I'm not convinced..\<br></br>(Thanks aphasiac for the inspiration) The decision by Tom to put #granules# of *fruit* into cigarettes to make them sweeter and tastier (and thus boost sales) was so brilliant that they made him *head* of the tobacco company. Unfortunately (thanks again to aphasiac) the #granules# also give people massive *head*-aches, and the company is now up to its *head* in lawsuits.
斤	This #tomahawk#, weighing a# catty# (500g), has a convenient split at the back so I can also use it to *drag* out *nails*, like a claw hammer.\<br></br>For primitive, I'm going with *axe* rather than tomohawk, as it's more general and therefore easier to make stories. Story: My pet pussy #catty# weighs 1kg, which is far too fat! So I cut my #catty# in half with an *axe* - now it weights 0.5kg :)).\<br></br>“Hey guys, this place is on fire!

斬	Etymology: car(t) getting attacked with an ax. Or how it went in old china: Merchant-dude with his cart, but suddenly some thief with his ax comes and BAM! behead.\<br></br>In this new video game Grand Head Auto, you drive your car around and behead random innocent people with your tomahawk. I'm sure mothers' groups aren't going to be happy about this one...\<br></br>Someone stole the Red Queen's crimson *chariot*! She's so mad that she runs about her palace waving an *ax* and screaming "Off with their heads! Off! Off! Off!" She then starts #behead#ing random people!\<br></br>Here we see a scene of the postapocalyptic world a la Mad Max, where a crazed brute drives around in his monstrous CAR# HEW#ING people's heads off with a huge TOMAHAWK (another meaning of this character is "behead").\<br></br>Trapped in the car, the fireman are contemplating whether to cut off your head with the car to save the rest of your body.

"You're new head will grow back in a *day*, swear it.".\<br></br>You are driving but you can barely see because the *sun* is shining right in your eyes. Somehow your front bumper is *hewn* off by something! (You can't even see what because it's so sunny.) You console yourself by realizing that it can be fixed. The damage is only #temporary#.

The next *day*, there are no more mentions.\<br></br>A "temp," or# TEMPORARY# worker, is someone who fills a position often for only a few DAYS while a "headhunter" works to find a more permanent replacement. That is, like the Dayaks of Borneo, the headhunter will seek to "BEHEAD" another organization and bring that head back to his own as a trophy.\<br></br>As you sit trapped in the car the whole day you remind yourself this is only a# temporary# situation.\<br></br>The folks at the NYSE decide to put a# temporary# ban on the short-selling of stocks that will last for just a *day*.

唐	The #Tang# dynasty is famous for the torture they inflicted to the traitors to the crown. Dissimilated inside the deepness of some *caves*, the supplice consisted in inserting a *rake* inside the *mouth* until it gets out by the … yeark!. Their emblem depicts a *cave* enclosing a *rake* over a *mouth* as a warning to their enemies. (stupid but vivid).\<br></br>#Tang# ( the powered fruit drink) was first created in China in the #TANG# dinasty. The# TANG# emperor discovered that certain #cave#s walls had a very sweet smell, so he #raked# the walls of one of them and put the #rake# into his #mouth#. This way he discovered that tasty powder that nowadays is known as# TANG# juice. (thanks to Transtic).\<br></br>Your 5th grade class will be doing a final project on the# Tang# Dynasty. You complain to your mom that you would rather drop a dirty, rusty rake on your *mouth* over and over again in a cold, wet *cave*.

君	[Continuing from Queen Elizabeth] See, this# monarch# tried to get Mr. T to *mop* his floor, but Mr. T just told him, "Shut yo *mouth* foo!" and left the scene.\<br></br>Imagine a very repressive# monarch# who has two jobs: first, acting as an *overseer* to see if anyone is behaving like a dissident, and then pressing down the *mouth* of those dissidents.\<br></br>The King's Speech:# Monarch# talks like he has a MOP in his MOUTH.

裙	A royal *cloak* is often worn by Our #monarch# The Queen of England on. But it's handy as when she doesn't need it for a royal function, as she can also wrap it around herself and use it as a deluxe long *skirt*.\<br></br>That white *clothing* that *Pope Francis* uses looks like a #skirt# on his legs.\<br></br>After washing the royal *cloak* at too high temperatures, the *monarch* could only use it as a# skirt#...\<br></br>The# skirt#-chasing prince becomes the new *monarch*. The first law he passes is that females may only wear# skirt#s for *clothing*.\<br></br>You send a# skirt# to the queen of Spain, thinking she’ll love it -- it’s red and yellow with the Spanish flag patterned on it, and it will look great in the Plaza Mayor. But it’s sent back to you, with a note saying this is not appropriate *clothing* for a *monarch*, and that only a regal *cloak* will do. Ouch! [I know that technically her husband is likely the monarch, but this is a Hanzi guide, not a course in political science!].\<br></br>A garment that swishes around like a mop and is open at the bottom is a# skirt#.\<br></br>The monarch's got a weak back, so he wears his cloak like a# skirt#.

昔	In his great novel Remembrance of Things Past, what actually kicks off Proust's reverie of# TIMES PAST# is not his precious madeleine, but rather a memory of a delicate SALAD he ate under the bright SUN along the Champs-Elysees.\<br></br>#Times past# is quite vague, so lets make this into the primitive also mean *fairy tale* (kids stories set in #times past#). Story: *once upon a time*, in# times past#, there was a boy jack, who left a *salad* out in the *sun* all *day*. When he came to get it, he found a magic beansprout..\<br></br>Per Wikipedia: "*Salad* *days*" is an idiomatic expression in the English language referring to a youthful time, accompanied by the inexperience, enthusiasm, idealism, innocence, or indiscretion that one associates with a young person.

Story: At an all *female* boarding school, the girls go back to their *dorm room* at night and share tips on how to #put on makeup# and make themselves look like *women*.\<br></br>All the men on a nature retreat are excited to get out of their *bunk beds* and go to the beach, but the *women* are still in their *bunk beds*, #putting on makeup# so they’ll look good to everyone there. It turns out these *women* stay in their *bunk beds* #putting on makeup# until the afternoon.\<br></br>Simplified 妆 : A lot of women take almost as long to put on make-up as the teenage ninja mutant turtles do on set, a very long time indeed!
壯	The *soldiers* at the navy camp are so# robust# (they’re effectively solid muscle and bone) that they break every *bunk bed* at an army camp they stay in one night. The admiral is extremely proud of his# robust#, army *bunk bed*-breaking navy *soldiers* and lets them jump off the diving board on the aircraft carrier to celebrate.\<br></br>To be a #robust# *soldier* takes more than just laying around in your *bunk bed*.

莊	Bad choice of keyword! This is NOT the Shakespeare character, but actual means a small village. to avoid confusion, I'm changing keyword to #small village#. Story: In Afghanistan, a *soldiers dorm* was shelled and the *soilders* were killed while sleeping in their *bunk beds*. Sad story, but a #small village# nearby loved their presence, and laid *flowers* out around the camp in mourning.\<br></br>A# hamlet# is a small village. With a war ongoing, this one is deserted and is being used by *soldiers* as a resting point. To keep themselves alert, the only things in the# hamlet# are *bunk beds* to sleep on and a small garden of *flowers* to remember their fallen comrades.\<br></br>In the little# HAMLET# of Hamelin, legendary for its association with the Pied Piper of Hamelin, a memorial has been erected for the children who disappeared. A ROBUST arrangement of FLOWERS gloriously depicts the multi-colored clothing of the piper, a powerful symbol of death.\<br></br>According to Wiktionary, a# hamlet# (in the UK meaning) is a village that lacks its own church. Well, a very militant group of atheists in the UK propose making their little village a# hamlet# by tearing down the church and replacing it with nice, *robust* *flowers* that won’t say anything they find offensive. A massive protest ensues and the atheists, coming to their senses, decide they won’t do it. The village mends its differences by planting *robust flowers* together in front of the church.
裝	The only# attire# appropriate for landing on Mars is extremely *robust* *clothing*, resistant to tears, heat, cold, radiation and dust. It must be full *clothing* -- not a bandana, not a cloak, not a scarf, but *clothing* in its complete form.\<br></br>In Afghanistan, *soldiers* have to wear extremely *robust* #attire#. this means *garments* like a blast-proof jacket and metal helmet and boots.
將	After endless amounts of training, the troops decide to *glue* their# General#'s entire *flesh* to his *bunk bed* so they can get some sleep.\<br></br>(this made me think of that story in Reservoir Dogs, about a scorned girlfriend getting revenge on her boyfriend with superglue) Story: Did you hear the gossip about the army# General#? His mistress found out he was married, and took revenge. This morning he was found in his officers *dorm room*, laying in his *bunk bed*, his *fleshy* p3nis *glued* to his stomach. Apparently it'll wear off in 1 week - until then he has to do a handstand everytime he needs to pee.\<br></br>All the soldiers sleep in *bunk bed*s but the# General# is the one with *stripes* *glued* to his sleeves.\<br></br>The# General# is pretty strict with military recruits who he thinks are being lazy. If they haven’t worked out for *two evenings* in a row [my alternative name for the distorted ‘flesh’ you see in the top right], he puts lots of *glue* on their *bunk beds* so they get stuck to them when they sleep, a signal to them (and everyone else) that they are performing subpar and may as well stay in bed if they’re not willing to do their best.

序	In the# preface# to his latest edition of RtH, *Heisig* tells us that until he invented his brilliant kanji-learning method, he was living in a *cave* beforehand. Luckily, the publishing of the book gave him enough money to move out of the cave into an apartment. (thanks to harusame).\<br></br>If you want to read Plato's "Republic" you must know *beforehand* that the entire first half of the book is pretty much just a# preface# to the *Cave* Analogy.\<br></br>Caveman child, the# preface# of all things man.\<br></br>The# preface# to a vast room of *cave* art—perhaps the world’s first art book—is a pretty *ceremonial spear*, planted into the ground, that Ug painted before doing the walls. It serves to invite you inside.\<br></br>This book is about a primitive tribe living in a remote area only reachable through a *cave*. The story of how the tribe was first found by the discovery of a *ceremonial spear* near the entrance of the cave is written in the# preface#.
預	Heisig gives you a few pages of RTH# beforehand# to see if it's right for you.\<br></br>My gf "gave me a head" on my "spear" and i came# beforehand#...\<br></br>Most of the story happens later, but,# beforehand#, during the opening credits, he gets hit by a *ceremonial spear* on the *head*.\<br></br>Caveman child about to be bestowed into adulthood wears war-makup on his *head*# beforehand#.\<br></br>Tom explains to the media that he apologized to Mr. Bort and they made up, but that “As to what happened# beforehand#, I refuse to say.” Well, what happened# beforehand# was that he ripped Mr. Bort’s *ceremonial spear* out of its stand on the wall and hit him on the *head* with it.

班	Due to boredom I've just joined a new adult night-#class# - fencing! I figure it's an active hobby, will get me fit and will make me look quite# class#y (like James Bond). Anyway when I get there I find it's very posh - in fact all my# class#-mates are royalty! For the demo I watch *two kings* fighting with a special *fencing-sabre*. So cool!\<br></br>Your 9th grade English# class# was pretty dicey. There were two students who considered themselves “*king*” of the school. One day they got into a horrible fight and one of them pulled out a *saber* at the other before campus police finally stopped them. That’s when you transferred to another# class#.\<br></br>Before and after: On the left, we have a *king* who isn't very good at ruling. But he takes a #class# in use of a *saber*, and his kingsmanship is improved, as seen in the right half of the hanzi, after he's graduated from his #class#.

強	A giant, giant *insect* has invaded your area. Your spouse pulls out a *bow*, hoping to kill the *insect* that way, but you announce, “I’m# strong#, so we don’t need a *bow*; I have an *elbow!*” You then crush the *insect* with your *elbow*, proving how# strong# you are.\<br></br>There was once a legendary *archer*, who was known for being incredibly #strong# and #powerful#. In reality he was very weak but had a powerful *insect* friend who tugged on his *elbow* while pulling back on his *bow and arrow*. (thanks to akrodha).\<br></br>*Legolas* crushes the giant *insect* with his *elbow*. Elves are much# strong#er than humans.\<br></br>Bow + elbow = carry on forward, so here we see an insect carrying something on his back moving forward so he is very# strong#.\<br></br>The #insect# was so# strong# it could bend the #bow# just using one #elbow#.
弱	Don't leave your *bows* outside in the cold! The *ice* will make the wood and string# weak#.\<br></br>Look at the two *bows* and you'll see it looks like *feathers* at the base of the *bows*. So, imagine two indian children who are still too #weak# to pull a real bow, so their parents make two *bows* from two long *feathers*. Now the #weak# children can pretend they have real *bows* - *Two feather bows* (thanks to nukemarine).\<br></br>Two# weak# archers agree on a duel to the death. They constantly shoot at each other but never manage to hit their target. But what they lack in skill they make up in determination, and they keep shooting for hours, and days, and months, until it's wintertime and their BOWS are coated in ICE.--thanks to akrodha.
彈	The hunting *bow* was useful years ago, but now I can see a whole *list* of things wrong with it. Far easier to just #shoot# things with a gun and #bullet#.\<br></br>Here we are on a Japanese# bullet# train – specifically, the Tokaido# bullet# train. It moves through its *list* of stations so fast (Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, with many in between) that it may as well have been shot from a giant *bow*. (I hope imagining that makes you smile!).\<br></br>A# bullet# ("*bow*-let") preceding each *list* item. Here the first item is a *bow* and the second item is a *list* of subitems.\<br></br>Hunting with a *bow* is too complicated. I'm switching to something *simpler*--using a# bullet#.\<br></br>You want# bullet#s for your gun so you go to all the weapon stores on the official *list* of weapon stores. But since guns are banned in China, all of them are only selling *bows* and arrows.
佛	*Mr T* finds the way of #Buddha#, and converts to #Buddhism#, and has since re-nounced love for the mighty "evil" American *dollar*. He now wanders around bald and naked except an orange robe - It's because he's found new spirituality and not just because he can't find work..oh no..\<br></br>Imagine that the# Buddha# tells *Mitt Romney* that all the *dollar signs* on US bills should be replaced with the word ‘compassion.’ [Actually I'm not sure that dollar notes actually have dollar signs on them, but there you are.].\<br></br>You need to follow the way of #Buddha# otherwise you will suffer the wrath of *Chuck Norris.* The *dollar sign* is another proof as failing at it. Originaly its shape was a perfect circle (the unique money meant to gather everyone) but since the famous back kick of *Chuck Norris*, its shape turned out to a twisted *bow* and a pair of *crutches* for the irreversible sequelae.
費	Imagine a group of American bakers spending thousands of *dollars* *on seafood* (clams) in one night. Doesn't matter to them, and they'll claim it all back on their #expense# accounts.\<br></br>This the story of a *shell* that is the accountant of Poseidon. To being more recognizable, Poseidon has carved a *dollar sign* on his top. His daily job is to record the #expense# accounts of Poseidon. // DOLLAR SIGN: An inverted dollar sign that looks like a *bow* mixed with a pair of *crutches.*.\<br></br>"Show me your# expense# report!" ".....No!!" -grabs the report- "What!! You spent all your *dollars* on *CLAMS*!!??".\<br></br>You must do your# expense# reports to keep your accounting consistent! I know we all refer to money as "shells" here, but in an# expense# report, you simply can't use that term-- you have to use a dollar sign, otherwise people will think you actually paid in shells!
弟	My #younger brother# is so *horny*, he decided to visit a cheap five-*dollar* hooker! Unfortunately this led to him catching crabs. When he went back and complained, the hooker replied "It was $5 - what did you expect, lobsters?". (boom tish..).\<br></br>Imagine someone has a very communist# younger brother#.

This guy is *somebody* in the science field, but he has a *mishapen nose* and talks in a boring monotone, almost like he's had a *stroke*.\<br></br>This is a nose that hooks down and has a long stick through it-- a really crazy nose-piercing, in other words. You see# somebody# with that crazy piercing as you walk down the street, and you can't help but stare at him. Your friend asks, "do you know that guy?" and you're kind of embarrassed to admit you've been staring at a stranger, so you just say "oh yeah, he's# somebody# I know.".\<br></br>This person with the prominent *nose* and paunch is certainly# somebody#. In fact, it is none other than *Sir Henry Merrivale*.\<br></br>(Thanks to aphasiac for help with the story) “Somebody call 911! This person has seriously messed up his body!” What has happened? Well, you’re in science class, and# somebody# by accident let a *drop* of sulfuric acid fall into his *eye*. This seriously damaged the eye; the right side of it has swollen down, and the bottom has puffed out to the left. Worse yet, he’s now having a *stroke* cutting through his body.# Somebody# help him!

謝	Our *science nerd* uses *words* to *say* #thanks# to the jock for turning him from a scared nerd into a man - but also to #appologise# for *shooting* him with a glue-gun.\<br></br>When a "#thank# you" is really sincere, the *words* *shoot* straight from one heart into another.\<br></br>Here you are writing a# thank#-you note to your aunt and uncle for two very different presents: a dictionary (from your uncle) and a sniper rifle (from your aunt). In the# thank#-you note, you say, “Thank you for the dictionary, it has so many *words* that I can learn. And# thank# you for the sniper rifle, I've taken it out to the target range and it *shoots* great!”.
老	so I'm going to use primitive *angry old neighbour*.
考	You're studying to #take an exam#, but your *annoying old neighbour* keeps banging on the wall, telling you to keep quiet and stop studying. Eventually you resort to firing at his windows with a *slingshot*.\<br></br>There are now so many children in the world that it would take *Santa Claus* way too much time to visit everyone personally. Instead, he decides to distribute gifts using a *slingshot*. But since this is a difficult skill, he needs to# take an exam# first.\<br></br>Here you are #taking an exam# on December 23. You wish that someone would take a *slingshot* and *slingshot* you out of the exam room and into your living room on Christmas Eve where you could rest and spend time with *Santa Claus*.
烤	You *take an exam* in cookery. First question - how do you #roast# something? Answer: With *fire* of course!!\<br></br>(Continued from aphasiac's 955.) After confronting the *old man* for interrupting your *exam* studying, you put him over a fire and# roast# him.\<br></br>You *take an exam* and, well, it goes terribly. You then throw the test into the *fire* and let the flames# roast# the paper black so that no one will know just how bad you did.\<br></br>I just *took an exam*. They *fired* so many questions at me that I feel like a# roast#ed duck right now.\<br></br>Peking Ducks are all# ROAST#ED over a FIRE, of course, but before being accepted to be# roast#ed, each must also TAKE A very stringent EXAM.\<br></br>Wanna# roast# it? Have you considered fire?
孝	When a *child* learns that the *Santa Claus* that gives them their presents is actually their parents, they grow immensely in# filial piety#.\<br></br>#Filial piety# is literally the Asian concept that a *child* must *support / carry* his parents, older relatives and other older members of society, without question. Even if they're angry and horrid like our *annoying old neighbour* - in fact# filial piety# is the only reason his *child* comes to visit him.\<br></br>#Filial piety# is a Confucius concept that *children* must support and respect their seniors, no matter what. If *children* do not embrace the #filial piety# belief, their parents may warn them that *Santa Claus* will not bring them presents for Christmas.
教	In Nazi Germany, *Hitler* made every school# teach# the concept of *filial piety*, as it was important to his dreams of a better Germany and the rise of the Arian race.\<br></br>This character can also mean religion. Some believe that religions are nothing but institutional *taskmasters* that tell you what you can and can’t do. But that’s not correct. Religions are positive because, among other things, they# teach# appropriate values like *filial piety* (the fourth commandment: Honor thy father and thy mother).
者	Our *dirty annoying old neighbour* just wants# someone# to love, but his best *days* are behind him now. So rather than go out in the *sun* and look for a real woman, he went online and bought a *lovedoll* (this will be the meaning of this primitive!).\<br></br>#Someone#’s *wagging tongue* informed Tom’s own# someone# that on Christmas *day*, *Santa Claus* was going to give her an engagement ring. A wonderful surprise, completely ruined -- and this makes the Christmas *day* lower than it should be (which is why *day* is at the bottom of this character).\<br></br>*Santa Claus* comes down the chimney too late - night is over and it's already the *day*. Since the whole family is already awake, when he gets down to the living room, #someone# sees him, and it makes for a really awkward moment! See <a href="/study/kanji/12">day</a> <span class="index">(#12)</span>.\<br></br>#Someone# came into our house and dropped off a #Santa Claus puppet# on Christmas *day*. If that# someone# wasn't *Santa Claus*, then who was it?\<br></br>The top is part of the word for an old man, so think of this as# someone# to hold and cherish for the rest of your days-- your counterpart of an old married couple.\<br></br>#Someone# slashed this Hanzi because it doenst make any sense. *soil* over *day* must mean something to# someone#. but no.\<br></br>The ventriloque's job is to pretend to be #someone# else. This ventriloque is speaking through a *Santa Claus* #puppet# by moving the *tongue in the mouth* of the #puppet#.
著	As soon as the *lovedoll* arrives in the post, the dirty old man decides to de-*flower* her, by do#-ing# it and do#-ing# it for days!\<br></br>Simplified: The keyword is associated with another character and this character is associated with another keyword. Strange ! Simplified-[着]-[#-ing#]: Pull#-ing# the *wool* over one's *eyes*.________________ Simplified-[著]-[#Author (v.)#]: The ventriloque with a *Santa Claus puppet* is #authoring# a new skit in which he will wear a *flower* shirt. The *puppet* will make fun of his new clothings.\<br></br>*Flowers* and *puppets*? "*Someone*" (ahem, you!) must be right in the act of watch#-ing# a marionette show. Now stop checking your watch, it is impolite! See <a href="/study/kanji/959">someone</a> <span class="index">(#959)</span>.\<br></br>An old married couple doesn't give each other fancy jewelry for their anniversary-- just a single flower, to represent the simple beauty of all their time together, talk-ing, laugh-ing, sing-ing, dance-ing, and everything they've done over the years.\<br></br>You attempt to watch a Youtube video on a 56 kilobyte modem. All you see are the words “buffer#-ing# . . . buffe#r-ing# . . . buffer#-ing# . . .” after 5 minutes you decide to spend an hour planting *flowers* and stitching together a *Santa Claus puppet*, yet when you finish, the video is still buffer-#ing#!
豬	The *lovedoll* comes sprayed with a power aphrodisiac, so get owners "in the mood". Unfortunately this pheromone also works on #pigs#, and attracts a female #pig# (*sow*) into the house, which attacks and humps the *lovedoll*!\<br></br>Your pet# pig# is a very affectionate *sow* who is very lonely because there’s no ‘special *someone*’ in her life. To make up for it, you buy many# pig#let *puppets* and put them in her pen to keep her company. She loves it! She spends the whole day nurturing these *puppets* and sleeping next to them, believing that she’s a busy mother. It’s pretty adorable.\<br></br>Ms.# Pig#gy and her love puppet (Kermit). Media portrayals of# pig#s are never nice.
追	Maestro primitive will mean *James Bond*, the famous spy who wears a tux. Story: *James Bond* gives #chase# to the villain on the road. but instead of a car-chase, he's running after him along the *road* on foot!\<br></br>You're driving down the *road* when you come across a very strange situation: A tuxedo-wearing *maestro* is running down the middle of the *road* #chasing# after his own car! How could something like this happen?\<br></br>Here we have a wannabe *maestro* who is #chasing# a position at one of the “Big Five” orchestras in the U.S. (New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia or Cleveland), thinking that would put him on the *road* to riches, fame and happiness. With a motive like that, it’s no wonder that he’s rejected by all of them!
帥	The #handsome# and #smart# *James Bond* is with a lady who's just had a shower - and he #commands her# to drop her *towel*! "Oh #commander# Bond" she squeals as he throws her passionately onto the bed..\<br></br>Simplified 帅# Commander# = *saber*, *towel*.\<br></br>Here we have a Navy# commander#. He’s so brilliant at positioning ships, aircraft and missiles that he’s considered the *maestro* of the seas. But commanding a navy gets exhausting and makes him sweat buckets, so he has to periodically wipe his forehead with a hand *towel*. Sound: shuai4 You tell a *Japanese* (my code word for 4th tone) friend: “don’t be so shuai (shy) about girls. You’re as handsome as James Bond, the Navy# commander#!”.
師	Imagine if *James Bond* was your school #teacher#! Each lesson would be about spying and defeating baddies - for instance, he teaches you how to escape from a room by tying a *towel* to the *ceiling*, and using it as a rope.
獅	*James Bond the teacher* is teaching his class when one kid asks him how escape from a #lion#. He recounts that in one of his films, he was being chased by a *pack of wild dogs*, and then ran into a #lion#. Totally surrounded, he ran into luck as the dogs and big cat started fighting, allowing him to escape.\<br></br>In China, the #lion# is not called the king of animals, but the TEACHER of BEASTS.\<br></br>Everything is seemingly fine in the classroom until the *teacher* turns around and sees a *pack of wild dogs* being chased right into the room by a #lion#! See <a href="/study/kanji/964">teacher</a> <span class="index">(#964)</span>.\<br></br>This *pack of wild dogs* is tremendously excited that their teacher in hunting prey will be a *lion*.
官	*James Bond* has had his gun taken away (the top drop) and now he spends all the time at home or at the office, filling in paper-work. the life of a #bureaucrat# is certainly not as exciting as spying..\<br></br>The top# bureaucrat#s are truly *maestros* of government, and only the *White House* can appoint them. But they conduct without batons (hence no top stroke), but rather, with paperwork.
管	*James Bond* may now be a *bureaucrat*, but he smokes a hand-carved*bamboo* #pipe# he was given by a lady in Asia. He does so to fondly remind him of his days as a spy.\<br></br>You have a beautiful carved *bamboo*# pipe# that you’re about to install in your house. Then a *bureaucrat* shows up who tells you that this is illegal;# pipe#s may only be made of metal or plastic. [Really visualize the# pipe# well. I was reviewing this character and had no clue how to write it because I never ingrained in my mind a picture of the# pipe#.].
父	Bill Cosby - a famous TV #father#. He's sitting in a Lazyboy with arms on the sides and legs stretched out and crossed. (thanks to Harrow).\<br></br>This# father# is so dedicated that he’s not taking a single bathroom break while watching his kids play in a baseball game. The first two strokes are just like in the Heisig story; the last two strokes are his crossed legs, a sign that he’s trying to ‘hold it in’.
交	Here, *Bill Cosby* is an old man, he can't give up his party lifestyle. Once a week he still dons his cool *top hat* (well, it was cool 40 years ago) and goes out on the town to #mingle# with the ladies. (thanks onsen_monkey).\<br></br>Wearing a *top hat*, Darth Vader tries to #mingle# with high society by saying "I'm your *father*!" to everyone.\<br></br>Your blue-collar, hard-working *father* puts on a *top hat* in an attempt to# mingle# with the 1 percent at a local country club. But he gets disgusted with their attitudes towards life, throws away the *top hat* and goes back to his loving family.\<br></br>The teenage girl's dorky father, in an effort to# mingle# with her friends during her slumber party, puts on his top hat and prepares to put on a tap dancing show for them, much to her chagrin.
效	*Bill Cosby* once went out *mingling* in a *Hitler* costume. Unfortunately it had a bad #effect# on his chance of finding a lazy, and it had a bad #effect# on his reputation!\<br></br>Every# effect# needs an equal but opposite# effect#. Here we have the happy, #mingling# male father opposed by the stern, unpleasant female *taskmaster*.\<br></br>Think of ‘side# effect#s’ to remember this character. You take a drug to help you sleep better but it has a terrible side #effect#: when you *mingle* with family or friends, it turns out that you act like you’re in the former *Imperial Japanese Army*.\<br></br>*Bill Cosby* once went out *mingling* at one of *Hitler*'s parties, and was never seen again. Not the #effect# he wanted.\<br></br>Think of that annoying *taskmaster* at work who 'delegates' tasks to you, but *mingles* with all the details. His intention is to make sure the work is done properly, but it actually has the opposite# effect#.\<br></br>Hitler's heard that a game called Mass# Effect# is very popular, but he doesn't know what it's about. He decides he wants to become popular by# effect#ing the masses, so he mingles with commoners, trying to have an# effect# on them so they'll all start to like him.\<br></br>It also means imitate so I will say people are mingling around the taskmaster imitating her behind her back.
較	Think of the phrase ‘#relatively# speaking’ (thanks Mom!) to remember this character. You get in a really bad car crash that was completely your fault (though fortunately no one was injured). How to explain this to a stern police officer? You explain, “Officer, my *car* *mingled* with his *car*,# relatively# speaking.”.\<br></br>Even the most kind, gentle, and pleasant of fathers like to show off to other fathers: here they are *mingling* and establishing their #relative# worth through comparing their #car#s, a surrogate for their penis size.
校	In secular #school#, the social mixity can be pictured as a giant *tree* of knowledge under which all kids *mingles* together without distinctive signs.\<br></br>In the #school#-yard, the kids *mingle* around a large *tree*, playing under the shade of it's branches.\<br></br>All the kids who decide to skip classes at# school# *mingle* behind a giant *tree* outside where no teacher or staff member will see them.\<br></br>There is a trend amongst #mingling# fathers to hide behind #trees# in the #school#yard to keep an eye on their daughters to make sure they are staying out of trouble. Indeed, it is quite comical in that behind every #tree# is a father!
足	Bottom part will mean *mend*, like the kanji site. Story: You scream with your *mouth* agape as a doctor *mends* your broken #lower leg# and #foot#. (you've been run over by a car!).\<br></br>This pirates #lower leg# (from the kneecap to the foot) was taken off by the *mouth* of a shark and replaced with a #wooden leg#, so now wherever he goes he leaves a trail of circular *footprints*. (Thx to anon).\<br></br>I will name this primitive “Paralympics” on occasion, as it’s an event where people with *wooden legs* can also compete. I might also go for "prosthetic leg" sometimes.
跑	A *pirate with a wooden leg* #runs# every morning, to keep fit! But to keep his *wooden leg* safe, he wraps it up in plastic to stop it getting wet with mud or rain, and going rotten.\<br></br>When you go# run#, if you don't want the beavers to get your *wooden leg*, you'd better #wrap# it first to disguise it.\<br></br>Here you are *wrapping* your *wooden leg* to your upper leg with athletic tape in order to# run# the mile# run# in the *Paralympics*; this# run# *wraps* up the *Paralympics*. If it’s not on tight enough it will fall off, so you need to *wrap* and *wrap* and *wrap* that *wooden leg* as much as possible so that you can# run# for the gold. [While I use# run# as a noun in this story too, the character is for the verb 'to# run#.'].
跳	At the zoo I saw a *turtle* with 2 *wooden legs*. amazingly because it's legs are even less mobile, it now #jumps# and #hops# everywhere instead of walking! quite a sight, can you imagine it?\<br></br>You have seen it all too often: #jump#ing too much while playing Dance Dance Revolution is a #portent# that you will at some point require a *wooden leg* to replace your damaged knee.\<br></br>You are walking along a creepy forest path when you see a bloody *wooden leg* left on the side of the road: a really bad *portent*. Then you get really nervous and #jump# at the slightest noise. It's time to leave! See <a href="/study/kanji/973">lower leg</a> <span class="index">(#973)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/223">portent</a> <span class="index">(#223)</span>.\<br></br>What a *turtle* would really like to be able to do with its *feet* is# jump#.
路	Army guy - "This is a #path# laid with mines!. I've lost one leg already and do not want a second *wooden leg* to match the first, I must take great care so i radio the base every step of the way with my *walkie talkie*.. (thanks to CharleyGarrett).\<br></br>*Each* competitor has followed the exact same# path# to reach the *Paralympics*, a# path# marked by sweat, tears, struggle, self-doubt and perseverance. Picture this scene in your mind -- *each* *Paralympics* athlete, some in wheelchairs, some with *wooden legs*, walking down a figurative *path* with the *Paralympics* in the distance.\<br></br>There is this #path# that has a statue with a *wooden leg* at the entrance. I take *each* girl I date there. I take the girl to a secluded part of the #path#, where I show her my *wooden "leg"*, hoping she would put her *mouth* between my *walking legs*.\<br></br>Army guy - 'This is a# path# laid with mines!. I've lost ONE LEG already, and if you don't watch out, you're going to lose what's BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.' (thanks to aphasiac).\<br></br>You have a *wooden leg* #for each# type of# path#.
露	Someone has spilled a 2-liter bottle of Mountain# Dew# on the *path* leading up to your residence. It’s sticky and wet and now ants are crawling around in it. Gross! You hope that *rain* will come soon and wash all this Mountain# Dew# off your *path*.\<br></br>Whenever my garden *path* is wet, it's either from *rain* or morning #dew#.\<br></br>The world was on a *path* to the worst *weather* ever: nuclear winter. So Bonnie Dobson wrote the song "Morning #Dew#" to warn the people about the dangers of nuclear weapons. See <a href="/study/kanji/396">rain</a> <span class="index">(#396)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/976">path</a> <span class="index">(#976)</span>.\<br></br>#Dew# appears on a *path* that has been *rained* on.\<br></br>The# dew# is so thick on the #path# that it's flooding things! It's worse than #rain#.
骨	The most famous #skeleton# is of course *Skeletor*! The top primitive is his *jawbone*, then he wears a crown as he believes he is the true ruler of Eternia. Then at the bottom, despite being a #skeleton# he has *flesh*, and actually those *parts of his body* are very muscular!\<br></br>A *jawbone* is a part of the #skeleton#, which is *part of the body*. See <a href="/study/kanji/13">month</a> <span class="index">(#13)</span>.\<br></br>#Skeleton# head on *body*. Can be looking left (simplified PRC joke?) or right. Bone.\<br></br>#Skeleton#s and bones look a lot like teeth, but these are actually different *parts of the body.* The top half shows a tooth. The first two strokes are the hard enamel that covers a tooth; the next two are the pulp. The right side of the tooth has been withered away so the pulp is nearly exposed on that side. This necessitates a dental *crown*. But, as I said, while# skeleton#s look like teeth, they’re different *parts of the body.*.
滑	If you were to give #water# to a #skeleton# to drink, the result would be a# slippery# puddle on the ground!
過	Why did Jaws# cross# the road? To get to the other tide.\<br></br>If you were to# cross# over a pile of bovine *jawbones* left on the *road*, perhaps in Arizona or some other arid climate, the result would be a resounding crunch.\<br></br>Hyf.\<br></br>#ET# switches his *CB aerial* that he used for terrestial #orientation - 向# for a *Square Duplex antenna* to# cross# the galactic #hiway# on his way home.\<br></br>You're walking down the *road* and you see a thuggish looking guy with an enormous protruding *jawbone* coming toward you. Uh, better #cross# to the other side.
阿	(Thanks aphasiac and dingomick for help) The *Burj Khalifa* is so high that you *can* see what the# Apollo# astronauts left on the lunar surface with your native eye. “No, you *can* not!” “Yes, you can!” (OK, you can’t.) Note: I am using *Burj Khalifa* as the *pinnacle* in my stories, as the Burj, the world's tallest manmade structure, is the *pinnacle* of the manmade world.\<br></br>as this hanzi is used as an abbreviation of the country. Primitive: *The Pinnacle* is a dream-like hotel at the top of a mount. This allows for innumerable stories for all the kanji with this primitive since you have a whole city to work with. Also prevents confusion with "mountain". Story: *Can* you see #Afghanistan# from *The Pinnacle hotel*? I *can*! I *can*! (thanks to dingomick).
啊	If I found myself in *Afghanistan*, my *mouth* would scream #aah!#, help, the Taliban!!!\<br></br>As the handsome god *Apollo* descended from the heavens surrounded by beams of sunlight, all the Greek women opened their *mouth* and went# aah!#\<br></br>All of the scientists scream# AAH!# out of their *mouths* as they ascend in the *Apollo*. They are realizing what a tin *can* it really is.\<br></br>Imagine that Walter Cronkite’s *mouth* gave out a big# aah!# when *Apollo* 11 landed on the moon.\<br></br>If Apollo had a mouth that is what he would say. He would say Ahh! Ahh is Apollo.
際	It's a special #occasion# at the * Pinnacle Hotel*! They're having a *penis festival* and live *circumcision* - fun!\<br></br>On# occasion#, and on special# occasion#s, you sometimes see an Arab billionaire drop a briefcase of money off the *Burj Khalifa* as a way of *offering sacrifice* of a few million dollars of oil wealth to God.\<br></br>On special# occasion#s, when the gods were angry, the Parthenon in the *Acropolis* would be the scene of a bloody *offer sacrifice* (hundreds of boys would be circumcised simultaneously).\<br></br>Simplified 际 : It's a really special# occasion# when the altar is moved from the church/temple to the peak.\<br></br>On the# occasion# of *offering a sacrifice* at *Weathertop*.\<br></br>Let the "pinnacle" radical mean Hakurei Reimu from Touhou. Reimu's idea of a special# occasion# is to perform a ritual at her shrine-- specifically, a virgin sacrifice ritual. Who knows what poor soul is going to be the victim...
險	Simplified-#险# . There have been many deaths at the #Pinnacle# caused by people attending #rave# parties - recreational drugs and high-rise balconies is a# perilous# mixture - bungy jumps without the rubber-band......\<br></br>One of the most# perilous# things to do would be to go to the *Acropolis* to have a *debate* with the gods.\<br></br>A *debate* at the *Pinnicle Hotel* can be #perilous#. this is because if it gets too heated, one party can just throw the other person off the peak, and their body will never be found. It's happened a few times..\<br></br>The candidates for head of Dubai’s government square off in a# perilous# *debate* atop the *Burj Khalifa*. They discuss oil and foreign policy but especially fear of heights, since if they fall off, they’ll be peril-ized (paralyzed) (OK, most likely killed).\<br></br>On the way to the great *debate* (the Council of Elrond) much of the soon to be Fellowship found themselves in a most# perilous# situation at *Weathertop*.\<br></br>All of Gensokyo debates about what kind of person Reimu is, but the one thing everyone can agree on is that her danmaku skills are# perilous#.\<br></br>Simplified-[险]-[1437]: In these #perilous# times, the greeks were under attack. They installed a *hootenanny* at the Athenian Acropolis (the greek *pinacle*) to send messages by night (prevent interception).\<br></br>Debating on the pinnacle can be# perilous#. Just ask Socrates or Aristotle.
隨	You : "the #Pinnacle# Hotel " . Taxi Driver : "# As you wish# , Sir .... Sir, on the #left# side of this #road# are the #flesh# pots of our city .. Is sir interested in #flesh# delights ? I can recommend.... " You:" You grubby little pimp ! The #Pinnacle# at once !". Taxi Driver : "# As you wish# ....\<br></br>You want to get to the *Pinnacle*, it's your life's ambition! You ask a poor begger to take your there, he says #as you wish#. Take a *left*, then *left* and another *left*, and leave all your *meat* on the *road*, as they have strict quarantine rules.\<br></br>says the Russian with a wry smile, pleased that the snub has had its intended effect.\<br></br>A man went up to the *Acropolis* for guidance from the gods. The instructions he received were to "stay on the *left* side of the *road*, and only travel by the light of the *moon*". As with most advice from the gods, it didn't make any sense to him, but this man knew better than to argue and just said:# as you wish#.\<br></br>I'm using the keyword *fleshlight* to represent the 左+月 primitive, because it's like an I-beam that you keep at your side to be used ON your meat. Also, it feels like using your left hand. #As you wish# then refers to your desire to use a *fleshlight* on yourself while driving up *Pinnacle Road*.\<br></br>Left is sometimes associated with sinister, so sinister flesh = your evil clone. I've always felts my life would be easier if there was another me, so I traveled up a long road to meet the shrine maiden Reimu to see if she can help me. She grimaces a little-- she knows exactly what might go wrong-- but she knows I traveled a long way, so she just says "as you wish...".\<br></br>Dubai is deep in debt after a crash in oil prices when they’re contacted by a Russian oligarch who is considering investing in the city. He tells Dubai’s government that he will put five billion dollars into the city if, and only if, he gets ten floors on the *Burj Khalifa* all to himself, he’s allowed to drive on the *left* side of all of the *roads* in Dubai, and he gets a crater on the *moon* named after him. The government simply says, #as you wish#. It’s a deal.\<br></br>The Empire was at the *pinnacle* of its power. Seated on the Death Star (which looks like a small *moon*), Darth Vader's *left*-hand man criticized Vader for his sorcerous *ways*, and in turn Vader does his force thing. .... Anyway, eventually the senior official tells Vader to knock it off and so Vader does, saying, "#As you wish#." This helps: http://bit.ly/oIWtf9 [Simplified version] just replace left and moon with possession: Vader using the force to possess the lieutenant.\<br></br>You could get to the #pinnacle# by taking the right hand track in daylight. Or you could go #left# by #moon#light by the *road* (#as you wish#).\<br></br>If you've seen the Princess Bride, you know that all Wesley ever said to Buttercup was "# as you wish# ." This character tells us that he retired to *Mt. Olympus* and once you get there take the first *left* along the *road* and look for the *meat* because he's a butcher now.
陽	What in the world does# Yang# mean? (You have to find out for your class on Eastern religions.) Apparently there’s a man atop the *Burj Khalifa* who will tell you. Once you’ve saved up enough in your *piggy bank* you’ll go and ask him.\<br></br>Too vague - I'm changing keyword to #sunshine# (a word this hanzi is used in). Story: The *Pinnacle* is environmentally friendly. They collect #solar# power through #sunshine# on their *piggybank* shaped solar arrays.\<br></br>阳 Those infused with# Yang# find it *easy* to climb the * pinnacle* ① (in Chinese thought)# yang#, the masculine or positive principle in nature (opp. 阴 yin) ② the sun.\<br></br>#Yang# is the great *piggy bank* at the *pinnacle* of the sky: the Sun.\<br></br>Reimu is a shrine maiden, so she doesn't just see sunshine as light or heat, but as an embodiment of the concept of# Yang#.
陳	The *East* is #exhibiting# jealousy at the *Burj Khalifa*. From 1998 to 2010 (first with the Petronas Towers, and then with Taipei 101) the *East* possessed the title of the world’s tallest building. But now the *Burj Khalifa* has won that title. All you can say is that the *Burj Khalifa* #exhibits# the oil wealth of the Middle *East*.\<br></br>Once a year the * Pinnacle* #exhibits# some *eastern* paintings, from *eastern* artists. Unfortunately this special arty occasion is usually ruined by the# exhibit#ionists who live there and like to walk around the hotel compound naked..\<br></br>A museum #exhibit## exhibit#ing the *pinnacle* of *eastern* art. -- thanks jennifu.\<br></br>The museum has an# exhibit# about the pinnacle of art and culture, with amazing artifacts from the East. Some of these artifacts might be from Hakurei Shrine...
防	The owners of the *Burj Khalifa* are determined to #ward off# any terrorist attack that may be attempted on the building. Security guards are thus positioned at the base of the *Burj Khalifa* in all 360 *compass* *directions*, all day and all night, ready to# ward off# an attack on the *Burj Khalifa* from any *direction*.\<br></br>*Weathertop* is a strategic position from which you can #ward off# enemies from every *direction*: even when they are undead Ringwraiths! -- thanks aphasiac.\<br></br>The *Pinnacle* is so high you can see in every *direction* and can# ward off# attacks or invasions. That's what makes it so perfect and safe (thanks to jabberwockychortles).\<br></br>Part of Reimu's job is to# ward off# evil from all directions.
附	At the * Pinnacle*, whenever you *pay* your hotel bill you get a free gift #attach#-ed to the receipt! usually it's a little toy or keyring - cute!\<br></br>Imagine that after completing its construction, the contractor #attached# a giant receipt to the side of the *Burj Khalifa*, politely asking investors to “*pay* this amount” for its construction.\<br></br>A sign was# Attach#ed on the PINNACLE of the Acropolis telling tourists they should pay extra money due to the economic crisis. Oh those Greeks.\<br></br>Dividing this hanzi up into three primitive elements since *glue* is so useful for #attach#: Did you know that oddly enough, *Mr. T.*, the world's toughest guy, actually is afraid of heights! So up at the top of the *pinnacle*, he #attaches# himself to you like *glue* and won't let go! See <a href="/study/kanji/766">pay</a> <span class="index">(#766)</span>.\<br></br>At the *pinnacle* of its power, Ancient Rome was ruled from the *pinnacle* of the Palatine hill. #Attached# to the core empire were a number of client kingdoms, which are so to speak #in the vicinity#. They were kept #attached# because the Emperors *payed* them for their loyalty.\<br></br>There is a sign# ATTACH#ED to the PINNACLE saying that you have to PAY to be admitted.--thanks to ruuku35.\<br></br>Beware of pickpockets on the Greek *pinnacle*. After *pay*ing your entrance to the Athenian Acropolis, the guide warns you to #attach# your camera with a strap which naturally you're going to *pay*! Once you return home, you will need to *pay* the software update to #attach# your camera to *Pinnacle* Studio in order to create a movie of your trip.
院	At the *Pinnacle* they just just *finished* building a huge Hanzi / Hesig #Inst.#, (institute) where you can study chinese characters and mandrain. People now flock there, so help *finish* their chinese studies.\<br></br>Imagine that as the Burj Dubai was running out of money during its construction, an emergency# Inst.# was set up called the “*Finish* the *Burj Dubai*# Inst.#” whose job was to raise money from someone, anyone, to make sure they did *finish* it. Well Mr. Khalifa chipped in to *finish* the *Burj Khalifa* (which now bears his name), so the# Inst.# was a success.”.\<br></br>*Weathertop* was supposed to be the site of a great #Institution#, but it was never *finished*.
陣	If the *Pinnacle* is ever attacked, they line up all *vehicles* around the top in #battle formation#, just to drive down and crush any attackers.\<br></br>The UAE is trying to show off its military, so it lines up all of its military *cars* in# battle formation# in front of the *Burj Khalifa*. Unfortunately other countries poke fun at them because they’ve also set a world record for the world’s smallest# battle formation#.\<br></br>In a fan-fic version of the *Weathertop* scene, the Fellowship shows up in toy *cars* to assume #battle formation# against the Ringwraiths.\<br></br>Battle of the Bulge. The cars of war (tanks) lined up on the pinnacle (Ardennes) waiting for battle.
隊	The #Pinnacle# used to host a football #team#, made up of an old army #squadron#. But they were *horny pigs* and abused the female guests, until they were all kicked out.\<br></br>In Pinnacle City, the most popular football# team# are the Pinnacle Razorbacks. Razorbacks are, after all, a type of sow that has horns.\<br></br>The *Burj Khalifa* is struggling to raise enough money to pay off construction fees (remember {frame 990}?. They decide to try to attract money and tourists by staging the world’s largest Super Smash Brothers# team# battle inside the *Burj Khalifa*. The prize for winning is a large *sow* that has *horns* glued to it that the winner promptly sells to a UAE billionaire for, like, a million dollars.\<br></br>Another LotR fan-fic. This time the Ringwraiths are a bunch of *horny pigs* who form an impromptu soccer #team# on *Weathertop* and play against the Fellowship.\<br></br>As part of the festival, the statues are put on carts and then hauled in procession to the top of the *pinnacle* by# team#s of #pigs#.
降	The proper, high-class way to# descend# the mountain of *The Pinnacle* is wearing a *monocle* with your *walking legs* splayed to a full gentlemanly stride. (thanks to wingedge).\<br></br>Alain Robert ascends the outside of the *Burj Khalifa* with his *walking legs*, and as he *descends* he is presented with a diamond-encrusted *monocle* by an oil sheik. He politely declines it because he doesn’t want to# descend# into materialism, and promptly moves away from the *Burj Khalifa* and away from the *monocle*.\<br></br>Having defeated the Nazgul, Frodo #decends# from *Weathertop*, smugly swinging his *walking legs* and adjusting his *monocle*, which had gotten a little foggy.
階	At the *Pinnacle*, *all* buildings contain #stairs# - no lifts allowed, even if they're 10 storeys! this is to keep *all* residents fit and healthy!!\<br></br>Simplified 阶# stairs# = *pinnacle*, *introduce*. Story: You are scheduled to *introduce* yourself to the CEO in his office at the top of the *Burj Khalifa*, but the elevators are out of service! Looks like you will have to take the# stairs#, and you better start hussling if you don't want to be late!\<br></br>The# stairs# to *The Pinnacle* are the longest. Add up *all* the other# stairs# in the world and the# stairs# to *The Pinnacle* will still be longer.\<br></br>The *Burj Khalifa* is so tall that it contains more# stairs# that *All* the other buildings in the world combined! However, few people have the stamina to climb them *all*. *Compare* how *white* the# stairs# at the very top are with the grubby ones at the bottom.\<br></br>#Stairs# have now been cut into the rock from the city up to the top of the *pinnacle* so #all# who want to can visit.\<br></br>To ascend to the *pinnacle* of the Mountains of Mordor, one must climb *all* the #stairs# of Cirith Ungol. The simplified character replaces *all* with *jammed in*, emphasizing how truly *jammed in* against the mountain those #stairs# to the *pinnacle* really were.\<br></br>You have to climb all the# stairs# up the pinnacle to Hakurei Shrine... it's supposed to be a test of character and patience, but it's just annoying.
穴	In my *house*, a creature with *eight* legs (a spider) lives in a #hole# in the *roof*! it's creepy, huge and gross but it's been there since I moved in, so i leave it be. Primitive will mean *Paris Hilton* (a vacious creature with a# hole# where her brain should be).\<br></br>You’re so confident about your pool skills that you tell everyone at your *house* party that if you sink the *eight* ball in the# hole#, drinks will be on the *house* (in other words, you’ll pay for them). Alas, you do indeed sink the *eight* ball in the# hole#, so all drinks are on the *house*, and you have to pay for about *eight* *houses'* worth of beer as a result.\<br></br>Nosotros cuando nos hacemos un #agujero# decimos que nos hemos hecho un siete. Para los chinos el único #agujero# que les importa lo tienen en *casa*, rima con *ocho* y está entre unas *piernas*. #xué, jué#.\<br></br>A #hole# in the *roof* is home to an *eight*-legged spider. -- thanks aphasiac.
究	Scientist wants to carry out sex #research#, using *Paris hilton* and a *baseball team*. Of course *Paris* jumps *on top* of them all immediately, and ruins the study.\<br></br>You# research# the best way to hit golf balls for your career, which everyone laughs at (since they think you’re wasting your life). But then you hit *nine* *holes* in one (in a row) at a golf tournament due to your# research# and win tons of prize money – enough to mean that you don’t have to do any more# research# (and indeed you don’t!).\<br></br>Of course there are scientists that# research# the nine (?!) planets, but the really groundbreaking# research# nowadays is to study the nine black holes.\<br></br>Just shortening up KBurchfiel's story: Your #research# on golf ball aerodynamics really pays off when you hit *nine* *holes*-in-one at a major golf tournament! Wow!! See <a href="/study/kanji/995">hole</a> <span class="index">(#995)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/9">nine</a> <span class="index">(#9)</span>.\<br></br>#Research# was conducted on the effect of *potholes* in the field on the performance of the *Yankees*.
突	*Paris Hilton* is being interviewed when she sees the cops - and# abruptly# drops her *small dog* on the floor below her and runs!\<br></br>You see a pot#hole# containing a *chihuahua*... slam on the brakes# abruptly# or you'll hit it!\<br></br>A *hole*# abruptly# opened and the *chihuahua* fell into it.\<br></br>“Abruptly . . .# abruptly# . . . how am I going to make a Hanzi story for the word# abruptly#?” you ask yourself while walking your *chihuahua”. Well, this might help – your *chihuahua*# abruptly# falls into a big *hole*in the road and you hope no one will run you over as you try to get him out.\<br></br>Toto was just happily walking along when he #abruptly# disappeared from sight: the poor little *chihuahua* had fallen in a *hole*.\<br></br>The *chihuahua's* yapping stopped #abruptly# when I tired of its noise and pushed it through the dog flap (a *hole* in the door) and into the cold outside (Thx to anon).
空	*Paris Hilton* kind find a real *job* or *work*, as her brain is #empty# and full of #air#.\<br></br>Your house is# empty#. There's a giant *hole* at the front door and your realize all you *work* has been stolen.\<br></br>You discover to your shock and horror that your pickup truck has an# empty# tank. How can this be? You just filled it with gas! Well unfortunately, there’s a giant *hole* in the underside of your tank. Imagine trying to weld an *I-beam* to the bottom of your truck to stop it from leaking, since otherwise it would take an immense amount of *work* to push your good-for-nothing pickup all the way home.\<br></br>You're *working* all day but really just spinning your wheels. You feel like all your *work* is being sucked into a black *hole* because by the end of the day, your output is #empty# and you've accomplished nothing. See <a href="/study/kanji/995">hole</a> <span class="index">(#995)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/72">work</a> <span class="index">(#72)</span>.\<br></br>It takes a lot of *work* to #empty# a *hole* of all its dirt.\<br></br>At the restaurant, you glare with annoyance at your# empty# glass. Upon closer inspection, though, you realize that actually, whatever was poured into your glass ate through it and bore a #hole# into the floor, revealing an *I-beam* underneath. Thank god whatever it was, you didn't drink it!
控	This character depicts how people# control# the Kinect: they move their *fingers* through *empty* space to# control# the action on the tv screen.\<br></br>Ultimate# control# is when your fingers press on nothing. Your mere authority# control#s remotely others.\<br></br>#Control# is not about taking things into your own *hands* but rather about taking them out: *emptying* your *hands*.\<br></br>You get your remote# control# and are about to use it, when you realise that the battery compartment is empty, you pry it open with your fingers (a lot of work to reach this small hole), but once it's open it slams shut on your fingers - severing them as they fall perfectly in to the battery slots.\<br></br>Karate Kid teacher: Ultimate# control# is when your *hands* touch nothing - just *empty space*. You have complete# control# without having to lay a hand.\<br></br>[This character is for the *verb*# control# but my story uses a noun to help me remember it.] Ground# control# learns from the astronauts that their rocket fuel tanks are *empty* and they have no clue how to get back to earth safely.

深	Primitive crown + human legs = *Japanese schoolgirl in miniskirt*. Story: a *Japanese schoolgirl* has fallen in #deep# *water*! she's all *wet* and splashing around, so she grabs hold of a washed away *tree* to stay afloat.\<br></br>Uh oh... you lost your *paper punch* in the# deep# #water#. If only it had been made of *wood*, it would have floated instead of sunk.\<br></br>Shen1. In the *deep* water, a *crown* made of *wood*.\<br></br>First, I will name the "paper punch" primitive *Taipei 101*. Why? This building looks a lot like *eight* giant *crowns* stacked on top of each other. And each *crown* that makes up *Taipei 101* is full of *human legs*. Imagine that the contractors for the *Taipei 101* are in# deep# *water* because it turns out that instead of using concrete for the *Taipei 101*’s foundation, they just used felled *trees* that happened to be nearby. (untrue).\<br></br>The map printed on this sheet of paper hides a #deep# secret but has been altered by the holes dug by a *paper puncher*. To … treasure, walk ... feet north of the *tree* then ... 8 ... along the ... *water*.
探	A dirty peeping-tom #spy# drills a #spy#-hole in his wall, so he can look at the girls dormitory next door. He strokes himself with his *finger*, watching the *japanese schoolgirl* undressing, until he gets *wood*..\<br></br>Playing the "I# spy# with my little eye" game. I# spy# a *Japanese schoolgirl* on top of a *tree*. The other guy doesn't believe it so I point towards the scene with my *finger*. I win.\<br></br>If your *hands* can go *deep*, into pockets for example, you would make a good #explorer-spy#. to explore; to search out; to scout; to visit; to stretch forward.\<br></br>If you want to be a# spy#, you have to have all kinds of skills. Hide a# spy# wire and a camera around your head like a crown, or hide a gun in your pants against your legs, or climb trees to hide. You also have to train your hand to be a quick draw.\<br></br>Tan4# Spy#-tan, I break your *arms* if you are the *spy* with a *crown* made of *wood* in your head.\<br></br>It turns out that the PRC government has planted a *spy* in the VIP room atop *Taipei 101* who can# spy# on millions of people in Taiwan with that unbeatable view. The Taiwanese government finds out and threatens to chop off the man’s *fingers*, but when the PRC offers to send a solid silver *tree* to Taiwan as a goodwill gesture, Taiwan relents.\<br></br>These spies communicate with one-time pads: the messages come in the form of #hole#s punched in *wood*, which you can feel with your fingers, even if you are a blind# spy#. Your one-time pad book gives meaning to the holes.
丘	This #hill# is actually an old warriors grave, buried under a #mound# of earth! you can tell because at the peak, there's an old rusty *axe* buried in the *floor*.\<br></br>The approval ratings for Capitol# Hill# have been driven into the *ground*. Why? Voters say that congressmen and senators are basically throwing *tomahawks* at each other without getting anything done.\<br></br>The# hill# is in the way: how silly it would be to try to chop it down to the ground - or *floor* - using a *tomahawk*.
兵	Strategically speaking, the best place for your# troops# to be is atop a hill; however, this hill is so steep that you need *animal legs* to scale it. (In this case, having a troop of furries, as horrible as that sounds, might actually be to your advantage, so picture a bunch of# troops# in animal costumes scaling the hill.).\<br></br>Many people in the U.S. have bumper stickers saying “support our# troops#.” Here’s one American’s plan for that: she makes many speeches inside Capitol *Hill* in favor of a bill that would give all# troops# a set of *animal legs* (in other words, a pet) for free, courtesy of the U.S. government. Because animals can give# troops# support also. Note that the second stroke in *tomahawk* is straight rather than curvy.\<br></br>This is very strange! This *hill* is moving magically. A closer look reveals that you misjudged the scale. What you're looking at is just a #troop# of centipedes which is carrying on its *animal legs* a clod of earth.
絲	Taking a tour of the# silk# factory you are astonished to see rows of spidermen making it in an assembly line.\<br></br>#Silk# 糹(simplified 纟) + Grade 1 kanji糸 = thread (but only 1488th) simplified 丝# Silk# takes the fine work of many *elbows*.

線	*Spider-Man* went for a dip fully clothed in a hot-*spring* (onsen). Now he's having to hang his uniform up on his washing-#line# to dry.\<br></br>Simplified-[线]-[1083]: Have you ever wondered why the *floats* in a parade always proceeded in a #line#, rather than side-by-side? The answer is that they are all attached together with a super strong *thread* and are being dragged by a tractor at the front! (Thx to anon).\<br></br>Xian4 A long *line* waiting near the hot-*spring* to *S-EE A N*aked woman.\<br></br>This kanji is used for train# line#s. SPIDERMAN does a hot SPRING tour of Japan using the train# LINE#S. You can see the Spidey costume hanging on the washing# LINE# as he enjoys the onsen.--jamestaverner.
維	Following from previous frame - *Spider-Man* is drying his uniform and so naked, when Aunt May walks in. Hw grabs a nearby frozen *turkey* and holds it over his exposed crotch, to #maintain# his dignity!\<br></br>I plan to use the word *Cardinal* (as in, the religious title) in place of *thread* for most stories. Why ‘cardinal’? Cardinals have awesome *threads* (meaning, clothing). Story: Imagine a *cardinal* who spends much of his day trying to# maintain# the faith by correcting errors, teaching young people, and so forth. But he also spends part of his day, with the Pope’s approval, #maintaining# a large *turkey* flock that he sends to a slaughterhouse in the fall to raise money for Catholic schools.\<br></br>*Spiderman* continues to# maintain# that the #turkey#'s child is not from the fruit of his loins(#silk thread#) - but the #turkey# insists that *Spiderman* helps# maintain# it - (the court will decide on the case in frame #1008#).\<br></br>Chickens may build their nests with straw (or brushes?), but they can only# maintain# them with some of the finest silk.\<br></br>Spider-Man is so desperate for not being able to# maintain# his erection with women.His psychoanalist told him not being able to# maintain# full erection is not organic problem. "Women cause you anxiety that's why you can't# maintain# your erection. Try something else bro..." So Spiderman is doing the turkey now as a safe alternative to women and he can# maintain# a fully erection!!!
羅	Spider man nets that lovely turkey with a# silk gauze#.\<br></br>Continuing Aphasiac's story from previous frame: There Spider-Man is in the kitchen trying to *maintain* a shred of decency by holding a frozen turkey in front of his naked body. His friend has seen the whole thing unfold and tries to help by throwing a *net* of #silk gauze# over him. It is somewhat helpful but only somewhat, because #silk gauze# is see-through! See <a href="/study/kanji/1007">maintain</a> <span class="index">(#1007)</span>.\<br></br>The judge ,with his# SILK GAUZE# wig states that as Spiderman had ensnared the TURKEY in his NET and impregnated the TURKEY with his THREAD (bodily fluids) - he must pay MAINTAIN-ence - that's the LUO.\<br></br>#Silk gauze# is the material of the *net* that the *cardinal* lovingly uses to capture and return any stray *turkey* that has wandered from his farm (see {frame 1007} for an explanation of this farm), thus *maintaining* the number of *turkeys* there.\<br></br>Of course, the easiest way the chicken can maintain his nest is to use a net of# silk gauze#-- sure beats tying up loose straws one-by-one!
續	Every *Spider-Man* comic ends with "To Be #Continue#-d - this is done in order to *sell* the next issue!\<br></br>The *selling* of *silk* in China was profitable for many centuries and will #continue# for a long time.\<br></br>Spiderman# continue#s selling his merchandise crap.
統	*Spiderman* failed his college course on the space-time# continuum#. He thought the breaks between crime-fighting created *sufficient* study time.\<br></br>One theory of the SPACE time# CONTINUUM# is that it is made solely of higher-dimensional strings (THREADS)--these are SUFFICIENT to account for all of existence.\<br></br>Maintaining the space-time #continuum# requires *sufficient* amounts of the four *threads* that bind all particles together: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force and the weak force. See <a href="/study/kanji/630">sufficient</a> <span class="index">(#630)</span>.\<br></br>I like to think of# continuum# as the space-time# continuum#, so let's make this a story about time travel! Time is like a long string, but if you go back to the past and change something, you basically cut off a bit of string and make a new path that branches off. You need to make sure there's sufficient string though-- if there are too many branching paths, you'll run out of string and time can't flow properly anymore!\<br></br>We have #sufficient# *thread* to repair the #overalls#. [1010 is #overall# in the first printing of RTH1, it has been changed to #continuum# in the errata].

It's never failed so far!\<br></br>You know how people# tie# *thread* around their fingers to remind them of things? Well, here, we# tie# *thread* around a different body part (I used something explicit to stand out, but take your pick) to bring us #luck#.\<br></br>結 also = jie1 - #to bear# (fruit). #Spiderman# is very #lucky# to# tie# the knot with beautiful Mary Jane and we hope their joint dreams will #bear# fruit.\<br></br>*Spider-Man* has a little bit of good *luck* when he #ties# up *aerosol can* wielding graffiti artists and saves the day!

This is symbolized in the old legends by the spider being eaten by the snake to represent one# epoch# passing into another.\<br></br>*Silk* defined one# epoch# for China, now capitalism of the *self* defines another. discipline; age; era; period; order; record. The character originally meant "to unravel"; how fitting.\<br></br>*Spider-Man* versus the *snake* monster. It shakes *Spider-Man* to his very *self*. It is a battle of the #epoch#! See <a href="/study/kanji/485">self</a> <span class="index">(#485)</span>.\<br></br>Imagine a *cardinal* waking up to find a giant *snake* in his room, placed there by a totalitarian government who hoped that it would bite him to death.

Constant destruction and creation at the same time ! (Thx to anon).\<br></br>The most important era for *Spider-Man* comics - also an #epoch# for Marvel - was the Silver Age (1959-70). This is where he gained all his popularity (I think the *snake* looks like a big *S* for SILVER AGE).
紅	After the savage beating with the *I-beam*, all that was left of *Spiderman* was a blotch of unidentifiable# red#.\<br></br>*Spider-Man* wears a #red# costume to *work*.

豆	Here is a gigantic #bean#. It's so large that that top of it almost touches the *ceiling*. At its base, it's kept from rolling away by a *horn* stand (great big buffalo horns), which is securely fastened to the *floor*. Let this primitive mean *Mr. Bean*, who's rather more memorable than either 'beans' or a table.\<br></br>(Radical 151) Here we have a jar of# beans#. The top horizontal stroke is the lid, the mouth is the jar’s body, and the final three strokes are two# beans# that have fallen on the ground. This one *jar* has enough# beans# in it to feed an entire *table* of people. I plan to expand *table* to *table tennis* on occasion to make this primitive more memorable.\<br></br>A pot of #beans#, sitting on a *table* waiting to be eaten!

Either that, or you could stand on a *table*, if you prefer that primitive interpretation.\<br></br>Here we have the Olympics for very# short# people. There are only two events: *darts* and *table* tennis – both rather good for people of# short# stature.

禮	*Mr. Bean* participates in a rather gruesome# ceremony#. He is brought up to the *altar* and then *bent* over, so that his upper body is pressed against the cold marble of the altar. Next they pull down his pants, and... well, you can imagine the rest.\<br></br>The# ceremony# requires a specially shaped *altar*. If you don't have one available, a #bent# *table* might do.\<br></br>In this ancient# CEREMONY#, the sacrifice was walked up to the *altar*, and then *bent* over a *table*, where his throat was cut.\<br></br>To initiate a low-budget# ceremony#, a person is standing at an *altar*, but really it's just a *bent* *table*.

Stumbling on a nighttime walk across an increasingly wild and violent pagan #rite#, *Mr. Bean* is forced to hide from the phrenetic dancers under a badly *bent altar*.\<br></br>Here we have an initiation# ceremony# for a Trinidad-themed fraternity. First the inductees and the frat members pray before the *altar* for a safe and fun year (Trinidad is mainly Christian). Next they play an exciting game of limbo in which everyone becomes *bent* to get under the pole. Finally they share a nice pot of *long beans*, which are eaten in Trinidad.\<br></br>Instead of a bent table, I think of this character as a twisted bean-- a Mameshiba. During Setsubun, the bean-throwing# ceremony# in Japan, we would normally just throw beans, but I found these creepy talking bean dogs... it's a miracle! I'll cast them on an altar and hold a# ceremony# for them.\<br></br>Simplified-[礼]-[903]: The Gods have #ceremonies# too. To become the God among the Gods, one has to undergo the soul's #ceremony# on the soul's *altar*. A giant fishing rod suspended above the *altar* throws its *fishhook* to retrieve and analyse his soul. If he succeeds the examination, he becomes the new God of the Gods, otherwise his soul separated from his body wanders forever.

All the *mouths* of the congregation are# joyful#ly singing 'O come all ye faithful,# joyful# and triumphant', but, instead of an organ, the only accompanying instruments are numerous big Africa *drums*. (To distiguish from 'joyous').\<br></br>If you’re really# joyful# about something, it’s like you’re banging a *drum* above your *mouth*, going around and telling everyone about it.

The #soldier# assigned to cooking the #beans# for dinner has no idea how to cook, and as a result, the final product could be used as *glue*.\<br></br>The makeshift army# kitchen# is stationed in a *cave* and uses a *drum* for a work space; and utensils are *glued* to the walls.\<br></br>You are exploring the woods when you come across a *cave* with an ancient #kitchen#: inside are an ancient *drum* that is *glued* to where it has been for a millennium.\<br></br>Out walking on the Salisbury Plain, *Mr.Bean* encounters a *cave* being used by *soldiers* on a training excercise. It's nearly mess-time, and *Mr. Bean* tries to help the *soldier* in charge of the canteen #kichen# with the broth, but, as you can guess, he mixes up one of the ingredients with *glue*, with hilarious results!\<br></br>The# kitchen# is a cave with inch-high drums-- the stovetop burners.\<br></br>This hanzi depicts a #kitchen# of a caravan parked on a *cliff* for sightseeing. You enter by lowering your head. The dining *table* next to the #kitchen# like all utensils are *glued to* the caravan.

樹	The lumberjacks came to fell the mighty #tree# for# timber#, only to find protesting hippies playing *drums*, crazy-*glued* all over it.\<br></br>Simplified-[643]: The #Timber#land company has just released a bio top-notch jacket made out of *tree*'s cellulose with their new motto printed on the back: "Yeah ! *That's right* !".\<br></br>This character is a *drum* interposing a *village*. Imagine a remote forest *village*, whose only trade is# timber#. But business has become so slow that they decide to *drum* in custom - quite literally, with an enormous *drum* in the middle of the *village*, calling travellers from far and wide to come to buy their# timber#.\<br></br>With a *drum* *glued* to my back, I set out into the *trees* in search of #timber#. See <a href="/study/kanji/191">tree</a> <span class="index">(#191)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/153">Chinese inch</a> <span class="index">(#153)</span>.\<br></br>A group of hikers cross the# timber# line – that is, the height beyond which no more *trees* grow there.

蓋	I’ve lost the# lid# for my pasta *dish*! It’s going to *go* bad if I can’t find it. Oh well, I’ll just put some fresh *flowers* on the *dish* as a makeshift# lid#.\<br></br>You go to check on your cooking, and find the #lid# has been blown off the saucepan, and the whole kitchen smells of *flowers*. Turns out you added *soap powder* to your *dish* instead of salt - oops!\<br></br>*Flowers* *go* into the *dish*, and on *goes* the #lid#. They'll be nice and dry for the sweet-smelling winter potpourri. See <a href="/study/kanji/624">go</a> <span class="index">(#624)</span>.\<br></br>An *auctioneer* (my primitive for go: 'going, going, gone') is selling a rare *dish*.

Traditionally *flowers* *goes* on top to make a nice #lid#. Today on the mainland (simplified 盖) they use *sheep wool* to make the #lid#. That leads to the ancient chinese saying 'to put the *wool* (*flowers go*) over the *blood* (someone's bad action) will put the #lid# on it (cover it up)'. Or maybe I just dreamt I read that in a fortune cookie.\<br></br>[ Simplified 盖 ] I take the# lid# off the #dish# and the #sheep# jumps out and escapes - I guess the shepherds pie needed longer in the oven.\<br></br>You have to put a# lid# on the *dish*, quickly, before the fine scent of *flowers* is *gone*.\<br></br>I place a pretty flower-painted crock pot# lid# on my dish, so the food inside doesn't go away and evaporate.\<br></br>When you lift up the# lid#, there are just *flowers* on the #dish#; everything else (that had been there) has already #gone#.\<br></br>Someone yells "put a# lid# on it!" in response to your bad wordplay song that criticizes the culinary trend of incorporating flowers into food: "Where have all the flowers gone? Gone to dishes (instead of Ms.'s) everyone...".
溫	This character is listed as "temperature" in my book. The cannibals must boil (using #water#) the #prisoner# to the correct #temperature# for this #dish#.\<br></br>Cannibals try to cook their *prisoner* in a big *dish* of *water*. But they're very primitive cannibals, and they haven't discovered fire yet! As a result, the whole thing remains only luke-#warm#.\<br></br>Simplified 温. Historically first# temperature# scales were always based on *blood* (body = 100F - almost), or more precisely liquid (*watery*) *blood* inside someone - preferably a *prisoner* traditionally. So now scientists, doctors don't want to use *prisoners* and like to think this# temperature# comes from the *sun*, or if your a doctor# temperature# is measured by the *tongue in mouth*.\<br></br>The *water*# temperature# in the jail’s showers is unsatisfactory – it’s merely lukewarn (lukewarm is an alternate definition). You’re a *prisoner* so you complain to the correctional officer. He decides to *dish* out punishment to you for complaining by hitting you in the head with your food *dish* instead of fixing the# temperature#. Augh, you hate being a *prisoner!*.\<br></br>A prisoner undergoes a very wimpy version of Chinese water torture; instead of an icy cold or boiling hot tub, he's submerged in a small dish filled with warm water.\<br></br>The #prisoner# is sitting in the *dish* full of *water* getting warm.
監	The supervisors "supervise" by periodically checking in by hidden camera: any *underling* caught *reclining* during this spot check only gets a single *drop* of food in their #dish#: enough to keep them alive, but just barely. That'll teach them to slack off.\<br></br>In Imperial China, the *feudal officials* would start *lying down* asleep after just a *drop* of opium from a *dish*, without #supervision#. That's why it was outlawed. It doesn't happen in modern China, however, because the state has *hidden cameras* to monitor everyone. The top pooh-bahs of the communist party can watch what anyone's doing at will on a special screen called '#Super-Vision#'.\<br></br>Simplified: upper part: Inspector Clouseau - the victim was reclining on the floor stabbed with a knife and with droops of blood.

"hmm... oats with milk and orange juice is a fatal combo. Acidic juices can curdle milk and turn it into a heavy mucus-forming substance. We have a murder attempt here!".\<br></br>Simplified 监 : Think of Mr. Miyagi supervising the latest fencing contest. Wandering around with a dish if anyone bends over and drops a bit of blood on the mat or in his dish then the cheat hasn't been using a fencing sword but a real sabre!\<br></br>The heads of your office# supervise# *underlings* like you with hidden cameras. If they catch you *reclining* instead of working, they’ll squirt a *drop* of vinegar into your eyelids! And if they catch you *reclining* again, they’ll break a *dish* over your head! It’s their way to *dish* out punishment for laziness at work. The threat of a *disk* broken over your head forms the foundation of your work ethic, which is why *dish* takes up the entire bottom of this character.\<br></br>You have to# supervise# the goons; if they're reclining around, they'll drop the dishes...\<br></br>There is a new tv reality show: Food for fencer.

銀	*gold* and #silver# are the most precious *metals*!\<br></br>*Silver* primitive story: a man wants to invest in precious metals. He believes the *sun* is made out of gold so he tries pulling it down with a giant *hook* (the fourth stroke). But this is so difficult that *drops* of sweat fall down his face and he has a *stroke*. So he gives up and decides to invest in *silver* coins instead. Frame 1083 storyIf I could choose between investing in *gold* and *silver*, I would choose# silver#. I will use *silver bars* as the primitive for# silver#.\<br></br>The *silver* primitive shall henceforth mean *werewolf*, being more memorable (it looks vaguely like something with a very oversized *tongue in mouth*, the 4th stroke a foot with hooked claw, and the last 2 its arms), and as, of course,# silver# is the only *metal* that a *werewolf* fears.

No one would think to look there (as long as it doesn't rattle when you walk).\<br></br>After Achilles'# heel# was shot, he quickly amputated his whole leg and got a *wooden leg* to keep himself from dying. Just to be extra safe, he made his# heel# out of impenetrable *silver*.\<br></br>This *werewolf* with a *wooden leg* is so slow and ungainly, that the only people it can catch up with are women wearing extremely high# heel#s. It lumbers after them, waiting for one of their# heel#s to snap in the undergrowth before going in for the kill.\<br></br>I wanted to buy my mother a *prosthetic leg* made out of *silver*, but I didn't have enough money -- all I could afford was a prosthetic# heel#. So I settled for that and she loved it.

[The drawing of *silver* here is slightly different than the others (the final stroke is shorter), and that’s because it didn’t originally use the *silver* primitive. See Wiktionary’s entry if you’re interested. I will call this form *silver leaf*, since a stack of *silver leaf* is shorter than a stack of *silver* coins.].

評	When you try and #evaluate# a Westerner's ability to *speak* chinese, it usually comes out poorly. This is because the *words* come out with an *even* tone..way too flat!

However, unlike the *water lily* primitive, he wears a slanted artists beret (1st stroke), and the last hooked stroke is his long beard. Almost blind from cataracts in later life, you would ask him a question and he would say "#hū# is this?"

To remember it, think of him wearing a traditional Arab cap, below which is pure evil - sinister - and a big belt sitting so high that it's next to his elbows. Bashar Assad is so cruel to his people that day after day they# leave# to Turkey that's giving them shelter.\<br></br>Let the character on the left be Ika Musume-- the squid girl.

勢	Don't want to use *rice stalks* as we have too many rice primitives. For me *mushrooms* picked out of the *soil*, dried and turned into a *bottle of pills* = * magic mushrooms* (the drug!).

Thus, I took this to be the sign / logo for a TV series about a bunch of distinguished, *top hat* wearing pigs based on YR.
核	If a *tree* is an atom, then an *acorn* would be the #nucleus#.\<br></br>The Chinese believe that the inner part of the seed, full of lots of nutritious fat is like a *hog*. so they gave *tree* *hog* the symbol for #seed# or #pit# of a fruit. Like *kern* in German or original meaning of #nucleus# in Latin for #seed# this word is also used for atomic #nucleus# today.\<br></br>Just as the *acorn* is at the center of a *tree* (or at least it was the beginning, when the acorn was the entire tree!) the# nucleus# is at the center of an atom.

Of course now, they don't eat like that but what a great image! Used to describe a period or #moment# in time.\<br></br>This famous ninja (I always use ninjas with *sabres*, distinct from samurai) used to engrave the kanji for his name onto *acorns*, and throw the *acorns* to distract his enemies.

毒	For *grow up* pimitive, I'm going to use *Peter Pan*, the boy who never grows up. Lots of good stories for this primitive on the kanji side! Story: *Peter Pan* is a lost boy and didn't have a *mother* - because he secretly gave her #poison#!\<br></br>This hanzi represents a reversal of the Oedipus story.

Only experienced moms know that it's all lies, and it's a synthetic# poison# that'll never replace fruits and vegetables.\<br></br>First, the *grow up* primitive: It’s pretty amazing how humans *grow up*. You start by progressing through *3* trimesters, then you’ll grow up basically in a *straight line* until you’re taller than everyone else in your family (which is why the *straight line* rises above the *3*). Story for# poison#: Mercury is a# poison# when it’s in the atmosphere. My *mother* is deeply concerned about this# poison# because its presence means that kids might not *grow up* right.\<br></br>Instead of grow up, let the top primitive be an unpleasant green vegetable, such as *brussels sprouts*. When you were a kid, you probably thought the *brussels sprouts* your *mother* served you tasted like# poison#.
素	*Growing up* on a# vegetarian diet# is likely to lead to you being as skinny as a piece of #thread#.\<br></br>It was by eating a #vegetarian diet# that *Spider-Man* *grew up* into his present, spider-like state.\<br></br>Sound: #su4# I would happily adopt a# vegetarian diet# if I could eat *Japanese* #su#-shi every day! (Japan = my code for fourth tone).\<br></br>Vegetarians eat plants and don't mind if spiders are on them, that makes them crunchy.\<br></br>There's no medical or dental care in Never Never land, so *Peter Pan* sticks to a# vegetarian diet# and *flosses* after every meal.\<br></br>When *spiderman* went on a# vegetarian diet#, he made *brussels sprouts* the cornerstone of his diet. Here you can even see him buried under all the brussels sprouts he bought.

請	Almost everyone is unfortunate enough to have as acquaintances a pretentious couple who believe that unusual possessions somehow make them interesting and give them the illusion of desperately needed confidence. Here, these friends have acquired a state-of-the-art telescope. Every time they extend an# invite#, it is just to *talk* about their *telescope*; you don't even get to use it!\<br></br>Your friends practically# invite# a prison sentence upon themselves when they decide to scrawl *words* on the surface of NASA’s *telescopes*. [But the Hanzi, of course, means# invite# in the sense of ask for, request.].\<br></br>If you listen carefully enough, you can hear *words* coming from *blue-green algae*. They seem to be saying something, I think they're going to# invite# you to a party.
情	*Data* seems to have developed some serious# feelings# for his new *telescope*. He hasn't left his room for a week.\<br></br>When someone wants to upset your# feelings#, their goal is usually to make your *state of mind* *blue* with sadness or *green* with jealousy.\<br></br>Japanese people do have# feelings#! It's just that, to read their *state of mind*, you need a *telescope*.\<br></br>Contrary to what most people think, Animal Rights Activists say *blue-green algae* does have a *life giving heart* and therefore it does have# feelings#. really, now what are they going to eat?\<br></br>Imagine *Mother Teresa* asking all the astronomers looking through their *telescopes* to have warm and compassionate# feelings# for any alien life they come upon.\<br></br>Contrary to what most people think, *blue-green algae* does have a *state of mind* and it does have# feelings#.
睛	His *eye* is as good as a *telescope* because he replaced his# eyeball# with a bionic eye.\<br></br>Breaking news: inside your *eye*, there's a certain strain of *blue-green algae* that's responsible for giving your eye its ball shape, turning your not-yet-formed eye into an# eyeball#.\<br></br>Many people have #eyeballs# where their #eye#-rises are either #blue or green#. Alternatively, the crazy astronomer, to enhance his #eyeballs#, stuck *telescopes* on them.\<br></br>A smurf has a huge eye-ball. The only part of their body that ain't blue. (We assume).\<br></br>Astronomer to a hesitant young child: To see out of this *telescope*, you have to put your *eye* right up against the viewing lens. Yes, don't be shy, use your actual physical #eyeball# itself.

You ask him if he knows how to use it. “Nah,” he says, “I’ll just# eyeball# it” (that is, guess how to use it without reading the instructions). A few minutes later he cries out in pain because the lens has hit him in the *eye*. He didn’t read the warning that the *telescope*’s lens could shoot back to focus without warning!
清	The #pure# *water* is in a land far away - see, I can see the bubbling streams and beautiful white waterfalls through my * telescope*.\<br></br>More breaking news: scientists find the fastest and easiest way to get# pure# *water* is to let it filter through some *blue-green algae*.\<br></br>#Pure# *water*, and# pure# *water* only, should be used to clean *telescopes*. Not fizzy *water*, not fruit-added *water*, not vitamin-enriched *water*, not even tap *water*. Just# pure#, distilled *water* goes on that *telescope* or you lose your job. OK?\<br></br>Smurfs only drink# pure# water. Part of their wholesome Dutch lifestyle.\<br></br>The most# pure# and perfect #water#, in my opinion, is that gorgeous tropical #blue or green#.
靜	I like to take my *telescope* out into the countryside and enjoy looking at the stars in the peace and #quiet#. That way I don't have to *contend* with all the nerdy idiots who are trying to grab a look in my college physics department.\<br></br>Once the Western Front is# quiet#, the military no longer had to *contend* with the Axis powers and could use their military *telescopes* to spot airplanes in peacetime.\<br></br>*Blue-green algae* in the modern age must *contend* with the worst enemy it has: noise pollution. All it wants is some peace and *quiet*.
責	One of the reasons *Peter Pan* and the kids live in Neverland is so that they can avoid grown-up #responsibility# - like worrying about *money* (clams), paying for things or having a job.\<br></br>When you *grow up* you have to start taking #responsibility# for things like managing household finances and being concerned with money (*clams*). See <a href="/study/kanji/51">shellfish</a> <span class="index">(#51)</span>.\<br></br>One of my foremost #responsibilities# as I have *grown up* from a young guy to a 21-year-old has been to *empty the dishwasher*, a job that I never got *clams* for – but that’s alright. I will use *empty the dishwasher* as my primitive for this one.\<br></br>According to this character,# responsibility# is eating your *brussels sprouts* and managing your *clams*.
績	*Spider-man* - "with great power comes great *responsibility*". but with it comes great #accomplishments#..\<br></br>*Spiderman* has many# accomplishments#, but he would have achieved only few without his world-class sense of *responsibility*.\<br></br>I name off a string of# accomplishments# that I've achieved-- went to the bank, did my laundry, cleaned the bathroom.

Once in a blue moon would a #merchant# come, carrying *seafood* which the cowboys would buy off him for hundreds of *shells*.\<br></br>When the Western# merchant#s started trading in the middle and far East, they didn't share the same currency, so all transactions were made with shells instead.\<br></br>In the *Old West*, a #merchant# had to be tough.

煙	Indians would use *fires* in the *Old West* to communicate via #smoke#-signals. They'd also use these fires to keep warm as they slept on the *ground* at night.\<br></br>Cigarette# smoke# has been banned in the *Old West* for two reasons: first, *fires* were being started everywhere because people didn’t know how to use ashtrays; and second, their contents were leaching into the *soil* and damaging crops.

南	Evangelical Christianity has had really *good fortune* in the# south# (i.e. it’s done well there), and thus we have the Bible *Belt* running through it. Some say the Bible *Belt* is even part of the *soil* here (as indeed it is in this character).\<br></br>*good luck charms* are really popular in the #South# of the USA and indeed in most countries of #South# America.

門	Looks like the# gate# of a saloon, with two swinging saloon doors. I will use #saloon# as primitive meaning.\<br></br>This is radical 169. I will name the primitive for this one “*Bill #Gate#s*”. Suppose it was *Bill# Gate#s* who designed this *gate* as the entrance to Microsoft headquarters because he wanted Microsoft to be a *sun*-ny place to work (see the two suns?).\<br></br>Simplified-[门]-[1262]: Let's take the #Stargate# universe for the key word #gate#.

問	Imagine arriving at the *gates of hell*, and finding 2 sets of *gates*, both with *mouths*.Then comes the riddle - "One gate leads to heaven, the other to hell. You can #ask# one of us a question, but one of us always lies, and one always tells the truth..".\<br></br>Picture a typical scene in a Western: the naive hero enters a *saloon* and opens his *mouth* to# ask# a really dumb question like "Can I have sparkling water"? Of course, he's laughed at by the other guests and it all ends in a gun fight.\<br></br>Imagine that *Bill Gates* is so smart that if you open your *mouth* to# ask# him a question, he gives you the answer before you can even say a word.\<br></br>Simplified-[问]-[1265]: #Ask# for someone at the *gates* using the big ring-knocker in the middle... or your *mouth*.\<br></br>Simplified-[问]-[1265]: Always #ask# the DHD for the next destination of a *Stargate* or else its *mouth* may bring you in middle of nowhere.
間	The *gates of hell* open at a regular #interval# - once a *day* at *sun*-rise - so suck in all the lost souls.\<br></br>A mathematical# interval# of size greater than 1 over the real numbers: the #gate#s mark the endpoints, and the *blabbering mouth* in the middle is trying to recite all the numbers in between, which is impossible since the# interval# is uncountable.\<br></br>Building off of gdaxeman's: These *gates* to the ancient Mayan temple are positioned just so that the *sun* shines through at a very specific #interval#: Once a year on the summer solstice. See <a href="/study/kanji/1201">gate</a> <span class="index">(#1201)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/12">day</a> <span class="index">(#12)</span>.\<br></br>The Chinese built *gates* which majestically framed the *sun*. But they can only enjoy the sight at 24 hour# interval#s.\<br></br>*Bill Gates* brushes his teeth at a regular# interval#: three times a *day*.\<br></br>Simplified-[间]-[1266]: The *Stargates* were built to reduce dramatically the #intervals# of time and space through the universe. One need to be careful to avoid to be too close to a *sun *during the teleportation or else #intervals# of time and space may be bent so that one may vanish just like that.\<br></br>The huge *gates* are opened at regular #intervals# to let the *sun* in.
簡	You can make a really #simple# ruler out of a piece of *bamboo*. It has notches at regular *intervals*, which can be used to measure things.\<br></br>The# simple# eating-habits of the panda means it eats *bamboo* at regular *intervals*. Cute but boring.\<br></br>There’s something very wholesome about a# simple# meal. *Bill Gates* eats the same# simple# meal each morning: *bamboo* baked in the *sun* for flavor and texture.\<br></br>Dr. Jackson made a really #simple# ruler out of a piece of *bamboo* which has notches at regular *intervals*. It was a #simple# but effective way to repair a defective DHD of a *Stargate* (Thanks to aphasiac).

Nevertheless, the radio signals can penetrate through the iris. It is like having *ears* which can #hear# on the other side of the *Stargate* but without the troubles.
倉	This is an old #storehouse# by the docks, that is used as a hideout for criminals. Just think, it's a place where gangsters go to *meet*, it's safe as there's just a small single *gatepost* to get in, and you have to open your *mouth* and whispter the password to enter.\<br></br>I see this as a# storehouse# for oil (although the character means a# storehouse# for food, of course). There is a *meeting* of hundreds of pipes and pipelines here. An electrified *single gate* blocks any intruders from entering. Where is it located? On the *mouth* of the Mississippi, of course.
槍	A hollow *tree* near the *gangsters hideout* is where they hide all the #guns#.\<br></br>The presents under the Christmas *tree* at the *gangster's hideout* all contain various types of #guns#: uzis, glocks, etc. Merry Christmas!\<br></br>Tom decides it’s time for his six-year-old to learn about the second amendment so he puts a# gun# under the Christmas *tree* as a present. When his wife finds out, she is so disgusted that she takes the# gun# back to the *storehouse* where he had bought it.\<br></br>Simplified-[枪]-[1121]: This supposedly abandoned *storehouse* and partially hidden by the *trees* is in reality a worldwide hub for #guns# smuggling.
創	To join your local gang, the #initiation# test to go down to the *gangsters hideout* by the docks with a *sabre*, and #initiate# a fight. Unfortunately you're highly likely to get a #cut# or #injury#.\<br></br>Wiktionary says this means “initiate” in the sense of “create” or “establish,” so my story may not capture the exact sense of the word, but . . . the leader of a group of terrorists declares, “initiate the mission.” The mission? To poke holes in America’s largest oil *storehouse* with *sabers* so that all the oil spills out and the U.S. is paralyzed. Little did they know it was made of concrete. At the end the dejected terrorist leader says, “uh . . .# initiate# something else now.”.
非	Pictograph of a key to a *jail cell*. This *jail* for #non-#conformists to the law. Is there any way to escape? nope there is #non-#.\<br></br>(Radical 175) Attacking a person with two *walking sticks* is definitely non¬-legal. It can get you six years in a *jail cell* (hence the three lines – 3 years for each *walking stick* used in the assault, whether they were shaped like J’s or like I’s).
排	FINGERS poking through the bars of a JAIL CELL conjure an image of Death# ROW#. The inmates are always trying to escape, and are constantly shaking at the bars, trying desperately to find any weakness in the cell. (Also imagine a# row# of cells lined up like this).\<br></br>In this *jail*, the rules are strict. Twice daily all inmates have to #line up# in a #row#, and have their *fingers* inspected for dirt under their nails.\<br></br>The final meal for this poor prisoner on death# row#? A bucket of fish *fingers* placed inside the *jail cell*.
罪	The criminal goes all *cross-eyed* as he admits his #guilt# - and then is sent off to *jail*.\<br></br>The sailor uses a fish *net* only able to capture the fishes of the legal size. The police has invented the criminal *net* only able to capture the #guilty# ones and put them in *jail cell*.\<br></br>Man in *jail cell* who hallucinates that there are lots of giant *eyes* watching him.

Lawn chair leg??? This will make sense once we get to <a href="/study/kanji/1221">tanned hide</a> <span class="index">(#1221)</span>.

Now he's learned to# defend# himself from curious people. He can freely walk down the boulevard without fear of crazed onlookers.\<br></br>The protagonist in an action thriller movie is walking down the *boulevard*, searching for his missing loved one. He finds her *locket* right in the middle of the median! It's ominous. He knows she must be in trouble. He will find her and #defend# her! See <a href="/study/kanji/699">line of business</a> <span class="index">(#699)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/1221">tanned hide</a> <span class="index">(#1221)</span>.\<br></br>Simplified 卫 : You'd better be seen to# defend# your country otherwise the chop will come down on the table from up above, and the chop may come down on your neck next!\<br></br>The Nazis are coming down the Champs-Elysees, that great *boulevard* of Paris. Your only mission as a soldier is to# defend# the *boulevard* -- and you carry a *locket* with your name, your religion and the cemetery where you would like to be buried inside, knowing that your chance of dying is quite large.\<br></br>We can# defend# the *boulevard* using our magic *locket* (which shoots magic missiles).\<br></br>If you are taking a #Defence# against the Dark Arts class a la Harry Potter, you must first go to Daigon *Boulevard* to buy a *talisman* as class material.
干	Imagine your neighbour leaving you a note- "I don't mean to #offend# you - but can you stop #drying# your clothes outside in public? That underwear is embarrassing and is bringing down the tone of the whole neighbourhood." (U'm going to use *dry* for this primative).\<br></br>(Radical 51) I will use “Airbus A380” as the primitive form of this character as opposed to *clothesline*. The first stroke is the horizontal stabilizer, the second stroke its huge wings, and its third stroke the fuselage. Story: the CEO of Airbus calls up the CEO of Boeing and says, “not to# offend# you, but our A380 is larger than your 747.”.\<br></br>If you put a bar on top of a cross, as if insinuating that Jesus had arms growing out of his head when he was crucified, you'll# offend# a lot of religious folks.\<br></br>In Toronto, up until a couple of years ago, it was illegal to hang clothes outside, i.e. one of the biggest offenses and ways to# offend# the sensibilities of people was to hang your clothes outdoors. Silly, but unfortunately true.
岸	Under the tall *mountains* are the *cliffs*. at the bottom of the *cliffs* are the *dry* #beaches# and sea-#shore#. Ah so nice to go for a day out!\<br></br>A vista: *mountains* overhead, *cliffs* underneath, and below them, on the #shore#, on the *clothesline* of a struggling favela.

It’s# shore# going to be difficult!\<br></br>To get safely to the# shore#, we're going to start on top of a *mountain* and then ride down the *cliff* on a *clothesline*.
幹	A fine *mist*-y rain is falling, and so everyone gathers around near the #tree-trunk#, effectively using the rest of the tree as an *umbrella* in order to stay *dry*. (thanks to sweetneet).\<br></br>There is a fine *mist* in the air, and the clothes on the *clothesline* are not drying at all. I put up a big deck *umbrella*, but it doesn't help. I pack the clothes away in a #trunk# and decide to try to dry them another day. See <a href="/study/kanji/1225">offend</a> <span class="index">(#1225)</span>.\<br></br>A# trunk# route in aviation is a central route to an airline’s route network – for example, Emirates’s *A380* flight from Dubai to Heathrow. Here some folks are watching an Emirates *A380* land in *London*, wearing *umbrellas* due to all the *mist.*.\<br></br>Through the #mist#, we can see with an elephant placing #umbrella# on top of a #clothesline# with its# trunk#.
旱	During a# DROUGHT#, you can be assured that not a drop of rain will fall, so it is the perfect time to dry your laundry on your CLOTHESLINE under the hot SUN.\<br></br>When the *sun* has *dry*-ed up the land and all of the water, you have a #drought#.\<br></br>Imagine there is a# drought# of orders for the *Airbus A380*, and thus a lot of planes have been manufactured without any buyers. This# drought# of orders means that all these *Airbus A380s* are baking in the hot *sun*, abandoned to wither away.
趕	If you #walk# through a #drought#, you had better# hurry# (or you will run out of water).\<br></br>You are *walking* along in a big #hurry# in a *drought*, and you are starting to get very thirsty and hot. Slow down or you might collapse from exhaustion!

I want to# hurry# home, but I can barely move in this heat, so instead of running, I skip to keep my mind off the heat while still# hurry#ing.\<br></br>A Texas minister is leading a prayer *walk*, calling on God to# hurry# up and put an end to the massive *drought* they are in – and indeed the next month is a rainy one!\<br></br>Definition of# hurry#: running through a place with drought (with a bottle of water in your hand).
于	The greatest way to #offend# someone is to say "f*ck# Yu#" and flip them off, with the hook at the bottom of this character representing the flipping!
宇	To store our clothes, under the# eaves# of our *house* we have a *clothing conveyor*.\<br></br>I hang my clothes from the #eaves# of my house using *clothes pegs* to dry them.\<br></br>There was a minor *plane crash* outside the White *House* yesterday. A plane missed its approach and took out all the# eaves# on the White *house* roof! Thankfully no one was injured.\<br></br>Some brat stays inside his house, face hidden by the roof's# eaves#, flipping people off. The# eaves# are important so no one can identify him.
余	Look at# moi#: I am *greater* (the umbrella is a greater than sign) #little# #yu#.\<br></br>#moi# French girlfriend is weird about weighing herself when I'm around - she always hides under an umbrella when doing it! Her *bathroom scales* are good though - they have these *little clothes pegs* attached by wires, which you clip on and measure your body fat.\<br></br>A French aristocrat got into a *plane accident.* As he explains it in court: “Yes sir, it pains# moi# but it is true: I poked myself in the eye with an *umbrella* while flying and got into a plane *accident*, but it was a very *small* *scale* accident. So please don’t be too hard on# moi# and take away my license.”.\<br></br>That brat from eaves is now hiding under an umbrella. He has to flip people off with a bit of a smaller action because the umbrella doesn't hide his face very well. Even by doing so, he's still managed to offend someone; a French girl screams "Excusez-moi!" and slaps him in a huff.
餘	If you eat an# excess# of *junk food* -- say, three meals at McDonald’s a day – this is bound to show up on the *scale* within weeks, if not days.\<br></br>That French girl was so offended by the boy that she started eating food emotionally, in# excess#! It's a terrible sight, a pretty young girl stuffing her face.\<br></br>As part of your diet, you have to place your #food# on a *scale*, and throw away anything in# excess# of 100 grams.
除	Every so often they weight the people on the #pinnacle# on a *scale*, and if there are too many, some are #eliminated#. Drastic, but they need to keep the population under control.\<br></br>Judgement day! The Greek Gods appear at the *Acropolis* and weigh the virtues and vices of everyone on a huge *scale*. Whoever is weighed and found wanting is# eliminate#d.\<br></br>“We will# eliminate# the United States!” one terrorist says to another atop the *Burj Khalifa*. “We will place nuclear bombs inside of *scales* and have them blow up across the country as Americans check their weight – they’re very fat, you know.”.\<br></br>The offended French girl goes to talk to Reimu, who agrees that the brat from eaves is probably possessed by a demon or something. She decides to go# eliminate# it-- even if it# eliminate#s the boy!\<br></br>Survivor: *Pinnacle*! To pass this challenge, you must step on a *scale* or be #eliminate#d.
途	Toll #routes# may have weight restrictions: here, you have to put your vehicle on the *scale* before you're allowed on the *road*.\<br></br>#Route# 7 traffic can get so bad that drivers periodically step out on the *road*, weigh themselves on a *scale*, and then step back inside once traffic moves in order to pass the time.\<br></br>A French girl calls a road a# route#. It's just more Frenchy that way!
束	Here we see the big open *mouth* of bundle man, snoring underneath a *tree*. As a primitive it becomes bundle-man, a wanderer (tramp), always with a bundle. (thanks to fuaburisu).\<br></br>Gypsies have very interesting customs. They're somewhat nomadic, so instead of sleeping in a house, they sleep bundled up in the hollow opening of a tree.
速	The *tramp* accidently left his *bundle* of possessions in the middle of a *road*! he has to be #quick# and grab them before they get run over.\<br></br>Jack be nimble, Jack be #quick#, Jack jumps over the *bundle* in the middle of the *road* (Thanks to anon).\<br></br>Gotta be# quick# when when going to# Quick# City. Keep your stuff in a *bundle*, ready to hit the *road* at any time.\<br></br>Gypsies are a lot more athletic than the rest of us-- while we drive down the road, they run, just as# quick#!
辣	*Bundle-man* is usually so hungry, that he often eats whatever he finds in the trashcan without thinking. So when he pulls out the leftovers of a super-#spicy hot# Sichuanese dish, he fails to notice all the little red *chili peppers*! Whats more, he has no drink to cool his mouth off with, oh no!\<br></br>When you put a bundle of spice on it's not just hot but# spicy hot#.\<br></br>You know those commercials for the “icy hot patch”? Here is a new product, the “spicy hot patch”. It’s just many *chili peppers* all *bundle*-d up that you put on your arm or chest whenever you crave a spicy taste. Note how the vertical stroke of the chili pepper curves to the left. Sound: la4 When you eat# spicy hot# wasabi in *Japan*, you think you’ve just put #la#-va into your mouth. (Japan is my code word for the fourth tone.).\<br></br>Gypsies make all their food# spicy hot#! With tons of peppers!
整	*tramps* and vagrants are hated by *Hitler*. He decided to "*correct*" the problem throughout the #entire# country and eventually #entire# Europe!\<br></br>The# entire# *bundle* of classwork assigned by the *taskmaster* must be *correct* before you can leave.\<br></br>*Hitler* was a tough person to deal with. If you didn't say the *correct* thing to him, he would have you and your #entire# family *bundled up* and shipped off to a concentration camp. That's why he lost the #entire# war. Everyone told him what he wanted to hear. See <a href="/study/kanji/1236">bundle up</a> <span class="index">(#1236)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/362">correct</a> <span class="index">(#362)</span>.\<br></br>I will be using *Imperial Japanese Army* in place of *taskmaster* as a more memorable story. Story: imagine that the *Imperial Japanese Army* demands that the# entire# country (100%) give a *correct* rendition of the imperial anthem, or they will have their blankets taken away and no one will be able to *bundle up*.\<br></br>Hitler eliminated the# entire# gypsy population from Europe, in his twisted belief that he was correcting the human race.\<br></br>The *taskmaster* is insisting that the# entire# *bundle* be checked (again!) to make sure that everything is #correct#.\<br></br>Wikipedia embodies the #entirety# of human knowledge. It requires a *bundle* of *taskmasters* (or editors) to make sure that everything is more-or-less #correct#.
練	*Spider-man* has to #practise# hard before he fights fights evil super-villain the *Toad*.\<br></br>Before fighting villains, *Spider-Man* gets some #practice# by shooting webs on a *horned toad*.\<br></br>Simplified [#练#] - right-hand primitive is a *rickshaw with stabilizers*. #Spiderman# is going into the #rickshaw# business but to pass his test he has to# practice# on a #rickshaw with stabilizers#.\<br></br>A *cardinal* is determined to# practice# what he preaches. Thus, the *cardinal* cares even for his animal neighbor: a poor *horned toad* that is nearly dying from the heat. He takes it to the rectory and gives it shade and water.\<br></br>Let the primitive on the right be a voodoo witch, a gypsy with mystical eyes. The witch# practice#s her voodoo doll magic, poking your effigy with little threads; it's just# practice#, it's not time for the pins yet...\<br></br>To improve your taxidermy, you can# practice# #threading# together some #horned toads#.\<br></br>Spiderman and the horned toad practicing their moves.

You’ll# opt for# the *fish fingers* since you’re not into roadkill.\<br></br>pointing with his fat little *fingers*. Here, he's at the pet shop, and instead of kitties or puppies, he, of course, wants a *horned toad*.\<br></br>Happy *finger*s in the forest are grabbing lots of things.

Taking #rickshaws# can be dangerous becos' they are inherently unstable . I always# opt for# flagging down #rickshaws with stabilizers# with my raised #finger# - you can never be too safe...\<br></br>When the voodoo witch opts for whom to curse, it's actually very random; she cackles "eeny, meeny, miny, mo" and points out the possible people with her fingers...\<br></br>Want to get something fix around the house?# Opt for# the horned toad with the fingers every time. See how he gets into the hardest to reach placed. The horned toad with the fingers... that's the one I'm opting for.
重	The first *computer* in the world was as #heavy# as *thousand computers* are now (thanks to erikkusan).\<br></br>New primitive - *mainframe supercomputer* - a machine used for particularly# heavy#-duty calculations, with the processing power of a *thousand* ordinary *computers*.\<br></br>Here is a# heavy# aircraft – an Eva 747-8F# heavy# – carrying a *thousand* giant mainframe *computers* to Taiwan for a new technology startup. (Because airplanes like the Boeing 747 are referred to as *heavies* in air traffic control communications, I will sometimes use *Boeing 747* in place of# heavy#, since I see it as the ‘original’# heavy# aircraft.).
懂	Data confuses flower with flour, doesn't# understand# heavy flower is not heavy flour. Don't you# understand# data? So much for AI and the cognitive models of the mind.\<br></br>Only *Data* can #understand# why the *flower* is so *heavy*.

Embedded in a human-like android, it is the mind of a *mainframe supercomputer* that can instantly #understand# anything, even a simple *flower*. See <a href="/study/kanji/1242">heavy</a> <span class="index">(#1242)</span>.\<br></br>#Understand#ing is a *state of mind* that not only can be as beautiful as *flowers*, but can also be a *heavy* burden, as *heavy* as a *thousand* *computers*.\<br></br>If I can think of one person who truly #understands# the poor, it is *Mother Teresa*. Imagine that at her funeral, thousands and thousands of the poor laid *flowers* on her coffin with *heavy* hearts [though hearts aren’t in this character] because of all she did to relieve poverty in India and around the world.\<br></br>God# understand#s all-- he# understand#s men's minds, he# understand#s the beauty of flowers, and he can make an object so heavy even he can't pick it up.\<br></br>*Commander Data* truely is an amazing android, great in every way. Not only can he #understand# complex quantum maths, but he also paints and takes *flower* arranging classes to show his creativity. And of course he's super-strong and can lift insanely *heavy* objects. He's pretty much the perfect crew member!
動	It's time to #move# house - so I now have to# move# all this *heavy* furniture, using every bit of *muscle power* I have.\<br></br>Simplified-[动]-[735]: *Star Wars* Jedi can #move# heavy and distant objects only with the Force *power* as if they were as light as *(rising) clouds*.\<br></br>It is truly ironic when your #heavy# #muscles# get so #heavy# that you can no longer# move#.\<br></br>It is very hard to #move# a *mainframe supercomputer* with just one's *muscle* alone.

He couldn't even remember where he found it...\<br></br>They cannot explain how this new# species# can be the *heaviest*# species# in the world (heavier than the blue whale), yet live solely on a diet of *wheat*.\<br></br>After the apocalypse, a team of explorers and scientists finds a modern *mainframe supercomputer* completely abandoned, with a new #species #of *wheat* growing on it, in it, and around it.

He'll Stick to business class from now on!\<br></br>I like Heisig’s story for sickness, but I will also use this primitive to denote *fictional* band called “The *Sickness*” whose misadventures will likely find their way into some of my stories. The story: *The Sickness* gets only *third* place in a music contest. The drummer is so upset that he ingests part of the bronze trophy they received. This gives him a severe# illness#, bronze poisoning (which I’m not sure exists, so don’t worry!).
痛	#ache# or #pain# - a *sickness* you get in your back and legs when you bounce on a *pogo-stick* for too long!\<br></br>I always think of 甬 as injecting heroin, since it consists of *elbow* and *utilize* (i.e. utilizing heroin). Here, your illness causes you to# ache# so badly that you need to inject heroin as a pain reliever / analgesic.\<br></br>After a *sickness* leads to #aches# and pains, I go to a strange massage parlor where they massage you with Chinese chops from their *chop rack* on the wall.\<br></br>*The Sickness* bought a new *chop rack* yesterday for signing their contracts, and they tested these chops on their guitarist – so he is really #aching# today from all the stamping!

He nods and smiles falsely, but knows that none of them will vote for him!\<br></br>A policeman #greets# you one day and asks you, “hey man, did you happen to dump your neighbor’s *stamp collection* all over the *George Washington Parkway* because he says your lawn is ugly?” They found out so fast!\<br></br>The *stamp collection* salesman was waiting on the *road* to #greet# us. "Greetings, strangers!".\<br></br>Travel along the road getting stamps on your passport and the# greet#ing "welcome to rip you off with our visa stamp land".
登	Count on *Mr. Bean* to do something really dumb, like putting a stepladder inside a *teepee* and# ascend#ing it to plug the hole in the top.\<br></br>When an American Indian warrior dies, his body is placed on a TABLE inside a TEEPEE, and a ritualistic ceremony is held to encourage his spirit to# ASCEND# to that big buffalo hunting ground in the sky.--thanks to johnskb.\<br></br>One time I got high and thought I had #ascended# to a higher plane of reality. It turns out I was just standing on a *table*. (Had I been in a traditional setting eating peyote, for instance, this might have happened in a *teepee*.).\<br></br>*Mount,ascend,register* - The old indian chief #signs the register# of the *Dignitas* #Teepee# - #mounts# the spirit #table# - takes a draft of hemlock - and awaits for his soul to# ascend# to the "happy hunting grounds".\<br></br>I take the top umbrella with wings to mean angel wings. Bean-sized creatures with angel wings are fairies, of course! The tiny fairies# ascend# like angels into the sky.
燈	The #lamp#s I'm thinking of are paper lanterns. When you light them on *fire*, they *ascend* to the skies, illuminating everything below.\<br></br>Each old-fashioned #lamp# along the walkway needs a small *fire* in it to shed light. But the #lamps# are high up, so every evening the workers have to bring out a little *stepladder* to light each #lamp# one by one. See <a href="/study/kanji/157">fire</a> <span class="index">(#157)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/1257">ascend</a> <span class="index">(#1257)</span>.\<br></br>The# lamp#s in our house are large chandeliers with real candle *fire*. Unfortunately, to light them on *fire*, we need a *stepladder*.\<br></br>Jesus points out that you wouldn’t put a# lamp# under a basket. On that note, I would add that you wouldn’t kick a# lamp# off a *stepladder* and light it on *fire*!
證	Based on FooSoft's RtK story: You *ascend* to the witness stand to give your *speech*, providing# evidence# against the defendant.\<br></br>[I plan to use *dictionary*, a book with lots of *words*, as the name for the *words* primitive from time to time.] We have finally found the well-guarded secret# evidence# about how the woman was killed: a *dictionary* and a *stepladder*. The murderer pushed the woman off this *stepladder*, knocking her unconscious, and hit her in the head with this *dictionary*. Can you imagine Phoenix Wright music going on in the background as this is revealed?\<br></br>Perjury descends to hell, but the *words* of true# evidence# #ascend# to the heavens.

Running Wolf writes down the order , ties it to his message #missile# ( a special arrow ), opens the #teepee# door flap and fires it with his #bow# to Mr Patel's order board ....
廢	Our *indian messenger* gets tired of his job, and decides to #discard# his message in a nearby cave.\<br></br>You have lots of things #sent out# to you regularly. Here, you take the junk mail that's sent out to you and# discard# in the small *cave* in your abode.\<br></br>This lazy *postman* (better image than a courier) doesn't do his job properly. Instead of trapsing around the town delivery his letters and parcels, he stops outside it and# discard#s them in a *cave*.\<br></br>After the Indian Wars, in this cave the# discard#ed decommissioned weapons lie-a tee-pee tent, bows, and missiles.\<br></br>The *courier* that will appear in my story (or stories?) will be *Fedex*.Imagine you get a nice package from the *courier* FedEx. You’re excited as you open it up, but it’s filled with nothing but junk mail! Ugh! You’re so upset that you go into the deepest section of a *cave* and# discard# the box there.
形	In this play of shadows, one is using *both his two hands* to create the #shape# of a *rooster tail* on the wall (Thanks to anon). // #ROOSTER TAIL#: Those three feathers come from a #rooster tail#.\<br></br>I hate to always change the names of primitives, but I plan to name this one *ski jump*. These are the tracks left in the snow by three people going down the same *ski jump* at once in a new Olympic Sport: synchronized ski jumping! Norway won the synchronized ski jumping competition this year: they went down the *ski jump* and made a heart# shape# with their *two hands* as they soared through the air.
影	Imagine the *scenery* of a city. The great tall buildings cast# shadow#s in every direction. They are long and bend with the passing of the sun, like great *rooster tails* on the sidewalks and streets below.\<br></br>says Ratcliff to Richard III as they survey the *scenery* of Bosworth Field on the morning of the battle. What Shakespeare omits, however is that he awoke Richard from his nightmare-addled sleep by tickling him with a *rooster tail* (from the early village-cock that twice did salutation to the morn in the previous line).\<br></br>You used to have beautiful *scenery* outside your Alpine chalet. But then they built a massive *ski jump* right next to your house, which casts a permanent# shadow# over your home and absolutely ruins your home’s view – and real estate value.\<br></br>The SUN over the CAPITAL casts a# SHADOW# in the shape of a ROOSTER TAIL.
彩	The magic #rooster's tail# has feathers of every# hue# -- you can #pluck# whatever you want.\<br></br>A *vulture* sits in a *tree* with a *rooster tail* in its beak, which it uses as a paintbrush, painting all the branches different #hues#. [differentiate from #1283 colour.].\<br></br>A line of striking purple# hue# always marked where the *ski jump* ended so you would know when to lift off. But now someone has *plucked* that line out of the ground and without the# hue# line, they have to cancel the race!\<br></br>*Mystique* sits like a *vulture* in a *tree*, deadly still, changing her #hue# to blend in...waiting to kill you..\<br></br>Instead of using an RGB palette to pick out your desired# hue#, here instead you're presented with an intricately coloured *rooster tail*. #Pluck# the feather from the tail that corresponds to the #hue# you want. It is actually like a pre-inked quill: you can use it as is.

The roosters #have to# comply when the evil doctor sews their *head*s and *rooster tail*s together.\<br></br>Why does he have a *rooster tail* stuck on his *head*? (Isn't the *rooster tail* in the wrong place?) He '#has to#', so he can cover up his bald spot [cf Harbaugh].
珍	A number of the games that# Rare# made were true *jewels*! I especially liked Banjo Kazooie, which ends with the characters drinking tropical *cocktails* on the beach.\<br></br>The #rare# pan-galactic-gargeblaster drink is the *king* of *cocktails*!\<br></br>A# rare# cocktail is the Jewel cocktail. This one is# rare# because unlike all other cocktails, which have pretentious names and wussy watered-downed alcohol, this one does contain a# rare# jewel that blows your mind. What is# rare#r than a cocktail that delivers what its name promises.\<br></br>*Elvis* was renown for having martinis with# rare# ingredients such as diamond encrusted umbrellas, crushed ice from the berg that sank the Titanic ,olives from Mount Vesuvius ..... the Waldorf sold these #cocktails# for $100,000 a glass - it was# rare# for #The King's Cocktail# to be ordered....\<br></br>A# RARE# old whisky, such as a nice 30-year Macallan, is a thing to be savored neat or with just a light splash of water, making quite possibly the world's simplest--yet finest--COCKTAIL. Imagine a dram being served here in a whisky glass studded with# rare# JEWELS to celebrate the occasion.\<br></br>I ordered my steak# rare#, but when it arrived it was so over-cooked it was as hard as a piece of *jade*! I complain to the waiter and he offers me a free *cocktail* of my choice by way of compensation.\<br></br>Goes back to the "metal" character, after hiding the# rare# treasures in the tent and melting them down the jewels were in a melted down shape, the jewel on the outside is one waiting to be melted down.\<br></br>People who like their steaks# rare# (like me) view a perfectly cooked# rare# steak as a true *jewel*. When served with a delicious *cocktail*, what more could one want?
參	Jostling to# participate# in the cocktail competition. See them all, the cocktail waiters elbowing each other in a mad frenzy to win.\<br></br>Three drunks at a bar, all "bending *elbows*" over their *cocktails*, are #participating# in a lively conversation.\<br></br>Story for the simplified version of this character: You# participate# in a dangerous *dog* sled race down a *ski jump*, with everyone *elbowing* the dogs to make them go faster! (Note that the two legs of the *dog* are spaced apart to make room for the *ski jump* primitive.\<br></br>Simplified 参 : The #St Bernard# and the #rooster# are about to# participate# in a cock-fight but to make it fair the #St Bernard# is having his #elbow# tied behind his back.\<br></br>Simplified 参# participate# = *elbow*, *big*, *rooster tail*. Story: Two roosters# participate# in a UFC cockfight in the Octagon! One rooster first drops a *big elbow*, then grabs the other by his *rooster tail*, swings him around and around, and finally throws him against the cage! What a *brawl*!

All the *drunks at the bar* stand up and follow her out.

Mac wants to# repair# things in the bar, but he is blocked (represented by the line separating the person on the left from the right) by *taskmaster* Sweet Dee, who, of course, is sprouting a *rooster tail* since she is, deep down, a bird.
文	*Top hat* + *crossed legged kilt* = *Scotland*. Story: I went to a *Scottish* college and had to study *Scottish* #literature#. It's like English lit, but the only texts were the works of Burns and 'Trainspotting' by Ivan Welsh.\<br></br>Just to add to Heisig’s story, this *Highlander* marks an *X* in a ballot in favor of translating all great# literature# into Scots.
蚊	#mosquito# - the *insects* you'll find in the highlands of *Scotland* (because it's always so wet!).\<br></br>Imagine the *Highlander* running away from a swarm of bloodthirsty# mosquito#s in Louisiana. “I can’t live in a country that has these *insects*!” he says. “In Scotland we only have nice *insects*, like ants and butterflies!” Off to the airport the *Highlander* goes, trailed by these# mosquito#s – the *insects* that make him lose all interest in emigrating to the U.S..\<br></br>A# mosquito# is the *insect* that is distracting *Highlander* from his endeavors.\<br></br>#Mosquito#s have been around for millions of years... so of course you'd find them even in ancient literature.\<br></br>You realize that that *insect*, the giant# mosquito#, is not that awful, since its proboscis is the only thing that can save us from those god-awful bagpipes of the *highlander*.
彥	That naughty old highland *bungee-jumper*, knowing full well that there's nothing between his kilt and his skin, has sculpted his pubic hair in the shape of *rooster tail* feathers in an effort to demonstrate to onlookers just how# erudite# and sophisticated he is.\<br></br>Simplified [ 彦 ] - the# erudite# (accomplished,elegant) #bunji jumper# asked the #cocktail# barman for a martini, shaken and not stirred - " and be so kind as to *omit the umbrella* - its so chav ! I'll be back ...INNNnnnn aaaaaaa sssseccccc ....".\<br></br>I'm really attracted to# erudite#, sophisticated, romantic men. My ideal image of one is someone who sits dramatically on a cliff, writing fine literature about nature with an old-fashioned feather pen.\<br></br>A 24-something woman must choose between two very handsome men want to marry her. One of them is a professional *bungee jumper* and the other is an Olympic *ski jumper*. What what matters to her, though, is: which one is more# erudite#?\<br></br>*Wolverine* in our bungee jumper, standing at the top of a *cliff* in a *top hat* like helmet, ready to jump with his claws out! He sees *Mystique*, and jumps...and with the perfect #erudite# (elegant, accomplished) dive he stabs her!
顏	If that #erudite# *bungee-jumping* *highlander* is jumping off the cliff without his underwear, which of his two# countenance#s will you see? The groomed one under his kilt, or the one under his cap (i.e. his *head*)?\<br></br>"#Countenance#" is just a more *erudite* way of saying "face" - the front part of the *head*.

Why? He has found a very erudite person to serve as a lobbyist for Congress – this oil company is going to have its way with Washington!\<br></br>#Countenance# = the appearance conveyed by a person's face. Story continued from last frame: *Wolverine* *bungee*-jumps off a cliff, stabs *Mystique* and then chopped her *head* clean off. You should see the happy / satisfied# countenance# he shows, with people around show horror and disgust.
產	A *bungee-jumper* salesman stakes his *life* on his #products# working perfectly! He demonstrates them with no safety line.\<br></br>Simplified : [ #产#] - Jackie *Chan* is #standing# on the #cliff# edge *producing* another #bunji jump# stunt for an advert - promoting# products# of Hong Kong.\<br></br>Since he was a little *zygote* this *Bungee jumper* has refused to use any animal# products#. He jumps as “Mr. Green man” and gives all his earnings (he jumps competitively) to animal rights charities. When PETA learns about this they announce that they’ll sponsor his *Bungee jumper* equipment in support of his dedication.\<br></br>If the *bungee-jumper* knows his# products# (algebra: cross product and dot product), his calculations in planning his jump will be correct and his jump will afford him *life* for another day.\<br></br>Every product needs to go through the bungy jump test. See if it can be used live by a customer bungy jumping.
率	*Top hat* + *coccoon* = *Rorschach*, the violent vigilante from Watchmen (think of his hat and masked face). Story: *Rorschach* decides on a way to get the crime-#rate# down - by brutally torturing a criminal in public, to show people he means business. He attaches a long metal *needle* to mains, and sticks it in his victim, causing shooting *sparks* like like a *sparkler*.\<br></br>Due to increasing #rates# of tax, the *top-hatted* owner of a silk *top-hat* factory wants to increase his production #rate#. To do this, he makes his workers sew the silken *cocoons* with burning-hot *sparklers* instead of *needles*, forcing them to work more quickly to avoid getting their fingers burnt. [Heisig is unclear about the stroke order for this character-- the *cocoon* element should be written before *sparkler*.].\<br></br>Please# rate# this circus act 1-5 stars: a *glowing cocoon* wearing a *top hat* balancing on a *needle*. (I used "sparkler" for another primitive, so "glowing" is my replacement.).\<br></br>Alt.: what is the message of this *mysterious* creature? It’s that the United States should lower its tax# rate#. Many citizens wave *sparklers* to celebrate, but the IRS wants to pin him to the ground with a *needle*. (*Mysterious* is *top hat* and *cocoon* together – but this comes in Book II.).\<br></br>You need to remove the *top hat* of this *sparkler* before ignite it. The burn #rate# depends on the thickness of the wick made out of thread of a *cocoon*. The last thing you need to know, is that the *sparkler* won't last more than *10* seconds for safety reasons. // #SPARKLER#: Look at the four dots as the sparks around the #sparkler#.\<br></br>After 10 minutes of no success, I# rate# coming up with a story for this character an impossible feat, so this will have to do: Top hats off to the golden ratio (rate), as illustrated in this lovely cocoon. Light a sparkler to commemo-rate it. --groan--.
摔	When using the# tumble#-drier, be careful not to get your *fingers* caught in it, as it spins at such a fast *rate* that they'll probably be ripped off!\<br></br>Jack and Jill's math skills are limited to what they can count on their *fingers*. They never took trig, so they can't use #rates# to calculate the slope of the hill, which is why they took a# tumble#!\<br></br>Jack and Jill using their fingers rather than a ruler to work out the slope ratio of the hill. Using their fingers for the ratio! No wonder they took a# tumble#.\<br></br>That guy gave *Rorschach* the finger. Big mistake. He ended up taking a "#tumble#".\<br></br>Continued from <a href="/study/kanji/1275">rate</a> <span class="index">(#1275)</span>: You use your *finger* to *rate* the glowing cocoon act just 1 star. This upsets the owner and he pushes you down a hill, where you# tumble# down at an ever increasing *rate*, desperately reaching out with your *fingers* for something - anything - to stop your descent.\<br></br>Think of the phrase “tumble dry.” You pull a horrible practical joke on your friend: you put a pile of *fish fingers* in his dryer, and then select “tumble dry” at the highest *rate* you can select (2000 rpm!). By the time your friend finds out, the dryer is completely encrusted in fish fingers . . . and you’re not friends anymore. It turns out that Herman Cain himself calls to admonish you (see <a href="/study/kanji/1275">rate</a> <span class="index">(#1275)</span> for that reference).
央	Mr. #Big# #Mouth# here thinks he's the# center# of the universe.\<br></br>*St Bernard* with a *box*-like body = *corgi dog*. Story: This *corgi dog* is the #center# of it's owners universe. She loves it so much, she's always feeding it and giving it treats - hence it's weight. Also *corgi dogs* look funny because all their weight is in their #center#, while they have a tiny head and legs.\<br></br>(My story probably doesn’t represent the actual sense of this character, but hopefully it will help you remember it!) Imagine that the Kennedy# Center# now allows *big dogs* inside, but on one condition: they must be led by a *belt*, and if they don’t, they will expel you and your *dog* outside the *Belt*-way! (My# center# will be the *Kennedy# Center#*).
英	#England#, known for it's lovely flower gardens, was once considered the center of society.

巴	As a primitive, this is going to mean *Rubiks Cube*. Story: to become a speed-cuber, you need to keep your *rubiks cube* perfectly clean and oiled. After a few uses, it will develop a #crust# of dirt from your hands will stop the sides spinning freely.\<br></br>You kill the snake in this character by throwing a sliver of the earth’s# crust# into it (stroke 2). After that you include this dead snake into a *mosaic* that depicts Saint George slaying the dragon. It may gross some people out, but come on, it’s realistic!
把	To be a good speed-cuber, you have to #grasp# your *rubiks cube* gently with just your *finger*-tips. But also your mind has to *grasp* the complex algorithms needed to solve it.\<br></br>There are *mosaic* tiles on the subway. You try to #grasp# them, but there is nothing to hold on to. Your *fingers* just slide off. See <a href="/study/kanji/1279">crust</a> <span class="index">(#1279)</span>.\<br></br>You can't quite# grasp# the meaning of this *mosaic* piece in the museum, so you rearrange the whole thing with you *fingers* until it does.\<br></br>You take the *Mosaic of Saint George* to *Tokyo* and put it on display, but no one seems to #grasp# the significance of it.\<br></br>Considering 1279 to be a pie crust, particularly a pot pie. The crust is the only part of the pie you can really# grasp# if you want your hands to be clean while eating it.
爸	Your #papa# may be a *crusty* old man, but he's still your *father*! (Thanks to anon).\<br></br>Sometimes I call my father "father," but when I see him eating a pie, crust first, like a child, I can only think of him as "papa.".\<br></br>Every Xmas my *Father* dresses as #Papa# Christmas and brings me a gift! this time he brought me a *rubiks cube*, woo hoo!
吧	There's a new 80's themed "nerd" #bar# opened near my house. I just go there to shove drinks into my *mouth*, and play *Rubiks Cube*.\<br></br>This# bar# is very unsanitary. I wouldn't put anything from near your *mouth* -- there's a *crust* of filth all over it!\<br></br>Every# bar# I know you just sit with your mouth open guzzling in the beer and just stare at the mosaic of whiskey bottles against the glass wall.\<br></br>This is a special# bar# with a subway *mosaic* behind it for decoration. The sign, oddly enough or appropriately enough, depending on your perspective, says: "*Mouth* Street". See <a href="/study/kanji/11">mouth</a> <span class="index">(#11)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/1279">crust</a> <span class="index">(#1279)</span>.\<br></br>My favorite thing to put in my mouth at that Irish# bar# isn't actually the alcohol-- it's the chicken pot pie! Yum~.\<br></br>The *Rubiks Club* #bar# has a technic to make you drink more. They give you some salty cheesy *crusty* apetizers in order to dry your *mouth*.
色	Six different #colors# are all *bound* up together in a *rubiks cube*.\<br></br>#Color# is a *bound up* wavelength your eyes happen to decipher out of the universal *mosaic*.\<br></br>From the outside, most pies look like they're the same# color#. However, the pie's crust is used to bind up the insides, which can be all kinds of# color#s-- blue blueberries, red strawberries, yellow lemon, etc.
絕	The *Spider-man* comics were #discountinued# for a while, after the printers couldn't make any more red or blue *color* ink. Evenutally they brought the comic back in black and white, with *spider-man* in his black venom suit.\<br></br>The *Spiderman* comics were almost# discontinue#d because they had depicted *Spiderman*, a kid's role model, using a *knife* as a weapon. This was back in the day so the creators relented by putting a *mosaic* on the scene and it was then allowed back in print. After the *mosaic*, everyone thought spiderman was using a gun!\<br></br>The Spiderman comic was# discontinue#d after it portrayed a graphic stabbing of a knife into a pie, spilling guts out everywhere. The censors need to get a life!\<br></br>Simplified-[绝]-[1333]: Due to a shortage of poppy flowers this year, the industrials have #discontinued# their production of red *color* *threads*.

He put an *Easter Basket* on top of the *Christmas tree,* thinking they denoted the same holiday.\<br></br>The strange man has placed a wicker basket on the tree thinking to catch "such and such" as they fall from the sky. Everyone ignores him and gets back to the harvest.\<br></br>Choosing a shadowy place to sit for the outdoor lunch, this family is evaluating #such and such# *tree* to put their blanket and their laden *wicker basket*.
其	Ok, this primitive is going to be *shopping trolley*, you know the metal wheely ones you get at supermarkets. Story: Imagine getting to the supermarket 20mins before closing! you grab a *shopping trolley* and dash around, quickly throwing items in for all of your family - #his-hers-its-theirs#.\<br></br>Use #his and hers# as primitive. late night shopping again: the tool (具) for him does not have enough grip for her and is too big. so we came up with the *his-hers* tool. not quite as long of a handle and with a grip. but wait, there is more: you can use both sides, use the other side of handle for small jobs (not sure what for - the man's business end is down while hers is up).\<br></br>Here’s a giant Easter Basket with double the room for sweets and a large base. Heisig will fill in the rest.
期	Apologies for being graphic, but when it is time for a lady's period during that period of the *month*, she fills up the *hamper* with her hygiene products.\<br></br>Your girlfriend fills her *shopping trolley* with sanitary towels at her #period of time# of the *month*..\<br></br>The laundry hamper should be the first thing you notice. How many months has it been since it was taken out? This is far too great of a# period of time# between washes.
基	If you're anything like me, you let your dirty laundry pile up in the hamper until it spills out and forms a towering mass. Here, at the# base# of the laundry tower of doom (rising out from the *hamper*), the laundry is so old that it has decomposed into #soil#.\<br></br>Building a new garden, you go to Home-#base# (A gardening shop in UK) and fill your *shopping trolley* with fresh *soil*. This is going to form the #base# of your new ornamental garden.
斯	I went to Egypt to see the #Sphinx# a few years ago. It was so impressive that I decided to take a memento home with me. So after dark I pushed a *shopping trolley* up to it, chipped off it's nose with an *axe*, and wheeled it away. Now you know what happened to the# Sphinx#'s nose (it has pride of place in my living room).\<br></br>After cutting it open with a *tomahawk*, archaeologists discovered that the Mighty# Sphinx# was, much to their surprise, nothing more than an elaborate ancient Egyptian laundromat, as evidenced by the *hampers* everywhere. Who would have guessed?\<br></br>I am trying to scale the side of the #Sphinx# with a clothing *hamper* strapped to my back and a *tomahawk*. When I get to the top of the #Sphinx#, I am going to chop the straps with the *tomahawk* so the clothing *hamper* drops to the ground. It's a bizarre physics experiment! See <a href="/study/kanji/1287">his-hers-its-theirs</a> <span class="index">(#1287)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/856">catty</a> <span class="index">(#856)</span>.\<br></br>This is the phonetic "Sir" (si) , in# Sphinx# it is there purely for phonetic effect - therefore primitive = SIR . White folks pushing their SHOPPING TROLLIES get a load of respect - SIR this - SIR that - SIR, can I serve you ? - SIR,have a nice day. Us braves from the reservation since taken' to carrying our TOMAHAWKS to the mart are now also SIRS . Hell, politeness don't cost diddly-squat ..
甚	The# tremendously# unpleasant part of laundry is #match#ing those damn socks. It's like the *hamper* eats half of them up. (The stroke order of this character emphasizes this idea perfectly: you have the hamper, and then the human legs, representing the socks. Then you finish the box, to represent the primitive for match, and thus the task of matching them.).\<br></br>Simplified-[甚]-[1340]: (animal legs instead of human legs) At the supermarket, I am always amazed at the #tremendously# long line of *shopping trolleys* pulled by a small vehicule. I was wondering how these were tied up together. Thanks to Heisig, I know now that they simply use a *fishhook*!\<br></br>You are pulling clothes out of the clothing *hamper* one by one to see if they *match*. The boredom! Why does it seem that the *hamper* has become #tremendously# large? See <a href="/study/kanji/1287">his-hers-its-theirs</a> <span class="index">(#1287)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/1250">match</a> <span class="index">(#1250)</span>.\<br></br>(In book 2, from <a href="/study/kanji/2673">tolerate</a> <span class="index">(#2673)</span> onwards, "Hercules" will be used to create a memorable image for this keyword.) Story: Hercules is# tremendously# fast and strong, and his shopping powers have no *match* anywhere on earth: he can completely fill a *shopping trolley* with the weekly groceries in less than 10 seconds.\<br></br>One of the lesser known labours of *hercules* (primitive name from book 2), was to defeat the #tremendous# half-man, half-*laundry hamper* monster of the Laundromat of Delphi. It refused to give back any clean laundery, so the people ancient world had become #tremendously# smelly. *Hercules* defeated it by trapping the monster's *human legs* in a *box*.\<br></br>You hear about a# tremendously# awkward situation: A guy was on *match.com* looking for a new girlfriend when his current girlfriend walked in with a *laundry hamper* (she wanted to surprise him by doing his laundry). She was so upset she just dumped the *laundry hamper* on him and walked out.
貴	First, *purse*: if you are threatened at gunpoint by someone who wants your *purse*, it’s best just to drop it on the *middle* of the *ground* so you’re not injured. Story: This car is so# expensive# that even if I filled my *purse* to the brim with *shells* I wouldn’t have enough money to buy it! Sound: gui4 Buying a GUI in *Japan* is really# expensive#, although also honorable.\<br></br>If you own the magic *purse* of Hermione from Harry Potter, you can grab as many *shells* as needed even for the #expensive# buyings. // #PURSE#: This #purse# accepts coins only *one* by *one*. You slide *one* coin in the slot located in the *middle* of the #purse#.\<br></br>Wow, this *purse* is really #expensive#! I'll need a lot of *shells* to pay for it.\<br></br>I have friends who have *purses* that are more# expensive# that the amount of money / #shells# they will ever contain over their lifetime.\<br></br>What an #expensive# *purse* up there! Do you have enough *shells* to pay for it? See <a href="/study/kanji/51">shellfish</a> <span class="index">(#51)</span>.
遺	When you reach the end of your *road*, you# bequeath# your belongings. It seems people only really care about those that are #expensive#.\<br></br>The State has built some *expensive* highways and *roads* and thus has #bequeathed# their *expensive* maintenance to the future generations.\<br></br>A Washingtonite# bequeath#s his *expensive* sports car to his son, who can now use it to cruise up and down the *George Washington Parkway* -- but unfortunately gets in an expensive car accident very soon.
舞	Top primitive = *hot tub*. Bottom *evening* + *monicle* = *sunglasses*. Story: Have you seen the Lady Gags - "Just #Dance#" music video? She's #dancing# around in a *hottub* all wet just wearing *sunglasses*.\<br></br>A *hot tub* is a big *oaken tub* in which I like to *recline*. Story: a multimillionaire spent the entire *evening* (7:00-11:59 p.m.) playing# Dance## Dance# Revolution. He was so exhausted that he collapsed in the hot tub, only to lose his $15,000 diamond *monocle* down the drain.\<br></br>Another graphic story, for which I apologize - but don't those seem to stick the best in your head? Here we have someone reclining in a hot tub (indicated by the first eight strokes). On his #fleshy# penis, he wears a pair of *glasses* (monocle), and he is flexing and unflexing to make it comically# dance#.
無	Imagine getting in a *hot-tub*, lighting the *fire* beneath it to keep it warm, and then spending the evening soaking, letting all your problems, worries and body aches drift away to #nothing#-ness.\<br></br>Imagine yourself reclining in a *hot tub* with the *cooking fire* burning underneath to keep it warm, thinking of absolutely# nothing#.\<br></br>Simplified 无.
撫	Think of the right hand side of this character as *hot tub* instead of *nothing*, since it is a tub over a cooking fire. Then the most# comfort# you can experience is to receive a massage from your partner's *fingers* while in a *hot tub*.\<br></br>(Continuing on from 1295) Thinking of *nothing* gets a bit tiresome after a while, so you decide to head to *Tokyo* to find some great# comfort# food.\<br></br>You're on a space ship, looking out into the vast void that is the *nothing* of outer space. You press your *fingers* and nose up against the glass to get a better view, and take #comfort# from knowing that you're safe and warm inside the ship. See <a href="/study/kanji/1295">nothing</a> <span class="index">(#1295)</span>.\<br></br>Simplified-[抚]-[612]: Edward Scissor*fingers* tries to #comfort# himself because *nothing* of everyday life is intended to be manipulated with normal hands.\<br></br>Look not at the *finger* pointing, but at what it points to: #nothing#ness --- this lesson is a great# comfort# to us.\<br></br>Touch with my fingers to offer# comfort#, I have nothing else but my fingers to offer as# comfort#.
且	gesturing to the new and even more boring shelf of items.\<br></br>Imagine going to your otaku friends house for the first time, and he shows you his *shelf* packed with Japanese figurines. Don't worry, there's #moreover# there...\<br></br>Imagine you spent your life carving the most beautiful, intricate *bookshelf* possible, which you would then sell for millions to fund your retirement. But then an arsonist destroyed it. You say to the person: “you destroyed my *bookshelf,* but# moreover#, you’ve destroyed my dreams.”.
姐	Your #older sister# is the *woman* who's been left on the *shelf* (i.e. not taken) when it comes to marriage.\<br></br>My# older sister# has grown up to be an honorable *woman,* but when I was younger [this part isn’t true] she would stuff me into the *bookshelf* in her room if I was getting on her nerves!\<br></br>Your# older sister# is the *woman* who can reach those yummy cookies on the top *shelf* for you, so start sucking up!\<br></br>Your friend: "Hey, who is that *woman* with the fantastic set of *shelves*?" You: "Ahem, that's my# older sister#...".\<br></br>My #older sister# is a *woman* as tall as a *shelf* in the bookstore!
組	At my kid's play-#group# they have hundreds of *Spider-man* toys all lined up on a special high *shelf*, which the kids can play with (if they ask nicely).\<br></br>In math, you have a field of topology called knot theory, which basically involves knots (which can be made out of thread) and various mathematical# group#s represented by them. Here,# group#s are divided up by shelves, one per isomorphism class.\<br></br>Seen from above, the tour #group# forms a long *thread* winding its way through the *shelves* of the museum (Thanks to anon).
祖	In Asia (Japan, china, taiwan)# ancestor#s worship is popular. Most families have a little *altar* with candles and pictures dedicated to their #ancestors# on a special *shelf* in their living room.\<br></br>I imagine that one of my #ancestors# had an entire *bookshelf* full of nothing but pictures of *altars*. Very religious! I admire her for that.\<br></br>You have an *altar* full of *shelves* / drawers, where you keep the ashes of your# ancestor#s.
助	Can you# assist# me to move this *shelf* unit? It's too big - I 've tried with all my *power* but it wont budge.\<br></br>Imagine how easier it would be to be #assisted# by Yoda *(Star War)* and his force *power* in order to mount *shelves* from Ikea.\<br></br>(The following use of# assist# doesn’t match the character’s real meaning, but anyway . . . ) Your soccer coach tells you: “look kid, you don’t really have enough *power* in you to make great #assists#. Why don’t you spend your time at the *bookshelf* instead?” (He’s asking you to put the *bookshelf* before trying to make *power*-ful# assist#s.).\<br></br>HELP! (RTK1 keyword) Someone's pinned under this bookSHELF and someone with a lot of POWERful muscles needs to# ASSIST# me in order to lift it off!--thanks to FudoMyo.
並	I will name the (full) primitive of this character *Siamese twins*, who, of course, are always# side by side#. And therefore, I’ll name the condensed version of the primitive *Siamese twins at an amusement park*, where it’s easy to become upside down (on a roller coaster, for example).\<br></br>Forget the book - this is a *chinese dragon boat*, with *horns* at the top, two *walking-stick oars*, and *drops of water* flying off as the oars hit the *water surface*. Upside down form is an *upside down boat*. Story: It's the Dragon Boat Festival in Taiwan! imagine watching all the *dragon* boats being rowed down the river, #side by side#. (thanks to sgrant).\<br></br>I keep forgetting how to write this character, so I'm changing its primitive meaning to a *tandem bicycle*. It has *two horns* (bicycle *horns*), between which *two* (as a roman numeral) people can ride# side by side#. The condensed primitive meaning shall be a futuristic *tandem hoverbike* that can additionally travel upside down.\<br></br>Ebony And Ivory - Live Together In Perfect Harmony -# Side By Side# On My Piano Keyboard. Pictogram of three piano keys - *ebony & ivory & ebony*.\<br></br>Double each of the strokes in the character for STANDING UP, and you have two dudes standing# SIDE BY SIDE#. Primitive: same, but can also mean# SIDE BY SIDE# AND UPSIDE DOWN when the bottom and top parts are flipped.\<br></br>The part that looks like the Roman numeral II is also the sign of Gemini. Two mischievous Gemini twins with two sets of little devil horns plot their next schemes side-by-side.
普	Here we have *Siamese twins* campaigning for# universal# human rights, explaining that everyone lives under the same *sun*, so everyone should have the same# universal# rights.\<br></br>#Universal# Studios in Florida have a new ride! you get in a *dragon boat* and using 3D glasses and screens, it simulates riding on the surface of the *sun*!\<br></br>The# universal# laws of physics prevent you from riding a *tandem bicycle* over the *sun*. However,# Universal# Studios had a *bicycle* being ridden over the moon (sort of) in the film E.T. Differentialte from <a href="/study/kanji/2109">universe</a> <span class="index">(#2109)</span>.\<br></br>#Universal# love - #side by side# under(sic) the #sun#.\<br></br>The Gemini twins are suns (stars) side by side; since they're a constellation in the universe, they're certainly quite# universal#.\<br></br>The# universal# order is many #suns# appearing *side by side* in the sky.
業	These Siamese twins have *not yet* decided what# profession# they will jointly pursue, so until then they have decided to go to an amusement park and have fun, hence being *Siamese twins at an amusement park*. #Simplified#: the Siamese twins’# profession# is not writing characters, since they only remember the first five strokes of *profession*. Wait, this is the simplified character? Never mind . . .\<br></br>My #profession# is boat-repair-man. When we get a boat in, we turn it *upside down* on the dock, look for leaks and fill in holes. We do a very #profession#-al job and it takes ages for the sealant to dry and for it to be water-tight - so we always have to turn away the owners who come day after day. "is it ready?" "no *not yet*!".\<br></br>Simplified-[业]-[1351]: When I entered my current #profession# (cactus farm), we were four applicants *side by side*. *The first three were discarded*!\<br></br>In the future, to tackle the problem of aerial congestion, a law is passed, saying that you're not allowed to ride a *tandem hoverbike* in the commuting lane if you have *not yet* got a# profession#.\<br></br>Simplified-[业]-[1351]: When I entered my current# profession# we were four applicants #side by side# ( Thanks Dunki). The first three were discarded! What is my# profession# - it's traditional 業 - I care for *small sheep* ( certain fonts are clearly sheep 羊 on top of small 小) - #lambs# - so it's quite seasonal.\<br></br>Consider the top part (above the bit that looks like the bottom of tree) Team Rocket-- they're a duo (like Gemini) that acts like sheep (the bottom part). Here they are sitting on top of a tree, hiding out as usual-- for an incompetent organization of evil, this is kind of their# profession#...\<br></br>When you are turned completely *upside down* (e.g. through health issues, divorce, etc), you may be #not ready# to take on a# profession#. (I have severe Crohn's Disease, so this story speaks loudly to me.).
對	Here we have *Siamese twins at an amusement park*. They fall off a ride (!) and land in the *soil*, and one of the twin’s arms breaks. He says to the other, we can just *glue* this back together, right? And the other says, that’s right!\<br></br>Continuing from last frame. I fix the *upside-down boats* by packing the leaky holes with *soil* and then *gluing* it in. #that's right# - sounds crazy but it's the best solution and makes the boats perfectly watertight.\<br></br>#That's right#, my <a href="/study/kanji/1304">profession</a> <span class="index">(#1304)</span> is *sheep* herding to make *glue*.

"That's right." "That's right." Yes men: a #profession# that makes you feel like you're about an #inch# (寸) tall.\<br></br>The shrubs are *side by side and upside down* held to the #soil# only by *glue* -- #that's right#, isn't it?\<br></br>Sing "Well, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, upside and side by side: that's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat, glue to the ground their (tiger) feet" To the tune of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2sMuVPMkkk.
共	This as a primitive is going to be *Noah's Ark*. Noah kept plenty of *salad* on board to entice the animals with their *animal legs* to scurry on board all #together#, two by two. (thanks to Django).\<br></br>Here’s a shining example of *French cuisine*: a nice *salad* with frog *animal legs* on top, served# together#. (My primitive name for this will be *French cuisine*.).\<br></br>Salad with legs = the Veggie Tales characters! They sing a cheesy little song about friendship and how they can do everything# together#.\<br></br>It is generally considered that the healthiest way to drink or do drugs is to do them# together# with other people as a social thing. Here we have a marijuana plant: leafy green *salad* that make you feel like you're scurrying around on *animal legs*. Break it out# together# with your friends and have some fun. (Primitive: marijuana).
供	*Mr T* actually keeps a large# supply# of animal food in his *Ark*, because he secretly believes 2012 will bring the second great flood. Instead of *Noah's Ark*, it will be *Mr T's Ark*.\<br></br>*Mr T* is great at building things (on the A-team), so he #supplies# *Noah* with his ark and continues to #supply# him with food and other support. He just needs animals now..\<br></br>Here we have *Mr. T.* wearing a French chef's hat and providing a steady #supply# of *French cuisine* to a restaurant's kitchen. See <a href="/study/kanji/1306">together</a> <span class="index">(#1306)</span>.\<br></br>If you are #together# with *person*, you can# supply# each other with what you need.\<br></br>If you need a# supply#, contact your pot dealer, i.e. the #person# who has *pot*. (Referring to the fact that I use the keyword *marijuana* for 共.).
異	*Noah's Ark* is a #different# / #strange# kind of boat - for it has a *rice field* growing on the top deck, to feed the grazing animals.\<br></br>Apple's old slogan was "think# DIFFERENT#." How did they accomplish this? By putting all of their BRAINS TOGETHER.\<br></br>I was OK with frog's legs on my salad. But this has gone too far: frog's *brains* on top of my *French cuisine*? It's just too #different# from what I am used to. I can't eat it. See <a href="/study/kanji/14">rice field</a> <span class="index">(#14)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/1306">together</a> <span class="index">(#1306)</span>.\<br></br>you say, attempting to be polite. (Differentiate from <a href="/study/kanji/122">strange</a> <span class="index">(#122)</span>).\<br></br>“That’s . . .# different#,” is all you can say about the French restaurant that serves pig *brains* on top of every *French cuisine* dish.\<br></br>The scientists were trying to prove that everyone thinks the same, but when they put all the *brains* in their collection #together#, they found that every one was# different#.\<br></br>Simplified-[616]: A snake breeder shows you the #different# *snakeskins* that are parts of the snake world. Your irrational fear of snakes makes you raise your *two hands* in front of you to express your denial to touch their *snakeskins*.\<br></br>Your *brain* feels# different# when it's on *pot*. (Quite literally, it is sitting on pot, which is the primitive I use for 共.).
巷	*Noah* has even installed bowling #lanes# on his ship. He goes there nightly to bowl, with his *snakeskin* bowling shoes. Coincidently, the snakes seem to have all disappeared from the ark..\<br></br>You are now walking down memory# lane#, *together* with the *snake* from <a href="/study/kanji/487">remember</a> <span class="index">(#487)</span>, which by now has become nothing more than a *snakeskin*.\<br></br>It is one of those mid-day cooking shows. As a gimmick, they have five chefs line up and each is given a #lane# to place his or her food into. In this #lane#, we have *French cuisine* that includes *snakeskin*. Uhh, no thanks! See <a href="/study/kanji/1306">together</a> <span class="index">(#1306)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/488">already</a> <span class="index">(#488)</span>.\<br></br>At the victory# lane# at 24 hours of Les Mans, you first drive your car through *French cuisine* (because victory tastes great), then get a *snakeskin* thrown at you (to represent that you have triumphed over nature).\<br></br>*Pot* head *snakes* on a# lane#! (Snakes under the influence of pot, describing the layout of this character since 共 appears to go anywhere and everywhere.) // Alternatively, some consider *pot* to be the gate to a *snakey*# lane# of drug abuse. (Note: this is using 共 as the primitive "marijuana".).
港	Did you know the *water* in a #port# is divided into several shipping *lanes*? It's all very organised, to stop boats hitting each other.
選	Wow, so many *snakeskin* vendors *together* by the side of the *road*! How am I going to# choose# between them?\<br></br>Isn't this how the US presidential ELECTion (RTK1 keyword) works? You are given a choice between two SNAKEs. Their politics are actually strung TOGETHER but you get to feel as though you# CHOOSE# which one you want to lead you down the political road for the next four years. So which snake are you going to# CHOOSE#?--thanks to nakome.\<br></br>I decide I want to become a chef, and I #choose# to become a student at the *French Cuisine* Institute. But at every class, they're really pushing the *snakeskin* at every opportunity. Finally, I get fed up with it, and #choose# to forgo my tuition and hit the *road*. See <a href="/study/kanji/488">already</a> <span class="index">(#488)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/1306">together</a> <span class="index">(#1306)</span>.\<br></br>it hisses. "One way leads to where you want to go, the other to certain death.# Choose# you path with care!".\<br></br>Think of Robert Frost's The Road Not Taken. *Noah's ark* has two possible course to take, Noah# choose#s the one less traveled by, but the male and female snakes wanted to be safe. Noah later discovered that the two snakes had went off on their own and left behind their *two snakeskins*.\<br></br>You lead a “#choose# life” rally right on the *George Washington Parkway* with posters and such. Some are hostile to your presence – *two snakeskins* get thrown at you – but someone else stops their car and gives you a whole tray of *French cuisine*!\<br></br>On the road to Noah's ark, Noah's wife was nagging him for some new clothes (cause all wives nag). So he let her# CHOOSE# one set of animals to kill to make some clothing from. All that's left of the snakes are 2 snakeskins, which were later used to make some bowling shoes.\<br></br>Two snakes strung together on the road represent two paths,# choose# which snake (path) you want to take.\<br></br>At the side of the #road#, the vendor has a souvenir for sale, made of #two snakeskins# fixed #together#. You can# choose# whether to buy it.\<br></br>I# choose# to have two stories for this character: (1) You support same-*snake* marriage: let them# choose# whether or not to #together# head down this *road*. (2) (Using 共 as a primitive for marijuana) US Politics: you get to# choose# between two nearly indistinguishable *snakes*, and neither will take the *road* to *marijuana* legalization.
井	This #well# is *two* *walking sticks* deep.\<br></br>The character for# well# looks like those simple water-wells where the pit with water is on the ground marked just by four wooden beams.\<br></br>Samuel *Ji* leans beyond his *two hands* as he looks into the# well#, and promptly falls right into the# well#. (Note that here the *ji* element goes beyond the *two* element, whereas in our *two hands* primitive, provided both horizontal strokes are there, the *ji* does not extend beyond the *two*. If this is confusing just compare the pictures in RTH.
亞	Looks like a big + (plus sign) bewteen the hazni for *two*. Story: There are *two* main countries in# Asia# - Japanese *plus* *China. There are some others but they don't matter politically or economically..\<br></br>Simplified 亚 (Japan 亜)# Asia# = *one* + *profession*. Story: The number *one profession* now in #Asia# is banking.

Story: There's only *one profession* a foreigner can choose if they want to live in# Asia#: Teaching English as a Foreign Language.
惡	#Evil# Communism descended into the *heart* of *Asia* -- China – during the 20th century.\<br></br>If Joseph Conrad were alive, he would've wanted to write a new sequel to his *Heart* of Darkness, this one called *Heart* of# Evil#, and set in *Asia* instead of Africa.\<br></br>Most people from *Asia* believe the *Asian* *heart* does not contain# evil#. Either people are good, or they have been corrupted by external forces earlier in life (or in a previous life!) to commit #evil# acts.
角	A museum display of some twigs *bound* together under a *glass canopy* and embedded in *soil*, showing the first device used to measure an #angle# (thanks to FudoMyo ).\<br></br>Simplified 角. Primitive man *utilized* simply sharp objects: horn, corners, anything with a sharp #angle#. He would *bind them up* to *utilize* them. traditionally it is just *soil* inside. Grade 2 Kanji. horn, point, corner.\<br></br>I’ll use *math test* as the primitive for this character, since those often have tricky questions about# angle#s on them.
解	You have to #untie# a cow after hog-tying it. Be careful what *angle* you hold the *dagger* when cutting the ropes, or you might slice and *cows* hoof.\<br></br>To# untie# the #cow#, you need to hold the *dagger* at the correct #angle#.\<br></br>A moment of relief: you# untie# your shoes after a difficult *math test* that you did well on. Now you can be certain that you won’t have to work at the slaughterhouse, stabbing *daggers* into *cows*, after all.\<br></br>The emblem of this ranch is a *carpenter's square*. The *cows* they raise, have their horns the particular shape of a *carpenter's square*. They tie the horns with a rope when young and they #untie# them when the extremity of the horns are spaced exactly the size of a *dagger*.
嘴	#NAUGHTY STORY ALERT# So the virgin you have been pursuing tells you she will let you into her #orifice.# Your *mouth* drops open in disbelief, so you *stop* everything you are doing, *spoon* her, and try to work it in at just the right *angle.*.\<br></br>At a finishing school: Now ladies, keep one's# orifice# at a right angle to THIS carpenters square when eating.\<br></br>Little girl to little boy : " #This# #mouth# is an# orifice# set at this #angle# and down there ,if you care to look , I have another# orifice# set at the complete opposite #angle#.." ...."*GULP*".\<br></br>You got a really bad grade on a *math test,* and because you don’t want your parents to see it, you decide to tear it up by making hundreds of *footprints* on it, then taking a *spoon* and putting it into your *mouth*. When they ask where it went you can simply say “it disappeared into my# orifice#.” (Gross!).
再	For me, a *ceiling* and *glass cover* you put over the *soil* = *greenhouse*. Story: I invite my singing group over to my house, to practise in the garden. We all sing but it's a big lacklustre, so I scream "#once more#, this time with FEELING". This time they sing so loudly that my *greenhouse* shatters! perfect!\<br></br>I changed keyword to "one more time" (as the Daft Punk song).

扁	I'm going to ignore Heisig and go with the cooler primitive name for this from the kanji site - *manga comic book*. Story: in Japanese convenience stores, the manga / hentai comic *tomes* are all kept by the *door*, usually #flat#-packed in plastic shrink wrapping.\<br></br>#Door# + "tome" = *primitive* #book cover# .........and the character's meaning is " as# flat# as a *book cover* ".\<br></br>Heisig says: "The book cover that you ripped off the tome in the last frame, the "door" to the tome, is lying# flat# on the floor, right where you let it fall, and where you will soon join it when the librarian comes in to punch your lights out.".\<br></br>A good thick book is a *door* to knowledge.

甫	This character, for so many reasons (despite never having tried it myself), makes me think of injecting heroin, so I take the keyword# Fu# to be as in "You foo'" (short for fool) in street-talk, since injecting heroin is likely to be a foolish thing to do. You have the *needle* going down into the train tracks in your arm (also reminiscent of part of the character for #risk#, as this is a risky thing to do), and you don't want to waste a single *drop*.\<br></br>Vietnam war - you're suddenly attacked! The solder next you shouts F***CK...#FU#.. and is then shot dead mid-sentence. All that's left is his *dogtag*.\<br></br>A druggie at Fairfield University (#F.U.#) is injecting heroin into his *flesh* with a *needle*, and out comes *one drop of* blood. See <a href="/study/kanji/10">ten</a> <span class="index">(#10)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/13">month</a> <span class="index">(#13)</span>.\<br></br>#FU#BAR/SNA#FU#/TAR#FU# in WWII. Your battle buddy has been hit, so you must inject a *needle* with a *drop* of morphine into his *flesh* (see the 十 go down the middle of 月 in the stroke order) to calm him down. Finally, you get his blood type from his *dogtag*.\<br></br>My Dr. is Dr. #Fǔ#. he is adept at *utilizing* a *needle* to extract just one *drop* of blood. He has a Ph.D.(博士) you know because he is <a href="/study/kanji/1338">knowledgeable</a> <span class="index">(#1338)</span>.\<br></br>The evil Dr.# Fu# Manchu *utilizes* a *needle* (note how these two overlap) to inject *drops* of LSD into people’s flesh – just to see how they react!\<br></br>The primitives in this character are 10, utility/screwdriver, and drop. Let this character mean Batman, represented by his utility belt of ten utility screwdrivers and only a tiny drop of skin visible in his whole costume. Any criminals who see Batman know they're screwed, and they scream "FU!".
補	Taking #Fu# to represent shooting heroin and thus *pain medication* in general as a primitive, then here we have a fentanyl# patch#: it's like *pain medication* in #clothing# form, i.e. that you wear. It makes you feel #patch#ed up.\<br></br>The mysterious Poe Toaster is actually a student at *Fairfield University (F.U.)* who wears a *cloak* and is seen in a certain #patch# of the Baltimore cemetery where Poe is buried. See <a href="/study/kanji/1336">Fu</a> <span class="index">(#1336)</span>.\<br></br>*Dr. Fu Manchu* once had a dog named# Patch#, but one day it ripped holes in his *cloak*. Angrily, he throttled the poor creature with its *dog tag*, and used its own skin to# patch# up his *cloak*.\<br></br>At the dump store, you can buy this really cool *cloak* that is# patch#ed with lots of *dog tags*.\<br></br>Nowadays, Batman has very little cloth on his costume-- everything is Kevlar and other materials! The only bit of cloth is a# patch#-- the one that shows his logo across his chest.\<br></br>James Bond has made MI6 upset (he was caught goofing off when he was supposed to rescue a group of people), so he decided to# patch# up relations by throwing a *cloak* around *Dr. Fu Manchu*, thus capturing him once and for all (until he escaped – read on . . . ).\<br></br>The Vietnam solder wears a special *cloak* of camouflage / invisability. Unforttunately it gets torn as he craws through the undergrowth, so he had to #patch# it up using the cords from his *dogtags*.
博	After going to school for *ten* years, you too can become a# knowledgeable# Doctor. Then whenever you wear a *gummed label* on your shirt, it will have "Dr." in front of your name to let everyone know how# knowledgeable# you are.\<br></br>The vietnam solder is hurt, but don't worry - the medics are very #knowledgeable#. First a *needle* in the arm to ease the pain, then check the *dogtag*, and then stick the *wound* closed with *glue*. Right side will now be *army medic* (a doctor wearing a *dogtag* who sticks people back together with special *glue*).\<br></br>The Jesuits over at *Fairfield University (F.U.)* want you to be more #knowledgeable# about Jesus, so they *glue* a *cross* to the door of your theology classroom.

Too proud to admit the mistake, the doctor gives lots of *pain medication* to dull the patient's senses.\<br></br>I will rename *gummed label* “Dr. Fu’s lair.” It is where *Dr. Fu* has escaped to continue his evil plots – it’s nearly impossible to get into because he has placed radioactive super-*glue* at the entrance, designed to trap and kill people who try to break in. Story: A very# knowledgeable# person at MI6 is able to find the way to *Dr. Fu’s Lair* with merely the *needle* of a Geiger Counter, as he knows that the lair is filled with glue around the edges.\<br></br>DOCTORS (RTK1 keyword) are very# KNOWLEDGEABLE#. In their work, they often need to take blood samples using NEEDLES, and to label these samples with GUMMED LABELS.\<br></br>The right-hand primitive is an inch-high Batman-- Robin! Robin is very knowledgable aboutBat-things-- he knows 10 ways to disarm someone, 10 ways to diffuse a bomb, 10 things that Batman doesn't even know about himself.\<br></br>A# knowledgeable# nurse who takes a blood sample, after they take out the *needle*, will attach a *sticky label* with the patient's name to the syringe to avoid errors.
搏	Don't you hate it when stores apply really sticky *gummed labels* to their products? You have to# wrestle# it off with your *fingers*, and it always leaves a sticky residue.\<br></br>The things that break most often in #wrestling# are the *fingers*, so after the match you take some *pain medication* and simply *glue* back your *fingers* into place. No surgery cause you're probably going to break them again anyway.\<br></br>You are a star athlete at *Fairfield University (F.U.)* and you are about to #wrestle# at a big tournament. But the referee notices you have *glue* all over your *fingers*. Suspicious of cheating, he halts the match and makes you go wash it off.

Dr. Fu passes out (but doesn’t die) and Bond emerges victorious.\<br></br>Batman's awesome at fighting and can just nerve-strike an enemy with his finger! Robin's not quite as good; if he wants to take down an opponent, he kind of has to# wrestle# them...\<br></br>The *army medic* #wrestles# with his patient whilst trying to remove a piece of shrapel from the guys *finger*. he just wont keep still!
都	Primitive on the right side = *the slums* (a disgusting place - the opposite of the pinnicle ). Story: *The slums* is a seedy# metropolis#, with people shagging *love-dolls* in the street..\<br></br>You are watching a *puppet* show. To hide the puppeteers, they have made it seem as if the show is taking place in a huge #metropolis#, with the *city walls* doing most of the work of blocking out the bodies of the puppeteers.

Sound: dou1 An *American* sets up a dou-gh shop in East Berlin that’s also a dou. It will help you escape from both (another word for this character) East Berlin and East Germany.
部	The government health# department# knows that the *slums* is a health hazzard, but they refuse to do anything about it -and they *muzzle* anyone who tries to expose this scandal.\<br></br>The government# department# most reviled in Beijing has no name. It simply *muzzles* people that speak out against the party. It's jurisdiction though only lies within the *city walls* so dissenters ofter try to escape the city.\<br></br>At the “Security #department#” of *East Berlin*, people who try to climb over the *city walls* are at the very least *muzzled* so that they’re humiliated and also unable to speak about trying to do it.

幻	I opened my clothes cupboard one day, and found a large mass of glowing *coccoons* hanging from a *clothes hanger*. It looked so odd it was almost #unreal#.\<br></br>Did you know that if you put a silk *cocoon* to the left of a *clothes hanger*, it will turn into a silk dress the next day? That’s# unreal#! (OK, maybe not.).\<br></br>Only in #unreal# #fantasy# novels would you find *cocoons* growing on *clothes hangers*.
司	Imagine a porn director #taking charge of# a porn shoot. As soon as he arrives on set, he shouts "put your clothes on the *clothes hanger*"! "Now i want to see this *one* guy in this girls *mouth*". This primitive will mean *porn director* (thanks to dingomick).\<br></br>The three musketeers know how to #take charge of# a situation. They put their incredibly sharp *clothes hangers* together (yes, that’s what they normally use their swords for, being peaceful folk), and say with a wide-open *mouth,* *one* for all and all for *one*!\<br></br>Commonly seen in 公司 (gong1si1) 'company'. Think of the *one* *mouth* (the CEO) who #takes charge of# the Chinese #clothes hanger# company.
詞	*porn* director says on set -I don't want to hear anyone *speaking* during this movie. I only want to hear the girl say one #word# - "give it to me" (okay that's 4..).\<br></br>A good *dictionary* will let you *take charge of* all the# word#s in the English language. They’re much easier to use than Chinese dictionaries, at least. Imagine yourself pointing to# word#s in a dictionary and saying, "you go here! You go there!".\<br></br>My Pleco Chinese *dictionary* for my Smart Phone lets me *take charge of* all the #words# by creating personalized# word# lists and flashcards. I'll be able to *take charge of* the Chinese language in no time!\<br></br>#Words# *take charge of speech*.
舟	Looks like a# boat# carrying 2 people, with oars and a rudder.\<br></br>(Radical 137) This# boat# has the form of a giant moon-shaped *glass cover* (imagine it tilted on its side) so that everyone has a great view of the water. On the top you have a communications antenna, the little *drop*. There’s a *drop* of cargo inside, and below the waterline (the long line) you have countless *drops* of water that make up the ocean. In its primitive form the *waterline* appears to stop at the right side of the# boat# and the left part tilts down a little.
船	This *boat* is a sail-#ship#, blown along by all the sailors onboard *burping* into the sails! (*burp* = wind + mouth, or more traditionally legs + mouth).\<br></br>Although this character means any water-going vessel, I remember the key word through the phrase 'the# ship# of state' -- run by politicians who *belch* nothing but *wind* from their *mouths*, it's amazing that the *boat* stays afloat! [In future *belch* may also mean a *windbag politico*.].\<br></br>Suppose that you let out a huge *belch* just as a *boat* is nearing the shore. The force of your belch knocks the# ship# against some rocks and a #ship#-wreck results. Everyone survives but you’re super-embarrassed! Note that the last part of *wind* in the “belch” primitive doesn’t hook up – maybe because the wind released by a belch is not as strong as that released by, say, a missile.\<br></br>A #ship# is like a *boat*, only bigger and full of rude sailors who *burp* frequently.
般	What #sort# of *boat* is this? Oh look it has *missles*, so it must be a *warship*, ready to# sort# out problems with pirates. This primitive will mean *warship*.\<br></br>Here is a *boat* carrying a shipment of liquorice all-#sorts#; it has been hit by a *missle*, and is sinking, turning the water around it black and sugary. What# sort# of people would do such a thing? A rival confectionary company, clearly. [As a primitive, this character shall be given the more concrete meaning of *liquorice allsorts*].\<br></br>A *boat* that shoots *missiles* from the deck is one# sort# of Navy weapon, along with aircraft carriers, submarines and so forth.\<br></br>An implementation of the bogus-*sort* algorithm: this war *boat* launches some *missiles* with numbers on them to be# sort#ed out. Now you check if they have landed in the correct order. If not, try again! (Thanks to anon).
盤	On this *warship* they serve amazing *dishes* of expensive food on a silver #tray# to the crew. You see, it's UK royal navy and just because they're solders, they still had class.\<br></br>It's all very well saying that the lady loves milk# tray#, but all I've got to offer her are some *liquorice allsorts* in a *dish*!\<br></br>Simplified 盘# tray# = *boat*, *dish*. Story: You are a server on a tropical cruise voyage carrying a# tray# with drinks and small appetizers. A tourist passenger then bumps into you, and the# tray# with all the *dishes* fall off the *boat* into the deep blue sea below.\<br></br>A# tray# is my favorite *sort* of *dish*. That’s because it can carry so much food! Enough to feed an entire family.\<br></br>A #tray# is a *sort* of *dish*, but not really. Infact, it is a *sort* of *dish* which is very inappropriate for using on a *boat*, because when the *missiles* strike the hull your are likely to spill your meal.\<br></br>A# tray# is a *sort* of *dish*. To make it easier to imagine, picture yourself on a boat. Missiles are frequently being fired at them, and so you need a hard, plastic# tray# to hold your food as the boat is going to rock from side to side quite a bit.
搬	The *warship* comes a cross a bunch of moored pirate-ships in his territory. The captain points his *finger* at the distant ocean and gives a warning - "You'd better #relocate# yourselves that way in 12 hours, or we'll blow you out of the sea".\<br></br>FINGERS on the WARSHIP (RTK1 primitive) sorting incoming ships into SORTs typing out a morse code message furiously. The message:# RELOCATE# the fleet immediately!\<br></br>When a worker in a *liquorice allsorts* factory gets his *fingers* caught in the machinery, the malfunction causes a massive explosion of molten liquorice into the surrounding area (rather like the Boston Molasses Disaster of 1919). The authorities are forced to# relocate# everyone in the vicinity whilst it is cleaned up.\<br></br>The Naval officer points at you with his *finger* and says, "Hurry up and pack your shit! You are to# relocate# to that *warship* by 14:00 hours.".\<br></br>One slip of a finger of a warship commander and the resulting missile have led to the whole village having to# relocate#.\<br></br>You have to# relocate# for work, but your child is really unhappy because the new city doesn’t have the *sort* of *fish fingers* that he likes so much.\<br></br>#Relocating#, or moving to a new home (搬家), requires lots of carrying of different sorts 般 of boxes with your hands 手. Note that 般 is a perfect phonetic here.
瓜	To split open a #melon# you can use your *claws*, hit it in the middle with your *elbow*, or do something else I'm not aware of.\<br></br>As a cruel punishment in the olden days, a man caught stealing a# melon# was forced to *drag* that# melon# by a rope attached to his *elbow* for five miles. It was so exhausting that he got a *stroke*. Note that that stroke begins to the right of the *elbow* and is disconnected from *drag*, at least in some fonts.\<br></br>Birds don't eat #melons#, as their *claws* cant grip it. Humans can smash them open with their *elbow*.
孤	This poor Nicaraguan *child* must sell *melons* on the street because he is an# orphan#, with no parents to support him.\<br></br>This *child* is an #orphan#. He was found on the steps of the# orphan#age, in a basket hugging a *melon* for comfort (it was his only possession..).\<br></br>The #orphan# *child* is alone in the wilderness with nothing to eat but a bunch of *melons*.
益	You go to a PETA #benefit# dinner, and are suprised to find they're serving *dishes* of *animal horns* and *animal legs*. oh the hypocrisy!\<br></br>Welfare# benefit# in the days of Oliver Twist consisted of a #dish# of *gruel* - made from *hog's head* and *pigs trotters*.\<br></br>A caterer has a really bad day supplying food for a PETA# benefit# dinner. He thought PETA stood for “People for Eating Tasty Animals,” so he served *dishes* with *horns* and *animal legs* in them. [Funny that Aphasiac and I both thought of a PETA# benefit# dinner for this one!].\<br></br>To celebrate their first *one* million# benefit#, they put a *sparkler* over a big cake during an official dinner with refined *dishes*.
假	Mr. T tells the kids, "wear your braces always, even on# vacation#. Discipline and perfect looks is what our country needs, foo. No dilly dally on# vacation#".\<br></br>*Person* is taking fake# vacation#s until their *braces* can come off (really they are hiding at home).\<br></br>(We already had "braces" as a substitute primitive for "silage," so I'm calling the right primitive an *awkward geeky middle schooler* after inspiration from jennifu.) Story: *Mr. T.* was once an *awkward geeky middle-schooler*, until one particular family #vacation#, when he decided to make his move and one day become an international super-star tough guy.\<br></br>When *Mr.T* went on# vacation#, he was annoyed that he couldn't enjoy any of the food because it was getting all jumbled up in his *braces*. He spent most of the time cleaning them.\<br></br>Instead of braces, I think of this primitive as being braces (mouth + staples) on the left and a groin protector (cup over crotch) on the right-- this is a nerd. When Mr. T goes on# vacation#, he lets loose and no one will see his true side-- he's really a timid, braces-wearing, bully-fearing nerd!
蝦	#Shrimp# are like marine *insects*. And just like *insects* that have hard exoskeletons, so do #shrimp#. So don't eat too much #shrimp# with the shell intact 'cause then you might need to get *braces*.\<br></br>[Gross story warning] Don’t eat# shrimp# if you’ve just gotten *braces*, since they’ll get stuck. It’s better to eat insects, which you can suck right through the braces.\<br></br>Nerds are used to being called ugly names! One jerk calls him a lowly bug; another calls him a# shrimp#.
氣	Here is someone who has lost all the# air# in their body. Thus they’re *reclining* on the *floor* (unconscious). How did this happen? They choked on a grain of *rice*. A paramedic has to come and remove that rice with a large *fishhook* so the person can get# air# again.\<br></br>This means both# air# and the vital energy qì. A mystical charlaton claims that when he's *reclining*, he can make his mind so at *one* with the #vital life force# that he can levitate into the# air#, or balance all his weight on a single *grain of rice*. In reality, however, there is a hidden *fish-hook* supporting him on an invisible wire.\<br></br>Simplified-[气]-[1404]: It reminds me some picture about a deity lazily *reclining* on a cloud who is fishing for souls to be analysed. The *One* God is lazily *reclining* over a cloud hanging in the #air# while throwing the *fishhook* of his fishing rod over the human souls to be spyed on.
汽	Look at that bowl of rice: the# vapor# above it is caused by *water* steaming off the rice into the *air*.\<br></br>How not to do# vapor# rub therapy: have the person *recline* on the *floor*. Spread some Vick’s# Vapor# Rub on a long *fishhook*. Stick it up their nose. Then squirt lots of *water* to clear the nostril.\<br></br>According to Wikipedia, humidity is a term for the amount of *water* #vapor# in the *air*.
飛	Here are two hummingbirds, as small as *fishhooks*,# fly#ing through the air with their *drops* of wings. They need lots of sugar water, don’t they? Why not set a *liter’s* worth outside your house? [The key to writing this character is to note how the horizontal stroke of *liter* doubles up as the body of the lower *hummingbird*.].
面	There's an old Taiwanese legend of a monster with *one hundred* *eyes*. I wouldn't like to come# face-to-face# with that thing! Now kids wear *masks* of this monster (let this primitive mean *mask* from now on).
麵	#Noodles# are a form of compressed *wheat* that you can slurp *face-to-face* with your boyfriend/girlfriend on a date. Just imagine diving into the plate together, heads butting as you suck in as much pasta as you can . . . romantic, right?\<br></br>When making fresh #noodles#, you need to grind up *wheat* extremely fine into #flour#, and wear a *mask* as you do the grinding and rolling (because untreated wheat dries your face and eyes!).
革	I was at a market and saw this #leather# jacket for *twenty* quid. However, using my quick *mouth* I managed to talk him down to *ten*.
鞋	The Dr Martens #shoes# are security #shoes# made of *leather* with a steel toe resistant to the fall of a *brick*.\<br></br>#Shoes# are made from leather as hard as bricks. (Not soft leather. That is for leather jackets).\<br></br>Imagine Prada makes a shoe with *leather* that is so pricey that you’ll need *bricks* of cash to pay for them.
馨	Soldiers in the *Civil War* douse themselves with *perfume* so that, if they are shot and killed, their body will still smell# fragrant#.\<br></br>I love the smell of napalm in the morning.\<br></br>*Chanel* have produced a# fragrant# #perfume# for men called "*Colt 1865*" - evoking the aroma of the *battlefield of Gettysburg* with a top-note of *cordite*.\<br></br>After having marched and battled for months, the smell coming off the soldiers fighting in this *Civil war* is awful. They are badly in need of some *perfume* to make them more# fragrant#.\<br></br>This is a little too abstract for Civil War to me; I'm going to let the soldier who has a flag split in two (between battle and womanhood) and uses projectiles = the Amazons (warrior women). The Amazons are a godlike race; they need no perfume and instead smell as# fragrant# as any woman with.\<br></br>The fragrance of the civil war battle field wafts up as the ambrosial perfume of a wretched sacrifice.
聲	After a battle of the *civil* war, soldiers would walk the fields with their *ears* to the ground, listening for the# voice# or sounds of fallen comrades.\<br></br>If Walt Whitman knew this Hanji with its Civil war and ears this is what he would say: "A# voice# cries out for those who have ears, hark and hear the horror of these years, the tales of woe, the horrors we sow, nothing to rejoice, just listen to my# voice#, my civil war years being# voice#d into your ears".\<br></br>The citizens of a war-torn country put their *ears* to# Voice# of America to see how the *Civil War* is going in their homeland, absent media censorship by the government.\<br></br>Not many people know that the Amazons, like the Sirens, have beautiful# voice#s. Their clear, sweet sound catches any passerby's ear.
吳	Stairway to Heaven is a weird primitive, im not going with it. Instead, borrowing from the kanji side, let this be a Dentist who opens your *mouth* with a special *crank tool* (the 2nd stroke), until it's really big and he can fit all his instruments inside. The dentists name is Dr #Wu#, and he makes you say "#wu# ("ooh") when he first examines your mouth.\<br></br>This is a pictograph of Mr.# Wu#, that is, Mr. Boogy Woogy Wonderland# Wu#! (Sing it "Wu!..Boogy wonderland, tonight"). Mr.# Wu# is the hippist disco dancer since John Travolta. Just look at him move (the top mouth bit is his head btw).\<br></br>Primitive meaning: hip-hop group, *The #Wu#-Tang Clan*.\<br></br>I think of this as John Woo, the director of Red Cliff among other things. As a director, he sits in this big chair (the bottom part looks like a chair over the character for big) and yells directions with his mouth.
娛	Women love John Woo movies! Forget chick flicks; these movies are the highest form of# amusement#!\<br></br>Mr. Wu the grooviest disco dancer since John Travolta dances with all the chicks. The zenith of# amusement#, 70s style.\<br></br>(Graphic story) For my# amusement#, I like it when a *woman* kisses me lower and lower, going down my *stairway to heaven* - also known as the Happy Trail - until she reaches...
誤	Dentist *Dr Wu* has to *say* a few *words* of apology. He's made a bog #error# - he *cranked your mouth open* and pulled out the wrong tooth!\<br></br>If you want to reach heaven, do you have to walk up or down the *stairway to heaven*? Read the instructional *words *in the bible carefully and don't make an# error#.\<br></br>There's an evil robot warrior in one of John Woo's movies; it was supposed to be a good guy, but it malfunctioned and now the only word it says is# ERROR#,# ERROR#.\<br></br>Mr. Wu says, making# error#s is cool and groovey, part of the cruise to smooth, the jive to being alive.
承	Take the combination of -ed and water to be still water-- the River Styx! The# undertake#r takes three souls along the River Styx to their eternal rest! It's a dangerous task to# undertake#.\<br></br>The *flipper baby* didn't live very long, only *three* years in fact, so now the parents will# undertake# the task of cremating it and spreading the ashes.\<br></br>Oh no - the #baby#(*child*) needs changing - #a line of poo,snot and puke# and swimming in a #puddle of pee#. Who is going to# undertake# this gruesome task ? "*Heads or tails ?*......(to be cont'd 1373).
蒸	#Steam#ing is a common way to cook food. It's typically used on things like vegetables, here represented by some *flowers*. The *water* is boil*ed*, and remember that these two ideas can't really come apart. In a traditional kitchen, the whole pot would be on the *floor* with a *cooking fire* lit underground.\<br></br>......(cont'd from 1372) - that's got rid of the #poo,snot and puke# - place the #child# on the #floor#, toss the diaper into the# STEAM#er on the open #fire# - add a bouquet of fragrant #flowers# , open the window, stop holding my breath.... and mop up this #puddle of pee#.\<br></br>Still water is pretty useless except for cooking! You can put still water over a cooking fire on the floor to# steam# all kinds of food. You can even# steam# flowers and eat them! How useful!\<br></br>Oh, for the Age of# Steam#! Imagine sitting in a beautiful, wood-pannelled train car gazing out the window over the fields of *flowers*, before returning to your contemporary 19th-century reading material of 'The *Water-Babies*' by Charles Kingsley. Under the *floor* of the carriage, the *fire* is always burning to keep the# steam# locomotive moving.\<br></br>Middle primitive is a *flipper baby*. In a poor village in China a *flipper baby* is born, but it dies shortly after birth. The parents don't want to waste any food, so they decide to cook and eat it. They don't want anyone to find out that they are cooking up some delicious flipper baby soup, so they add *flowers* to the *boiling pot*, but the #steam# still carries the fresh odor of *flipper baby*...Notice there is an extra stroke above the flames.\<br></br>To produce# steam#, pour *water* on the *floor*, light a *cooking fire* underneath and wait until it is heat-*ed* to 212 degrees Fahrenheit (or 100 degrees Celsius for the rest of you). Now that you have this *steam*, cook broccoli *flowers* with it! [Don’t actually do this, you’ll get carbon monoxide poisoning and/or your house will burn down. Use a stove instead.].
牙	The #tusk# of Pumba the warthog is a #tooth# that looks like a *spear* protruding from a large *box*, his mouth. // #TUSK#.\<br></br>Suppose you discover a giant shark# tooth# on the beach. You put it in a *slightly open box* (resembles the first two strokes of *monocle*) so you can admire it on the way home. Then you *nail* it to the wall with a hooked nail so it stays in there. (The horizontal line of the box serves as the head of the nail). Finally, you connect a decorative *tassel* to it. Smugglers, however, are not interested in shark #teeth#; they are interested in *tusks*.

All so he can eventually# pass through# one and satisfy himself that he's getting into heaven!\<br></br>The *hole* in the fence was not large enough for the whole elephant, but allowed him to# pass through# his *tusk*.\<br></br>Smugglers make use of a *hole* under the Kenyan border to smuggle *tusks* out of the country and into the black market.\<br></br>If you are gored with an elephant tusk it would leave big hole.

He’s taken two *animal horns* from a goat and has used them to strip the feathers off two *dove tails* (hence the two featherless dove tails we see here), leaving just one *feathered dove tail* in the cage. Sound: wei4 For what reason are the *Japanese* sumo wrestlers #act#-ing strangely? They ate contaminated wei protein.

To fix this, you have been instructed to take your leftover *tin cans* and run them through a mandoline *guillotine* , the only food tool sharp enough to chop them up. Voila! A cheap diet supplement to cure you.\<br></br>Tin can, guillotine. You need to guillotine those canned dinners and cook something real if you don't want to be# deficient# in nutrition.\<br></br>You CAN not GUILLOTINE a mentally #deficient# person!
寶	Based on hissatsu's RtK story for "treasure [old]": When I found the #treasure# that had been hidden in my *house*, I immediately put those *jewels* in a *tin can* and took them to the pawn shop to get some *money*.\<br></br>The *king* used to have an enormous amount of# treasure# in his *house*, but after he was robbed all he had left was some *money* (shells) in a *tin can*.\<br></br>Some young people think that *bad beer* is a real# treasure# because it lets them have *house* parties.

Don't expect to find supermarkets along the way.\<br></br>Hawaii is generally considered the most# remote# island chain in the world, and in Hawaii, it is well known that the population LOVE their *Spam* (*canned meat*). In fact, all *roads* in Hawaii lead to some form of Spam.\<br></br>I thought I had found a really# remote# island country to take my hiking holiday in, until I found a familiar brand of *canned meat* lying in the *road*. It seems that the whole world is globalised nowadays, with even people in far-flung places #remotely# accessing the internet, and watching all the same television channels using their #remotes#.\<br></br>You are supposed to camp in a# remote# location. Eating a can of *spam* off the *George Washington Parkway* does not qualify as camping because you’re not in a# remote# location. Note that the *meat* in *spam* is very compressed; if it helps you remember the shape, imagine this as meat that you can eat over *two evenings* (evening-like shape, with two, not one drops in the middle) and still be full. Note how the first stroke in *tin can* touches *meat* but goes at a different angle.

Also he often falls over things..\<br></br>In the bright light of the *sun*, you won't find any *hares* They avoid the sun and only come out of their holes by# nightfall#.\<br></br>As the *sun* starts to set and #nightfall# sets in, it's always one of the best times to spot the *hares* roaming around the yard.

You #scold# the horse for this!\<br></br>Simplified-[骂]-[1456]: During a pratice session with your *horse*, he stops to chitchat with the mares here and there. You #scold# your *horse* for being more a *chatterbox* than a jumping *horse*.\<br></br>Before the invention of the dunking-chair, common# scold#s would be repeatedly thrown into the water, and people with *nets* on *horses* would have to keep fishing them out.\<br></br>To a kid, their *mama* has no *woman* characteristics/primitive.

虎	The top primitive is a guild of seven wizards, known for their secret meeting place on top of an enchanted hooked cliff. Their special guild spell is to summon a wind that looks like a# tiger#, their mascot.\<br></br>*seven* very smart *magicians* were standing on top of a *special cliff*. The 7 very smart magicians wanted to create a# tiger#. The #tiger# appeared.. and ate the wizards, leaving just a pair of *human legs* behind. (thanks to Filip).\<br></br>1. Primitives: magic wand, Guangzhou (广州)，seven, bench. Story 1: The Seven# Tiger#s of Guangzhou Football Club is one of the most popular football clubs in Asia. Their coach who never sits on the bench during the match, totally transformed the team in the last few years (maybe by using magic wand) .\<br></br>A# Tiger# stands *above* a *cliff* with his *hooks* (claws) firmly into the cliff. He is *hooked* on sitting there and deciding which pair of *human legs* he will *dice* up next. (*Above* and *cliff* share a line.) Note that the right human leg comes out pretty far. When there are no *human legs* under the top part of# tiger#, my primitive for the character will be “Hobbes,” from the wonderful Calvin and Hobbes comics by Bill Watterson.\<br></br>The top primitive is a guild of seven wizards, known for their secret meeting place on top of an enchanted hooked cliff. Their special guild spell is to summon a wind that looks like a# tiger#, their mascot.\<br></br>Simplified-[虎]-[1459]: (wind instead of human legs) This is #Tiger#assic Park (ersazt of Jurassic Park)! They discovered *seven* rests of an old# tiger# which were *diced* into pieces through the ages. The sorcerer's apprentices used their *magic wand* to produce a magical *wind* that has recreates a gigantic #tiger# inside their *zoo-like* park. But now the gigantic #tiger# has escaped and has came for revenge.
慮	When a *tiger* is *considering* whether to eat your brains and heart out is probably not the best time to# ponder# the big philosophical questions.\<br></br>Simplified-[虑]-[1460]: Face to face with a *tiger*! You #ponder# a way to escape and survive. But your *heart* is pounding so hard that you are not able to #ponder# to good choices.\<br></br>I# ponder# why *Hobbes* *considers* humans to be such pitiful creatures. Is it because they’re weak? They don’t have fur? Or because of their littering and violence?\<br></br>I# ponder# why the *simplified* #虑# *mainland* #tiger# has only a #heart# - unlike the *traditional* 慮 hanzi it lacks a #brain# to# ponder# . Mao must have #思 considered# it wasn't necessary to have a #brain# to# ponder#. Great Leap Forward, *brainless# ponder#ing tiger *....#WRONG AGAIN#!!.\<br></br>*Hobbes* reads the Wizard of Oz and# ponder#s the philosophical implications behind why the Tin Man wants a *brain* and the Scarecrow a *heart*.\<br></br>OK, so the word "ponder" reminds me of the Magic: The Gathering card of the same name... When the wizards consider something, they insist on calling their thought process "pondering;" it's just a more magical version of the term.\<br></br>This represents what you are# ponder#ing as the *tiger* is eating your *brain* and your *heart*.\<br></br>I find sometimes rhymes really help me remember certain hanzi, and this one in particular seems ripe for one: It is important to# ponder# // Approaching the #tiger# out yonder // If you don't want him to start // With your *brains* and your #heart#.
處	When you encounter a *tiger*, it's no use to try and run away on your *walking legs*. It's much better to find a hidden# location# somewhere down *wind* so it can see nor smell you.\<br></br>Ah, This looks like a good #location# for filming our movie! You'd better just *walk* around a little, to check the area for *tigers* and *wind* strength..\<br></br>It's all about# location#,# location#,# location#. This# location#, though, is no good: what is that ghastly smell? It's a place where #tiger#s *walk* around breaking *wind*.\<br></br>*Hobbes* sees that a powerful *wind* is coming and thus, with his strong *walking legs*, takes Calvin to a safe# location#.\<br></br>"Location,# location#,# location#!" Before the wizards set up their guild secret base on the hooked cliff, they spent a long time on their walking legs, seeking out ideal places to cast their special guild wind spell. Hooked Cliff really was the best# location#! (I guess the hookedness of the cliff is ideal for wind spells. Who knew?).\<br></br>When it comes to *tigers*, the most important thing is knowing their# location#. When you are out in the jungle, enjoying the fine pair of *walking legs* you've been given, always pay attention to the *wind*. In it is the secret to where the tiger is hiding, for tigers smell terrible and can never hide their# location# from your nose.
戲	In this episode, *Mr. Bean* is dressed up as a *tiger* to# frolic# about on a *fiesta*.\<br></br>The wizards aren't just serious all the time. One of their favorite spells is to enchant a bunch of beans so that they spring to life and# frolic# about-- how cute! Then the wizards make the beans fight in a tournament-- a# frolic#king cuteness tournament, that is!\<br></br>You are at a backyard *fiesta* where most of the people are calmly drinking wine and chatting. The you come upon a *tiger* #frolicking# on a *table*! It is a little out of place to say the least.\<br></br>Simplified 戏 folic = *crotch*, *fiesta*. Story: Let's go to the Friday Night# Frolic# - I hear it's a real *crotch fiesta*!\<br></br>In this episode, *MR. BEAN* is dressed up as a *TIGER* to play a #trick# to someone, but his victim, not afraid in the least, chases him back armed with a *SPEAR*!\<br></br>Hobbes and Calvin# frolic# when *Hobbes* throws them a *fiesta*. The only food: tuna fish-flavored *beans* -- a typical fiesta food with a Hobbesian twist.\<br></br>Think of our friend *Tigger* and the great *fiesta* he would have after eating jumping *beans*. Like his tail, the beans should be under him as he# frolic#s.\<br></br>The vegetarian #tiger#, which only eats #beans#, #frolics# at the *fiesta*.\<br></br>There's fun and# frolic# at this *fiesta*... that is, until they march out dinner: #tiger# and #bean# chilli, served in hollowed out #tiger# heads as bowls. How barbaric!
劇	A truly# drama#tic spectacle is taking place:a fencing match (with *saber*s) between a #tiger# and a *pig*! (Don't they look ridiculous decked out in their fencing gear and standing upright?).\<br></br>Ancient Roman times: in an interlude between the feeding of Christians to the lions, we see a sideshow. It consists of a *tiger* versus a *sow*. There is plenty of #drama# until it is time for the next act and gladiator comes in and slashes them both with his *saber*.\<br></br>Since 豦 means a wild boar, I shall take that as a primitive - a giant wild *sow* with stripes like a *tiger*. The great# drama# here is the story of King Arthur's hunting of the great *wild boar* Ysgithyrwyn in order to procure its *sabre*-like tusks for the giant Ysbadaden to shave his beard.\<br></br>Imagine a# drama#tic play in which a vicious *tiger* attacks a village and kills all the *sows*. What a# drama#! How can the villagers eat when all their livestock is dead? So they pick up their *sabers* and hunt down the tiger to kill it like a pig.\<br></br>The# drama#s that *Hobbes* watch is where the tiger succeeds in catching the *sow* and is eating it all mannerly with a *saber*.\<br></br>Calvin shows up at# drama# class with a great play idea: an evil *sow* will attack *Hobbes*, but Calvin will kill the sow with a *saber*. He’s promptly thrown out of school for the day (since he brought in a live *sow* and a real *saber*).\<br></br>That wizard guild is not without# drama#! One day, one of the wizards summoned a cute pet pig, but another wizard, unaware of the summon, cut it up with a saber because he wanted to use the tail for his special potion! It caused a ton of# drama#-- they wouldn't speak to each other for months!\<br></br>Simplified-[剧]-[890]: Dexter preferes to plan a murder but in case of a hurry, he must adapt his plan. Here the #drama# takes place in exactly where the yakusa *resides* and he takes the first weapon available: the decorative *great and flashing saber* of the yakusa.
據	Even though it's physically obvious, you needed to get a medical# certificate# to prove that a #tiger# ate all your *fingers* and #piggies# (toes).\<br></br>You need a# certificate# to explain the incident: you used your *fingers* to grab the *tiger* that was eating your *sow*.\<br></br>The film Hannibal has an 18# certificate# due to such scenes as where the #certified# lunatic Lecter cuts off his *fingers* to escape, after having fed one of his enemies to *wild boars*.\<br></br>Calvin presents *Hobbes* with a# certificate# of achievement for his hunting kills: he ate all the *sow* meat (pork) and *fish fingers* in the fridge.\<br></br>Remember that wizard's pet pig? It was no ordinary pig-- it had human hands instead of hooves! That's why the wizard valued it so much-- that pig had a# certificate# of magical awesomeness! It even won# certificate#s for hand modeling!\<br></br>Simplified-[据]-[891]: Dexter is fascinated by the Edward Scissor*fingers* movie. Its most morbid interest *resides* in its special *fingers* and he thinks about them as a free #certificate# to kill.
鹿	In an ancient *cave*, behind a *double locked door* (for security) lies rare cave paintings of primitive people hunting #deer#. By *comparing* these paintings to later ones, scientists have learnt their age and alot about human history - hence so valuable. Primitive will now be *cave paintings (of# deer#)*.\<br></br>Two ancient cave-people are *comparing* the# deer# paintings they made in a *cave*. They get into a heated argument about whose is nicer and then break out into a fight, hitting each other with their *two walking sticks*. A wise woman then sealed the cave with a *key*, ensuring that these disputes would not happen again – and preventing the cave from being discovered until thousands of years later.
塵	To protect the *deer cave paintings*, all *soil* has been removed from the cave by scientists. This is to stop #dust# forming and destroying the pictures.\<br></br>"*Deer*-ly beloved, we are gathered here... *Earth* to *earth*, ashes to ashes,# dust# to# dust#. To reinforce the pun, imagine all the mourners are actually *deer* in morning suits, lowering the casket into the *earth* using their antlers.\<br></br>The ancient PAINTINGS OF DEER in the Niaux cave were covered in# DUST# when they were rediscovered in the early twentieth century, and had to be painstakingly cleaned and restored, each# DUST# mote carefully brushed away.\<br></br>[Sorry for such a sad story, but the point is that you’ll remember it better.] Radioactive# dust# shoots out of a malfunctioning nuclear power plant, thus causing all the *deer paintings* to be buried in toxic *soil*.
麗	*two ordinary* people (i.e. non-scientists) sneak into the *deer painting cave* to make out. "oh look at these drawings, they're #lovely# - it's so romantic" says the girl. "Yes..you look #lovely# and #beautiful#" says the boy. They end up destroying half the paintings during their fit of passion.\<br></br>The top part of the character to me looks like two very creepy eyes, giving me the following familiar passage from Little Red Riding Hood, or Little Red Riding Bambi, in this modification: "What# lovely# *eyes* you have!" "The better to see you with, my #deer#!".
熊	This amazing #bear# has the *ability* to walk over a *cooking fire*!\<br></br>Manliest camping trip ever: you knock a vicious# bear# to death with your elbow. Then you roast its *flesh* over a *cooking fire* so that with two *spoons*, one for you and one for your buddy, you can eat it up.\<br></br>The #bear# when sitting is as large as the *parts of the body* combined of *two men sitting on the ground* tied by their *elbow*. Instead of a direct confrontation, you should stay near the *cooking fire* (fire camp) to repulse the beast. (hint: think of the 4 letters of b.e.a.r. as the 4 primitives above the *cooking fire*, #b# -> part of the #b#ody, …).\<br></br>How do you cook a# bear#? You pick up the #flesh# with your *elbow*, then use two *spoons* to hold it over the *cooking fire*.\<br></br>I did things the other way around, focusing on ability first, and# bear# second. Furthermore, I like to use the primitive "amputee" for 能 based on my story. Here, the# bear# is an *amputee* after walking on the *cooking fire* to get to a picnic basket.
能	I did things the other way around, focusing on# ability# first, and bear second. Here, all the *flesh* below your *elbow*s has been amputated. In order to regain some# ability#, you have been endowed with #spoons# replacing your forearms and hands. Furthermore, I will use this as a primitive meaning *amputee* in future stories.\<br></br>His special #ability# is to detach hs *elbow* from other *parts of his body*, then juggle it together with *two spoons*.\<br></br>Two things require great# ability#: kissing the *flesh* above your *elbow*, and getting *two spoons* to stick onto your nose.
態	This kid has a bad #attitude# - he has the *ability* but he doesn't have the *heart*.\<br></br>This surgeon has a nervous# attitude# about open heart surgery, because to be honest, he doesn’t have the *ability* to operate on people’s *hearts*.\<br></br>We have a positive# attitude# in our #heart#, that we have the #ability# to succeed.\<br></br>Some might think you have a bad# attitude#, but the truth of the matter is that you needed to have an *amputation* of the #heart#.
寅	If you draw the #sign of the tiger# on the *ceiling* of your *house*, you will *sprout tiger's legs (animal legs)* and be able to run and pounce like the big cats yourself! (thanks to chamcham).\<br></br>In your house, the# sign of the tiger# refers to the three #signs of the tiger# cereal (Frosted Flakes) being overconsumed in your house: 1. Children on the *roof*. 2. Children hanging from the *ceiling*. 3. Children *sprout*-ing *animal legs*. As a primitive form, I’ll have it refer to an imaginary award-winning Chinese play called “Sign of the Tiger.”.\<br></br>Our fearless leader, born under the# sign of the tiger#, has decided to raise a bit of revenue on the side by growing *sprouts* under the *ceiling* of the *house* and selling them on the black market. The *animal legs*? The leader gets them from the tiger. [ok, you come up with something better. Maybe you can think of the tiger from "Kungfu Masters of the Zodiac".].
演	meaning that your car would #perform# better by using this brand of *liquid* gasoline (thanks to mspertus).\<br></br>The theatre group is unable to# perform# *Sign of the Tiger* any longer because *water* from fire sprinklers above has flooded the stage. (Imagine you pulled the fire alarm by accident.).\<br></br>Not sure why, but "perform" reminds me of "performing jutsu"-- some kind of special move that may or may not be related to Naruto... A ninja# perform#s his water jutsu, first by making the sign of the tiger.
辰	Let this primitive be *Bruce Lee*! Story: #Bruce Lee# (sign of the dragon) is such a badass he climbed a sheer vertical *cliff* using only *2 hairpins*. (thanks to dingomick).\<br></br>For# sign of the dragon# maybe you can think of the dragon from "Kungfu Masters of the Zodiac". Presumably it is leaping off a *cliff*.
晨	*Bruce Lee* would get up at 5am every *morning*, just as the *sun* was coming up. And under this rising# morning# *sun*, he would practise kung-fu.\<br></br>The hour of the #day# under the #sign of the dragon# is 7 till 9 in the# morning#.
農	*Bruce Lee* got his start in# agriculture#: he kung fu-punched all the apple trees until they were *bent*, ready to be plucked.\<br></br>Like Prometheus giving the gods' fire to humans, it was originally dragons who taught humans the practice of# agriculture#. Nowadays, humans still use it, but their versions is... well, if not corrupt, at least slightly bent, what with the pesticides and growth hormones and all.\<br></br>Because *Bruce Lee* accidentally *bent* all the #agricultural# equipment with his kung-fu strength, now he has to do all the# agriculture# by hand. Here you can see him carrying *two sprouts* on his head, ready to plant them out in a field somewhere.\<br></br>Simplified 农# Agriculture# = *crown*, *scarf*.\<br></br>The #agricultural# equipment has been #bent# because it has been pulled by the cartoon #(sign of the) dragon#.
濃	A new form of# CONCENTRATED# WATER has been developed which greatly increases the efficiency of AGRICULTURE.\<br></br>How to make# concentrated# fruit juice --- grow some fruit (#agriculture#) and then remove the *water*.\<br></br>Through the magic of irrigation, *water* from the sky and ground is #concentrated# through human intervention, and the result is more productive *agriculture*. See <a href="/study/kanji/1438">agriculture</a> <span class="index">(#1438)</span>.
送	Special #deliver#-y!! the UPS comes up the *road* to #deliver# your much anticipated package - a juicy *fatted calf*.\<br></br>If you're transporting a solid *golden calf* on the *road*, the last thing you want to hear anyone say is "Stand and# deliver#!".\<br></br>A Supreme Court case in conscience rights arises when a UPS man refuses to# deliver# a *golden calf* down the *George Washington Parkway* to a pagan temple in Alexandria, saying that doing so would violate his religion. Fortunately the UPS man wins.\<br></br>You know how Keiichi accidentally orders a girlfriend goddess for# deliver#y in the manga Oh My Goddess? Well, this special# deliver#y is a little different. The# deliver#y man down the road this time# deliver#s another being from heaven, but it's a fallen angel with devil horns!
鬼	In some parts of the world, it is believed that a# ghost#, a little *drop* of ethereal spirit, can enter the *brain* of a dead person and take over, which is visible as the *human legs* and *elbows* suddenly start moving again.\<br></br>In Asia a #ghost# is wandering slowly on its *human legs*, searching for *drop of brains* to eat. it has a forked tail that looks like an *elbow*. (thanks to Matthew).\<br></br>I don’t believe in# ghost#s. But if they were to exist . . . even someone with just a *drop* of *brains* knows that you can’t let a# ghost# get close to you. So you have two options: run away with your *human legs* or, if you have the courage, *elbow* the# ghost# away from you. [Note: it appears you can either extend the vertical stroke of field into the left human leg or have these be two separate strokes; KaiTi font gives an example of the former.].\<br></br>A# ghost# is the *drop* of spirit that remains when the *brain* is no more, but which continues to wander the earth with *human legs*. This particular# ghost# is the headless huntsman kind that carries its head tucked under its *elbow*.\<br></br>Traditionaly a #ghost# is represented by a *white* sheet where you can guess a pair of *human legs* which exceed. By pushing aside the *elbows* under the *white* sheet, the #ghost# starts to live.\<br></br>What an ugly #ghost#! It has only a *drop* of *brains*, *human legs*, and an *elbow* coming out of the front leg!
魔	Me and my buddies smoked so much *hemp* in a *cave* that paranoia kicked in, and we started to see *ghosts* in the clouds of smoke. Finally we were visted by a #demon# - the #devil# himself!!\<br></br>A group of hippies hold a seance to communicate with a *ghost*, but owing to their excessive consumption of *hemp*, they get the ceremony wrong and end up summoning a# demon# instead! [Differentiate from <a href="/study/kanji/2101">evil spirit</a> <span class="index">(#2101)</span>].\<br></br>#Demon#s are basically *ghosts* that smoke *hemp*. They give the rest of the supernatural community a bad name.\<br></br>Perhaps one of the creepiest-looking Hanzi. Smoking *hemp* was this poor guy’s# demon# until he became merely a *ghost* of his past self.
塊	Without any weapons, our only defense was to throw #lump#s of *soil* at the advancing *ghost* horde. (thanks to dingomick).\<br></br>You get a huge# lump# in your throat when, walking through a cemetery, you believe you see many *ghosts* rising out of the *soil*! Auggh! Fortunately, it’s just fog.\<br></br>Simplified-[块]-[1277]: This #lumps# of *soil* marked with blood were left intact as a reminder of the the french revolution. This is exactly the place where royalty was beheaded by a *guillotine*. This blooded## lump#s# of *soil* reclaimed by the french people as a symbol of freedom.\<br></br>That# lump# of #soil# is actually the tumulus of a long-dead warrior, so don't go near it or you will disturb him and his #ghost# will attack you.\<br></br>In case anyone else likes Coleridge: "A heavy thump, a lifeless# lump#, they dropped down one by one." And, having all hit the *ground*, the Ancient Mariner goes on to recount: "The souls did from their bodies fly, they fled to bliss or woe. And every soul, it passed me by like the whizz of my cross-bow!" That is to say, he saw their *ghosts* depart.\<br></br>When I visit a place that's supposed to be haunted, I keep a# lump# of soil in my pocket as protection against ghosts, sort of like how the Japanese might throw salt to ward off evil spirits. Still, I have a# lump# in my throat as I worry about a ghost showing up...
龍	Legend of Zelda: Link awakens the sleeping #dragon# boss by throwing a *vase* at the exposed *flesh* of its belly. Then he uses his *special hookshot* *3 TIMES* to kill it. (thanks to plumage).\<br></br>The evil *snake* used his *magic wand* and with a combination of *three* spells transformed the# dragon# from *flesh* to a painting on a *vase*.\<br></br>A# dragon# is essentially a massive piece of *flesh* *standing up*. On the right side, we see (1 a very brave dude standing on (2 the# dragon#’s hooked tail. The first two strokes show the guy’s arms, held out in front for balance, and then his torso and legs. The third stroke shows the first spike of the# dragon#’s tail. The last four strokes show the# dragon#’s long hooked tail with three additional spikes on it.\<br></br>An ancient Japanese# DRAGON#, beautiful and terrifying. Here it is depicted STANDing on a piece of MEAT (its prey) and a description is written on the right margin. It is said to be like a snake that has three toes on its feet and can sometimes use its head as a flamethrower (kind of like a sling, but with fire instead of stones).--thanks to raulir.
襲	Legend of Zelda (or any other RPG): you #raid# the *dragon* lair to get the special armored invisiblity *garments* that lay in a chest beneath him.\<br></br>The #dragon# is #raiding# a #clothing# factory to look for fake Gucci dragon suits.\<br></br>The LA police# raid# the fictional “Magic *dragon* *clothing* store” because they suspect (correctly, in turns out) that the store is merely a front for the largest marijuana distribution center in Los Angeles.
兒	before being introduced to a *set of rotten teeth* on *human legs*.\<br></br>said the stereotypical old northerner, "we didn't 'ave them fancy 'lectrical devices for making t'grub. Every day I had to carry t'heavy *mortar* ten miles home with only me *human legs*!".\<br></br>A# youngster# was *mortared* and all that's left is his *human legs*.
舊	At Christmas I go visit my #old# grandparents in their #old# old## house. I bring them *flowers* as a gift, and Xmas *turkey* to eat, but we have to boil and liquidise it and they both have *rotten teeth*.\<br></br>The *flowers* outside the# old# people's home belie its gloomy interior. Every Christmas they have to crush the *turkey* up in a *mortar* so that the toothless# old# folks can swallow the resulting mush for their christmas dinner.\<br></br>An# OLD# style (舊式 ) christmas would involve on christmas eve gathering FLOWERS, buying a TURKEY and mixing MORTAR to make a clay oven. (老 =animate;舊=inanimate).\<br></br>To make the *turkey* look# old#, we mash up some arcane *flowers* in a *mortar* and feed the mash to the bird.

She told me it would stay dry, but there was so much *water* coming down in the thundershower that I was# soak#ed to the bone.\<br></br>You have a Super-#Soak#er fight inside your home with your friends, but unfortunately you accidentally# soak# your dad’s expensive *radio* [my primitive term for the element on the right] in *water*, rendering it useless. Wow is he mad!
渺	The little boat in the WATER is so small and# insignificant#, FEW EYES on the shore even noticed it.\<br></br>Cement dust! even if you just get a #tiny /# insignificant## amount in your *eye*, you need to wash it out immediately with clean *water*, as even a *few* #tiny* particles can lead to blindness.\<br></br>When something or somebody is# insignificant#, it means that very *few* *eyes* will *water* when he's gone.\<br></br>Some drops of *water* are always going to be seen as# insignificant# when viewed by our *eye*. This is the terrible mistake of perspective. After all, while only a *few* drops can't do much harm at all, when those drops are joined by others, terrible havoc can be brought about.
腺	The male #gland# - a *part of the body* that gushes like a foaming white *hot spring*..\<br></br>A #gland# is embedded in the *flesh* and acts like a *spring* delivering nutrients and important fluids to the body.

坦	Old farmers trick. best way to make sure the *ground / soil* is #level# is to go to the field at *day-break* and watch the shimmering light bouncing off it.\<br></br>Vampires, remember this simple rule: no matter how much fun you had at night, by the time of the daybreak you must be at a ground# level#, in your coffin. Until the next sunset, that is.\<br></br>Perhaps you’ve heard of the Most Interesting Man in the World. Well, here we have the Most# Level# Man in the World.

娃	In traditional Chinese society, if a# newborn# is a *woman*, that's worth less than a few *bricks*.\<br></br>Imagine if the *woman* Mary did not even have a manger in which to lay her #newborn# (Jesus), and hence had to set him on a pile of *bricks*, the best she could do.\<br></br>I can't imagine what a *woman* goes through to give birth to# newborn# babies.

(thanks to megaboyx).\<br></br>You decide to impress some guests by #stir-fry#ing some food for dinner. Problem is the stove isn’t working, so you have to make do with a *few* *fires* (namely, a couple of candles).

She dipped a *drop* on her *hood*, just *one*, and it turned# cinnabar red#.\<br></br>Okay, can't resist a Pokemon reference here. Cinnabar Island is where they created Mewtwo.

The *water* is full of *visitors* who came too close...\<br></br>I go down to the #water's edge# every day to eat my sandwiches during lunchbreak.

When you stand on the water’s edge of this pond and peer into the *water,* a *visitor* appears – not simply your reflection, but rather, who you will be in ten years.

柏	The #cedar# *tree*, so called because it's *white* like a block of cheddar.\<br></br>The# cypress# is a *tree* that endures the bright *white* sun.\<br></br>While riding through California subdivisions, you look out the window and see a special *tree*: It's a #cypress# with a *white dove* sitting right on the very top.

Turns out that the rest of your family isn’t so keen on this idea; they prefer pine, fir, etc.. But your pet *little white bird* loves to play around in it – something about the smell – and so you end up using it after all.
槓	I had a *tree* in my garden as a kid, that i used to play with every day. eventually it got cut down, so i took some of its wood and made this #thick stick#, which i keep as a *tribute* to it.\<br></br>Teddy always carried around a# thick stick# made from a *tree* to make sure people paid him *tribute*.\<br></br>The giant *tree* hegemon gets *tribute* from the smaller tress in the form of# thick stick#s.\<br></br>Simplified 杠# Thick Stick# = *tree*, *work*. Story: Communist leader: "Every *tree* is being put to *work*! We need all the# thick stick#s we can get!".\<br></br>As a form of *tribute* to a local strongman, you give several crates filled with a certain type of #thick stick# made of *wood*.

See <a href="/study/kanji/191">tree</a> <span class="index">(#191)</span> and <a href="/study/kanji/77">tribute</a> <span class="index">(#77)</span>.\<br></br>Under the *Christmas tree* you find a# thick stick#, courtesy of your grandfather, who has gifted it to you “as a *tribute* to your strong will and stubbornness” – meant as a compliment, of course.
朵	#flouds# = #flowers and clouds#. Story: It's a *windy* day, so i climb to the top of tall *tree* and watch the beautiful #flowers and clouds# blowing in the breeze.\<br></br>#Flouds# occur when *wind* from clouds rushes above a *tree* and causes its flowers to fall to the ground – hence why this term is used as a measure word for both clouds and flowers.
杜	Planting *trees* can #prevent# *soil*-erosion.\<br></br>The Grinch wanted to# prevent# people from having a merry Christmas, and did so by pouring salt over the *soil* where *Christmas trees* are grown, in hopes that no one would even have a Christmas tree under which to put presents.\<br></br>Only you can# prevent# forest fires. Smoky the Bear knows that dirt is less flammable than wood, so he suggests covering trees with soil.
桂	The #cassia-bark tree# is a *tree* that's used in cooking. small *bricks* of it's #bark# are added to foods as a spice (true story!).\<br></br>The Christmas after you bring home a cypress for a tree (see <a href="/study/kanji/1543">cypress</a> <span class="index">(#1543)</span>), you use a# Cassia-bark tree# as a *Christmas tree*. The advantage is that after Christmas, you can grind the tree into *bricks* of cinnamon and sell them for a profit.
椅	To the Japanese, the first time they saw a# chair#, it looked like a strange use of wood! Probably why they still like to sit on the floor...(thanks to ikmys).\<br></br>One Christmas someone finds a *strange* gift under the *Christmas tree*: a worn copy of “The Silver# Chair#” by C.S. Lewis. She is mystified by the writing, but it plays a role in her conversion to Christianity.
杰	Joan of Arc, the French national #hero#, was executed by being burned at the stake (wood + fire underneath).\<br></br>At the end of the story, the #hero# comes back with a huge pig. The group of starving castaways then lights a *cooking fire* under the *tree* and cooks the pig.

櫻	My *baby* loves #cherry# - i give her# cherry# clothes, toys and sometimes i place her in the #cherry# *tree*.\<br></br>The fruits of the# cherry# *tree* are its *babies*. If you leave the cherries lying around you may have a lot of baby# cherry# trees next year.\<br></br>Amazing! On Christmas day, #cherries# the size of *babies* appear on your *Christmas tree*. They’re a meal in themselves.\<br></br>What kind of wood is a# cherry# tree? Well, think of the phrase "cherry boy," used to describe virgins. Taunting tarts call# cherry# boys "baby" to flirt with them, but also to make fun of their virginity...
梢	Everyone knows that something has to decorate the# treetops# of *Christmas trees.* I suppose centuries ago, it would be bright *candles* that stood atop the# treetops# of *Christmas trees*, but given the fire risk, they eventually switched to sculptures of angels.\<br></br>In germany at Christmas, people place *candles* in the #treetops# of *trees* on xmas eve.\<br></br>Some folks up in #treetops# are just looking for their kites ... in this case, because it's night time, they're looking by the light of a *candle* for anything that might *resemble* their kites.

桐	The# Paulownia# is a *tree* that was named after Queen Anna Paulowna of the Netherlands. Apparently it is very ornamental, but to me it looks the *same* as any other tree!\<br></br>Paul owns a# paulownia# *tree* to meditate under, the *same* as the rest of the *monks*.\<br></br>Me and my mate #paul# went to the pub last friday night. at closing time, some shady bloke approached him and asked, do you want to buy a *tree* for a half a monkey? having a few pints paul agreed and got a photo of his new purcahse. next day #paul# goes down to the forest to see the *tree* he #owns#, but he cant find it = they all look the *same*!\<br></br>All right, going to go for a hanafuda reference here... The# paulownia# suit in hanafuda (the purple December flowers) is the only suit that has three plains that are the same. Also, unlike, say, the iris, they're a purple flower that can grow on trees.
宋	Alt. The# Song Dynasty# was the most fun period ever in Chinese history, because everyone lived in *tree* *houses* from which they sung karaoke #Songs# to each other.\<br></br>My taiwanese neighbour mr #Song# loves to sing KTV! but he's so bad, whenever he wants to sing a song his wife forces him to go to his *tree house* (a tree with a roof on top).

朱	It's autumn: only one #vermilion# leaf (the *drop*) on the tree has *not yet* fallen. (thanks to dwhitman).
株	This *tree* is unusual. Not only do it's leaves turn *vermilion * and fall off in autumn, but it's #tree trunk# also turns *vermilion* too!\<br></br>As the autumn leaves fall off the *tree*, the bare# tree trunk# is surrounded by *vermilion* leaves.\<br></br>A new Christmas tradition: paint the# tree trunk# of your *Christmas tree* a bright *vermillion* red as a symbol of joy. But beware of toxic paints!\<br></br>The part of the *tree* scratched with *vermilion* letters declaring the love of young people is the# tree trunk#.
樑	#Roof beam#s are very labor-intensive to make. You need two *Christmas trees* - worth of wood; one should be long and one should be thick (hence their placement in the Hanzi). You use a *dagger* to cut them, but this can be painful – hence the *two drops* of blood on its left and right sides, one for each hand. Once you’re done, hose the dagger down with *water* and pat yourself on the back!\<br></br>I want to associated the water + drops + knife (or water + small dagger) as a waterjet-- the tool for cutting. First you waterjet the wood to make the nice, even square shape of the beam, then you balance it carefully on another piece of wood to make your secure beam.\<br></br>Imagine a tribe making a wooden hut; they start by making the the large #roof beam#. First 2 men cut down a tree, and soak the trunk in *water* znd mud to that it becomes flexible and mould-proof. Then they take a sharp *dagger* and cut the huge tree into a perfect square beam. Once done both men prick their hands and put a *drop* of blood on the beam to symbolise how difficult it was. Finally the #roof beam# is supported on top of two *dead trees*.
碟	A flying# saucer# lands in your backyard. Two aliens emerge with a *stone* *family tree* with your name at the bottom. They explain to you that you’re actually their child and that you should come back with them! Then you wake up – fortunately it was just a nightmare.\<br></br>This cute little leaf-shaped stone (porcelain, actually)# saucer# has been in our family for generations~ although if you just put a leaf on a flat stone, you could use that, too.\<br></br>*Tarzan* (from <a href="/study/kanji/216">leaf</a> <span class="index">(#216)</span>) sees a flying #saucer#!! confused, he just throws *stones* at it..\<br></br>If you get STONED every night, then maybe, just maybe, once in a GENERATION, you will see a flying# SAUCER# atop a TREE in the distance.
萌	A maple will only# bud# into *flower* when the *bright* light of March returns.\<br></br>Made me think of the PS3 game *flower*. For the 4th stage ("Illumination"), every *flower* you touch #buds# and a *bright* light shines out. Check out the vid on youtube for a strong image.\<br></br>I can only know this word because of MOE~... A# bud#ding young moe girl has a smile as bright and cute as a flower~ or something.
苛	Your# exacting# coach says, “even *flowers* *can*” do this! Why can’t you! Oddly enough it doesn’t motivate you . . .\<br></br>Growing some kinds of *flowers* *can* be very# exacting#. They need exactly the right temperature, humidity, water, nutrition, etc...\<br></br>When #exacting# revenge on a scorned lover, *flowers* *can* be used. Just leave a beauiful bunch on her doorstep, with a packet of maggots ready to hatch wriggling in the bottom , hidden in the stems.\<br></br>Flowers are so tiny and fragile, if one wrongs you-- say by growing right in your path, you CAN be harsh and# exacting# on it. You can easily trample it-- but should you?
膜	The *part of the body* that the zombies in the *graveyard* all want..Mmmmm-brain (#membrane#).\<br></br>This is horrible. You're out at night in the *graveyard* looking for zombies with *nobody* else around, when you come across some sort of *flesh* on the ground.

One day a giant *wind* came and picked this *chatterbox* off his feet (do you see this in the primitives’ placement?). He finally pledged not to# curse# anymore, and he was allowed to return to the ground.\<br></br>The sirens are sweet-tongued *chatterboxes*. Their voices carry on the *wind* towards gullible sailors, who are# curse#d the moment they listen. When they get too close, they'll# curse# their own stupidity.\<br></br>The *little spoilt chatterbox* is so annoying that an old gypsy put her a #curse# on her! now her face gets stuck every time the wind changes (oh and she's permanently *windy* down below too..).

A large creature has been sighted roaming at night...rabbit *brains* were found scattered on the *floor*..bite marks were found that showed it's *mouth* must be the size of a large adult lion! Then it's finally caught, turns out it was only a stray *dog*..\<br></br>Simplified 兽# Beast# = *horns*, *brains*, *floor*, *mouth* Story: This actually looks like a pictograph of a nerd's face (the *horns* are eyebrows, his *brains* look like glasses/4-eyes, and he rocks a thin mustache).

狸	(Thanks Aphasiac) The# raccoon dog# is much cuter than *a pack of wild dogs*, and that’s why it was the dog featured in the *computer* game Super Mario 3.\<br></br>#raccoon dog# = #tanuki#, the famous flying suit from Super Mario 3! Story: when I'm playing super mario 3 and have the #tanuki# suit, even a *pack of wild dogs* couldn't tear me from my *computer* game console..\<br></br>There was a *dog* once that spent so much time in front of a *computer* that it developed huge dark circles around the eyes from strain and lack of sleep.

Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just open your mouth wide and# sniff# to find out?\<br></br>Makes me think of how dogs approach each other. first they walk towards each other, *mouths* open, teeth bared. then they have a good #sniff# nose to nose, and then move on to #sniff#-ing each others *stinking* backsides.
牡	One easy way to tell if a *cow* is a #dude / male animal# is to check and see if it's covered in *soil*. You see, bulls like to roll around in the *dirt* while females stay pristine.\<br></br>"Dude, don’t sit there. That’s not *soil*. It’s a *cow* pie.”.\<br></br>If you are a male #cow# ( or *horse,deer*...) ....then your chat-up line of choice is "I'm a# dude# , you're a babe - let's get down on the #dirt# and be #dirty#...." becos' us# dude#s love #dirty cows#...

贊	The only time I've heard needing #succor# is when talking about spliting up with your partner. Story: i've been kicked out by my girlfriend, and left with no *money*. To deal with it, I go to my ex (my *before* girlfriend) for #succor# and *clams*, and when she doesn't take me i go to the one *before* that. she is my *lifesaver*!\<br></br>"Hey, did you call me sucker #?!?!#".."No way , I said# succor#...

I've seen you twice *before*, but I didn't carry anything on me. Now, here's some *money*. Homeless guy: Aw thanks, you're my *lifesaver*!\<br></br>I think of the word for before as a man in a suit, because of the Chinese 先生 for mister. Two men in suits (and pretty handsome, succulent-looking men at that~ mmm) show up at your door asking for shells for# succor# or assistance for the poor; can you really trust them?
舍	A *meeting* of *ancient* people? This #abode# is of course an *old peoples home* - for some they drop in daily to chat and play games, for others they live there, for it's their only #abode#.\<br></br>Welcome to our humble# abode#! is what your host said, but really it's just an umbrella propped up to serve as a ceiling, and even that is ancient...

旺	It's his corination *day*, and the new *king* is #thriving# on all the attention thats on him! what a great job being *king* is!\<br></br>The #Sun King# , Louis XIV , ruled for 72 years , a period that saw France# thriving# as the prime European power.\<br></br>The *sun king* Louise XIV's campaign slogan was "a# thriving# France".\<br></br>A# thriving# kingdom where everything is *sun*ny can only exist when the *king* is capable and knows how to properly rule the country. He needs to be like the sun, shining his warm rays on every one of his subjects.
碧	The *king* has a beautiful *white* *stone* set in his crown! It's so big its incredible. But if you look closely, you'll realise it's actually #green jade# - it only looks white because it's so shiny!\<br></br>You give your sweet pet *white bird* a nice# green jade# *jewel* to wear around her neck. The problem is that it’s so heavy that it makes her fall to the ground like a *stone* whenever she tries to fly. At least she won’t fall away!\<br></br>This *king* has a bizarre system for determining the authenticity of# green jade#. He passes the rock in question to his favorite *white dove* who flies high into the air. The dove then drops it on the *stones* below. If the rock doesn't shatter, then it is in fact# green jade#.
汪	It's the *kings* coronation day, but it's started to rain and he's now all *wet*! the emotion gets to him and he becomes all #tearful# (along with the audience watching him).\<br></br>There's a# tearful# goodbye (with lots of *water* coming out of the queens eyes) as the *king* sails off into the *water*s of the ocean to fight a battle with a distant kingdom.\<br></br>A rich woman is quite# tearful# when, on a boat ride, she realizes that all of her *jewels* have apparently sunk into the *water*, a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\<br></br>The KING has died and all the subjects are# tearful# with WATER streaming down their faces.

He's soon spotted and thrown in jail.
珠	The giant *king* of the Oysters produces special *Vermillion* (dark red)# pearl#s! (thanks to Christoph).\<br></br>Most# pearl#s are ordinary, but I found this huge *vermilion* one. It really is the *king* of jewels!\<br></br>Perhaps you’ve heard of (or seen) the movie “Girl with a# Pearl# Earring?” Here’s the forgettable sequel: “Girl with a *vermillion* *jewel*.\<br></br>We always think of# pearl#s being white, but did you know that the most valuable# pearl#s are those that look like vermillion jewels?

On this episode of# Crocodile# Hunter, he's actually hunting a# crocodile#! To lure it out, he places a *fish* on the end of a *snake hook* and starts taunting it like a real *chatterbox*.\<br></br>If you expect the dark shadow you see approaching in the murky water to be a *fish*, it's very *shocking* to find out that it is actually a# crocodile#!\<br></br>#Crocodile# are very peaceful at first when you see them on TV, then the host throws a *fish* at it and you get a *shocking* display of raw power.\<br></br>It was absolutely *shocking* for the *fish* to wake up and see a# crocodile# staring it down.
鬥	Two *kings* decide to have a #fight# - but of course, they#re so noble their# fight# is a joust, using two long *stick*-like lances!
栓	A# plug# needs to cover the *whole* hole, a branch isn't enough so you bring the *whole tree* to# plug# the hole.\<br></br>You go out with your family to pick up a *Christmas tree*, but once you tie it to your car, you realize that the spark# plug# is busted and the car won’t start. Your younger sister cries, “our *whole* Christmas is ruined!” Not so – except that you will indeed have to carry the tree the*whole* way back.\<br></br>The beaver is busily gnawing away - even though the dam only has a small leak it still requires a #whole tree# to# plug# the *hole*.\<br></br>(Dragon Warrior Monsters 2) Great Log won't be whole anymore unless we find a# plug# to fill the hole.\<br></br>My WHOLE door was knocked down by an intruder.

An awfully large two-story# pillar# for the tiniest of fires.\<br></br>The LORD of the town's mansion is magnificent with it's giant WOODEN# pillar#s. Everyone else lives in tiny shacks.\<br></br>Impressive *trees* form# pillar#s next to the drive up to his *lord*ship's mansion.
鉤	At the start of a story, you need a good# hook#. It should be a *gold* *sentence* to keep the interest of your readers.\<br></br>To# hook# up with some one you can show off your *gold*... or your polished *sentences*.\<br></br>The CAST keeps your broken arm from being bent like a METAL# hook#.
鈔	There's a lot of people that want money, but the kingdom has too *few metal* to make enough coins. The solution?# Paper money#, of course!\<br></br>Ron Paul would argue that# paper money# has very *few* advantages compared to *gold*.\<br></br>Now that we're off the gold standard, our# paper money# may not have financial backing.

銷	Everything in your house must be# put up for sale#. To attract buyers, you set up signs laden with *golden sparklers* (a real eye catcher) around the neighborhood reading "EVERYTHING IS BEING# PUT UP FOR SALE#!".\<br></br>This noble family is on such hard times that it even will# put up for sale# the golden candlestick heirlooms that have been in the family for generations...\<br></br>You# put up for sale# your *gold* *candle*, but it has no interest from buyers – one, it won’t work, being made out of metal, and two, it’s impractical – people want to buy golden coins or bars, not a candle. [I would advise you against using *candlestick* in your story, since that is the name of a different primitive form.].\<br></br>I #put# my house #up for sale#, totally unfurnished except for a huge ugly *metal candle-stick* holder which sits in the middle of the living room. Amazingly a potential buyer views the house and decides they want it..because of this extra feature..\<br></br>Your used CANDLES are# put up for sale# for a garage sale, but can't even fetch a few METAL coins. Who'd want to buy used candles?!
鎖	My wallet has a *small metal* pad-#lock# on it, to keep my money (*shells*) extra safe :).\<br></br>A# lock# is literally a *small metal shell* with gears and springs inside.\<br></br>You’ll need to spend more than a *small* amount of *shells* on a# lock# for your *gold* safe – best to splurge for one that can’t be broken.\<br></br>You'll need more than a SMALL METAL# lock# to keep a thief from stealing your precious SHELLS (money).
鑽	Digging for *gold* with a shovel is a lot of work. Using a# drill# can be a *lifesaver*!\<br></br>When using a #drill# machine, you'd better wear *metal* gloves - it could be a *lifesaver*!\<br></br>Simplified [#钻#] - "What do the cards say ?

If you don’t like this story, consider playing off Sarah Palin’s call to “drill, baby,# drill#” – she thought her plan would be a *lifesaver* for the economy, or at least a *golden* opportunity.
迫	There was a wounded *white dove* sitting in the middle of the *road*, in danger of being driven over. I felt# compel#led to help it, so I tried to# compel# it to move aside.\<br></br>In the first Harold and Kumar movie, the duo get stoned and then feel #compel#-ed to visit *White*-Castle and hit the *road*..\<br></br>Not another traffic hold-up !! Oh no, there's a traffic cop in the #road# directing traffic .

Ugh!

逼	The want of *wealth*# press# on people to continue on a *road* that they don't want to be on. The best advice for these people is, "Don't# press# on".\<br></br>There's a private road, funded by people of fortune and paved with all their riches. I'd sure like to travel on it, but if a commoner goes down it, the owners' bodyguards jump out and# press# you for a permit or ID...\<br></br>A *weathly* person with a monocle and cane attacks me while out on my bike, in a fit of *road*-rage. He tries to pay me off, but i decide to do the right thing..and #press# charges..\<br></br>Whereas some# press# gangs used the old trick of slipping a shilling into a tankard of ale, here we see a more ambitious plan: they have spread *wealth* all over the whole *road*, and anyone who crosses it will be #pressed# into military service.\<br></br>Refugees with their entire #wealth# loaded on to carts, prams , ...# press#ing onward along the #road# to an uncertain future.....\<br></br>If someone finds out you have a lot of *wealth*, they’re likely to# press# charges against you, for example, for a fender bender on the *George Washington Parkway*.\<br></br>Walking down the ROAD in a WEALTHY neighborhood, an officer decided to# press# me on what I was doing there.
逃	A *turtle* decides to #escape# from the zoo and runs off down the *road*. 1 day later it's only moved 10metres away..
逞	See the *king* with the big *mouth*# flaunt# what he has on the *road*. Everybody of course submits to his# flaunt#ing.\<br></br>Many people# flaunt# where they go to college when they’re driving on the *road*, by means of a bumper sticker. But you go a step further and# flaunt# where you *submitted* applications to college – hence you have Harvard, Stanford, Princeton and Yale bumper stickers visible as you drive down the *George Washington Parkway* (or the*road* of your choice).\<br></br>Heading up the castle's ROAD, the knight was hesitant to SUBMIT his plan of attack on the neighboring country, knowing full well the king would# flaunt# the idea as his own.
轟	You hear a huge #rumble#, and also feel the ground #rumbling#, only to see a huge monster truck coming toward you. It's so big it's driving over 2 other *cars*.\<br></br>Simplified 轰# rumble# = *car*, *pair*. Story: "Let's get ready to# rumble#!" A flashy *car* drives up and a *pair* of WWE wrestlers get out, vamping up the crowd for the upcoming# rumble#-mania. Wrestling outfits always seem a little tight around the *crotch* area too.\<br></br>Who could forget the famous# Rumble# in the Jungle? Well, suppose that the reward for winning was *three* luxury cars: a Ferrari, a Lamborghini and an Aston Martin.
軌	There was something on the# rails# that caused the train to derail and cause a huge accident with *nine* of the train *cars* completely wrecked.\<br></br>In a tragic accident, the entire BASEBALL TEAM was killed by a train when their CAR unexpectedly stalled on the# rails#.\<br></br>It is absolutely illegal to play a game of *baseball* on the# rails# of the subway. You are likely to get struck by a subway *car*. I hope the absurdity of this idea helps you remember the character.
軋	Imagine a *car* being picked up by a large crane *hook* and then totally #flattened# by the compressor at the automobile junkyard.\<br></br>My CAR'S wheels were# flatten#ed by a FISHHOOK . Damn fishermen!
輻	WEALTHY people pay as much for a wheel spoke as I paid for my CAR.\<br></br>Plenty of people show off their *wealth* by buying expensive# spokes# for their *cars*’ wheels. But here’s one guy who decides to take it a step further: his# spokes# have an LED screen that shows the current value of his portfolio and flashes green or red based on how the stock market did that day.
煎	To# saute# means to cook over a hot hot *cooking fire*, while standing *in front* of the pan stirring and shaking it every few seconds..\<br></br>(I might be wrong about this but) I think of# saute#eing as a quick, easy cooking, to set it apart from other cooking. To# saute# is thus really easy-- it's the thing you learn before any other advanced cooking techniques, and you just stand before a cooking fire and kinda wiggle stuff around.\<br></br>My vegan wife tells our children that #butchers# are evil and when they die they will be #in front# of the queue for the #fires# of hell where they will be# saute#d - in revenge for all the animals they've killed for the frying pan.\<br></br>A jealous butcher decides that he will “#saute#” his rival’s *butcher’s shop* over a *cooking fire* -- namely, a can of gasoline lit on fire. But fortunately the police stop him before he is able to carry out his plot.\<br></br>To# saute#, due to the care you must take due to the high hear, you must stand #in front# of the *cooking fire*.\<br></br>You# saute# a dish by putting it IN FRONT of the COOKING FIRE.
喻	At the #slaughterhouse# the local butchers always greet each other with " I hope your *sausage* is still satisfying your housewives !" - it's just a# figure of speech# ....\<br></br>Girl is at a slaughterhouse, her friends making her follow through on something she said. 'When I said I would put my MOUTH on all the meat in the SLAUGHTERHOUSE it was a# FIGURE OF SPEECH#.'.\<br></br>I was playing a game when I got in trouble for saying "I'm going to slaughter you all!" to my opponents. "It's just a# figure of speech#!" I protested. Me and my big mouth...
榆	Going to sleep on# Elm# street, you have a nightmare that someone took your# Elm# *Christmas tree* and chopped it to pieces in a *slaughterhouse*. How terrible!\<br></br>The #elm# is the most popular *tree* amongst *butchers* - because it reminds them of the violent# elm# street movie series!\<br></br>Because of the the famous horror film, an# elm# tree can easily be remembered as a SLAUGHTERHOUSE TREE.
略	SOS, TTYL, 10-41 etc! it takes a lot of *brains* to remember all the #abbreviation#s when speaking on a *walkie-talkie*.\<br></br>There are a LOT of rice fields throughout China... Of course, as one might expect, the government knows where every single one is, but even these are so numerous that each only has an# abbreviation#, no actual name.
暈	Riding in his CHARIOT all day with the SUN above, the rider became# dizzy# with heat stroke.\<br></br>Be sure the *sun* isn't shining directly in the eyes of your *army*, or they will become# dizzy# and unable to fight well.\<br></br>Helios, the Greek god pulling the sun around the world with a chariot, must be getting pretty# dizzy# by now.
渾	This hanzi actually means both #muddy# and #confused#. Story: a *chariot* driver is driving in the rain, and gets all #muddled# up with his directions. He ends up driving through rivers of mud, getting the *chariot* all *wet* and *muddy*/.\<br></br>You’re having a nice day of fishing at the local pond when a team of *chariots* splashes across it, kicking up mud that leaves the *water* all# muddled#. Now there’s no way you’ll see the fish. Ugh!\<br></br>Chariots are usually so gleaming bright, if they get a little water on them they'll look completely dirty and the color and sheen will be# muddled#.
膏	Don't you hate those late-night night infomercials that advertise# ointment#s that supposedly make a certain PART OF THE BODY stand as tall as the EIFFEL TOWER?\<br></br>On a trip to Paris, you are so transfixed by the view from the top of the *Eiffel Tower* (Heisig’s new primitive for *tall*) that you stay there all day, causing your *flesh* to get dry and itchy from all the wind. The only solution is to find some# ointment# – but fortunately you’re in the right city for that! [Note how *flesh* is below *tall* -- maybe you can think about realizing that your flesh was dry and itchy only after you got back down. This tripped me up during review.].

Wow, he scared the living# daylight#s out of you!\<br></br>Simplified 昼# daylight# = *ruler*, *daybreak*. Story: Imagine finding your 4 yr. old nephew outside with a *ruler* in the ground at *daybreak*. "What ya doing there buddy?" "Measuring the# daylight#, Uncle." Smart kid, he basically self-discovered the sundial.\<br></br>Imagine that MGM releases a James Bond Movie called “The Living# Daylight#.” It’s two hours of James Bond lying on the *floor*, reading a *book*. This is when the series really hit its *floor* before bouncing back.\<br></br>I've been studying, reading this book, for so long it's already daybreak... I only noticed because with the# daylight# seeping it, I can read just fine.\<br></br>For this, I picture the sun coming up during *daybreak*, although strangely it isn't bright, just a dull orb in the still-dark sky.

釐	"Is the place still *not yet* clean?" the angry *taskmaster* yells at you. "If I find even one# smidgen# of dust, I'll throw your *computer* of a *cliff*!".\<br></br>I really struggled with this character, but it became much easier when I saw that 厘 has the meaning of centi-, or 1/100 = 1%. Using this gives: The taskmaster in training (the *not yet* *taskmaster*) is a# smidgen# away from full taskmasterdom: in fact, he has *1/100*th *not yet* accomplished.\<br></br>The paragliding *taskmaster* tells his students, "*Not yet*" on the *cliff* which they plan to jump off. He is waiting for the signal from the guy below with the *computer* trying to detect a# smidgen# variation in wind for the perfect paragliding.\<br></br>Simplified 厘# Smidgen# = *cliff*, *computer*. Story: If my *computer* was just a# smidgen# faster, then I wouldn't be throwing it off a *cliff* right now.\<br></br>Imagine that the *Imperial Japanese Army* has captured you in 1945, and they say you’ll be executed in 15 minutes. You plead with them: “*not yet*, *Imperial Japanese Army*!. Just wait a# smidgen# of time.” They agree to push it back until tomorrow. That gives you time to break into their compound, take their master *computer* and throw it off a nearby *cliff*. Hence all of their files are lost and they surrender that evening. Not only have you escaped death, you’ve won the war!

玫	The #King# won the heart of the cold and stern *taskmaster* by giving her a# rose#.\<br></br>The White# Rose# was a student resistance group against *Hitler* during the peak of his power, when he practically became the *king* of Germany.\<br></br>Originally a type of jade, hence the lack of expected flower radical. *Margaret Thatcher* is presented with a jeweled# rose# by a visiting foreign *king*. It is a diplomatic faux pas, the# rose# being the symbol of the labour party! This character is used in conjunction with <a href="/study/kanji/2901">marvelous</a> <span class="index">(#2901)</span>.\<br></br>The dating *taskmaster* advise that if you can't afford a *jewel* then give her a *rose*.\<br></br>A member of the *Imperial Japanese Army* listens by accident to the Christmas song “Es ist ein# Rose# entsprungen” (Or “Lo How a# Rose# E’er blooming”). He admits that it’s a real *Jewel* of a song, and it overwhelms him so much that he decides to abandon the army and become religious.\<br></br>Think of the story of Beauty and the Beast. A# rose# was given to *king* of the castle by a *taskmaster* in order to test his ability to love people other than himself.\<br></br>The cruel TASKMASTER doesn't want you to bring him# rose#s as payment, he wants rare JEWELS!
敦	Most people have seen those #candid# pics and videos of *hitler*, *enjoying* himself in his in the swiss alps retreat .\<br></br>#伦敦 = London#. *Hitler* "This time next year I# candid#ly believe we will be #enjoying# *London*. ".\<br></br>An episode of# Candid# Camera catches an old guy saying, “I really did *enjoy* my time in the *Imperial Japanese Army*.\<br></br>Despite his awful reputation, people ENJOY the cruel TASKMASTERS company on the rare occasions that he is kind-hearted and# candid#. (Note: I used the word 'kind-hearted' because mdbg.net gives it as the main defintion of 敦).
諾	A mom makes a# promise# to her child that if he studies the *dictionary* for five hours every day, next year she will take him to *Disneyland*.\<br></br>I gave my kids my WORD that I would# promise# to take them to DISNEYLAND.
謂	Your STOMACH is making WORDS# meaning# that you're hungry.\<br></br>Someone hits you hard in the *stomach* with a *dictionary.* Confused and angry, you ask them, “What is your# meaning#?”.\<br></br>What is the# meaning# of life? You start looking through the *dictionary* for the answer, but after awhile, you get hungry. . . then it hits you: the# meaning# of life is to just feed your *stomach*!\<br></br>Sometimes I go into a rice field at night and just stand there in the moonlight, looking up at the moon, talking to myself with all kind of crazy words to contemplate the# meaning# of life.
詢	You# inquire# to your teacher, “what in the world does *decameron* mean?” She says, “I have no clue. Look it up in your *dictionary.*”.\<br></br>If you read every *word* of every issue of the National #Inquire#-r newspaper, it'll only take *10 days*, at 1 hour a day. Cos it's rubbish.\<br></br>I think of# inquire# like the Spanish Inquisition-- they'll "inquire" about your beliefs for about a decameron. It takes that long because the inquiry is also just torture.\<br></br>The police# inquire# witnesses asking them to give some WORDS of testimony and TEN DAYS later they catch a lead in the case.
罰	In some societies, if you say the wrong *words*, you'll be# penalize#d in a horrible way. They'll hunt you down, catch you in a *net*, and then chop of some of your bits with a *saber*.\<br></br>A member of the Buffalo *Sabers* hockey team is #penalized# for throwing a *dictionary* into the *net* as part of a dispute with a referee over a denied goal.\<br></br>Two guys in the street are shouting *words* at each other and fighting with *sabers*! a *net* is thrown over the pair, and they are# penalize#-d by being thrown in prison..\<br></br>Ever seen crazy Japanese game shows? They often have a "penalty game" (batsu game) used to# penalize# a contestant's very petty offenses. In this game show, contestants must avoid saying some common word like the or a, otherwise they are# penalize#d-- a net is dropped on them and then they are spanked with a shinai sword!\<br></br>In medieval times, if you gave a superior the side-EYE, you weren't# penalize#d with WORDS you got the SABER.
訂	I try and #place an order# at a restaurant, but i keep messing my words up as i want to *nail* the hot waitress..\<br></br>When you# place an order# with a waiter, your WORDS are in a way NAILED down confirming your food selection.\<br></br>You work at the sales center for Merriam Webster and just got a school system to# place an order# for 5,000 *dictionaries*. A guy congratulates you and says, “you *nailed* the one-day *dictionary* sales record!”.
詠	Hare Krishnas believe that if they #chant# the exact words of the Hare Krishna mantra constantly in life, they will live *forever* (in heaven).\<br></br>Simplified 咏# Chant# = *mouth*, *eternity*.
諜	You’re out on a global# espionage# mission. You carry around with you a *dictionary* of the local language, but inside you’ve hidden the *family tree* of the person you’re spying on, complete with their addresses, phone numbers, pictures – and favorite foods.\<br></br>See #葉# <a href="/study/kanji/216">leaf</a> <span class="index">(#216)</span> : British# espionage# agents sent #word# back to London that Opium Wars were to break out - with the Chinese aiming to eliminate the product of the poppy #flower# being peddled to #generations# of mulberry #tree# farmers.\<br></br>When you think# espionage#, you think James Bond, right? Well, like a stereotypical British gentleman, it turns out Bond is a descendent of a long family tree of spies. However, unlike a noble or royalty, because they're spies, they can't actually let other people know who is in their family, so they only identify each other with a secret word.\<br></br>You've just carried out a master #espionage#, by changing the *words* in your *family tree*, to make it seem as if your brother was the offspring of apes.\<br></br>The Magician can commit# espionage# by changing himself into an unassuming BUTTERFLY to overhear the enemies' WORDS.
註	I am the *lord* of #annotations#! when i write something, i literally #annotate# every difficult *word*, as it makes me look intelligent..\<br></br>I'm a diligent student of the *words* the *Lord* has written to us, so I# annotate#d a lot of passages.\<br></br>You# annotate# your parents’ nice *dictionary* by pouring hot wax from a *candlestick* on it. Pretty dumb, you admit, which is why you use a fancy word to explain your action to them.
諒	I can# forgive# many things, except when someone types all of their #WORDS# in #CAPITAL#s.\<br></br>Years later, Godzilla now a reformed monster, SAYS "Forgive me." for when he attacked the CAPITAL.\<br></br>You ask the members of Congress to# forgive# you for throwing a *dictionary* at someone you didn’t like while sitting in the *Capitol building* gallery. You promise you won’t do it again, and you’ll pay for the poor guy’s medical expenses.\<br></br>Someone went and insulted the capital of my nation with mean words, but I decided to# forgive# him. "That's very capital of you!".
讚	Sometimes a small# praise# given to a desperate man can prevent him from doing something awful. A couple of *words* can truly be a *lifesaver*.\<br></br>You publicly# praise# the guy who gave you a *lifesaver* when you were drowning, and as additional thanks, get him a copy of the *dictionary*, so that he’ll be able to prepare for the SATs while on the job.\<br></br>Words that will act like a lifesaver. You are praising god in your daily life so he might come to your aid when you need help the most.
貳	(Thanks Aphasiac for help) My plan is to use# II#,# II#I and IV as references to the Star Wars movies. Let’s pretend that Star Wars# II# was actually titled Star Wars *2*: Attack of the *Shellfish*, and consisted mainly of Anakin fighting off these horrible shellfish with light-*arrows*.\<br></br>When you have Crohn's Disease (like I do), you never know what's going on inside you. Here, you've just gone for a number #II#, and lo and behold, you've pushed out #two# *shell*s. Of course, it felt like you were shooting out *arrow*s, as usual.
膩	You’re# sick and tired of# having the flu. While you wait to get better, you prop your *flesh* down on the couch and watch Star Wars *II*.\<br></br>You're# sick and tired of# seeing these *flesh* eating monsters in yet another terrible sequel movie: return of the flesh eating zombies *II*.\<br></br>I get# sick and tired of# eating the same FLESH (chicken) even after just II days.
洩	I don't like Heisig's story, for two reasons: 1. Heizig ignores the fact that 曳 is a character, meaning "to drag, to pull". I interpret this character as drag in the sense where you are dragging a sea creature you caught with a halberd (instead of a hook) in its mouth. 2. The "discharge" meaning seems to have more to do with a fluid leaking than it does discharging a weapon. Thus, I took my story to be watery# discharge# oozing from the wounds in a sea creature caught with a halberd.\<br></br>Simplified 泄# Discharge# = *water*, *generation*. Story: Each *generation* is# discharge#d from the womb after their mother's *water* broke.\<br></br>Rice fields are actually pretty watery, so make sure you don't hold some kind of tournament with halberds in one-- the water from the field might ooze out like fluid# discharge#.
划	Did you know, to save space and weight, Spartans used to# paddle# their boats with their weapons? Instead of oars they've# paddle# away with their *halberds* and *swords*, always instantly ready for combat!\<br></br>Perhaps you have heard of the phrase “Plan *Fiestas*, not war.” It means that, if you happen to have a *saber*, use it to# paddle# your little canoe down to the nearest fiesta.\<br></br>Sim. and Trad 划 hua2 =# paddle# ; Simplified 划 hua2 = #to cut/scratch# ; Simplified 划 hua4 = #plan# . When you are up sh%t creek, you'll need a# paddle# to# paddle# . Follow this #plan# . Cut down a tree with your #halberd# and carve out a# paddle# with your #sabre#. What ? You haven't a #halberd and sabre# ? - then you are up sh%t creek without a# paddle# !!!.\<br></br>If you ever played Rivers of Light on Adventure Construction Set back in the day, to reach Urshanabi, you run out of wooden poles to #paddle# your boat across the acidic lake. Here, you need to use the Repeller (*halberd*) and the Driver (*rapier*) to make it the rest of the way. Otherwise, just think: having no #paddle#, you must# paddle# your boat using a *halberd* and a *rapier*.
嘎	The crow's *nose* is jammed into the *ceiling* and# caw#s through its *mouth* for help. However, everybody is busy downstairs with the *fiesta*.\<br></br>#Caw#s come from crow #mouth#s. To stop them, jam the crow's *nose* into the *ceiling*, and enjoy the unhappy, wiggling body that resembles a *fiesta*!\<br></br>You consider having a fiesta at your home tonight. But then you hear a raven give an ominous# caw# with its *mouth*. You’re even more surprised when it hops inside your house and opens its *mouth* to explain: “While you have the *fiesta*, someone who hates you will hang you from the *ceiling* by your *nose*.".\<br></br>A# caw# is noise that comes from the *mouth* of a bird. It is a terrible omen. The only way to prevent bad luck is to hang things from your *ceiling*. We recommend bird *noses*. Then, you will be safe to have a *fiesta*.
域	In my# domain#, you either do what I say *or* leave this *land*.\<br></br>If you have money for a# domain#, you have two choices: buy a# domain# of *land*, *or* buy an internet# domain# name. Not sure which one will make you more money – depends on the location, doesn’t it?\<br></br>Your# domain#, sadly, is nothing more than a pile of *soil*, and not a #country#, so you don't get to draw a boundary around it. (Subtractive instead of additive, but I found it so much easier to work country into the story rather than or.).\<br></br>Within this kingdom's# domain#, follow the law of the *land*, *or else*!\<br></br>The dictator successfully flees with his loyalist from his former# domain#. He kisses the SOIL on the FLOOR with his MOUTH and holds a FIESTA to celebrate.
栽	On *Thanksgiving* night, you# sow# the seed for your super-fast-growing *Christmas tree* so that it will be ready by the 24th.\<br></br>*Thanksgiving* is the time to #sow# a seed so that you have a #tree# for Christmas. (Silly, since a tree would never grow in a month, but it works for me.).\<br></br>In preparation for THANKSGIVING, the farmers# sow# seeds from TREES and by November the food will have grown.
戚	When you take visiting# kin# (relatives) to a PARADE, hold the LITTLE ones up ABOVE so they can see over the crowd.\<br></br>*sad and lonely uncle* has put his crotch away, and it going to a *parade* with his #kin# folk - not relatives but other wackos.\<br></br>Imagine an embarrassing *parade* organized and conducted by your# kin#, including your *uncle* who underwent a sex-change operation and *lost his crotch*.\<br></br>The character 叔 for #uncle# plays in here and with many other stories of mine. I have taken the left side of 叔 (上＋小) to be a primitive for a sick and perverted uncle (on top of the small), so here your #kin# is a parade of *perverted uncles*.
蔑	Gay *flower* *march* for gay-rights is so #despise#-d by many, that they try to thrown a *net* over the whole thing (i..e they try and get it cancelled).\<br></br>Sometimes I find a rhyme is best for memorizing characters: To those that you #despise# // put *flowers* on their *eyes* // and *march* them to their demise.\<br></br>The bees# despise# the florists as they MARCH about taking every FLOWER they set their EYES on.
喊	To# yell# is to open your *mouth* and speak so that *everybody* can hear you. It’s pretty annoying.\<br></br>On the million man march, *everyone* is #yell#-ing with their *mouths*.\<br></br>This disembodied #mouth# just goes around# yell#ing at #everybody#.\<br></br>Whenever SALTY food touched the babies MOUTH, he will# yell# in protest.
濺	At your parents’ house you drink *water* really messily and# splatter# it all over the table, floor, etc. Your parents scold you, but you say, “*Water* is so *cheap,* it’s OK to# splatter# it!”.\<br></br>If your bacon is cooked to the sound of spits and# splatter# it's becos' your #cheap# and got rashers full of #water#.\<br></br>Jackson Pollock is famous for making those crazy# splatter# paintings that sell for really high prices, but I don't understand... they're just some wet# splatter#s, they're probably really cheap to make.\<br></br>A mysterious liquid has# splatter#ed all over one of the cheap floats at the parade. Is it blood?
址	Before the# address# were invented, all you had to claim your property was your FOOTPRINT in the SOIL.\<br></br>It seems these days like every fancy new development is an# address#. Given the environmental movement, this# address# advertises itself by saying that it leaves no *footprint* on the *soil*. Indeed, this is true: it’s suspended over the ground by massive columns so that the soil remains untouched.
澀	Two enemies decide they’ve had it with each other and enter into an# astringent# duel, each with a very sharp *blade*. But they both *stop* dead in their tracks (note there’s a *stop* for each person* when a policeman shows up and threatens to douse them with *water* from a fire hose.\<br></br>The plum has lots of watery *juice*, but it's so #astringent# it feels like two *blades* on your tongue. *stop STOP* you shout when eating!\<br></br>Imagine drinking the# astringent# juice of lemon. Each time a drop of the citrusy water passes your lips, its# astringent# taste feels like a tiny dagger in your gums, making you cringe and stop for a moment. Drop, dagger, pause, drop dagger, pause.\<br></br>You step into a lake and make a few steps, then you *stop* because *both* of your feet are hurting. You come out of the *water* and notice that there are little *blades* in each of the feet, probably carelessly dumped by someone. It's a good time to wash the wounds and apply some# astringent#.
蘋	Imagine a team of investors throwing *flowers* in the air to celebrate the fact that# Apple# stock has *repeatedly* gone up, making them rich -- once they sell it.\<br></br>Simplified 苹# apple# = *flowers*, *water lily*. Story: This is a new GMO for hydroponic farms. The *flower* on this *water lily* will eventually produce an# apple#.\<br></br>#Apple#s are the most symbolic fruit; not only are they traditionally the forbidden fruit, the flowering of the# apple# tree repeatedly every year represents the circle of life.\<br></br>#Apple# trees seem to be quite prolific in their output. That's because they *flower* #repeatedly# (and each flower turns into an# apple#, of course).\<br></br>To start, I picture an# apple# with a *flower* growing out of the top of its stem. Then I cut the# apple#, and each resulting half sprouts another flower somewhere. Cut it again and again, and flowers continue to sprout, *repeatedly*.
赴	From a programmer's perspective, a GOTO statement is a *magic wand* that changes how you *walk* through the code.\<br></br>I wouldn't have to *walk* anywhere if I had a *magic wand*. I'd just teleport to wherever I wanted to# go to#.\<br></br>I would love to# go to# Denver to live. Among other reasons, you can take nice long *walks* in the nearby mountains, and my radio *antenna* would get great reception given the altitude.\<br></br>#GO TO# JAIL. Do not pass Go, do not collect a magic wand that would magically get you out of jail.\<br></br>One does not simply *walk* to [go to] Mordor: you also need a *divining rod*.\<br></br>DIVINING ROD in hand, Gandolf sets off WALKING to# go to# Mordor.
趟	Imagine you take an epic, five-year# trip# in which you *walk* around in every country on earth. People would likely *esteem* you for your accomplishment, but you in turn would have *esteem* for everyone on Earth.\<br></br>When taking a# trip#, you know where you're *walking*, and hold your destination in #esteem#.\<br></br>A person held in high ESTEEM in past times was not allowed to WALK during# trip#s, but was carried instead.\<br></br>This company always sends it's best employees on a number of# trip#s each year. Those that *walk* through hell for the company are shown the company's *esteem* by being sent away.
堤	To *be* safe or not to *be* safe, that's the question if you live near a river. Well, just in case, let's pile up the *soil* to make a# dike#.\<br></br>A# dike# is land that serves such a noble purpose, but it sure can mean that the soil erodes away! "To be, or not to be a# dike#," wonders the ground, pondering its destiny.\<br></br>In this city below sea level, the *ground* needs *to be* surrounded by high walls at all time to keep the city from flooding. This# dike# is hugely important.\<br></br>To build a strong# dike#, the SOIL type must BE just right.
鍵	Apple# keyboard keys# feature an aluminium all-*metal* *build*, and have fantastic *build* quality.\<br></br>An eager fan *builds* a keyboard with keys made out of *gold* and gives it to Elton John.\<br></br>You order a keyboard with solid *metal*# keyboard keys# in order to *build* the next bestselling novel.\<br></br>The best keyboard‘s keys are *metal*-*built*.\<br></br>#Keyboard keys# are not made of METAL, but are used to BUILD wonderful pieces of music.
婿	To become a# son-in-law#, you need a #woman#, and then you f-ck like a crazy zoo on your honey*moon*.\<br></br>When a bachelor becomes a# SON-IN-LAW#, he and his WOMAN will create their own ZOO at home, using only their FLESH.\<br></br>The Black Widow Spider at our local #zoo# not only enjoys the #flesh# of her husbands but #she# also eats her# son-in-law#s ....... which leaves her poor daughters feeling a bit peckish.\<br></br>You're this woman's# son-in-law#; she insists that you and your wife must only enjoy each other's flesh the CORRECT way-- no weird kinks for her precious daughter!\<br></br>Steve Irwin became the WOMAN'S father's# son-in-law# after proposing to her under the MOON at the ZOO.
裁	For *Thanksgiving*, one who# tailor#s is thankful for #clothing#; without it, he wouldn't have a job!\<br></br>This unusual# tailor# not only# tailor#s *clothing*; he also# tailor#s the *Thanksgiving* dinner, measuring the turkey, clipping away at the cranberry sauce, adjusting the mashed potatoes and trimming the napkins.\<br></br>The# tailor# prepares the family's GARMENTS for the THANKSGIVING dinner.
襪	An old CLOAK that was DESPISED was cut up and turned into# SOCKS#.\<br></br>Hey, all you aunts,sisters,girlfriends,wives .... listen up !! I want to lift the #cloak# of secrecy on what presents men want for birthdays,fathers day, xmas... Taiwanese men #despise## socks# ... and simple mainland guys say [#袜# ] the #last# thing they want is# socks#... what they really want is ....\<br></br>You meet someone who absolutely *despises*# socks#. Why? She loves her feet (and wants others to see how beautiful they are), and# socks# are like *cloaks* that cover them up.
滾	As pointed out on the kanji site, this is actually <a href="/study/kanji/377">grief</a> <span class="index">(#377)</span> with water and animal legs added. Story: our *alcoholic bum* is now living in the forest, trundling along all his possessions in a stolen shopping trolley. His only source of *water* is rain*water*, and he lives on a diet of *boiled wet* *animal legs* (squirrels and dogs). This character also means to #boil#.\<br></br>Overcome with *grief* that his favourite pet animal was overrun by a #trundling# cart, *water* is streaming from his eyes as he holds the *animal legs* of his pet before his eyes (between his top hat and mouth). Slowly he# trundle#s off in the distance.\<br></br>Simplified 滚# trundle# = *water*, *top hat*, *public*, *scarf*. Story: The rock band "Oscillate-and-Trundle" is playing a free concert down by the *water* front that's open to the *public*. This is a high-end area of New York though, so everyone in the vicinity (literally the element for *public*) are disinterested bystanders dressed in *top hats and scarfs*. Perhaps the band should# trundle# their act to another location.\<br></br>The right primitive is a bit hard to abstract-- I'll just view the animal legs as a mustache growing above his mouth. Actually, this is the grieving tramp's twin brother, who you can only tell apart by the mustache. The tramp live on land, the brother live on water, and he must# trundle# his belongings on this water.\<br></br>Heisig ignores the fact that 袞 is a character in its own right meaning *imperial robe*. Here I take it to be a robe made from a scarf, with six "mouths" to allow to access to the two eyes, two ears, the nose, and the mouth. Imperial robes are supposed to be fancy, but when wet (#water#), you can# trundle# along in them at best.\<br></br>We need to# trundle# a package down to the river. Fortunately, it's in a hexagon shaped container, here represented by a *six* sided *mouth*. It's not particularly round, but I'm sure wrapping a *scarf* around it will help with the curves.
衰	If you thought that the wino in <a href="/study/kanji/377">grief</a> <span class="index">(#377)</span> was pathetic, you haven't seen him after his# decline#. Here he is carrying a *stick* around in his mouth like a dog, begging people to throw it for him (and then give him money when he fetches it). Note that the mouth is closed only after the stick goes in, as is only logical. (thanks to raulir).\<br></br>Whenever you #decline# extra fees at stores or anywhere else (e.g. "special insurance" for electronics and video games), it's not all that rare to get grief for it. Here, when you #decline# jam a walking stick in the mouth of the #grief#-giver to save yourself the obnoxiousness.\<br></br>The GRIEVING man's mental state began to deline so much so that he is carrying a WALKING STICK in his mouth.
衷	The man who has caused you such *grief* invites you to sit down. He leans on a *walking stick* and, amazingly, pours out his# innermost feelings# to you. It’s a touching and healing moment.\<br></br>The suicidal man in his GRIEF feels he must share his most# innermost feelings# literally by shoving a WALKING STICK down his mouth.\<br></br>To literally get to your #innermost feelings# of grief, shove a *walking stick* down your #mouth#.
禪	You like to be organized, so on your *altar*, you keep a #list# of your# meditation#s.\<br></br>One well-known type of Christian# meditation# is Lectio Divina. Here you are before the *altar* with a *list* of all the steps involved. Read here, reflect there, pray here, contemplate there . . . it’s a little tricky, but you’ll get the hang of it.
猿	Our old friend #Yuan# and a *wild dog* bred to give an entirely new species of #ape#.\<br></br>To catch an #ape# (think of the game# ape#-escape), chase him with *wild dogs* into a *lidded crock*, then tie it up tightly with a *scarf*. (thanks to dingomick).\<br></br>Right primitive: lidded crock wrapped in a scarf might be a bomb - thanks chamcham . Monkey saving a dog from a bomb explosion in China: www.imgur.com/kLvNv‎.\<br></br>The politician *Yuan* is so suspicious, that he even sends a *pack of wild dogs* after an# ape# he suspects of being his political opponent.\<br></br>Politicians like Yuan basically combine the stupidity of dumb# ape#s with the immorality of wild beasts.\<br></br>The# ape# likes to play hide and seek with the PACK of WILD DOGS by hiding in the LIDDED CROCK. But he is easily spotted because his little SCARF is always hanging out. (thanks to sannomiya @ RTK).
吊	Some spit is #dangling# from your *mouth*. Best use a *towel* to wipe it away.\<br></br>Bullfighters are known for #dangling# a big red towel from their side. But this bullfighter, the bravest (or most foolish) of them all, decides to# dangle# the *towel* from his *mouth*.\<br></br>To prevent anything dangling from your mouth while you eat,# dangle# a #towel# under your #mouth# instead.\<br></br>You know who ate the TOWEL because you see it# dangle# out their MOUTH.
帕	You realize that you’ve been using the same# handkerchief# for many years. It’s pretty beat up, and to keep up appearances you’ll have to get a new one. But what to do with this# handkerchief#? You give it to your pet *white bird* so she can use it as a *towel* after taking her daily bath. [Note: be careful about using *white towel* in your story, since this has been introduced as a primitive earlier.].\<br></br>A# handkerchief# is basically a WHITE TOWEL you carry around.\<br></br>The all purpose *towel* acts as a# handkerchief# for the magician who forgot the real one, no matter, he's still able to make *doves* appear.
帖	You go to see the *fortune teller*, but all you find when you get there is a *towel* hanging on the door, and a #note# saying "Gone for a shower - back in 5 minutes".\<br></br>The FORTUNE TELLER actually has# note#s written on a TOWEL that help her make the best possible predictions. What a fraud!\<br></br>Sometimes people leave phone numbers or calculations on napkins as a little# note#, at a restaurant or bar. Well, you were chatting up a fortune teller, and before she left, she gave you a# note# scribbled on a towel-- turns out it had your future listed on it.\<br></br>#Towel#ie from South Park has been kidnapped, and this ransom# note# #tells his fortune# is you do not give in.
帆	When a# sail# reaches the end of its useful years, it gets chopped up into hundreds of *ordinary* *towels* that are then sold to tourists. (*Towels* is to the left of *ordinary*, and remember that the second stroke in *ordinary* is in its full long form.).\<br></br>We went canoeing one time as a kid, and the wind was so strong that my friend's mom stood up and held up a #towel# to catch the *wind* as if it were a# sail#. Here, that same #towel# is up, catching each *drop* of *wind*.\<br></br>An ORDINARY TOWEL is not enough to serve as a boat# sail#.
幅	In ancient times, the *width of cloth* of your *towel* (cotton being an expensive luxury) would show how * wealthy* you were. really * wealthy* people would have a bath-*towel* stretching the whole length of a room. totally impractical but proved you were loaded.\<br></br>Never mind the quality...feel the# width of cloth# . Phrase used to persuade you that quantity is more important than quality. Germans on holiday put their #towels# on the sunbeds before the other guests wake-up - a statement of ownership - "this# width of cloth#, which is part of my #wealth# gives me ownership of this sunbed." Never mind good manners..\<br></br>When they need to dry, the #towels# of the *wealthy* are simply the entire massive #width of cloth#.\<br></br>When it comes to scrolls, it doesn't matter the# width of cloth# or the fact that it's basically just a TOWEL so long as it contains a WEALTH of information.
錦	In this hotel, the *white towels* are made of a richly decorated# brocade# inlaid with real *gold* stitched into it.\<br></br>To me, “brocade” sounds a lot like blockade. As the general of an army, you try to stop the opposing army from advancing by laying a giant all-*metal*# brocade# down. Unfortunately, they break through your *metal*# brocade#, and you have no choice but to wave the *white towel* in surrender.\<br></br>The difference between# brocade# and other embroidered fabrics, is that# brocade# is reversible and is equally pretty on either side of the fabric.# Brocade# is made from silk fibers, which can melt under extreme heat, so you can iron it by placing a towel over it and ironing the towel. This protects the delicate fibers of the# brocade#.\<br></br>#Brocade# is simply pure #gold# stitched into a stark #white# #towel#.\<br></br>This particular# brocade# is a WHITE TOWEL with intricate GOLD patterns woven into it.
沛	In the wake of Y2K, many paranoid people went to MARKETS to buy# copious# amounts of WATER.\<br></br>You make# copious# amounts of money by investing in a bottled *water* companies on the stock *market*. Turns out that people really like Deer Park.\<br></br>Any time that anything happens, everyone buys #copious# amounts of #water# at the #market#.
柿	The# persimmon# TREE sells well in Asian MARKETS because of it's use in traditional Chinese medicine.\<br></br>A# persimmon# *Christmas tree* will produce nice, ripe fruits (technically berries) that you can then sell at the *market,* perhaps paying for all the Christmas presents you gave out.\<br></br>I actually like# persimmon#s quite a bit, but they're pretty hard to find in my hometown. The grocery store doesn't have them, so the only place is the farmer's market. Of course, I suppose I could also just get a# persimmon# tree...\<br></br>Nobody would every buy #persimmon# at the #market#, as there is a #tree# there where you can take them.
鬧	Imagine you’re watching CNBC when one analyst says, “the stock *market* is going to crash.” The guy across from him says, “you’re just trying to# stir up trouble#!” They then get into a *fight* on live TV and the anchor tries to break it up.\<br></br>Simplified 闹# stir up trouble# = *gate*, *market*. Story: Here's *Bill Gates* when he was accused by the US Government of #stirring up trouble# by having a monopoly over the *market*.\<br></br>The worst, most chaotic way to# stir up trouble# is to cause a #fight# in the #market#.\<br></br>Classic Bruce Lee film: gangsters STIRRING UP TROUBLE in the MARKET leads to a FIGHT.\<br></br>The gangsters come through the GATES of the MARKET and will do nothing but# stir up trouble#.
棘	The# thorn bushes# growing around the castle of Sleeping Beauty were endless: just *thorns* alongside *thorns* as far as you could see.\<br></br>The# thorn bushes# (棘) are to *thorns* as woods (林) are to trees (木).\<br></br>The# thorn bushes# are tied back with BELTS so their THORNS won't injury people passing by.
棗	According to Heisig, the# jujube# plant is used for treating sore throats. This character shows a poor guy who got a sore throat by stuffing *thorns* over *thorns* down his throat as part of a dumb bet. He runs off looking for some# jujube# fruit – his throat is killing him!\<br></br>Simplified 枣# Jujube# = *thorns*, *ice*. Story: When I have a sore throat, it feels like a wad of *thorns* are poking me every time I cough. I usually eat some #jujubes# and drink an *Icee* to make it feel better.\<br></br>#Jujube# bushes have double the *thorns*.\<br></br>The# jujube# (Chinese date) is used in Chinese medicine for pain relief when your throat feels as if you swallowed 2 THORNS.
蕾	Imagine that if# flower bud#s burst into *flowers*, they released a booming *thunder* sound. Spring would be a very noisy time – you would need earplugs whenever you visited the park or a garden!\<br></br>This# flower bud# is a particularly odd type: it only blooms into full *flowers* when it hears #thunder#.\<br></br>This# flower bud# is a timid little FLOWER afraid to come out and show itself because it is scared of the THUNDER.(thanks to megaboyx @ RTK).
吞	The new prion disease causes people to# gulp down# everything in sight! It is a sure-fire way to #die young# through the #mouth#.\<br></br>Pictograph of a *mouth* trying to# gulp down# revelations from *heaven*. It doesn't seem to be going very well, however, so I don't think we have a convert here.\<br></br>how can you# gulp down# all of that in your mouth at once.\<br></br>My MOUTH so thirsty, I# gulp down# the drink down so eagerly it looks as if I could# gulp down# the HEAVENS too.
妖	A siren is a# bewitching# #woman# who leads one to #die young#.\<br></br>The WOMAN tragically DIES YOUNG, but comes back from the grave# bewitching# all who were involved in her murder.
沃	You poured tons of *water* over a field so that the soil would be# fertile#. Unfortunately, this drowned the sprouts and your plants *died young*.\<br></br>The# Fertile# Crescent is marked by much #water# (the Tigris and Euphrates), and is where Gilgamesh went to avoid #dying young#.\<br></br>If a woman is extremely# fertile#, she might die young from having too many babies (okay, probably not true, but whatever). You know she's really# fertile# if her water is breaking all the time...\<br></br>The land is not# fertile# due to no WATER and the crops DIE YOUNG before they can even leave their seeds.
轎	This character is easy, and just quite literal: a# sedan chair# is precisely the equivalent of a #car# for #angel#s.\<br></br>When I ride in a sedan car, I like to pretend I'm some fancy celebrity riding in a# sedan chair#.\<br></br>The Chinese empress treated as an ANGEL is carried about still sitting in her# sedan chair# in a royal CART.
垃	When you don't have a carpet, what do you do with all the# garbage# #dirt# that you swept up? You hide it in the big #vase#, of course.\<br></br>Don’t let# garbage# end up in the lovely *soil*. Put it into that recycling *vase* instead.\<br></br>That pesky maid has been hiding all the# garbage# and *dirt *inside our big *vase*!\<br></br>It's better to put# garbage# in a VASE rather than throw it on the SOIL.
啼	This is the *mouth* of *Lady Sovereign* singing her latest hit,# Weep Aloud# - with the entire crowd singing, or rather weeping along.\<br></br>When the supposedly *sovereign* Kim Jong-Il died, all the residents of North Korea were ordered to# weep aloud# with their *mouths* -- and it had to be #a loud# sound.\<br></br>I associate 帝 with gay guys (being one), because the apron part reminded me of being at Gay Pride and seeing a hot guy wearing nothing more than an apron (seriously). I pictured him standing sovereign as an icon of gay liberation, hence carrying the association forward. Now, for# weep aloud#, I am reminded of the true #sovereign# icon of the gay community, good old Chris Crocker, weeping aloud for Britney with his #mouth# wide open.\<br></br>The *sovereign* from <a href="/study/kanji/413">sovereign</a> <span class="index">(#413)</span> is standing in the kitchen cutting an onion. He's not used to this, so he is #weeping aloud# with his *mouth* wide open.\<br></br>The SOVEREIGN has died and people's MOUTHS# weep aloud#.
蒂	A beloved *sovereign* chokes on a# fruit stem# and spits it out on her plate. In order to save face her assistants quickly cover the# fruit stem# with a bouquet of *flowers*.\<br></br>I use #sovereign# (帝) to represent a *gay guy*, as explained in {<a href="/study/kanji/1672">weep aloud</a> <span class="index">(#1672)</span>}, and as a gay guy is sometimes called a fruit, a #fruit stem# is obviously his penis, which, as JFK on Clone High said, is his "precious *flower*.".\<br></br>The spring #flower queen# has garlands of *apple blossom* in her hair. It is a familiar pagan ritual , the #queen# representing a fecund# fruit stem# , that will bear #fruit# in time for harvest festival...\<br></br>The *sovereign* is standing in the kitchen, cutting the edible *flowers* from the plant at the# fruit stem#.\<br></br>The# fruit stem# is the part of the *flower* that makes it *sovereign* from the rest of the plant.\<br></br>The# fruit stem# is cut and the FLOWER is given as a gift to the SOVEREIGN.
滴	#Drip#,# drip#,# drip#. The sound of Chinese water torture. Except in this case, the torturers are making the *water*# drip# on the man’s precious *antique* vase and will only stop when he reveals his bank account number. As always, form a really good image of the *water* #dripping# onto the *vase* in your head for this one.\<br></br>This faucet is *antique*. It looks very ornate, but because of its age it is a little leaky and# drip#s *water* all the time.\<br></br>I only# drip# *water* on my *antiques* to clean them because any more than a# drip# will shatter them.\<br></br>When water# drip#s from your ceiling, porch, or anywhere else, just collect it with an antique vase.\<br></br>Thanks to johnzep of RTK: In the museum, due to the leaky roof, #drip#s of *water* were collected in #antique# vases.
頃	A# 100 Chinese acres# race where the contestants carry a *spoon* on their *head* for# 100 Chinese acres#.\<br></br>You have hired the very competent farmer *SpoonHead* to manage your #100 Chinese acres#.\<br></br>#100 Chinese acres# is required to grow sufficient saffron crocus to harvest just a #spoon# of this treasured spice. You will see peasant farmers in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces carrying baskets of crocus on their #heads# for the womenfolk to later pick the purple stigmas..\<br></br>You are sent to a huge piece of land,# 100 Chinese acres#, with just an ancient spoon in hand and a page instructing you to use the spoon to dig up all# 100 Chinese acres#...\<br></br>I SIT HEAD hanging down wondering who I can farm these# 100 Chinese acres# on my own.
匙	To *be* or not to *be* a# spoon#, is what this *ancient# spoon#* is wondering after watching the famous "There is no# spoon#" scene from the Matrix.\<br></br>*To be or not to be* a *spoon*? is not a question an actual #spoon# gets to answer.\<br></br>#Spoon#s are peaceful utensils. Have they ever done anyone harm? Not until you threw a# spoon# – I repeat, a *spoon* -- at a Shakespeare actor saying “to *be* or not to *be*” and consequently got kicked out of the Globe Theatre.\<br></br>I also like to use 是 to represent Hamlet (to be or not to be), so here we have *Hamlet*, whose main hobby is collecting #spoon#s.\<br></br>How can an ANCIENT# SPOON# BE as good as a modern# spoon#?
乖	Imagine a child so# well-behaved# that Santa sends him *1000* gifts from the *North* Pole.\<br></br>In order to have their kids grow up# well-behaved#, parents are willing to pay #thousand#s to send their kids to the renowned school in the #North#.\<br></br>The# well-behaved# *goody-goody* actually went to the *North* pole for our geography assignment. The teacher was so impressed she got a *thousand* out of a hundred points.\<br></br>My parents compare me to thousands of other kids... they're always talking about how the others are so much more# well-behaved#.\<br></br>THOUSANDS of teachers applied to the school in the NORTH where the students are# well-behaved#.
乘	This *goody-goody* refuses to# hitch a ride# because it’s illegal in his state. In fact, he ends up climbing a *tree* (note how it overlaps with goody-goody) and sleeping there overnight instead of breaking the law.\<br></br>The *goody-goody* from {<a href="/study/kanji/1677">well-behaved</a> <span class="index">(#1677)</span>} hitched a ride on a Mary Poppins' *umbrella*. Primitive: *hitchhiker*.\<br></br>Pictograph of two guys SITTING back to back on a wagon to# hitch a ride# through the WHEAT field.\<br></br>I know the truth-- my parents think those thousand other kids that they always compare me to are all well-behaved, but the truth is that just go around town with an umbrella, skipping class to# hitch a ride# with whoever will take them away from school every day.
剩	Well, I hitched a ride with a stranger once... he offered me some# leftover# food, and I was about to accept when I noticed the saber in his truck-- the# leftover#s were actually the chopped up remains of other people who had hitched with him! I got out of there fast...\<br></br>The man who *hitched a ride* with you offers you all of his# leftover# food. Unfortunately it’s so hard that you have to cut it up with a *saber* just to eat it.\<br></br>After cutting up the *hitchhiker* with a *sabre*, the driver stored the# leftover# body parts in the fridge next to his# leftover#s. Ick.\<br></br>To HITCH A RIDE, the killer kills the driver with a SABER and discards the body like# leftover# food.
棍	Our ancestors used to be able to take an entire tree and use it as a# club#! As their descendents, we aren't that great...\<br></br>Imagine that you were once a wild and violent person, swinging your# club# everywhere and being generally antisocial. But then you have a change of heart, and as a sign of your conversion, you offer your giant# club# to your *descendants* so that they can use it as a *Christmas tree*.\<br></br>We are the DESCENDENTS of cave people that walked around carrying a WOODEN# club#.
諧	When ALL speak the same WORDS, we are# in accord#.\<br></br>You love being# in accord# – that is, in your Honda Accord. That’s because it sprays *All* detergent as an air freshener, and it knows *all* the words in its *English-Japanese* dictionary, so you will become fluent in Japanese by the time you sell it! [Note: note that in *all*, the *compare* primitive is on top, whereas with *descendants* in frame 1680, the *compare* primitive is on the bottom.].\<br></br>A choir can only be# in accord# if they *all* sing the same *words* and *all* of them at the right pitch.\<br></br>We're all# in accord#?

Hint: It aint yo' dumb ol' momma!\<br></br>EVERY TASKMASTER must be# quick-witted# to stay in charge.\<br></br>#QUICK-WITTED#ness (or CLEVERNESS RTK1 keyword) is something that EVERY TASKMASTER must have.
霉	EVERY time it RAINS, I get# mildew# damage on my roof.\<br></br>Imagine your *mother* *reclining* outside on a warm sunny day. She falls asleep, only to be *rained* on when a storm rolls through. To her disgust, she wakes up smelling like# mildew#!\<br></br>*Yo' momma's* so dumb, she forgot to dry off after spending the whole day in the *rain*, so now she reeks of# mildew#.\<br></br>I hate rain because afterwards, EVERYTHING in my house smells of# mildew#-- the furniture, my electronics, even all my food. It's just awful!\<br></br>#Every## mildew# begins from #rain#.

砍	I practice karate, but I still LACK the ability to# chop# through STONE.\<br></br>I# chop# a *stone* and break it, then pretend to *yawn* at the easiness to the amazement of my spectators. Even though it actually really hurts.\<br></br>You decide that you’re going to# chop# a *stone* in your yard to pieces. Unfortunately, it turns out that stones are harder to# chop# than you think, which is why at 4 a.m., you’re still out there trying to# chop# the *stone*, and now *yawning* profusely.

How am I going to get over this# hump# to make it through the harsh winter?\<br></br>Farming the SOIL all day, I LACK the strength to get me over the last# hump#.\<br></br>Those# hump#s in the #soil# are caused by the *yawns* of huge underground creatures.

欽	People# think highly of# #gold# because they *lack* it. If there was more of it, it would have much less value.\<br></br>Imagine a celebrity who is hounded by admirers. One of them rushes up to him and says, “I# think highly of# you – let me give you this *gold* necklace!” But he just *yawns*, since so many people (however earnest they were) have said the exact same thing.\<br></br>Being so rich, you find it hard to find people who would't be affected by your *gold*. You will# think highly of# the one who'll just *yawn* upon seeing your *gold*.\<br></br>Pennies are METAL that most people don't# think highly of# because it LACKS value.
剖	Before the veterinarian can# cut open# the dog to do surgery, it must first place an anesthesia-containing *muzzle* on its nose – only then may she/he wield the medical *saber*.\<br></br>Thanks to sannomiya from RTK: before you# cut open# someone, use the *muzzle*before the *rapier* to avoid noise.\<br></br>#Cut open# the MUZZLE with a SABER so the hostage can talk.
菩	A# bodhisattva# is someone who has had the *muzzle* of karma removed from his life, because he realizes that even the *flowers* around him are not real.\<br></br>The# bodhisattva# must silently appreciate natural beauty to achieve enlightenment, so he wears *flowers* and a *muzzle*.\<br></br>Pictogragh of the Buddhist spiritural being,# Bodhisattva#, who STANDS on a PLATFORM in a museum with FLOWERS on its head.\<br></br>The# Bodhisattva#'s mission is to help everything in the world achieve enlightenment; from the *flowers* to society's worst undesirables who have been *muzzled* and locked up.\<br></br>A friend has gone a little crazy – she has placed *flowers* all over the *muzzle* of her pet dog because she claims he is a# bodhisattva#.
芒	You are on a deserted island with no food. If the# mango# don't FLOWER this season you will PERISH from hunger.\<br></br>Often companies will emphasize their charitable work when advertising their products. You pick up a can of dried# mango#es at the supermarket and learn that for each can you buy, the company will donate a *flower* to the families of local *deceased* individuals.\<br></br>#Mango#es, being the seeds of the# mango# tree, grow where the *flowers*, having been fertilized, #perish#.
荒	When all the FLOWERS PERISH and the STREAMS dry up, you are living in a# wasteland#.\<br></br>Perhaps you have heard of the song “teenage# wasteland#.” Why was it a# wasteland#? Perhaps because teenagers *flooded* the place with *mangoes* as a practical joke, but then (being teenagers) didn’t clean it up, causing the flood of mangoes to go rotten and become a real# wasteland#.\<br></br>A #mango# *flood* sounds good in theory, but in reality, it destroys everything in its path, leaving a bleak and sullen# wasteland#.
謊	You may think the falsities you say are just little white# lie#s, but they really are wastelands of words-- they create a barren wasteland in your heart where nothing new can ever grow again. It's permanent!\<br></br>A classic# lie# is "Greenland": the *words* belie the fact that it is a #wasteland#.\<br></br>You gave me your WORD that the land was beautiful, but it was all a# lie#. It's a barren WASTELAND.\<br></br>(Thanks to vorpal and swilkins1984) You discover this# lie# in your *dictionary*: it says that Iceland is “an utter *wasteland*.” This causes all of the population of Iceland to write angry letters to the editors, saying “you tell# lie#s!”.
茫	This# boundless# expanse of *flowers* is almost as bad as a desert: despite its beauty, without *water*, you will soon *perish*.\<br></br>The world feels# boundless# during your Caribbean vacation. You are floating in the *water* off the beach with a *mango* lying next to you, and no worries on your mind. Why is *water* positioned so close to *deceased*? Because sadly, many have *perished* at the hands of *water.*.
贏	You had to play a survival game-- kill every other competitor and be the last one alive to# win#. Well, you won-- everyone else perished, and you're so exhausted and traumatized that you can't talk; your mouth just hangs open. You get to choose one of three things as your prize-- flesh (a sexy new wife or husband), shells (tons of money), or just to live an ordinary life. Surprisingly, that last one might be the most appealing now...\<br></br>A rather long story for this five-primitive character. Imagine that you’re on a basketball team when your beloved coach *perishes* the night before the championship. As the captain, you grab hold of his flesh and say with a shaking mouth, “Coach, we’re gonna# win# this one for you.” Indeed, you# win#, and donate the *shells* to the coach’s morning wife. She looks at you and says, “you are no *ordinary* team. This game was much more than a *drop* in the *wind*. Thank you.".\<br></br>You are an ORDINARY human being fighting against a monster OYSTER. You# win# by going through it's MOUTH and tearing into its vulnerable FLESH interior causing it to PERISH.\<br></br>To# win# against cancer and avoid *perish*ing, go in through the #mouth#, and amongst all the *flesh* that is #ordinary#, grab that *oyster*-like thing and tear it out.
訊	Whilst you are #interrogate#d, you must either spill the *words*, or they'll be pulled out of you with *crochet needles*.\<br></br>The TSA# interrogate#s your poor grandmother to check for terrorist links. That’s because she left her *crochet needles* in her pocket English-Spanish *dictionary* and they set off the airport X-ray scanner.\<br></br>WORDS, a NEEDLE, and a FISHHOOK are all useful to# interrogate# a hostage.\<br></br>"Enhanced interrogation" techniques utilize hooks and needles to get the words out of its victims...
坊	It’s common knowledge that Santa’s# Workshop# is located underground at the North Pole. How to find it, then? take a *compass* until you reach the *land* where the compass spins around, then dig into the *soil*. [Granted there’s no soil there . . . but this is Hanzi land, not a geography course!].\<br></br>Want to find the plot of land for Santa's# workshop#? It's easy, just follow any compass.\<br></br>This bizarre little# workshop#'s claim-to-fame is actually disposable compasses, i.e. *compass*es made of *dirt* that return to dirt after using.\<br></br>The entrepreneur bought the LAND and built a# workshop# the specializes in COMPASSES.
芳	A FLOWER COMPASS works by detecting the# aromatic# scents of flowers.
訪	The thing I detest the most is when someone comes by announced to# call on# me. The only *words* I have for their little surprise is to say what *direction* they can take their announced visit.\<br></br>When you# call on# someone, you point your WORDS in their DIRECTION.\<br></br>It's geography day, and the teacher #calls on# her student to get the *dictionary* and read aloud the definition for *compass*.\<br></br>When the president calls on you to do something, make sure you have a *dictionary* handy so that you can understand his *directions*.\<br></br>When the teacher calls on me, she points in my direction and says some words, like "yes, you," or "what is your answer?".
熬	Another thankless job, compliments of your taskmaster: you are thrown into the *dirt* with only a *compass* by the *taskmaster* and expected to find your way to the *cooking fire* if you have any hopes of getting any# stew#.\<br></br>You are thankful for what the *soil* provides you with, as it *releases* you from hunger and allows you to# stew# nice# stew#s over a *cooking fire*.\<br></br>Continuing on with <a href="/study/kanji/463">release</a> <span class="index">(#463)</span>, in which the *Imperial Japanese Army* releases you into the wilderness with nothing but a *compass*. You become extremely hungry during your trek back to civilization, so much so that you# stew# *soil* over a *cooking fire* as a disgusting dinner. Why the strange primitive placement noted by Heisig? Because you’re also mentally *stewing* about the army and the compass they gave you, which is why those are closest to your (mental) *cooking fire*.\<br></br>Combining "grow up" and "direction" reminds me of that saying that someone is growing out and getting fat, instead of growing up and getting tall. Hitler is afraid of growing out, in the wrong direction, so he orders attendants to cook him healthy# stew#s that must# stew# slowly over a cooking fire.
菸	I always take 於 to be a swiss army knife - the all purpose tool - since it contains everything one would need: a compass, an umbrella, and some skis. Here, to smoke Nicotiana rusticum (aka wild# tobacco#), you first remove the *flowers* using your *swiss army knife*. Note this is a variation of 煙.\<br></br>A group of kids at a high school decide they’ll skip class the day they have to learn the *all-purpose preposition*, so they hide in the *flower* bushes outside and smoke# tobacco#.
榜	Every adventurer wants a# roster# of brave and willing companions for his or her next adventure. Hence, you give *Magellan* a# roster# of fellow sailors by putting it under his *Christmas tree.*.\<br></br>Before *Magellan* went on his trip around the world, he made up a# roster# of fellow sailors by asking volunteers to gather under the large *tree* in the middle of the town.\<br></br>For every business, team, class, etc, there should always be a tree standing on the side of the institution with a# roster# list carved in the wood. As the group grows, so will the tree, so there will always be room for new names!\<br></br>MAGELLAN's crew# roster# is etched into the WOOD of the ship.
磅	Little known fact, but MAGELLAN was the first to establish the metric# pound# using only STONES.\<br></br>Ugh, this stone is so heavy! I swear it weighs a# pound#! Well, I set it to the side since I'm such a wuss.
膀	Imagine if they had vaccines back in the time of the great explorers. Here’s *Magellan* biting his lip in the doctor’s office as a nurse sticks shot after shot after shot of vaccines into the *flesh* of his# upper arm#. Look, tropical diseases are no joke . . .\<br></br>The flesh on your sides is actually kind of like the flesh on your# upper arm#- they're both kind of wiggly and flabby.\<br></br>A recent study has shown that the most common tattoo in the *flesh* of the# upper arm# is a likeness of *Magellan*, strangely enough.\<br></br>MAGELLAN has the coordinates to the treasure island tattooed into the FLESH of his# upper arm#.
銳	The METAL at the tip of the DEVIL'S 3-prong staff is# sharp#.\<br></br>Saint George slayed the *devilish* dragon with a# sharp# *metal* sword. Very# sharp# of him to do that.\<br></br>The science of metallurgy all begun from the need to convert the metal into# sharp# knives, arrows and spears.\<br></br>The *devil* always uses a *golden*# sharp#ie when condemning the greedy who revel in *gold* for irony.\<br></br>The #sharp#est things - from wit to horns to tail - all exist on the *Metal* *Devil*, that character from Futurama.\<br></br>A# sharp# weapon is *metal* that does the work of the *devil*.
虹	All the *insects* in the field stop their daily *work* to watch the beautiful# rainbow# that has appeared. Picture the bees and the ants and the grasshoppers all looking at the# rainbow# . . . pretty cute, isn’t it?\<br></br>#Rainbow#s are actually the constructions of billions of *insects* using *I-beams*.\<br></br>This# rainbow# is actually the WORK of multi-colored INSECTS flying together.
蝠	#Bat#s measure their *wealth* in *insects*: indeed, their bank account balances are in insects and not in money.\<br></br>Calvin (in Watterson’s Calvin and Hobbes) mistakenly believed that# bat#s are *bugs*.

蟬	The 17-year# cicada# broods are one of the rarest *insects* to spot because they emerge from the ground so rarely, so you must keep a *list* of the years they comes out on your fridge to know when to expect each brood.\<br></br>[See 1007 維 - #Maintain#] : *Spiderman* and the *turkey'*s love child has a great appetite for #insects# but top of the #list# is the# cicada# - meal-time is a fairly noisy occassion.\<br></br>#Cicada#s are *insects* that have such a long *list* of things to do, that they only finish it after 17 years!\<br></br>#Cicada#s are *insects* that love to stay up way into the night and *list* all of the things they did that day. That's what they do with their unique sound - gossip.\<br></br>Since the breeding pattern of# cicada#s is so complex (i.e. there are broods that come above ground every X years to mate), we must keep #lists# to know their behaviour.\<br></br>#Cicada# just reminds me of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni-- "When the# Cicada#s Cry" Japanese visual novel with a long list of dead people...
楓	(Thanks to Katuso on RTK.) To tell if a tree is a# maple# tree, stand next to it during a *windstorm*. If you are covered in# maple# syrup, you have found yourself a# maple#.\<br></br>The# Maple# Leafs hockey team's (made up) motto is "firm as a *tree*, and fast as the *windstorm*".\<br></br>A huge insect-filled *windstorm* knocks down a giant# maple# and it crashes into your living room. Always one to see the bright side of things, your dad says, “well, this will be our *Christmas tree* this year – the largest we’ve ever had!”.\<br></br>The# maple# TREE is strong enough to withstand a WINDSTORM.

炮	#Fireworks# are simply *fires* *wrapped* up into colorful packages that are set ablaze on special occasions. Hint: so that you don't confuse *wrapped* with *bound up* (which I will likely do on occasion), really try to picture these few characters being wrapped up, not just bound up.\<br></br>#Fireworks# are really like having #fire# that is all #wrapped# up, ready for use.\<br></br>Gotta wrap those# fireworks# tightly, so the powder doesn't leak and cause some horrible accident... When you detonate them though, it's beautiful, like the sky is wrapped in beautiful colors like a lovely present.

How exciting!\<br></br>This crazy sow is in love with me!! I'm running on the road, and it's just pursuing me, oinking and crooning all the way.
遂	The pig was HORNY and marched down the ROAD to find a SOW to# satisfy#. (Note: Apologies to those offended by this).\<br></br>Some *pursue* a big rack of *animal horns* in order to# satisfy# their desire for manhood, or blood, or death, or triumph, or so on.\<br></br>The saddest fly was *pursuing* poor Sue's sow because since he was born he wanted *animal horns*! And he was jealous that the sow was going to grow them so the saddest fly swore that he would not be #satisfied# until he killed the sow.
蒙	In India, cows are sacred. In# Mongolia#, pigs (not really): here, we have the annual pig fest, where #one# *pig* is chosen and crowned with a *flower* *crown*.\<br></br>#Mongolia# was once a land of *flowers*. At the height of their empire they had a *ceiling* made from the *crowns* of the kings and emperors they had conquered. However, despite their glory they still kept their nomadic roots for they regularly let *sows* into their royal palaces.\<br></br>As a North Korean refugee, you escape China and make it into# Mongolia#. This gives you a chance to meet the queen of# Mongolia#, who wears a *crown* of *flowers* and lives in a home with really tall *ceilings*. You’re so relieved that you offer her a giant *sow* that almost reaches to the *ceiling*.\<br></br>In a normal house, you might keep a sow indoors. In# Mongolia#, you don't just let it inside; people there respect their pork so much, they put a crown of flowers on the sow and then set it right under the ceiling, so it can be above everyone else.
朦	The traditional folklore name for the *moon* in *Mongolia* literally translates as "the# dim# light," obviously in contrast to the not-so-#dim# light of the sun.\<br></br>Imagine that pollution has gotten really bad in *Mongolia*, and hence citizens have only a# dim# view of the *moon*.\<br></br>Mongolians don't use lights. They just go by the moonlight, so although they can kind of see (less pollution there), everything is rather# dim#...\<br></br>In the Himalayas in MONGOLIA there is a dark area where the MOON is# dim#.
豪	Don't let the *sows* run around# unrestrained#! If you do, before you know it they'll have taken over the place (like in Animal Farm) and start to imitate humans by wearing a *tiara*.\<br></br>#Miss Piggy# , in #tiara# and pink boa scarf and nothing else, is gagging# unrestrained# for some serious loving :" Oh Kermit , come out,come out where ever you are - it's time for a game of hide the saugage !!".\<br></br>A fat *sow* on the farm decides that from now on, she is going to live an# unrestrained# life. She promptly puts a squishy *tiara* on her head and says (or honks), “I’m the boss around here!”.\<br></br>This particular PIG wearing a TIARA is allowed to wander about# unrestrained#.
啄	RE 'hog-tied' primitive: Let’s suppose that this *sow* is hog-tied because a bandit is trying to steal her. Hence I will also label this primitive a *stolen pig.* The farm robber tries to make it out of the shed with his *stolen pig*, but is confronted by a flock of angry geese who open their toothed *mouths* wide to# peck# at him.\<br></br>The sow with two of its legs stroked together reminds me of a pig on a spit. If you leave that spit-pig around, all kinds of mouths will come to# peck# at it.\<br></br>Birds# peck# away at the MOUTHS of SOWS keeping them clean.
琢	The robber is elated that he’s made it out with the *stolen pig*, except that it turns out that this is the *king’s* *stolen pig*! The penalty for such a heinous crime is to be# chisel#ed to death. Augh! He’d better return it . . .\<br></br>The #jewel# craftsmen is using a *pig* as a model - and it is #hogtied# so that it doesn't move - while he #cuts the gem# with his# chisel#. Its the *Year of the Pig* so this *little piggy* should be a best-seller !!!\<br></br>The precursor to crucifixion was a king who had his criminals hog-tied and #chiseled# to death.\<br></br>This is precisely why pigs are no longer used for truffle hunting: they want those tasty *jewels* so badly that even if they're *hog-tied*, you still need to# chisel# them apart.\<br></br>You know how pigs roasting on a spit stereotypically have an apple in their mouth? This one is holding a jeweled ball; if you take a# chisel# to it, I guess you could sculpt that into an apple though.\<br></br>The sculptor# chisel#s the BALL of marble into a PIG statue.
嫁	My friend #married# the worst *woman* ever. She spent all their money on the wedding, so they could only afford a *flophouse* for their honeymoon.\<br></br>Always at home alone, the WOMAN feels like she's going to# marry# a HOUSE rather than her absent fiance.\<br></br>After# marry#ing, it is expected that a #woman# would move into her husband's #house#.

楊	The Western Balsam# Poplar# *tree* was the first *tree* to have its full DNA code sequenced. I'm sure that scientist became very "poplar," and it couldn't have hurt the *piggy bank* either.\<br></br>It's popular to make *piggy banks* from the *wood* of the #poplar# tree, because it's so shiny and smells so good.\<br></br>Simplified [#杨#] : *Factoid* : The# poplar# #tree# is perfect for producing *chopsticks* - so is an ideal accompaniment with roast #piglet#.\<br></br>To buy a# poplar# as a *Christmas tree*, you will need to take all the money out of your *piggy bank*. That’s because these are very# poplar# Christmas trees (hehe)!\<br></br>Almost all *wooden* *piggy banks* are made from# poplar#. Alternatively, there seems to be a misunderstanding here: you gave the #poplar tree# your *piggy bank* because you thought it might make you POPULAR.\<br></br>Okay,# poplar# is Popura (same name...) from the anime Working!. She's working in the restaurant so she can save money in her piggy bank-- she may be a high schooler, but sometimes she acts kind of cutely immature, doesn't she?\<br></br>To hide it from my siblings, I hid my PIGGY BANK under the# poplar# TREE.

He's feeding drugged *soup* to girls and then de*flower*ing them.\<br></br>The man falsely convicted of being a# licentious# child molester is released and welcomed home with FLOWERS and a bowl of SOUP.\<br></br>Casonova: " I gave her a bunch of #flowers# and a hot steaming bowl of aphrodisiac oyster and carrot #soup# -# licentious# ?? - well, let's just say I had a good *dunk* !!".\<br></br>Try some of this del-#licentious# egg *flower soup*!

He’s# licentious#! He brags about putting marijuana *flowers* in his *soup*!” [Confession: I didn't actually know the meaning of# licentious# when I wrote this story, so it could be completely off the mark -- but it's certainly a memorable image.].\<br></br>Hippies are# licentious#-- they wear flowers everywhere and only drink soup broth, since they are generally somewhat poor and also don't want to consume once-living things that often.
詳	The police wanted to get a# detailed# description of the mysterious sheep killer, but the only *words* they got out of the surviving *sheep* were "baa".\<br></br>I imagine a *sheep* being interviewed, with the police officer *saying* "Can you give us a #detailed# description of the wolf who stole your wool and ate your family?".\<br></br>Prosecutor: " In your own #words# - did the accussed sexually assault you ?" . #Sheep#: " I've already given a# detailed# statement - what more do you want ? written testimony ??....\<br></br>The *sheep* wanted to de-tail himself but first he has to write down in# detailed# *words* that he is consenting to the operation.\<br></br>With a tough keyword like this, I think it’s best to go with a memorable image. Imagine that Marriam-Webster buys a *sheep* and paints images of all of its *dictionaries* on it. It then releases this sheep into college towns so that those who see this# detailed# sheep will consider buying their products.\<br></br>I ran out of paper, so I wrote my college papers on, yes, a sheep.

羨	This sheep has #envy# for the sheep in the next field. You see, this field *lacks water*, and the grass is greener over there..\<br></br>A pastor explains to his congregation, “A good *sheep* is above [note the primitive placement] #envying# others when he or she *lacks* the money to afford artisan bottled *water*.\<br></br>I lack even water...

唯	Thanks to diracbracket of RTK: #Solely# is a synonym for only, or 只.

焦	A *turkey* admits that he’s# apprehensive# about going over the *cooking fire* and becoming a *roast turkey*.\<br></br>Imagine a *turkey* have a counseling session with a psychologist. "It will be Thanksgiving soon, and I will have to go over a *cooking fire* to become a *roast turkey*." "Mm, yes, I see. And how does that make you feel?" ". . .Apprehensive.".\<br></br>Given the long-standing rivalry between *turkeys* and *cooking fires*, it's hard to imagine a more character that captures the idea of #apprehensive# better...\<br></br>Chickens may not be smart, but if you place one over a cooking fire to cook it alive, it'll at least feel# apprehensive#...\<br></br>Dropping off to sleep while it was cooking, I woke up# apprehensive# (worried) that my TURKEY burnt in the COOKING FIRE.
瞧	When you# lay eyes on# the *roast turkey* that your brother cooked for Christmas dinner, your *eyeballs* bulge out. It’s huge and beautifully made; you had no idea he could make something like this! Picture your *eyeballs* literally laying on the turkey.\<br></br>I really like fairy tale stories where a prince will# lay eyes on# a princess and immediately fall in love with her. There are no princes or princesses in this world, but that doesn't mean I don't have my one true love-- food! I fall in love with a roast turkey right when I# lay eyes on# it (don't judge me!).\<br></br>Who literally took out their glass #eye# and #laid it# upon the *roast turkey*? Imagine the turkey coming out of the oven (to emphasize the roast turkey idea), only to find a glass eye sitting next to it.\<br></br>Shy people get APPREHENSIVE when they# lay EYES on# new people.
礁	A guy decides he’s had it with life in [pick your country] when a group of people decided to *stone*/throw *stones* at his *roast turkey*, just for fun. So he has moved to Australia and lives alongside the Great Barrier# reef#.\<br></br>There's nothing like relaxing vacation in Australia, getting *stoned* and eating *roast turkey* while watching the waves crash over the Great Barrier# Reef#.\<br></br>This# reef# in particular (I like to think of it as in a crazy Japanese video game to emphasize the possibility of absurdity) is strange: every #stone# and rock has been methodically replaced by a *roast turkey*.\<br></br>Due to the hot sun, the ROCKS of the coral# reef#s look like ROASTED TURKEY.
蕉	At Christmas dinner, the relative of yours hosting the meal says that instead of eating *roast turkey*, everyone will be having a# banana# instead so that they can be more in touch with nature. Your grandfather grunts, “who let this *flower* child be in charge of the food?”.\<br></br>We are all familiar with a *banana* split, the thing that should first spring to mind when we hear the word# banana#. Well, the# banana# is the *flower* of the# banana# tree. Once we've gone and grabbed one, we need to cut it up, but we're not going to use scoops of ice cream. Instead, we're going to use big scoops of *roast turkey*. Doesn't it sound delicious?\<br></br>You know how it's pretty common to serve pork with pineapple? Well, I want to start a new trend of fruit-and-meat-- let's eat# banana#s with roast turkey.\<br></br>#Banana#s were laid out in a *flower* pattern around the *roast turkey*.\<br></br>The perfect finale to a garnished (*flower*) *roast turkey* dinner is a# banana# split.\<br></br>Now that the Cavendish# banana# has gone extict from the Panama virus and black mould and what have you, the new cultivar that's made it to the world stage tastes, disturbingly, like a *flower* crossed with a *roast turkey*.\<br></br>Like the fruit itself,# banana# FLOWERS look like ROASTED TURKEY as they age.

This unfortunately means that for your Christmas dinner, the *turkey* is a solid block of *ice*.\<br></br>My mom's family is absolutely freakishly paranoid about maintaining a cold turkey so as to avoid salmonella to the point that if the turkey is out of the fridge for more than a minute prior to cooking, we're all going to die. Thus, for me, this character represents this carried out to its extreme conclusion: finally, the paranoia has compounded until the only *turkey* they# allow# me is one made entirely out of *ice*.\<br></br>I'm on a special QUASI-diet (RTK1 keyword): only# ALLOW#ED to eat ICE cream and TURKEY.
雀	Due to the long-running shortage of there only being a #few# *turkeys*, for special occasions we now must feast on #sparrow# instead.\<br></br>There are relatively FEW TURKEYS compared to the widely familiar# sparrow#.

No ... but I can make a# (pause marker)#.\<br></br>Some guy comes up to Tom and asks if he wants to put some *hemp* into his *mouth*.

Well, first you put *hemp* on a large flat *stone*, then you# grind# it into a pulp and put it in a cigarette.\<br></br>Before modern-day# grind#ers, it was necessary to #grind# #hemp# by throwing it on top of a #stone#.

廈	During the *summer*, fancy# skyscraper#s ramp up the AC until the building is as cold as a *cave*.\<br></br>After the dreaded 9/11, the government has mandated that #skyscrapers# only be built in *caves* during the #summer#.\<br></br>In the #summer# with clear skies and the sun high in the sky the *simple mainlanders*[ 厦 ] in the 1960's went to the #cliff# tops of Fujian and could see and marvel at the# skyscraper#s of Taipei, whereas the office workers [廈] in the Taipei# skyscraper#s could see the #caves# along the Fujian coast.\<br></br>The Empire State Building is a# skyscraper# that I visit every SUMMER and it makes any CLIFF look tiny.\<br></br>They built a nice# skyscraper# by digging little *caves* in the sheer side of the mountain, that people could use in the *summer* to escape the heat.\<br></br>The# skyscraper# is as tall as a *cliff*, but you can only see it in *summer*, due to all the heavy pollution.\<br></br>For this one, I try to imagine the very first "skyscrapers" in ancient China. Like, maybe at the beach, there were some small *caves* that people could sometimes duck into to escape the *summer* heat. But as the population increased and trips to the beach got more popular, those caves got taller and taller to accommodate more people. until finally they looked like# skyscraper#s.\<br></br>If you want to escape the heat of the *summer*, you're going to have to do better than a# skyscraper#. After all, heat rises. Might I recommend a nice *cave*?
廁	Back in the day, the# toilet# *rules* were simple: shit anywhere, but not in the *cave* where you live!\<br></br>Before# toilet#s were invented, there were no flushing RULES. People just did their business in CAVES. How gross!\<br></br>*Rule* #1 when camping: don’t use the *cave* you’re staying in as a# toilet#!\<br></br>In Taiwan the *traditional* #rule# is to do one's# toilet# under the secluded cover of a #cave# . The 厕 *simple mainlanders* have no such #rule# and have no hesitatation on having their# toilet# in full view on top of a #cliff#.\<br></br>Simplified 厕# Toilet# = *cliff*, *rule*.

悟	*Data* was a rather gifted android, because he was able to# realize# self-consciousness after reading the word "*I*" in a *literary* text and comprehending its meaning.\<br></br>Note: I use 吾 to represent the five senses. #Realization# is the *state of mind* that can be triggered by any of the *five senses*.\<br></br>*Mother Teresa*# realize#s that the poor of India need *medical care* for the *five mouths* in their head (two nostrils, two ears and a mouth), and hence decides to dedicate her life to serving the poor of Calcutta.\<br></br>After much reflection, I came to a new STATE OF MIND and I# realize# what I want to do with my life.
忠	During the revolutionary war, I imagine that those# loyal# to the British Empire were sometimes stabbed in the *middle* of their *heart*. :-(.\<br></br>Like the brain, the heart is divided according to functionality. Here, #loyalty#, one of the deepest and most profound of feelings, is right in the #middle# of the #heart#.\<br></br>When you are# loyal# to someone, you keep them right in the MIDDLE of your HEART.
悼	*Data* loves watching TV portrayals of *Houdini* (the eminent magician), but he notices that *Houdini* always looks like a different person - which one is the real *Houdini*? A fellow cadet tells *Data* that *Houdini* died before television was invented. *Data* then #mourns# both the death of *Houdini*, as well as the fact that he will never be able to see the real *Houdini* in action.\<br></br>Given that the most profound writing often comes about when one is in #mourning#, it is the *state of mind* that has the greatest potential to bring about *eminence*.\<br></br>*Data*# mourn#s the death of his *eminent* creator Dr Soong.\<br></br>Many *eminent* leaders around the world# mourn#ed *Mother Teresa* at her passing. She was a reminder that to serve is greater than to be served.\<br></br>The dark secret of becoming an eminent magician is that your powers can only awaken when you have a terrible tragedy befall you. Although the magician is eminent and amazing, his state of mind is therefore always# mourn#ful.\<br></br>The STATE OF MIND when the EMINENT leader has died is to# mourn#.
慎	*Mother Teresa* was very# prudent#: she would only say things that were *true*.\<br></br>Ever seen Star Trek:TNG when Picard asks *Data* for some information, and gets a long rambling answer that's far too accurate and he has to shout "MR DATA!". Well now Data is more# prudent# with the *truth* and gives more succinct answers.\<br></br>Simplified <a href="/study/kanji/1780">be frightened</a> <span class="index">(#1780)</span> [#惧#].

"It's *true* man, you know how# prudent# *Data* is.".\<br></br>I tend to become highly avoidant when faced with hardship. If I were truly #prudent#, I would face the #truth# and use that to mould my *state of mind*.\<br></br>It wouldn't be# prudent# to be in a care-free STATE OF MIND while using power TOOLS.
恕	A group committed to ending the death penalty asks the governor of Virginia to# pardon# the prisoner, saying “*be like* a *heart*!”.\<br></br>(Sexist, yes, but only because it's an easy stereotype to remember and not an actual reflection of my opinion.) Men need# pardon#ing because out of their mouth comes the contents of their stomach (gas) with reckless abadon. #Women# need# pardon#ing because out of their #mouth# comes the contents of their #heart# (feelings) with reckless abandon.\<br></br>The WOMAN made a mistake thinking I was the boyfriend who broke her HEART and punch me in the MOUTH. She apologized and I# pardon#ed her.
悄	Imagine *Mother Teresa* giving a group of youngsters a valuable lesson: a *candle* is# noiseless#, yet it produces immense light. Likewise we can do great good in the world without making a lot of noise along the way.\<br></br>For your #state of mind# to be in repose and# noiseless# hold a #candle# in front of your mouth and concentrate on the flame being still.\<br></br>Your *state of mind* gradually becomes# noiseless# as you stare into the sparkle of the *candle* and calm down.\<br></br>In terms of focus, a substitute for #noiseless# is to focus your *state of mind* on a *candle*.\<br></br>I meditate by# noiseless#ly focusing only on the light of a candle, to perfect and purify my state of mind.\<br></br>It's# noiseless# as you blow out the CANDLE and your STATE OF MIND calms.\<br></br>Being# noiseless# is the *state of mind* you need to have when you are working late at night by *candle*. You don't want to disturb anyone else, do you?
恍	Imagine that# All of a sudden#, even though it’s the middle of the night, a *ray* of light falls from the sky and falls on *Mother Teresa*, causing everyone to ooh and ahh.\<br></br>A bad rhyme helps here: Your *mind*,# all of a sudden# // with #rays# has been floodin'. Also, be VERY careful not to confuse this character with the following: suddenly 816 忽, abruptly 997 突, immediately 1087 即, all at once 1741.\<br></br>#All of a sudden#, *Data* pulls out his *ray*-gun and takes a shot at another crew member. He looks confused though, and then apologizes for the circuitry misfire that happened# all of a sudden#.\<br></br>Androids have many useful functions, but they may# all of a sudden# shoot beams of light from all over.\<br></br>You are in a relaxed STATE OF MIND and# all of a sudden# RAYS of light enter the room and your alarm goes off. It's time to wake up!
惰	I'm in such an# indolent# *state of mind*, I don't want to do anything. All my paperwork, which is piling up on the *left* of my desk, is *left* for next *month*.\<br></br>(I'm using the keyword *fleshlight* to represent the 左+月 primitive, because it's like an I-beam that you keep at your side to be used ON your meat. Also, it feels like using your left hand.) When you are #indolent#, you are too lazy to have sex. Your *state of mind* just wants a session with the *fleshlight*.\<br></br>*Data* is being so# indolent# (lazy) today that he's only using the *left* side of his *body* - the other half is switched off!\<br></br>Being# indolent# is to be in a *state 0f mind* where the entire *left* side (the hard working side) of your *flesh* is lazy.\<br></br>An anti-poverty activist is in an# indolent# *state of mind* because, he says, the Americans spent billions of dollars to go to the *moon* with nothing *left* to help the poor around them.\<br></br>My evil clone's (from "as you wish") state of mind is to be# indolent#... he definitely doesn't make my life any easier...\<br></br>When in a# indolent# (lazy) STATE OF MIND, the things you need to do are LEFT for next MONTH.

恢	Imagine *Mother Teresa* standing before an# immense# pile of cigarette *ashes* and thus becoming very concerned about India’s public health.\<br></br>In the pursuit of an #immense# intellect, he took an #immense# amount of smart drugs. In the end, it has the opposite effect and reduced his *state of mind* to *ash*.\<br></br>#I think that # the suffering experienced at Pompei under that mountain of #ash# was# immense#.\<br></br>The android runs on some kind of combustion engine... since its computation skills are very powerful, it creates an# immense# pile of ashes wherever it goes...\<br></br>His STATE OF MIND was# immense# despair when he discovered his home had been reduced to ASHES.
恆	*Data* doesn't have to sleep, so he is on# permanent# standby from *sunrise to sunset*, and *sunset to sunrise*.\<br></br>When something is #permanent#, it becomes your *state of mind* forever, *spanning* all of time. (Note: I believe that Heisig is wrong, and the traditional version of this character in common use is actually 恆. In that case, my story becomes: when you marry someone, you go in with the *state of mind* that it will be #permanent#, and you will #mutually# be together (互) every #day# (日).).\<br></br>My STATE OF MIND is never# permanent#, it changes like SUNRISE and SUNSET.\<br></br>Imagine *Mother Teresa* saying, “from *sunrise* to *sunset*, God should have a# permanent# presence in your life.”.
慕	When you secretly# admire# someone, you can take that secret with you to the *graveyard*, or send that person a *valentine*'s card.\<br></br>You have to# admire# the novelty when the mayor decided a start a *valentine* event at the local *graveyard* to bring in tourists. Unfortunately, he forgot that he had add mire (quagmire) to the *graveyard* last year. During the event, many couples were forever united together...underground.\<br></br>You get a really creepy letter on Valentine's Day. "I will love you even to the grave... From your secret# admire#r." Yep, you definitely hope this person will only# admire# you from afar...\<br></br>Imagine a tragic story: you greatly# admire# someone and want to marry them, so you send them a *valentine*. But then it’s sent back to you, with the news that the person has died and is now in a *graveyard*.\<br></br>Even in death, those that are truly #admired# are visited at the *graveyard* and given *valentines*.\<br></br>My people# admire# Elvis Presley as they come to the GRAVEYARD at Graceland to leave him VALENTINES.
恰	#Just right# is the STATE OF MIND where everything seems to just FIT.\<br></br>Goldilocks reaches a blissful state of mind when she eats the porridge that's# just right#, or sleeps in the bed that is# just right# and fits her small frame perfectly.\<br></br>*Data* tries on different skin-tight uniforms until he finds one that *fits* perfectly. "This one sir, it's #just right#".
惶	You know how intense fear can turn your hair white? The #emperor#'s *state of mind* is so #fearful# that it explains why white is a part of the character for emperor.\<br></br>The servants are# fearful# for their lives when the see the EMPEROR in a bad STATE OF MIND.\<br></br>The good #emperor# should always be in a# fearful# #state of mind# for the security and welfare of his people .\<br></br>The greedy *emperor* of a poor country is very# fearful# today, because he hears that *Mother Teresa* is visiting, and she is sure to call him out on the mismanagement of the country’s finances.\<br></br>A Chinese emperor would be# fearful# of androids, a dangerous Western technology.
愉	A serial killer is #overjoyed# when his *state of mind* is a #slaughterhouse#.\<br></br>At the *meeting of the butchers*, *Data* introduces himself with a terrible joke - "Hi, I'm# overjoyed# to MEAT you all!" (thanks to nest0r).\<br></br>#Overjoyed# is the animal's STATE OF MIND when it is not chosen for the SLAUGHTERHOUSE.
愈	The plight of cows at certain *slaughterhouses* weighs# more and more# on your heart until you decide not to eat any more beef.\<br></br>#More and more# people are having HEART attacks from eating too much beef from SLAUGHTERHOUSES.\<br></br>The butcher at the slaughterhouse is crazy; he loves to chop up hearts, screaming "MORE AND MORE! WAHAHAHA.".\<br></br>With the increase in popularity of offal, *slaughterhouses* are serving up #more and more# #heart#.
惑	A guy comes up behind you in a dark alley, "Give me your *heart or else*!" I think anyone would# be bewildered# at what the hell this guy is trying to pull. (alternate: Your response, "I'm sorry sir, but I'm (stuttering) #be-be-bewildered# by how to do so.".\<br></br>Someone of critical importance needs a heart transplant, and you are a match. You are bewildered: do you do nothing #or# give your #heart#?\<br></br>Do I choose to give my heart to this person or that person? I am bewildered because love is so difficult~~.\<br></br>I would# be bewildered# if they had to make a choice for me *or* the *heart* of another.\<br></br>Anyone would# be bewildered# and HEART-broken if they caught there significant other at a FIESTA on the FLOOR locking MOUTHS with another person.
怔	My STATE OF MIND before my final exams is# terror-stricken#. What if I don't get all the CORRECT answers?!\<br></br>Before the emotion chip, *Data* made ethically fraught decisions with relative ease. Now, though, he often finds himself# terror-stricken#: "What if my intended course of action is not the *correct* one?".\<br></br>Imagine that India becomes# terror-stricken# after a series of terrorist attacks, and that they call in *Mother Teresa* to help *correct* the situation.\<br></br>Some people are afraid of dying and such, but I am always most# terror-stricken# of tests; my state of mind is# terror-stricken# when thinking of what's correct.
怖	*Data* is trying to understand what it's like for a child to# be scared of# something, so he's hiding under a *cloth* blanket. Another cadet walks in and mockingly plays along, "There, there *Data*, there's nothing to# be scared of#.".\<br></br>Whenever I was #scared of# anything as a child, my *state of mind* was convinced that #cloth# could protect me, and hiding under blankets would keep me 100% safe.\<br></br>No one is scared of *Data* wearing a big *cloth*, pretending to be a ghost. He's trying to be human and got it wrong again!\<br></br>*Bullfighter* : "The bull has an odd #state of mind# - to# be scared of# a piece of red #cloth# - how can that be threatening ? ".\<br></br>A family# be scared of# what seems to be a ghost. They call in the Ghostbusters, who demonstrate that it was merely a guy in a *cloth*. The family says to them, ‘you’re like *Mother Teresa*! Thank you!”.\<br></br>Kids in big cloth try to be scary, dressing up as ghosts. "Woooooo,# be scared of# me!" Just the way they say it is kind of cute.\<br></br>Your *state of mind* when men in *cloth* sheets are approaching (think KKK): it's #dreadful#, so certainly it's something to #be scared of#.\<br></br>Your STATE OF MIND when you realize it's just a man wearing a CLOTH sheet and not a ghost is there is nothing to# be scared of#.
添	This character explains the stupidity of breast# augment#ation in women, and possibly penile# augment#ation in men: you fill yourself up with a *water*-like liquid, ensuring that you will #die young# but receive more *valentines*.\<br></br>The US was #augmented# by the #annexation# of Hawai'i. Hawai'i makes a great place to go on vacation. It's got lots of *water*... just a *heavenly* place to bring your *valentine*.\<br></br>When playing an# augment#ed reality game, you can make the world however you want? Imagine a heaven or a watery oasis where you can spend all your time with your valentine.\<br></br>After the long famine, WATER falls from the HEAVENS which served to# augment# (make greater) the failing crops and lift the HEARTS of the people.
悔	*Data* just cracked his first *Yo' momma* joke! Perhaps he should# be sorry about# it, but it has actually become his new guilty pleasure!\<br></br>then you know that horribly guilty, disgusted *state of mind* you experience when waking up from a dream about *lying down* on your #mother#? There's little most people #be sorry about# more.\<br></br>*Mother Teresa* has nothing to# be sorry about# -- *every* day she is doing good work.\<br></br>You know those people who always say sorry? They'd# be sorry about# everything; it's a sorry state of mind...\<br></br>The *state of mind* of *every* Christian on their deathbed is to #repent# -- or #be sorry about# their sins.\<br></br>After finishing anger management, my STATE OF MIND is to# be sorry about# what I said to EVERY person I was mean to.
慌	When you're# nervous# about something, say a big company presentation, your state of mind is a wasteland and you start to imagine ridiculous scenarios. Maybe you'll mess up and lose your job and go broke and have to live on the street and get arrested for vagrancy and finally be forced to escape the city and live in a desolate wasteland...\<br></br>#Nervous# is your STATE OF MIND when you enter into the WASTELAND. You don't know what's out there.\<br></br>The Who are very# nervous# about meeting *Mother Teresa* -- they’re not sure if she will like their song, ‘Teenage *Wasteland*.’.\<br></br>As someone with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, I know that when I am at my most #nervous#, my *state of mind* becomes a desolate #wasteland#, in that I am dysfunctional and unable to remember anything.\<br></br>To be #nervous# is to be in a #disconcerted# *state of mind* -- that is, when your thoughts, which ordinarily resonate in concert with oneanother, are *laid waste* by the emotions of# nervous#ness. Think of your thoughts as the flowers, and the# nervous#ness as the flood which perishes your state of mind.
悅	Devilishly #delighted# is how both you and the *devil* feel as you let your *state of mind* succumb to the *devil*. I mean, everything that makes our *state of mind* feel #delighted# is associated with the *devil*, right?\<br></br>*Mother Teresa* is# delighted# to hear that a priest from India successfully exorcised the *devil* out of an Indian child.\<br></br>A stranger says "delighted to meet you," but behind that suave exterior, he probably has a devilish state of mind... after all, no normal person says stuff like that nowadays...\<br></br>The *devil* is most #delighted# when he can manipulate your *state of mind*. Ironically, he normally makes your feel #delighted#. (Think of doing/thinking naughty things.).
憎	*Mother Teresa* does not# loathe# those who *formerly* did wrong; she forgives them.\<br></br>Lore, *formerly* Dr. Soong's favorite child,# loathe#s *Data* for taking his place.\<br></br>#LOATHE#. Data# LOATHE#S The Artist formerly known as Prince because his music doesn't make any sense.\<br></br>I like to associate 曾 with politicians, especially former politicians. To #loathe# is a *state of mind* that tends to #increase#, especially when it is directed towards a *former politician*.\<br></br>Loathing is the one state of mind that continuously increases; you# loathe# and you'll# loathe# more.\<br></br>#Loathing# and #hating# is my *state of mind* whenever I see *Bill Clinton*.\<br></br>#Loathe# is the STATE OF MIND that INCREASES the more you're around a who person annoys you.
忌	The SNAKE due to its reputation is# shun#ned by everyone leaving it HEART-broken.\<br></br>I# shun# the thought of eating a *snake heart*.\<br></br>A little garden *snake* is after your *heart*, but knowing he’s up to no good, you quickly# shun# him and walk away.\<br></br>This bizarre species of *snake* will happily eat anything, but for some strange reason, will actively #shun# the #heart#, spitting it out.\<br></br>People in #mourning# generally #shun# light-clothes (and light itself). This is because they have a *snake* wrapped tightly around their *heart*.
惟	The usual *state of mind* of a *turkey* is# thinking# about where he can gobble up his next meal.\<br></br>When *Data* does too much# thinking# his brain overeats and he starts walking around flapping his arms and gobbling, like a *turkey*.\<br></br>The Thinker is the famous statue of a man# thinking#-- his state of mind is that he's so lost in thought that he doesn't notice when a chicken is perched atop his statue...\<br></br>*Turkeys* are generally considered to be dumb as crap. Here, however, we have a special super-aware Sage *Turkey* with his very own *state of mind*, who is very clearly capable of *thinking*.\<br></br>#Thinking# and #pondering# are the past-times of the *Old Turkey*. He is often in a pondering *state-of-mind*.\<br></br>The TURKEY'S STATE OF MIND is# thinking# of a way to get away before supper.
懼	*Mother Teresa* happens not to# be frightened# when a *turkey* suddenly confronts her in the streets of Calcutta. Undeterred, she stares him down *eyeball* to *eyeball* (hence the two eyeballs) until it walks away. To remember this one, connect the ‘eye’ sound in frightened to the two *eyeballs*. There are a lot of keywords like this – fearful, fear, be scared of, etc.\<br></br>Simplified [惧] - *to my mind* it's ever since seeing the *Texas Chainsaw Massacre* that it's terribly easy for me to# be frightened# by power#tools#.\<br></br>The *state of mind* of the *turkey*, with #eyes# so big they're like dinner plates literally popping out of his head, is to #be frightened# when he sees the farmer coming, wondering if it's his turn.\<br></br>An android chicken whose two eyes are floating above the actual body screams out "BE FRIGHTENED!# BE FRIGHTENED#!" I am...\<br></br>My philosophy teacher used to try to #disquiet# us students using a disquet-o-matic, which is, of course, a mechanical *turkey* with two huge glowing *eyes* sticking out from its head which stir your deepest *state-of-mind*. Why would you not #be frightened#?
患	Do you have #troubles#? Are they# troubles# with the heart? Maybe you are #afflicted# with a *shish kebab* skewer through the *heart*. Ouch.\<br></br>Eat too many SHISH KEBABS and your HEART will have# troubles#.\<br></br>#Heart# troubles## are caused by high cholesterol in particular, such as would arise by subsisting exclusively on *shish kebabs*.
惹	A group of youngsters try to# provoke# their father into taking them to *Disneyland* by spending the whole day saying, “don’t you have a *heart*, Daddy?”.\<br></br>Your love for your sweetheart# provoke#s you into presenting to her a bunch of #flowers# with your #right# hand and placing your left hand on your #heart# and saying "How about it,then?".\<br></br>A fun way to #provoke# someone is to get their #heart# set on going to #Disneyland#, and then cancelling!\<br></br>The *young* always #attract# the *heart*, but they can also #provoke# you to illegal activity.\<br></br>If you want to# provoke# him, just remind him of the time he bought flowers for his love at Disney Land, but she broke his heart.\<br></br>The YOUNG boy decides to# provoke# the bee hive and here he is HEART racing fleeing for his life.
恩	What is a greater statement of #kindness# and #grace# than to let a trapped *St. Bernhard* out of the *pen* and into your *heart*?\<br></br>The PETA might define# kindness# as opening your *heart* and taking a shelter animal out of the *dog kennel*.
憶	Total# recall# was a movie about altering your *state of mind* by planting a fake *idea* into it.\<br></br>*Data* can #recall# every *idea* he's ever had, back to when he was created, because he has a perfect memory. you could almost say that he has total# recall#..\<br></br>#RECALL#. Data stresses to the crew that they must# RECALL# the Prime Directive, the guiding idea behind Federation.\<br></br>Simplified [ 忆 ] : *To my mind* it is easy to# recall# a pop song if it has a #hook# ; although people in Taiwan say that to their *minds* they can# recall# traditional music if the #sound# moves ones #heart#.\<br></br>(Recall as in to remember, not as in to take back a dangerous product.) Imagine that *Mother Teresa* stresses to her order that they must# recall# every day the original *idea* of their mission – e.g., service to the poor.\<br></br>As a researcher, due to the fact that I suck at #recall#, I feel deep concern that my *state of mind* may never be able to generate #ideas#. Alternatively, the very act of #recall#, by definition, involves bringing #ideas# back to your *state of mind$.\<br></br>To #recall# or #recollect# is when an *idea* comes back into your *state-of-mind*. Think of a light-bulb in your brain turning on (again).\<br></br>In order to# recall# something, it's important to put yourself in the *state of mind* you had when you first had the *idea*.\<br></br>#Recall# is your STATE OF MIND when an IDEA resurfaces in your mind.
媳	A #daughter-in-law# is what the French call a belle-fille (lit. 'beautiful girl'). So, it's a *woman* so beautiful she takes your *breath* away.\<br></br>Sure, you very much like the *woman* who is your# daughter-in-law# . . . but her *breath* is absolutely terrible! Does she know what mouthwash is? (Actually, does she know what toothpaste is?).\<br></br>If your mother gets desperate for a #daughter-in-law#, this character may well summarize her more-than-relaxed requirements: a #woman# who can #breathe#. Everything else is optional at this point.\<br></br>A woman will pick on their# daughter-in-law#, since that's sort of the girl who stole her baby away. This woman criticizes everything the# daughter-in-law# does, even if it's just breathing!\<br></br>Meeting his future# daughter-in-law#, the man could see why this WOMAN took his son's BREATH away.
熄	In one BREATH, Superman can# put out# a FIRE.\<br></br>The entire theory of fire extinguishing rides on the fact that to #put out# a #fire#, you need to extinguish its source of oxygen, that is deprive it of its #breath#.\<br></br>How do you #put out# a candle? Why you blow on the *fire* with your *breath*. This applies to electric lights too, but normally we don't blow on them... unless you have rigged a breathalyzer into your Tap-Light.
瑟	Playing the# Chinese harp# for 2 KINGS is CERTAINLY an honor.\<br></br>A# Chinese harp# is considered a royal instrument. It is *certainly* found in the royal courts: one *king* can *certainly* play it himself, the other *king* *certainly* wants to hear# Chinese harp# concerts all the time.\<br></br>The local holiday# Chinese harp# concert at your community center is *certainly* an interesting occasion. Here is the musician playing “We *two kings* of Orient are . . . “.\<br></br>The beauty of the #Chinese harp# is able to enthrall #kings# and *break* their #hearts# (必).\<br></br>The #Chinese harp# is a many-stringed citar played with both hands using *two jade balls*. The study of the 瑟 was a *necessary* subject in classical Chinese schools.
泌	When you *slash a* #heart#, it invariably #secretes# a *liquid*.\<br></br>You are *certainly* bound to# secrete# *water* from your armpits on a hot day (or on a hot date) unless you use deodorant.\<br></br>The *slashed heart* #secretes# a *watery* fluid.\<br></br>When WATER if left in a container with a small opening it will CERTAINLY# secrete# out.
蜜	Your *house* will *certainly* become littered with *insects* if you smear# honey# all over it – so why not use it for food, rather than decoration?\<br></br>NOTE: 宓 (mì) is a character meaning "still, silent, quiet". Here we have a species of magical bee *insect* that makes #honey# out pure silence.\<br></br>The bees are the *insects* who keep their #honey# in the secret house on the mountain. (Recall 密, the secret house in the mountains where you keep your broken heart.).\<br></br>Leaving# honey# jar open in the HOUSE will CERTAINLY attract INSECTS.
摩	Imagine someone who is smoking pot when they see police lights. They immediately try to# rub# all of the *hemp* off of their *hands*.\<br></br>As a moisturizer, you# rub# the *hemp* oil on your #hands#. (You can even do this instead of grinding it with your stone a la 磨 for great skin {<a href="/study/kanji/1752">grind</a> <span class="index">(#1752)</span>}.).
蛾	The# moth# is truly a *miser* of an *insect*. He eats up all of your bread and cereal, leaving you with nothing and making him a very, very fat# moth#.\<br></br>The #moth# is the *insect* *I* hate the most (all flappy and evil looking).\<br></br>If #I# was an #insect I# would be a# moth# - a gorgeous creature of the night attracted to the bright lights.\<br></br>The# moth# is an *insect* that is very *egocentric*. Instead of buying its own clothes, it eats yours!\<br></br>The #moth# is an *insect* revered by *Freud*, as it represents the vagina.\<br></br>The MISER# moth# is an INSECT always trying to stay in the lime-light.
扒	It's a well-established fact that you need at least #eight# *fingers* to effectively #pick pockets#.\<br></br>If you're all #fingers# and thumbs then maybe don't# pick pockets# - but if your #eight fingers# are dextrous then *dipping* could be a good career move.\<br></br>In addition to *fingers* and *fish fingers*, I will name the ‘fingers’ primitive *Tokyo,* since it’s the city with the most fingers in the world. I simply find it hard to create stories with merely ‘fingers,’ since it’s a pretty bland and unmemorable image compared to *Tokyo*. Story for 1792: Tokyo is such a safe city that only eight people (out of 35 million)# pick pockets# there.\<br></br>In order to# pick pockets# effectively, your *fingers* need to do *eight* different things at once, distracting and grabbing and patting and stealing.
扣	The guy was talking loudly so I put a FINGER to my MOUTH telling him to "# Button# it!".\<br></br>My girlfriend uses her #fingers# and her #mouth# to undo my# button#s - *how envious are you* #!?!?#.\<br></br>To# button# up your shirt, you need to use your *fingers* to open the small *mouths* (holes) in your shirt and slide the# button#s through.\<br></br>You open your *mouth* wide in your *Tokyo* hotel because you are shocked to see a full 100# button#s in the elevator – it turns out your hotel is huge!\<br></br>To do up a #button#, you need to be agile enough to work your *fingers* around a hole or #mouth#. Note the noun form of this character in 繁體字 is commonly written 釦.
捐	Even if you can't# contribute# any money, perhaps you can give some fish *fingers* to feed the hungry *mouths* in Africa and get them some *flesh* on their bones.\<br></br>Imagine the government of *Tokyo* asking its residents to# contribute# to the elderly, both with their *mouth* (raising awareness and doing advocacy work) and with their *flesh* (organ donations if they die young).\<br></br>We all need to do our part and #contribute# *fingers* to sate the Giant *fleshy* #mouth# that has enslaved us!\<br></br>Some people live a very "hand to mouth" existence; if you would just# contribute# a little to our charity, even that small contribution is like you're giving them the moon!
拍	#Racquet# induced medical conditions such as tennis elbow are well known but #white finger# , a painful vibration induced complaint common among pneumatic drill operators and sex toy practitioners is now becoming the scourge of tennis pro's - hopefully #racquet# development will make #white finger# a less common occurence ....\<br></br>Back in the olden days, before people had the technology to make synthetic wires and string them in a wooden circle, people would simply use their *fingers* to grasp a *white bird* and swing it around madly at the ball. They weren't the best# racquet#s, but they were all they had. This put a whole new twist on the meaning of a birdie.\<br></br>A new law has been passed in *Tokyo*: all tennis# racquet#s must be *white* to match your white tennis clothing.\<br></br>Without a #racquet#, you'd have to use your *fingers* to hit that birdie / *white dove*.\<br></br>A white bird is like the birdie in badminton. You how a birdie in one hand and the# racquet# in the other.\<br></br>The cruel kid's FINGERS gripping the# racquet#, he hits the WHITE DOVE.\<br></br>Dainty HANDS clad in WHITE gloves are golf-CLAPping (RTK1 keyword) after a superior display of# RACQUET#-wielding on the tennis court.
啪	The# clapping sound# of thunder has the same decibels as the grunt from the #mouth# of the #racquet# bearing Maria Sharapova - but then again who's listening, just look at that figure !\<br></br>All of the audience at the Tokyo Dome makes a# clapping sound# when the entertainer swallows an entire *racquet* with his *mouth*.\<br></br>You can make a cool #clapping sound# like "PA" by bouncing your #racquet# off your #mouth#. Alternatively, you need to use your #mouth# to make the #clapping sound# because your *fingers* are #white# with soreness from overclapping.\<br></br>That# clapping sound#, with all the cheering, is making a racket! (pun on racquet of course).\<br></br>When the villain is hit in the MOUTH with a RACQUET you can hear the# clapping sound#s and cheering from the audience.
損	Who# damage#d the copy machine?! The EMPLOYEES point FINGERS at each other to avoid blame.\<br></br>A Japanese *employee* is fired from his job and subsequently #damages# the city of *Tokyo* pretty badly, kicking down traffic lights, throwing rocks at subway cars and tearing down store signs until he’s apprehended by the police. (Just kidding -- no one in Japan would ever do this.).\<br></br>The boss hit the employee with his hand; he had to pay# damage#s...
扛	You grip with your *fingers* an *I-beam*, like a yolk to #carry over the shoulder#.\<br></br>During the rebuilding of *Tokyo* after WWII, I imagine that hundreds of thousands of workers in *Tokyo* #carried over their shoulder# *I-beams*, hence jump-starting the Japanese economic miracle.\<br></br>FINGERS gripping the I-BEAM to carry it over the shoulder.
扎	Careful not to# prick# your FINGER on the FISHHOOK.\<br></br>Imagine that during a visit in *Tokyo*, you fall ill with a toothache, and must spend an entire day at the dentist’s office while the dentist# prick#s at your tooth with a giant *fishhook*.\<br></br>His #prick# was so tiny, it was like wrapping your *fingers* around a *fishhook* while trying to avoid getting a #prick#.
拇	The finger most associated with mothers is the# thumb#-- a baby sucks his# thumb#, and a mother may wear a thimble on her# thumb#.\<br></br>I was born in *Tokyo*, so for this Hanzi, I imagine my *mother*# thumb#ing [granted that’s not the meaning of this keyword] through the pages of a magazine while she waited at a *Tokyo* hospital for her newborn to be ready to go home.\<br></br>Back in the old days // when people were still dumb // the #mother# of all *fingers* // was considered the #thumb#. (My "visual memory" is poor, but my verbal memory is excellent, so I like little rhymes like this sometimes to memorize a character.).\<br></br>Your bossy MOTHER points her FINGER trying to tell you what to do. Being fed up, with your# thumb# you# thumb# your nose at her.
拘	You have been #detained# for giving someone the *finger* and now await your #sentence#.\<br></br>If you give people the FINGER and say mean SENTENCES, the authorities will# detain# you.\<br></br>In *Tokyo* you are# detain#ed at a jail as you await your *sentence* for . . . spitting gum on the sidewalk.
抄	Your *fingers* are only capable of# copy#ing a *few* things, really. Large amounts of text would require machines.\<br></br>Your mission is to be one of the *few* people in *Tokyo* to# copy# down all of the Remembering the Hanzi vocabulary – in one day, in one sitting!\<br></br>If you have to# copy# things by hand, better hope there's very few things...\<br></br>I took the pencil in my FINGERS to# copy# down a FEW notes.
拓	The #pioneers#, upon #pioneering#, need to first upon settling somewhere, use their *fingers* to clear out all the *stones*. What a laborious task!\<br></br>The kung-fu master# pioneer#ed the technique of using your FINGERS to crush STONE.\<br></br>The first person to put a big *stone* on a girls *finger* as an engagement ring was a #pioneer# - now we all do it!\<br></br>The# pioneer# get his *fingers* over the last *rock* which he climbs to enter uncharted lands.\<br></br>Imagine the head of a Scottish Whiskey company# pioneer#ing the introduction of ‘whisky’ into *Tokyo* so that the Japanese too can enjoy a shot on the *rocks*.\<br></br>#Pioneers# need to #clear the land# of *rocks* with their bare-*fingers*.
捏	#Pinch# yourself with your *fingers* as you wake up to see only the *sun* above you, *soil* underneath and nothing else.\<br></br>#Pinch# as in# pinch#-zoom. Google products on smartphones let people# pinch#-zoom to get a detailed view of Earth (ground) and the solar system (sun).\<br></br>When #kneeding# bread dough it's important to #pinch# the dough with your *fingers* to get out the chunks of *dirt*, and then let it dry under the *sun* for a whole afternoon.\<br></br>You sometimes# pinch# yourself if you think you’re dreaming. Here a resident from *Tokyo* dreams that his house (in the heart of a city) has huge *sun*-lit rooms and a giant *soil*-filled yard. So he# pinch#es himself – and unfortunately, yes, he was dreaming.\<br></br>If you use your *fingers* to #pinch# everyone you meet in a #day#, they will be covered in *dirt*.\<br></br>When I go to a new land, I like to take a# pinch# of the sun-warmed soil-- it's a very romantic image.
撓	*Pigpen* is a dirty, dirty boy. Consequently he gets very itchy. When he really wants to #scratch#, he takes his *fingers* and #chafes# his skin a few times. -- Also, to get people to #yield# to his desires, *Pigpen* scratches behind their ears a few times and their wills #sag#.\<br></br>Your *fingers* get all #chafe#-ed when building a *scarecrow*. imagine poking all that scratchy straw into his body through small holes, and your fingers becoming red-raw.\<br></br>Simplified : [挠] - For #javelin throwers#, the cord on the javelin grip and the throwers #fingers# placement determine the amount of# chafe# .# Chafe# is inevitable - although #finger# care can alleviate most discomfort.\<br></br>*Pigpen* is driving in *Tokyo* but doesn’t realize that he’s on the wrong side of the road (they drive on the left there, not the right). So he# chafe#s against all the cars until the police apprehend him.
抹	See the clown burnt out with his job# smear on# his make-up with FINGERS grumbling, "I hope this is the LAST time I have to put this crap on.".\<br></br>You take a trip to *Tokyo*, but it turns out to be so hot that you have to# smear on# sunscreen 24/7. You mutter to yourself, ‘this will be the *last* time I ever visit!” (Hopefully not.).\<br></br>Put your *fingers* to use and #smear on# some of that soothing lotion on the tree on its #last# legs to bring it some relief.
描	It's hard to# describe# something like a TOMATO SEEDLING with just you FINGERS. It's just too small.\<br></br>There's a meditation exercise where you take a small food item--let's say a tomato seedling-- and hold it in your fingers, taste it, experience it with all your senses,# describe# it.\<br></br>In *Tokyo* you spend an entire hour trying to# describe# to your Japanese friend what a *tomato seedling* is (it’s on the menu at an American restaurant there). After 60 minutes of “uhs,” “ers” and *umms*, you finally give up.\<br></br>You know the story of the blind men and the elephant and how they all couldn't find a common way to #describe#it because it was so large? Here we have the reverse scenario: a #seedling#, which is so small that just using our *fingers* to feel it, we also can't come up with a common way to #describe# it.\<br></br>An old farmer is trying to# describe# life and living to his young children. He finds in his *fingers* a *tomato seedling* he recently picked from the garden. He then uses this example to# describe# growth, change, and eventually death to his curious family.
摸	At the GRAVEYARD, perverted zombies FINGERS rise from the graves to# grope# unsuspecting women.\<br></br>You find yourself in a *Tokyo* *graveyard* -- you’re not sure how you got there. Because it’s pitch dark the only way out is to# grope# with your fingers around the gravestones for an exit. Super creepy!\<br></br>Perverted #grope#rs love the *graveyard* because no one there can say no to their *fingers*.
挑	When you# foment#, you stir up trouble or nitpick. Here, we have that silly image of someone waving around their index *finger* in a very condescending, judgmental way as they# foment#, which is clearly a #portent# that a fight will ensue.\<br></br>This evil palm-reader with her FINGERS actually# foment#s (promotes) bad PORTENTS rather than just read them.\<br></br>Back in the old days, the French used to stick their finger up at the British to portend them chopping their long bow (and arrow) finger off if they were captured.. It always# foment#ed (incited) violence before a battle.\<br></br>Imagine that, in *Tokyo* in 1989 an old stock adviser says that a *portent* of a stock market crash has appeared. The authorities accuse him of# foment#ing unrest and riots in the financial district.\<br></br>The Chinese system of writing was able to# foment# because old witch doctors would hold cracked bones in their *fingers* assigning to these different cracks various *portents* that would later become the basis for a system of writing.
拴	Using my FINGERS, I# tether#ed (tied) the huge animal to the pole, but it tore the WHOLE thing down.\<br></br>I've been looking for fish *fingers* the *whole* day and looking around the *whole* city. I'm really at the end of my# tether#!\<br></br>Imagine the *whole* of the universe being# tether#ed together by God's *fingers*.\<br></br>In *Tokyo* a man# tether#s himself to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in preparation to climb up the *whole* structure.\<br></br>My dog is so annoying and constantly chews on his *fingers* when he is bored, so I# tether#ed each finger #whole#-ly to the umbrella-pillar.
拾	I tried to# tidy up# the house, but my FINGERS couldn't FIT in some of the tight areas.\<br></br>Use your *finger* to# tidy up# a place, the result is that everything looks like where they should belong and *fits* the environment perfectly.\<br></br>Imagine that Japan launches a ‘Tidy up *Tokyo*’ competition to see who can *fit* the most litter in a trash can. Perhaps it could even become a Japanese game show.\<br></br>as it were.\<br></br>When #tidying up# a room, a typical thing you need to #pick up# is an old, chipped, seldom-used bowling ball. Your excuse: "I tried to #pick it up#, but my *fingers* didn't *fit* in the holes.
搭	To# put up# the pagoda (塔) requires using your *fingers* to carefully make all the *flowers* #fit#.\<br></br>#Put up# or shut up! Either enroll in the *flower fitting* (flower arrangement) class where you also# put up# flower structures, or shut up about how much you love Eastern cultures.\<br></br>On your trip to *Tokyo*, you tell the receptionist that the nice *flowers* you got for your spouse don’t quite *fit* in your tiny hotel room. She tells you to “put up or shut up.” (Just kidding – no one in Tokyo would ever be that rude!).\<br></br>You have to# put up# a pagoda by hand because machines are forbidden when putting up such a work of art of a building.\<br></br>Whenever I #put up# a structure, whether it be a tent or a small shed, I throw a party. We celebrate the hard work that our *fingers* have done in the putting up by trowing leis made of *flowers the fit neatly together* around eachother's necks. -- Now, this is quite similar to the lei placed on you when you get a *hand* in #boarding# a boat.\<br></br>My *fingers* have been trying to# put up# these *flowers* all day. Unfortunately, I can't find anywhere in my home where they seem to *fit*.
掠	It's terrible, but think rape and #pillage#. The *capital* has been raided, and the women are all being forcibly *fingered*. (credit: aircawn of koohii's rtk).\<br></br>I have trouble keeping "pillage" and "plunder" straight, so I just remember: a general points out into the distance with his finger and yells, "Pillage the village!" Of course, better than pillaging a small village would be to# pillage# a capital city, so let's# pillage# that!\<br></br>FINGER pointing to the CAPITAL, the general order the troops to# pillage# it, taking all they could carry and burn it to the ground.\<br></br>On your trip to *Tokyo,* you get in a talk with a Japanese guy who says that U.S. soldiers #pillaged# the *capitol building* of *Tokyo*, looting and destroying it, in 1945. You ask him what his source is.
捨	How creepy! Who knows the true story of what transpired here? All we know is that the owners of the #abode# #abandoned# it so quickly that they even left their *fingers* behind...\<br></br>What is# abandon#ed is left in a specific *abode*, those that are left there have only their *fingers* to help them escape (do hard labor).\<br></br>A group of Buddhist monks# abandon#s their monastery in *Tokyo* because of the noise, and moves to a quieter *abode* in New Mexico.\<br></br>Sometimes people# abandon# babies at the doorstep of some abode, although today someone# abandon#ed a severed hand-- gross!\<br></br>I prefer the keyword #discard#. Think of a late-night cardgame going on in your neighbor's (possibly #abandoned#) *cottage*. You take the card that you wish to #discard#, and you slowly and emphatically place it on the discard pile using your *fingers*.
拭	That annoying graffiti artist left his #"style"# all over your property. #Wipe it away# with your *fingers* while giving him the *finger*!\<br></br>There's a new style of painting called reverse-*finger-style*. basically you cover the paper in paint, then *wipe away* the paint with your finger to make your image.\<br></br>Some believe that when the real estate bust #wiped away# a lot of *Tokyo*’s wealth in the early 1990s, *Tokyo* (esp. Ginza) also lost a lot of its *style*.\<br></br>Picking your nose with a finger is super gross; the stylish way to do something like that is to# wipe away# your boogers.\<br></br>Think of tissues with *stylish arrow patterns*. It's a great way to #wipe away# tears with your *fingers* in *style*. Commonly seen in 拭淚 shi4lei4, and 拭目以待 'wait and see'.\<br></br>Using Kleenex, I wipe my nose with my FINGER STYLE.
扯	With you FINGERS, you# yank# the chain of the animal making it STOP.\<br></br>*STOP* #yank#-ing my *finger*!! it hurts and it;ll make me cut the cheese.\<br></br>Protestors# yank# away blueprints for an expansion of *Tokyo* Narita International Airport because they say that Narita’s *footprint* should not be increased whatsoever.\<br></br>#Yank# with your *fingers* on the reigns to make the ox *halt*.
拖	The *scorpion* has poisoned you so you are *laying down*, and now it is #dragging# you along by your *fingers*.\<br></br>A *scorpion* stung you on the *finger*, so now you're *reclining* on the ground, trying to #drag# yourself to hospital.\<br></br>A murder in *Tokyo*. A team of assassins poisoned someone with a *scorpion*, then# drag#ged his *reclining* body away to Kyoto. The police are investigating.\<br></br>#Dragging# a *scorpion* across the ground with your *fingers* in plain violation of the *half-banner* over-head saying "Don't# Drag# Scorpions (especially if they are *laying down*)".
揚	Those that #publicize# are usually the greedy pricks that want to get their grubby little *fingers* inside everyone's *piggy banks*, so that what little they give you in return for their "services" won't even fill a *piggy bank*!\<br></br>You don't want to# publicize# having a PIGGY BANK because everyone will want to get their little greedy FINGERS on it.\<br></br>The publishers gleefully tenting their *fingers* as their *piggy banks* grow by #publicizing# the corrupt *piggy banks* of others.\<br></br>In *Tokyo*, it is considered extremely rude to# publicize# the size of your *piggy bank*. But imagine an ex-pat violates this taboo by putting a huge billboard on the side of a building with a picture of his fat pink piggy bank.\<br></br>#Publicizing# a company involves signing documents with your *fingers* that promise to fill the *piggy bank* of the company. -- On a Japanese pirate ship, you instead #hoist# the sails with your *fingers* (putting them to good use), with a big yellow *piggy bank* painted on the mainsail instead of the traditional skull and cross-bones.
搞	Due to Paris' romantic reputation and the rather phallic nature of the *Eiffel tower*, *fingers* sometimes #engage in# things they shouldn't up there...\<br></br>#Engage in# the Guinness world record attempt to have the most people simultaneously make the *Eiffel Tower* shape with their *fingers*.\<br></br>Imagine that, at the U.N., the leaders of France and Japan# engage in# a fight about whether the *Tokyo* Tower or the *Eiffel Tower* is more beautiful. Switzerland has to break it up.\<br></br>You might sarcastically tell your extraordinarily *tall*, lanky, and awkward friend that they are 搞笑 gao3xiao4 'funny' when they tell a bad joke. You take your *fingers* and slap them hard on the cheek for #engaging in# such nonsensical humor.\<br></br>To# engage in# height discrimination is to point FINGERS making fun of TALL people.
撞	JUVENILES are so rude nowadays. If you# bump into# them mistakenly they are likely to give you a mean look and the FINGER.\<br></br>Imagine a team of *juvenile* bicyclists racing down the streets of *Tokyo*, bumping into more cars than you can count.\<br></br>If you #bump into# the *fingers* of *juveniles*, you may end up missing your wallet or something else of importance...
摘	His *fingers* magically knew, like a dousing rod, how to #handpick# the best *antiques*.\<br></br>An expensive *Tokyo* restaurant# handpick#s the extremely expensive *antiques* to display inside each night, sometimes after consulting diners for their preferences. [But see Heisig's usage note -- my story may not convey the proper usage of this character.].\<br></br>The best *antiques* are those that are #handpicked# by your own *fingers* in the antique shop.\<br></br>With her FINGER, she# handpick#ed the ANTIQUE herself.
捆	Many serial killers realized that if they could #lash together# the *fingers* of their victims, the victims would be #trapped#.\<br></br>*Tokyo’s* firefighters# lash together# a long string of blankets to free those *trapped* in an elevator. (They’ll use it to pull the elevator to safety – they won’t ask people to climb it themselves!).\<br></br>Now the poor *tree* is really in a 困難：he is *pent in* and is being #lashed together# with other trees by the *fingers* of Saruman to make firewood.\<br></br>WOOD# lash together# with your FINGERS keeps it all PENT IN place.
撼	When you play Jenga, if your *fingers* #joggle# that tower, #everyone# can feel their #heart# skip a beat!\<br></br>To# joggle# is is to shake slightly but your FINGERS can still FEEL it.\<br></br>The word# joggle# has a new English meaning: to juggle while jogging. Although it has nothing to do with the Chinese meaning of the character: imagine yourself in *Tokyo* when you see an advertisement for a #joggle#-ing competition. The lovable Engrish motto is: “*Feel* excite! *Tokyo*# joggle# championship 2013.”.\<br></br>Normally used as han4 in 撼動 han4dong4. This is like when a cannon blast is so powerful that it #joggles# your very *emotions*, as if you were shaken by an invisible *hand*.
擾	Simplified [ 扰 ] : Superman prods #Superdog# with his #finger# - “Wake up you idle mutt !!"...He keeps prodding with his #finger# until #Superdog# opens his eyes. “WAKEY,WAKEY – now go get me my carpet slippers !!..."..#Superdog# leaves, muttering...." who needs this# harass#ment first thing in the morning? ".\<br></br>During the real estate bust many in *Tokyo* were *worried* about their finances, and they #harassed# their financial advisors, asking if everything was going to be lost.\<br></br>I use the primitive *squirm* for 憂 to capture that image of squirming with worry, so here we get the idea of #harassing# someone by poking them until they *squirm*, like might be the case with a ticklish person.\<br></br>Leave *melancholy Hamlet* alone -- don't #harass# him by poking him with your *fingers* as you try to distribute some religious flyer. He doesn't care.
擅	I am using *Dexter* (as in Dexter Morgan) as a keyword for 亶 (dǎn, which, also note, means *sincere*) instead of Mr. Hyde because it works: come daybreak, he returns to civility in a similar fashion. *Dexter* has his own personal code and is so cautious, and thus only time he would kill with his own *fingers* (as opposed to using a knife) would be when he #acts without authority#.\<br></br>*Mr. Hyde* was arrested by police for #acting without authority# in *Tokyo* -- he was breaking through walls, robbing banks and basically scaring people out of their minds.\<br></br>When *Abe Lincoln* declared the Civil War by *signing with his fingers* some Proclaimation, he #acted without the authority# of the people.\<br></br>MR. HYDE will often# act without authority# and give the FINGER to anyone who objects to it.
壇	Simplified 坛# Altar# = *soil*, *clouds*. Story: An# altar# is the metaphysical junction of *soil* (earth) and *clouds* (heavens) for religious persons.\<br></br>*Mr. Hyde* is taken to the# altar# by the British Government during his court trial. He can repent then and there and be saved, but if he doesn’t, he will be executed and thrown into the *soil*. A tough policy, one that the church leaders disagree with.\<br></br>This character requires extra care for me, because I've always thought of 豊 and 禮 as being related to# altar#s. *Dexter* seeks out the *dirt* of humanity and slays them on an #altar#. (Note that it is the only *dirt* on his otherwise pristine #altar#.).\<br></br>When *Abe Lincoln* gave the famous Gettysburg address, he did so at an #alter# instead of a #podium#. It was in the middle of a field, in the *dirt*. It was *daybreak* on the day after the battle. He had to start several *times* because he messed up the first line. And of course, he was wearing his *tophat*.
顫	Dr. Jekyll's HEAD starts to# tremble# wildly right before he transforms back into the evil MR.

莽	Here’s an example of someone being very# rude#: they are offered a bouquet of *flowers*, but they say, “I want a *chihuahua* instead!” and throw it down with their *two hands*.\<br></br>Two hands and a chihuahua just makes me think of Paris Hilton holding her dog in her purse. Someone disses her and she's like "UGH!# RUDE#!" so she finds out where the guy lives and holds her chihuahua with two hands so that it can eat all the flowers in his yard. Now who's the# rude# one?\<br></br>*Chihuahua* is considered an elegant meat (like squab or cornish hen), and when dining at a nice restaurant with *flowers*, the most #rude# thing you can do is just dig in with #two hands#...\<br></br>The *Chihuahua* is a #rude# animal. It eats your *flowers* and uses its *two paws* to dig up your tulip bulbs. (So, it's understandable if you are #rude# to your neighbor who owns the stupid dog.).\<br></br>If the CHIHUAHUA ruins your FLOWERS, tossing it with TWO HANDS instead of one is not considered# rude#.
戒	The *halberd* is a dangerous weapon.# Take precautions against# injury and hold it tightly with *two hands*.\<br></br>Also means #ring# , #to give up(smoking/gambling,...)# : to #give up# womanizing the reformed Casonova put his wedding #ring# on his left #hand# and held a #halberd# in his other #hand# to# take precautions against# insatiable women pleasuring themselves against his will...\<br></br>To# take precautions against# wasting food, everyone on Guam always takes home the leftovers at the end of a *fiesta*- enough to fill *both hands*!\<br></br>The way the US is advancing to #take precautions against# terrorism, soon just to visit a *fiesta*, you will not be allowed to attend if you have both your #two hands#, and will have to sacrifice one at the door. (Lest you "throw your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care"!).\<br></br>Moses came down from the mountain with his #commandments#. He handed out the tablets with *both hands* to his people, who were having a genuine *fiesta* of adultery in the valley below. The content of the #commandments# were to help #take precautions against# the negative afterlife side-effects of poor behavior on earth.\<br></br>#Take precautions against# getting run over at the FIESTA by a parade-float by waving your TWO arms.
械	Even if it's just WOODEN, a# weapon# is something you should always TAKE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST.\<br></br>A father gives his son a# weapon# under the *Christmas tree* (much to the horror of the mother). He then says, “son, *take precautions against* hurting anyone with this, OK?”.\<br></br>Another society kneejerk reaction: because we can use them as #weapons#, *trees* are something we must #take precautions against# and preemptively eliminate.\<br></br>Moses' people did not appreciate being handed these preachy *commandments*. Thankfully, they had *taken precautions against* them, and built a massive *wooden* trebuchet #contraption# to fling the tablets miles away. This turned out to be a great #weapon# and was used up until modern times.
誡	You’re a pilot in an airplane when you see a message# warn# you about some problem with the aircraft. It says “*take precautions against* flying with too much weight.” You thus open the window and toss your big fat Oxford English *dictionary* out the window.\<br></br>Think of how South Park #warned# us to #take precautions against# swear *words*.\<br></br>If you actually read the *words* written on the *commandments*, they #warn# you of the dangers of sin.\<br></br>To# warn# someone is to say WORDS to advise them to TAKE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST something.
奔	A# Dash# 8 Cargo aircraft has lost power to its engines and must attempt an emergency landing! Hence the airport quickly puts together a *big* *haystack* that the plane can crash into and hopefully stay intact.\<br></br>In order to make the *St. Bernard* #dash#, find the *needle in the haystack* and then jab it between his legs.\<br></br>Vet: " #Hand# me the #needle# and I'll give this # St Bernard# it's annual jab .....".. "Gulp , I'm out of here !" ....# dash# ..... "Here doggy,doggy .....\<br></br>The ST. BERNARD# dash#es into the HAYSTACK looking for it's bone.
噴	You# spurt# *local-yokel chowder* out of your *mouth* once you learn that the primary ingredient is hay. (Note that in *local-yokel chowder*, the *two hands* are compressed and slanted to look very much like the typed form of *flowers*.).\<br></br>I use 賁 (which is a character meaning energetic or bright in and of its own right) to represent *deflower* or *virgin sex*, because it looks like a bunch of flowers on top of a *clam*. Draw your own perverted imagery from that. Here, the #spurt# from the excitement of *virgin sex* has caused semen to go so far as to leak out of the recipient's *mouth*. (Sorry for the perverse picture, but I find those can go a lot further to stay in the memory.).\<br></br>Lava# spurt#s from the MOUTH of the volcano destroying all the villagers HAYSTACKS and SHELLS (money).\<br></br>See <a href="/study/kanji/1728">licentious</a> <span class="index">(#1728)</span> .

墳	Archaeologists discover an ancient# tomb# buried deep under the *soil*. What do they find next to the skeleton? A giant pot of *local-yokel chowder*, proof that this gross concoction has existed for at least a thousand years.\<br></br>When the Qin Emperor died his# tomb# had warriors,chariots and ... to accompany and protect him in the afterlife .. when Casanova died his# tomb# beneath the #dirt# had #10's# of #flowers# and crates of #oysters# to facilitate his *rogering* in the *life hereafter*.\<br></br>After the crucifixion, there's a piece of land where the victims'# tomb# lies.

材	The GENIUS of WOOD is that it can be used to make all kinds of# stuff#.\<br></br>The guy who came up with the idea of putting# stuff# you and others want under the *Christmas tree* was truly a *genius*. Or was he?\<br></br>This company takes #trees# and uses a *genie* to convert them magically into the #stuff# that they sell.
孕	You want to *punch* the guy that got your *child*# pregnant# out of wedlock.\<br></br>Fertility class 101: you first become# pregnant#, and *only then* will you give birth to a *child*.\<br></br>Here, we have the unfortunate ancient method of birth-control: upon finding out she's #pregnant#, punch a #fist# down on the unborn #child#.\<br></br>#Pregnant# women are with CHILD and liable to punch you with their FIST during labor.
扔	To #throw away# something, take it in your *fingers* and make a #fist# to crumple it up, like paper or aluminum cans. Now you can dispose it compactly.\<br></br>Take trash paper in your FINGERS, ball it up in your FIST and# throw away#.\<br></br>Imagine the famous boxing legend *Tokyo* *Fist* #throwing away# his boxing gloves. No longer will he use his *fists* for violence in *Tokyo*, even very lucrative violence.
圾	One man’s# trash# is another man’s treasure. Here we have a person reaching into the *soil* of a landfill with *outstretched hands*, looking for# trash# that will be treasure to them.\<br></br>Homeless people are covered in SOIL with OUTSTRETCHED HANDS for money, but people treat them like# trash#.\<br></br>On white #trash#, you can see the extent of the *dirt* that covers them when they show you their *outstretched hands*.
叉	#Fork# to the CROTCH. See the DROP of blood?\<br></br>Never have dinner without pants! When you *drop* your# fork# into your *crotch*, *drops* of blood will fly everywhere.\<br></br>Eating and talking at the same time is dangerous, and not just because of the choking hazard. Here a person moves his arms wildly as he explains a funny story, and hence pricks himself by accident in the *right hand* with a# fork#, leaving a *drop* of blood.

He knows that if the police catch him, he’ll be *finished*. Hence wherever he goes, he holds a stolen police *antenna* in his *right hand*, so that he’ll know if they are close to arresting him.\<br></br>I'm using 攴 (KangXi radical 66, pū = to knock, to rap lightly) to mean "penis enlargement" due to the fact that it captures the only way that could actually be done: by waving a *magic wand* over the *crotch*. This character then represents the work to #outlaw#, and thus put a #finish# to the dangerous current methods available for *penis enlargement*.
敲	Gandolf# knock#s on the TALL door with his MAGIC WAND. The people are not happy to see him and kick him in the CROTCH. lol.\<br></br>Imagine that on the long elevator ride up to the top of the *Eiffel Tower*, you and your friend are sharing hilarious# knock#-knock jokes. Another tourist is so enraged that he takes his radio *antenna* (he had been listening to music) and tries to pierce through your *right hand*. What a jerk!\<br></br>Even the *Eiffel Tower* receives shills #knocking#, selling *penis enlargement*. Alternatively, your penis is so #tall# from *penis enlargement* that you can use it to# knock#! Indeed, you know how most door# knock#ers are high up and look like a man with both hands over his junk? It's not much of a stretch (har, har) to imagine using your tall, enlarged penis to actually# knock# on the# knock#er!\<br></br>There is a tall woman above me with her crotch over my face...# Knock## knock## knock#.... Hi Ms. Crotch, my name is Mr. Dick could you please open the door for me?
灌	You# pour into# the *stork’s* mouth some *water* so that it will be ready to take the next newborn baby to its loving parents.\<br></br>think of the Flintstone days: if you wanted to serve #water#, you'd have to *pour it into* a serving vessel, in this case, a *stork*, like how many Flintstone objects are actually animals.\<br></br>WATER is poured into the bird bath for the STORK to drink.
權	Eric Cartman of South Park wearing a cop uniform, riding a WOODEN STORK on a carousel, yelling “RESPECT MY AUTHORITAH!!!”--thanks to fuaburisu.\<br></br>The *stork* is unhappy that it is treated so poorly for its hard work in delivering babies, so it climbs up a *tree* and won't get down until the boss gives him some# authority#.\<br></br>Simplified 权.# Authority# is given by *trees* (as resources) and *crotch*. either that means people vote with their feet or sex as a weapon of# authority#. choose your favorite image. 336 most common Hanzi.\<br></br>You were bummed out that your spouse didn’t get you the gift you wanted from Sports# Authority# for Christmas. But then you see a *stork* crash through the window and lands right next to the *Christmas tree*. Whoa, a baby! This is much better!\<br></br>here I imagine Eric Cartman - who wants to maintain his spoiled only child status - asserting his #authority# by using a *wooden club* to beat away a *stork* when it comes to deliver him a sibling.\<br></br>The giving *tree* was given# authority# to aid little boys by the *stork* that delivered them.
毅	A# resolute# SOW STANDS UP against a MISSILE.\<br></br>Imagine you are a sailor on board the (fictional) USS# Resolute# in 1777. You’re unloading *vases* with *sow* meat inside them when a *missile* from the British strikes the side! Afraid as you are, you stand# resolute#, knowing that your beautiful vessel will not sink.
肢	Your# limb#s are the *part of the body* that are like *branches*.\<br></br>To go ‘out on a# limb#’ means, literally, to place all of your *flesh* on a tree *branch* that could very well break under you.\<br></br>A# limb# is a FLESH BRANCH of the body.
妓	You are with a# prostitute# in your bedroom when, unexpectedly, your wife comes home early. You must rush the *woman* out the window and onto a nearby *branch* so as not to be detected.\<br></br>This is not one of your classier# prostitute#s, but one of those nasty ones who has truly succumbed to the hardships of a life of addictions and street life. This *woman* has lost her arms and legs to intravenous drug use but cannot afford prosthetics, so instead she sports #branches#.\<br></br>You set up ten *branches* of a dry cleaning store that will be staffed by *women* who were former# prostitute#s (I think James Joyce wrote about something like this, maybe in Dubliners?).\<br></br>#Prostitute#s are WOMEN who BRANCH out looking for clients that will pay money to have sex with them.
歧	Your *footprints* *stop* abruptly because you notice that there are two *branches* in the road ahead. In other words, you’ve come to a# fork in the road#. What to do?\<br></br>At the# fork in the road#, the *footprints* *branch* into two different paths.\<br></br>You *stop* at the *branch* in the...err, I mean the# fork in the road#, confused as to why this hanzi doesn't contain the primitive for "road.".\<br></br>You STOP at the BRANCH or more commonly called# fork in the road#.
翅	#Fins# are the little *branches* on the body of a fish, dolphin or shark that act like *wings* in the water, letting it rise, descend or go to the left or right.\<br></br>#Fins# are to fish what *branches* are to trees and *feathers* are to birds.\<br></br>The# fins# of a flying fish resemble *wings*--indeed, it can even fly out of the water and perch on a *branch*, like a bird.\<br></br>Skates (the fish) have prominent #fins#, although culinarily, we call them *wings*, and put a #branch# through them to prepare to cook them.\<br></br>#Fins# BRANCH from a shark's body and propels them like WINGS.\<br></br>*Branch*ing off of the fish in every direction, the# fins# act like *wings* for soaring through the water.

He hopes its taste will overwhelm you and thus make you forget the embarrassment of his falling into the water in <a href="/study/kanji/1852">graceful</a> <span class="index">(#1852)</span>.\<br></br>The #spice plant# is a tree that is predominantly used due to its ability to repel dirty #uncles#, like garlic with vampires.
后	The old# queen# is such a *drag* to be around. I always find that I'm staring at the *ceiling* whenever she opens her *mouth*.\<br></br>The new# queen# of the realm turns out to be a *drag*# queen#. But that's *one* fact all the loyal subjects keep their *mouths* shut about.\<br></br>If you insult the# queen# of [insert a totalitarian country’s name], you will be *dragged* by your *mouth* against the *ceiling*. (This is incidentally the simplified character for ‘behind’.).\<br></br>The #queen#'s mouth is so stretched out from yelling royal proclamations that she has essentially become #one# #mouth# that #drags# everything into her, like a black hole. (Simplified version of 後.).
盾	This is a magic# shield# with TEN EYES which have the power to DRAG the victim towards it. (Thanks to fuaburisu @ RTK).\<br></br>This# shield# has #ten# paralyzing #eyes# that lock on an enemy and #drag# them where you want.\<br></br>Here you are in a boss fight in Star Fox 64 – which begins when Slippy says, “enemy# shield# analyzed!” *Ten eyeballs* (your friends’) watch as you try to defeat this boss, who also happens to have *ten eyeballs*. It’s a tough fight that *drags* on and on, much to your embarrassment (this was supposed to be a kids’ game, right?).
販	It is *against* this man’s philosophy to give a single *shell* to a# peddler# – he only shops in department stores.\<br></br>Don't buy your *shellfish* from that disreputable seaside# peddler#. Instead of washing them properly, he just *drags them against his crotch*. It's not hygienic!\<br></br>A# peddler# is a salesperson that pushes her wares against you and then demands shells, as opposed to a normal seller who would be much more polite...\<br></br>Those pesky #peddlers# have formed a coalition #against# beach #shells# because then you don't have to buy from them!\<br></br>No# peddler# is AGAINST SHELLS (money). They'll do anything to get your money!
扳	Foreskin #tugging# is using your *fingers* to oppose or go *against* what has been done to you, or alternatively in simpler terms, using your *fingers* to *drag* the skin of your *crotch*.\<br></br>To# tug# on something is to grab it with your FINGERS and pull AGAINST it.\<br></br>In this mismatched# tug# of war, the *fingers* of the winning team are still pulling the rope whilst the weaker team's *crotches* are *dragging against* the ground.\<br></br>The# tug# of war is a sport where two teams grab a rope with their *fingers* and are pitted *against* each other to# tug# as hard as they can.\<br></br>Protesters who are *against* the existence of *Tokyo* Narita International attempt to# tug# away a 747 that has just landed, but once it runs up *against* the grass they’re unable to pull it any more.
覓	A *vulture* circles high in the air to *see* if there are any dead animals to eat.

He has taken wing and is *see*ing the whole world below.
妥	There's a noisy vulture that flies around above women and screeches at them, "your skirt is too short! your shirt is too low! It's not# appropriate#!".\<br></br>A *vulture* tries to swoop down and grab a *woman*, but finds (duh) that she’s too heavy. The irritated *woman* shakes her finger at the *vulture* and yells, “that’s really not# appropriate#, you know!” Not to mention that she was not the# appropriate# size for the vulture!\<br></br>Anti-gay rights idiots feel that it's #appropriate# to claim that people will think it #appropriate# to marry *vultures* instead of #women# if we allow gay marriage.\<br></br>Calling a WOMAN a VULTURE is not# appropriate# even if she's always taking your money. (Sorry to any women reading this!).
睬	As you wake up, you can’t help but# notice# that someone has *plucked* out your left *eyeball!* You can only see with your right eye.\<br></br>When you specifically #notice# something, it's like your #eye# #plucks# it out of the surroundings.\<br></br>An animal lies dying and the VULTURES perched on a TREE EYES fixed definitely# notice#.

Now we need to address and #cross out# the newer and even more horrific *binding* of *elbows*.
晉	I can't help but feel that this character looks like a face, like 曾 sort of does. In this case, though, because of affirmative action, we are going to #promote# old *elbow*-eyes.\<br></br>This means# promote# to a higher position, not as in promoting a book. To get #promoted#, you'll have to *elbow* your way past all the other hopefuls (represented here by doubling *elbow*), from the *floor* of the organisation right up to the *ceiling*. But once you've managed it, the lower orders will think that the *sun* shines out of your backside!\<br></br>To# promote# the Alice in Wonderland movie, they showed a trailer in which, in the course of a single *day*, she grew so large that her *two elbows* just fitted between the *ceiling* and the *floor*.\<br></br>Simplified 晋# promote# = *Asia*/*Mao*, *sun*. Story: *Mao* has just defeated the KMT and has just #promoted# himself to Chairman. It's a glorious day, and *Mao* feels like he's on top of the world - no, on top of the *sun*!\<br></br>This employee wants to be #promoted#, but sexism in the workplace is disallowing it. Here she is pressing against the glass *ceiling* with her *two elbows*. She witnesses a beautiful *sunset* outside and realizes that tonight must be the *sunset* of her job with the company – she must seek employment at a place that will let her become an executive.\<br></br>You# promote# an elbow grease extractor machine: place *two elbows* on the *floor* smash the *ceiling* on it. The process takes one *day*.
宏	Here we have a truly# magnificent# *house*: it deflates in seconds to the size of your *elbow*, and you can hence keep it *by your side* all the time by dangling it from your *elbow*. Especially useful for hikers.\<br></br>Taking you by the ELBOW at his SIDE, the prince gives you a tour of his# magnificent# HOUSE.\<br></br>The# Magnificent# Magnifico is a famous magician known for his great sleight of hand tricks. He makes all kinds of objects appear out of thin air, even with his sleeves rolled up! In truth, he has a little house compartment at his side and at his elbow, where he stores his doves, rabbits, handkerchiefs, etc.\<br></br>which will serve well here. Dean Corll, the most #magnificent# of serial killers, in order to preserve what he felt was the #magnificence# of his victims, kept their *upper arms* in his *house*.
胎	Every *month* your wife gets an ultrasound of the developing# fetus#. Here you can see a couple *parts of the body*: the little guy's *elbow* and *mouth*.\<br></br>Here we see an pro-life campaigner trying to defend the rights of the# fetus# by showing grisly photographs of dead pieces of *flesh* from atop his speaking *platform*.\<br></br>I believe that we must place (not literally) the *flesh* of the# fetus# on a moral *platform* to demonstrate that it has the same right to life as the rest of us.\<br></br>Imagine a woman's womb like a pedestal where new life blooms. The #fetus# is then the *flesh* that develops on this #platform#.\<br></br>The# fetus# develops on a FLESHY PLATFORM (uterus) in the mother's body.
冶	When you #smelt#, you bang on a #platform# to the desired shape, and then quickly cool it with *ice*.\<br></br>Imagine trying to# smelt# *ice* into a *platform* for a train station. They pour it into the heating vat and . . . huh? Where did it go?\<br></br>After the steel has been# smelt# (melting to separate metals), cool it first with ICE and lay it outside on the PLATFORM.
颱	A# typhoon# is a ferocious *windstorm* that can wipe away an entire train *platform*. Note the elongated final stroke of windstorm – there it is, picking up the *platform*.\<br></br>The #typhoon# was so incredibly impressive that the *windstorm* was captured, frozen in time, and placed on a #platform# in a museum for all to see.
怠	Relationship advice: Don't be# negligent# with your spouse. Keep him/her elevated on a PLATFORM in your HEART.\<br></br>You were quite# negligent# this afternoon and lost something on a train *platform*. What was it? Your *heart*! Uh oh, better run back and see if you can find it!\<br></br>Someone who is truly #negligent# has an empty #platform# in their chest, with their #heart# having fallen off underneath.\<br></br>This politician's platform relates to# negligent# parents; he wants to heal poor children's hearts from the damage due to bad parenting.
抬	Press the button with your FINGER to# elevate# the PLATFORM.\<br></br>A bold politician proposes that *Tokyo* outfit its train *platforms* with the ability to# elevate# 50 feet in the air so as to escape damage from a tsunami.
丟	The EXACT reason I end up #mislay#ing something is because I *drop* it and #go# without taking a moment to put it back where it belongs. Thus, #mislay# = *drop* and #go#!\<br></br>(Based off vorpal and mornir’s stories) You# mislay# your car keys, and before you can *go* to work you must find this little *drop* of metal. Darn, you say to yourself, where did you# mislay# them?\<br></br>Heisig says *thousand* + *wall*, but I prefer *porter* + *elbow*. When you# mislay# the keys to your appartment, you ask the *porter* to let you in. But it turns out he's #mislaid# his too; in the end you have to break down the door with your *elbow*!\<br></br>Whatever you do, don't# mislay# anything in the famous Chinese "Labyrinth of a *Thousand Walls*." You'll never find it again.\<br></br>You have to *go* and look for the *drop* that you lost/#mislaid#.
臺	I like the usage of 至 to mean *climax* as used by many in RTK. Living in# Taiwan# to perfect my Mandarin is my dream: it would be equivalent in its wondrousness to wearing a #lucky# *crown* while *climaxing*.\<br></br>You spend your days spraying designs on plastic *crowns* with an *aerosol can*, counting down the days *until* you have enough money from this job to move to# Taiwan#.

Now all the *infants* can do is suck their *fingers* instead.\<br></br>I'll call the right-hand side a *pedophile*, since he likes to touch *infant flesh* and act like an SM *taskmaster*.

Stay cool and don’t pay attention to them.\<br></br>"A picture is worth a thousand words," so TAKING A PHOTO can replace the scribbling done by many FINGERS, or the hearing done by many EARS (here, three).\<br></br>It should be no surprise that when people go to# take a photo#, they often raise their *fingers* in a sign of peace. More recently, people have been pointing their *ears* to towards the lens that we might see a *pile of ears* in every photo.

Old *Scrooge* of course has no desire to part with any *part of his body*, even though he could afford to.
募	Most military organizations are having a hard time finding ways to# recruit# men to join. Unfortunately, most people see it as signing up to join a *graveyard*. However, the military has begun to focus on people who only think with their *muscles* and never with their brains.\<br></br>A nuclear *power* plant tries to# recruit# new workers, but most people refuse to apply, saying, “you’ll send us to the *graveyard* early!”.\<br></br>Us gay people are frequently accused of trying to #recruit#: here is the truth of the situation.

However, it turned out to be just a piece of *flesh* in the form of a lamb chop!\<br></br>Simplified 胁# threaten# = *part of the body*, *sweat*.

When the police show up, they yell *go!* *Go!* *Go!*.\<br></br>To# plunder#, you #go# somewhere and exert your #power#. Alternatively, to make it more vivid, here we have a lady pirate who has allowed her penchant for muscles to transcend into something truly bizarre and perverse: she #plunders# by #going# somewhere and actually taking #muscle# tissue as her trophy.\<br></br>What better description of a person who# plunder#s is there than someone *going* someplace and taking whatever they want with their *muscles*.

While Dr. Eggman loves to build machines and conquer the world, Dr.# Eggplant# loves to *add flower* around the local orphanage.\<br></br>I discovered how much I disliked #eggplant# when I took the plant (*flowers*) and #added# it to one of my favourite dishes to make it healthier, which invariably ruined the whole dish.\<br></br>#Eggplant# is a FLOWER (vegetable) you can ADD to any meal.\<br></br>The# eggplant# is a kind of odd little vegetable, here represented as a *flower* that has puzzled chefs for generations.

循	This basically describes a peaceful protest with people who #comply with# the law: on the left, the *queue* of protesters, and on the right, the riot squad with their #shield#s.\<br></br>A large *queue* of protestors demands that the U.S. Army# comply with# the latest regulations in military *shield* technology – they want only the best in Humvee and tank safety.\<br></br>A new law has been passed forcing all loyal citizens to stand in a *queue* and submit themselves to daily cavity searches.

衍	The thing that allowed Ontario to #develop# was the #develop#ment of the Rideau Canal, which is essentially a large #boulevard# full of #water#.\<br></br>The city is currently trying to# develop# more infrastructure. Here we can see the *boulevard* is being renovated with additional pipes for *water* to flow better from one side of the city to the other.\<br></br>Sometimes people have goofy ideas about how to# develop# an area. Imagine that the French government has plans to# develop# the Champs-Elysees by pouring *water* on it and making it into a Venetian canal.
衡	On this *boulevard*, the little fish shop prides itself on selling fish of the exact same# weight#. The trick is to allow their *dog to bite the tails off of fish* before he sells them. This dog has a great eye and always knows exactly how much to nibble away.\<br></br>You know how many traffic lights are #weight#-based? Engineers have determined that the perfect #weight# to trigger traffic light signal changes on the *boulevard* is precisely the #weight# of a *St. Bernard* with a #fish# in its mouth.\<br></br>To lose# weight# you go to this famous *boulevard* where you can eat a *fishdog* (a hotdog variant with fish). It's famous for helping people lose# weight# (since even the sight of it will make you barf).\<br></br>A giant (think Clifford-size) *Saint Bernard Dog* has an equally large *fish* in its mouth. (Note that the *cooking fire* is hidden, blocked off by the top of *big dog.) It happens to be standing on the *Champs-Elysees*, and the large# weight# of the dog and whale combined is making the *Champs-Elysees* (boulevard) sink below his feet. “Too much# weight#! Too much# weight#!” scream the authorities as they try to chase him off the road.
銜	Embedded in this *boulevard* are beautiful *gold* plaques of famous people with a royal# title#.\<br></br>One way to guarantee a #title# for yourself would be to construct a *boulevard* made of solid #gold#.\<br></br>A man is so proud of receiving the# title# of general in the French army that he struts down the *Champs-Elysees*, showing off the *gold* stars on his uniform.\<br></br>The great conquering hero who has caused the *boulevard* to be lined with *gold* will surely be given a new# title# for all of his great deeds.
禿	The trend in body hair removal is to be #bald# and as smooth as a piece of *wild rice* on *human legs*.\<br></br>In my upcoming stories, I will often give *wild rice* the connotation of an alleged health item or ‘miracle food’ to distinguish it from plain old *rice*. For example: a new commercial announces: “spread our miracle *wild rice* cream on your *human legs* each morning, and you’ll never go# bald#!”.\<br></br>Blowing his toupee off like WILD RICE in the WIND, you see the man is actually# bald#.
頹	It is good to be #bald# everywhere BUT your *head*, in which case you are considered #decrepit# and undesirable.\<br></br>Unfortunately, the baldness prevention advertised in <a href="/study/kanji/1941">bald</a> <span class="index">(#1941)</span> did not work so well, leaving many a man to see his *bald* *head* in the mirror, and say to himself, “I look so# decrepit#!”.\<br></br>HEAD left BALD from old age, the geezer looked sickly and# decrepit#.

稍	Think about the kind of meals they serve at a fancy restaurant-- probably delicious, but such small portions. You get a great ambience and a candlelit dinner, but in the end, the food is just a single noodle!# A little#? More like too little!\<br></br>Given how *wild rice* barely smells like anything at all, a *wild rice*-scented *candle* only affects its surroundings #a little#.\<br></br>WILD RICE RESEMBLES regular rice more than just# a little#.\<br></br>“Ahh, doesn’t this *wild rice* *candle* freshen up the room?” asks the salesman. “Uh . . .# a little#,” says the (unimpressed) shopper.
穌	Jesus, who will# rise again#, can make *fish* and *wild rice* appear out of nothing.\<br></br>The term #rise again# immediately makes me think of Jesus: when he rose again, he performed the "miracle" of the fish and loaves: in this case, #fish# and *wild rice* to cater to the gluten-free crowd. Note that since *wild rice* typically occurs on the LEFT of a character, which will certainly trip me up, I remember that it occurs on the RIGHT in this character because this character, like the religion it describes, is completely backwards.\<br></br>If I remember correctly, when Jesus #rises again# he asks for some *fish*, but imagine that the best his disciples can do is pluck out some *wild rice* from the ground.\<br></br>This is basically the story of the fish and the loaves (bread made with standing grain or wheat); even when the quantity of food should have decreased, it continued to# rise again#.\<br></br>The town's FISH stores have been depleted and the WILD RICE crops have failed, but the people will pull together and the town will# rise again#.
蘇	This poor guy is in a coma, but his girlfriend #revives# him by placing some sweet-smelling *flowers* under his nose, allowing him to *rise again*.\<br></br>In some video games, you use a special rare flower item to# revive# your fainted party members and make them rise again.\<br></br>To #revive# anyone and anything, regardless of their state, use these #flowers#: they were suspected to be implicated in making Jesus #rise again#.
萎	I always associate #committee# 委 with a wedding committee, because it looks like wild rice being thrown at a bride. So the wedding #committee# is responsible for choosing *flowers* that won't #wilt# before the big day.\<br></br>The *flowers* in the Oval Office are #wilting#! Hence the president calls a secret *committee* to figure out what can be done. After three hours, they all agree that their only hope is to give the flowers some water.\<br></br>This *committee* meeting is so dull and tedious that it's making the *flowers* on the table# wilt#.\<br></br>The FLOWER COMMITTEE'S job is to make sure no flower is left to# wilt#.
黏	The character 黍 actually means GLUTINOUS MILLET, which to me makes sense: take *wild rice*, use a filtering *umbrella* to remove the husks, leaving shiny white *snowflake* looking rice. (I know that wild rice and rice are not related at all, but bear with me.) So here, *glutinous millet* used to be used to #tell fortunes#, but it proved to be too #sticky#.\<br></br>*Rumpelbrella* stops by the *fortune teller*, who predicts the upcoming# sticky# situation: someone will soon steal the blueprints to your magical umbrella and use it for evil.\<br></br>Wheat/noodles, an umbrella, and a snowflake is a lover's umbrella-- two people walk together under an umbrella and share a bowl of noodles (like Lady and the Tramp), as romantic snowflakes fall. These lovers stop by a fortune teller, who tells them that they will be# sticky#-- lovey-dovey and utterly stuck together-- for the rest of their life.\<br></br>*Rumpelbrella* hears about a# sticky# situation on the *radio*: the local ski resort’s snow is all# sticky# and warm, and no one wants to hit the slopes! Hence he quickly goes down with a jar of wild rice to make some snowflakes himself.\<br></br>RUMPELBRELLA is told by the FORTUNE TELLER that he should keep his WILD RICE under the UMBRELLA and away from SNOWFLAKES to keep it# sticky# and good to eat.
黎	This character is causing problems for me, and using Rumpelbrella or my "glutinous millet" primitives aren't cutting it, so I'll try something new. The #Host# is an Indian restaurant we frequent. You can get *wild rice*, *naan* (almost a *knot* of bread, but missing one stroke), AND (using the conjunction symbol) regular rice as white as *snowflakes*.\<br></br>A# host# of people have kidnapped *Rumpelbrella* because they want to know his secret to making snow. Hence he’s *bound up*. But he takes his special *eyedropper* (which contains sulfuric acid) and cuts through the ropes, hence making his escape.\<br></br>There are a lot of different types of# host#, but I'll take this one to be a# host# club type. A handsome# host# will walk with you under a lover's umbrella, and since you're paying him and he can't refuse, it's like you have a bound-up little drop of happiness in your life.\<br></br>The# host#, RUMPELBRELLA, invites you BOUND in your coat covered in DROPS of SNOWFLAKES into his home for a WILD RICE dinner.
漆	Note that 桼 is actually a very rare character (reading: qī) with the meaning of "varnish" - and I am using this meaning instead of Baron von Rumpelbrella. #Wall paint# is nothing more than a *liquid* *varnish* for your walls.\<br></br>*Baron von Rumpelbrella* makes a small fortune by putting just *water* into paint cans, then selling it as expensive# wall paint#.\<br></br>The halls of Baron von Rumpelbrella are always being hit with water. In order to mask the *water* stains left behind, *Baron von Rumpelbrella* is always forced to apply another coat of# wall paint# to them.
膝	(Note that 桼 is actually a very rare character (reading: qī) with the meaning of "varnish" - and I am using this meaning instead of Baron von Rumpelbrella.) In order to protect the #knees# from running and kneeling (for perverted reasons), coat the *flesh* with a layer of *varnish*, and voila! No scuffing!\<br></br>#Knees# are *Baron von Rumpelbrella*’s favorite *part of the body* because they have little *flesh* and they’re easy to break.\<br></br>You kneel on the FLESH of your# knees# before the great BARON VON RUMPELBRELLA.
稠	Super-#dense# objects are a threat to us as they can spontaneously collapse into black holes. Here, to indicate the danger, we put *wild rice* around the #circumference# of a #dense# object.\<br></br>It will be a great harvest. The fields are# dense# with WILD RICE covering the entire CIRCUMFERENCE of the farm.\<br></br>Back to the wild rice health products craze: an advertisement says, “if your body has a larger *circumference* than you’d like, just rub some *wild rice* cream on it, and you’ll become# dense# with muscle!”.
稿	The first# draft# of the *Eiffel Tower* called for it to be made out of handsome jet-black *wild rice* so that, in the event of a famine, the French government could chop it down and feed the hungry masses.

穎	Paper is one of the most #clever# inventions we have, and it can be used to record #clever# ideas. Here we have the recipe for paper: a #spoon# of *wild rice* for one *page*.\<br></br>You can guess how# clever# someone is by brain size--anciently this was done by estimating how many *spoonfuls* of *wild rice* would fit in their *head*.\<br></br>Frosted Mini-Wheats has commercials where they purport to be healthy for kids-- kind of a stretch for sugary cereal... In the commercial, a smiling child spoons wheat into his mouth and says it'll make his head (brain) healthy and more# clever#. If you say so...\<br></br>A# clever# guy makes a million dollars by asking himself, ‘what would my ideal amusement park be?’ He thus invents *Wild Rice* land, in which you can swim in a large vat of *wild rice* up to your *head* and eat all you want with a *spoon*.\<br></br>You don't need to use your HEAD and be# clever# to figure out how to pick up WILD RICE with a SPOON.\<br></br>Think back to our story for 100 Chinese Acres. In order to pass the balance test, a# clever# student has weighed down his spoon with several grains of *wild rice* so it won't fall from his head.
稅	The Japanese grumble among themselves, “those foreign *devils* are making us pay a# tax# on *wild rice* exports!”.\<br></br>#Tax# was at one point paid in *wild rice*, and taken by the #tax# collector *devil*s.\<br></br>A# tax# is the DEVIL's way of making it harder for you to afford WILD RICE.

菌	#Fungus# grows like a FLOWER on WILD RICE when it is PENT IN humid places for long periods of time.\<br></br>Anyone who's ever grown their own mushrooms (magic or otherwise), which is a type of #fungus#, knows that the way to do this is to prepare jars of substrate cake: *wild rice* is typically used and placed in a *sealed jar* (*pent in*). Then the #fungus# of interest is the *flower* that grows off of the substrate cake.\<br></br>Have toenail# fungus#? Try soaking them in a vat of *pent in* *wild rice* with *flowers* added in, and they’ll be healed in no time. Actually, they won’t. Don’t believe any of this.\<br></br>#Fungus# is very similar to a *flower* blooming on the surface of another living thing. This happens most often when plants, like *wild rice* are grown in a very humid area, *pent in* with no ventilation.
稚	It was pretty# immature# of that farmer to think that all his *turkeys* would ever need to eat would be *wild rice*, supposedly such a great health food.\<br></br>This 40-year old guy is acting really# immature#. He's spilled his bowl of *Wheat Chex* and is gobbling around like a *turkey* eating them off the floor.\<br></br>Adults like fancy food like foie gras, but# immature# brats like me prefer wheat pasta and chicken nuggets.\<br></br>When one is #immature#, any wild tastes are often challenging. Here we have the ultimate duo of tough flavours: *wild rice* and wild *turkey*.\<br></br>The butcher's TURKEY's are small and# immature# so he stuffs them with WILD RICE to make them more appealing to shoppers.
穫	To #harvest# tiny grains of *wild rice* is no easy feat, so it has become tradition to use *birds of paradise* to perform the task for you.\<br></br>You are kind of a lazy farmer, so you train some *birds of paradise* to# harvest# all of your *wild rice* for you. They get to keep 10% of all the wild rice they# harvest# as payment.
私	This guy has the most bizarre #private# parts: his testicles are like tiny grains of *wild rice* and his member is bent like an *elbow*!\<br></br>People can be very protective of their wild rice. This woman *elbows* a guest in the face who wanted to take a look at her bottle of *wild rice*, saying, “that’s my# private# stash!”.\<br></br>That naked girl has to cover up all her# private# parts! She crosses her elbows in from of her breasts and has a single wheat stalk covering her lower# private#s, almost like a fig leaf.\<br></br>Farmer's sign:# Private# WILD RICE...All trespassers will be ELBOWED.
秩	My #husband# is very organized. He likes to chew on his glasses while imposing #order# on our rices, here working with the *wild rice*.\<br></br>Make sure your WILD RICE is kept in# order# or you will LOSE a lot before the harvest.\<br></br>The newest development in the wild rice craze: if your toilet is out of# order#, just pour in some *wild rice* and flush it down – that way, you won’t have to *lose* any money by hiring a plumber.
殼	I am taking the parts of this character associated with #soldier#, *crown*, #one#, and *missile* to represent *battle gear*. (The significance of the #one# is that even after a solider gets his protective crown and his offensive missile, he still only has #one# life to protect.) Thus, here we have that during basic training, we learn that in a pinch, a #shell# can be used as *battle gear* that can protect you from *wind* (or poisonous gas).\<br></br>Let the *soldier* who earned a *crown* by being number *one* be a *distinguished soldier*. Story: the *distinguished soldier* earned his crown by devising a kind of protective# shell# that could withstand both the *wind* and the constant barrage of *missiles* from the enemy.\<br></br>#One# fact* admidst* the #superfluous# hyperbole concerning modern warfare is that nuclear interballistic #missiles# have not rendered the #soldier# or the #shell# redundant.\<br></br>A *soldier* is given a camouflage *crown* to reflect that he scored number *one* in the ‘shooting *missile* #shells# into the *wind*’ competition that year. [Note how *wind* is compressed to make room for *missile*; this shows up both in the printed and written form, so it’s best to write it like this.].
穀	The #cereal# in *battle gear* packs is *Wild Rice* Krispies! Picture Snap, Crackle, and Pop in battle fatigues.\<br></br>The *distinguished soldier* from <a href="/study/kanji/1962">shell</a> <span class="index">(#1962)</span> earned another crown by discovering that putting *wild rice* in their breakfast# cereal# made the soldiers much better at shooting *missiles*.\<br></br>A *soldier* is given a cardboard *crown* for scoring *number one* in the “eating *wild rice*# cereal# contest.” As a prize he gets his very own ballistic *missile* (they had some extras lying around the missile silo.).
鍬	This special #gold# #shovel# is reserved for use in #autumn# work.\<br></br>Politicians and CEOs often get to break ground on some new project with a *golden*# shovel#. What to do with that# shovel# afterwards? May as well use it to rake away all of the *autumn* leaves that have settled on their yard.\<br></br>The gold diggers took their# shovel#s to dig for *gold* in *autumn*, before winter would come and the ground would become too hard to dig for anything.\<br></br>A METAL# shovel# is useful during the AUTUMN harvest.
揪	In #autumn#, due to erratic, gusty weather, your *fingers* need to #hold tight# to things everywhere you go. (Careful not to get this mixed up with grip {<a href="/study/kanji/825">grip</a> <span class="index">(#825)</span>} (握) or grasp {<a href="/study/kanji/1280">grasp</a> <span class="index">(#1280)</span>} (把).\<br></br>"WARNING : #AUTUMN# STUBBLE BURNING" .. before initiating #fire# lick your #finger# and establish wind direction and force. If safe to do so begin fire. It is imperaritive that you now# HOLD TIGHT# - do not leave until the very last flame is extinguished and all embers have cooled. ".\<br></br>Imagine that *Tokyo* gets super-windy in the *autumn*, so pedestrians have to# hold tight# to a streetlamp, or a sign, or a car, just to stay upright.
梨	The Japanese# pear# TREE is the most PROFITABLE in the world, because it produces its fruit in pairs [sorry for the awful pun]. (thanks rptb1 @ RTK).\<br></br>#Pears# provide tremendous economic gain. Thus, the are essentially #profit# in a #tree#.\<br></br>You made a lot of *profit* in your job this year, so you can afford to send people those juicy gift #pears# to place under their *Christmas tree* (or on top, in the case of this character).
犁	To farmers, a #plow# could radically increase their #profit#, and was pulled by a #cow#, thus: The #plow#: #profit# on the shoulders of a #cow#.\<br></br>You want to live the life of a snow# plow# operator, so you spend all your *profits* from herding *cows* and buy a nice snow# plow#.\<br></br>Some farmers# plow# by hand, but if you want to turn a profit, you really need to get an ox-pulled# plow#. Yes, it's more expensive, but it's better for business-- put in an initial investment, and your productivity will be higher and you'll have a higher profit!\<br></br>To make a PROFIT, a farmer needs both a# plow# and a COW.
曆	I call the *cliff*side restaurant that specializes in *wild rice* dishes (for you and a date) *Le Rizerie*. (From experience, {<a href="/study/kanji/723">experience</a> <span class="index">(#723)</span>}, 歷 - indeed, they both simplify to the same character, 历.) Here you have a *day* marked on your #calendar# to go to *Le Rizerie*.\<br></br>Your friend explains to you, “mark your# calendar# – tomorrow our country (the U.S., not Canada, Vorpal!) is going to fall off the *cliff*. Hide under *two* big stalks of *standing grain*, and you might just survive the *day*.”.\<br></br>Years-Months-Days: It takes many years for a CLIFF to form or erode. STANDING GRAIN takes many months to grow. But DAYS pass by regularly - so in this way, we see the movement of time such as with a# CALENDAR#.--thanks to Danieru.\<br></br>When is the *day* of your super-special wild rice *experience* (see <a href="/study/kanji/723">experience</a> <span class="index">(#723)</span>)? Wait, let me check my# calendar#.
糕	Some people bake# cake# in the oven, with wheat flour with butter. They're wimps. I never make substitutes-- it's gotta be rice flour and SHEEP LARD, over a cooking fire, for the fattiest, fluffiest, unhealthiest# cake# around.\<br></br>This #cake# is a *mochi* white rice# cake# filled with *mutton* (#sheep# meat roasted over a *cooking fire*).\<br></br>I will often use *Rice University* as a primitive for *Rice*. Now Rice is a great school with hard-working students, but I’m going to *#pretend#* in my stories that it’s a party school with unmotivated students, which of course is not the case – it’s just that it makes for better stories that way. Story: *Rice* University students make a white# cake# by roasting a *sheep* over a *cooking fire*, laying it on its side and cutting it into cubes (eww!).\<br></br>RICE and SHEEP prepared on a COOKING FIRE will not make# cake#.
糊	When making #batter# with *rice* in it, to get the *rice* to the right consistency and not have full broken-up grains, you have to be extremely #reckless# with it.\<br></br>When making the# batter#, pay attention to the ingredients and don't be RECKLESS with the RICE.
粘	Be careful not to get mixed up with paste {<a href="/study/kanji/52">paste</a> <span class="index">(#52)</span>} 貼 and sticky {<a href="/study/kanji/1948">sticky</a> <span class="index">(#1948)</span>} 黏. This white *rice*'s *fortune* is easy to tell: it will be made into #glue#.\<br></br>This guy spent all his time at *Rice* University partying, and hence the only job he could find was #glue#-ing *radio* parts together.\<br></br>For a handful of *rice*, the old man will kindly *tell your your fortune*. Knowing it, you have been# glue#d to your destiny and know precisely what decisions to make.
糧	Before you go out on a journey, make sure you pack# provisions#-- you need to measure out the exact quantity of rice to pack, or you'll run out and starve!\<br></br>Simplified 粮# provisions# = *rice*, *halo/Jesus*. Story: For his daily# provisions#, *Jesus* would just turn pebbles to *rice*. No need to pull out the fancy stone to bread trick.\<br></br>These #provisions# refer to the white *rice* #quantity# you receive.\<br></br>Imagine that *Rice* University instructs its students to make# provisions# for what will happen if a friend ingests too large a *quantity* of beer.
菊	#Chrysanthemum# sushi: a *flower* on top of *bound up rice*.\<br></br>Instead of zucchini blossoms, here we have #chrysanthemum# flowers, *bound* and stuffed with white *rice* as a nutritional side.\<br></br>Thinking of the pretty# chrysanthemum# flowers, like in tea. They're flowers with tons of tiny petals, that look like cute grains of rice bound up in the center.\<br></br>A *Rice* University student goes on a cultural exchange trip to Japan’s Imperial Palace, where he innocently takes the Emperor’s very own# chrysanthemum# *flower*. He’s immediately *bound up* by security for this act.\<br></br>A# chrysanthemum# is an important FLOWER in China worth more than a BOUND UP bag of RICE.
糙	If one were to use *rice* paper instead of sandpaper on something one #created#, the result would be quite #rough#.\<br></br>A farmer who CREATES RICE probably has# rough# hands from the farm work.\<br></br>#Rough#age is incredidably important for #rice# eaters as sticky #rice# causes *constipation*. The boffins have #created# a GM brown #rice# that is so# rough# that it comes out just as it went in !!\<br></br>*Rice* University students, explains a tour guide, are known for *creating* amazing products – such as this# rough# material for frat house floors that will prevent people from slipping on beer.\<br></br>Usually before you create any piece of art, you should do a# rough# sketch first. I prefer to do my sketches on rice paper-- it's a great, surface for a# rough# plan!
粒	The traditional choice of #grain# in China is white *rice*, and the traditional unit is the *vase*: indeed, think of a #grain# man, the equivalent of a milk man, delivering white *rice* in a *vase*.\<br></br>A sage is using *rice* to fill up a *vase*, but as an exercise in patience, he's doing it #grain# by #grain#.\<br></br>Best take with a# grain# of salt the story of that guy in the bar bragging about how he can make small# grain#s of *rice* *stand up* straight.\<br></br>Imagine that# Grain# is *Rice* University’s mascot; he spends most of his time *standing up* at football games, cheering wildly. To reinforce the primitive elements in your mind, you can also picture that he wears as his uniform a big *vase* full of *rice*.\<br></br>#Grain# and RICE are kept in VASES in the kitchen.
燦	I call the top right of this character (magic wand / evening / crotch) *Viagra*, because waving a magic wand in the evening over your crotch guarantees a night of sexual success. Here, if we build a #fire#, take *Viagra*, and then spray our *rice* into the fire, the colours produced will be #brilliant#.\<br></br>Last night I had a# brilliant# evening: I *dined* (<a href="/study/kanji/1098">dine</a> <span class="index">(#1098)</span>) with my wife, were instead of generic food we had *white rice* (presumably because we just got married) and there was a# brilliant# *fire* in the fireplace on the left.\<br></br>Simplified 灿# brilliant# = *fire*, *mountain*. Story: A dumb tourist gets the# brilliant# idea of checking out an erupting *fire mountain*, i.e. volcano.\<br></br>Here we have two *Rice* University students standing in London’s Hyde Park, waving radio *antennas* for the entire *evening*, pretending that they are famous conductors at the Royal Opera House. Well, this makes their *right hands* get pretty cold, so one of them suggests, let’s light a *fire* so we can stay warm. The other says, “brilliant”!\<br></br>When we think of# brilliant# ideas, we think of flashes of insight. In the past, there were no bulbs, so that flash was represented by a *flame*. Sadly, these# brilliant# ideas were thought to be connected to sorcery, represented by the *magic wand*. Commonly, a# brilliant# person shared his ideas in the *evening* with his supposed friends, even shaking their *right hand*. Those people would then go and mark his door with a picture of *rice*.
粉	To get a fine soft talc-like #powder# from white *rice*, we need to pass it through #eight# #blades#.\<br></br>PARTS of parts of parts of parts of RICE... is# POWDER#. (Image: geishas# powder#ing their faces with RICE FLOUR [RTK1 keyword] to make them white.)--dingomick.\<br></br>A large *part* of *Rice* University is sealed off while police investigate a suspicious white# powder# that turns out to be flour. [Whew – 50 characters a day for the last four days over my February college break. If I can do it, you can do it! But it does take up most of my day.].
瞇	Why are you# squint#ing with your *eyeballs*? I *lost* my glasses, so I have to# squint# to see anything!\<br></br>A #squint# in someone's #eye# often means that they are #lost#.\<br></br>Simplified 眯# squint# = *eyes*, *rice*. Story: While on vacation in China, you get your name in Chinese painted on a single grain of *rice*. Of course, you immediately drop in on a bustling sidewalk, and now must# squint# your *eyes* to try and find it again.\<br></br>#Squint# is what your *eyeball* does in order to hide in embarrassment for getting you *lost*.\<br></br>If you# squint# too much with one of your *eyeballs*, you may wake up one day and find that it’s *lost* forever. (Not true!).
幣	We've made some counterfeit# currency# out of a papery towel material, but the cops are on us! We have to shred it all ASAP to destroy the evidence.\<br></br>To curb inflation, a government decides to put bags of its# currency# through the *shredder*. An employee stands below the large machine wiping her head with a *towel* since it’s tough work.\<br></br>#Currency# according to Maoist orthodoxy is a temporary necessity. Mao , the great helmsman(#taskmaster#) , would have preferred to #shred# all# currency# ; ritually washing his hands ( and drying them with a #towel# ) of the whole filthy cash nexus. *Simple mainlanders* [#币#] however continue to handle# currency# and have #drop#ped the whole #towel# ritual.\<br></br>Simplified 币# Currency# = *drop*, *towel*.\<br></br>The *shredder* is the essential tool to transform towels into counterfeit #currency# such as 人民幣.\<br></br>SHREDDER shreds up TOWELS to make counterfeit# CURRENCY#.
斃	The worst way to #die a violent death# is to pass through the *shredder* to your #death#.\<br></br>Simplified 毙# die a violent death# = *compare*, *death*. Story: Two people *compare* life stories as they sit and await to# die a violent death# by firing squad. The *Grim Reaper* then appears from below to *compare* which one deserves to #die a more violent death#.\<br></br>To meet your *death* by falling through a paper *shredder* would indeed entail #dying a violent death#. Don’t let it happen! Note how *death* is appropriately located under the *shredder*, which is (ugh) where you would come out . . .\<br></br>I can think of no *death* more #violent# than to meet your end in a *paper shredder*.
蔽	In order to truly #shelter# your loved ones from any harm, you cover everything with a thick layer of *flowers* passed through the #shredder#.\<br></br>Imagine Dandelions uprooting and running to find a# shelter# from the "*flower shredder*," i.e. a lawnmower.\<br></br>It’s really not sensible to donate *flowers* to the animal# shelter#, since there are hundreds of furry *shredders* waiting to tear them up. Why not donate toys instead?\<br></br>When the FLOWERS see the SHREDDER (i.e. Ninja Turtles) coming they take# shelter#.
撇	FINGERS holding the letter, it is# cast aside# to the SHREDDER when you're done reading it.\<br></br>A criminal in *Tokyo* repents and #casts aside# his *shredder* -- he’s tired of covering up the group’s illegal activity! Unfortunately he casts aside the *shredder* right out the window and into downtown *Tokyo* 20 stories down, where it lands right on a parked car.
弊	To cover up serious financial# fraud#, this man stuffs documents into the *shredder* with his *two hands* as fast as he can – he hears police sirens in the background.\<br></br>The SHREDDER hates# fraud#s impersonating him and beats them up with his TWO HANDS.
筍	In order for *bamboo* to grow new and tasty #bamboo shoots#, it takes precisely one #decameron#.\<br></br>A# bamboo shoot# is young bamboo under a decameron old; after that, it harden and grows into a stalk.\<br></br>A health magazine suggests that you try eating nothing but *bamboo* from# bamboo shoot#s for a *decameron* (ten days). But wait –this magazine is owned by a bamboo company!
筒	A #tube# made of *bamboo* is allotted to each *monk* to handle their... ahem... "needs" (like a primitive flesh light). CAREFUL: pipe {<a href="/study/kanji/967">pipe</a> <span class="index">(#967)</span>} 管.\<br></br>These you#tube# clips about China all start with images of *bamboo*. They all look the *same* to me.\<br></br>These *monks* are far too busy growing *bamboo* trees to watch some silly program on the# tube#.\<br></br>Seriously, all BAMBOO sticks look the SAME, just long CYLINDERS. Should the story be more complicated?--thanks to Nukemarine.\<br></br>MONKS wield BAMBOO# tube#s (staffs) as a weapon.
築	You think about #constructing# a permanent Christmas tree using *I-beams* decorated with *bamboo* leaves. But you give up after a while and settle for an *ordinary* *Christmas tree*, originally at the ‘bottom’ of your list (hence its placement at the bottom of this character).\<br></br>To #construct# a *bamboo* #tree# fort requires *I-beams* of *ordinary* size and shape. CAREFUL: create {<a href="/study/kanji/271">create</a> <span class="index">(#271)</span>} 造, build {<a href="/study/kanji/370">build</a> <span class="index">(#370)</span>} 建.\<br></br>You want to# construct# a tree house, but instead of using *ordinary I-beams*, you opt for *strengthened bamboo* to give it that Asian flavor.\<br></br>Simplified 筑 : Just another normal day at work# construct#ing a building but in HK they use Bamboo for scaffold!\<br></br>There are several materials you can use to# construct# a building-- bamboo, an I-beam, and wood for example. Just make sure your materials can stand a little breeze of wind, and try not to make the design too ordinary!
笨	Teacher : "Young pandas that prioritize eating #bamboo# above studying their #notebooks# are# stupid# creatures .... aren't they boys and girls !?!".\<br></br>I'm going to take 本 here to be a #tree# that's going to be cut down, since there's a line or perforation at the base where someone plans to cut. Little is more #stupid# than planning to *cut down* all the #bamboo#.\<br></br>To use BAMBOO to make BOOKS is really a# stupid# idea. (we need to protect bamboos because the panda is an endangered species).\<br></br>If you give a child *bamboo* to look at instead of *notebooks* filled with knowledge, it’s possible that he/she will grow up to be# stupid# (but we hope not). Sound: ben4 I think I know this one by now. Ben4!\<br></br>A NOTEBOOK about BAMBOO seems kind of# stupid#.
箭	When loading an #arrow#, the sharp *bamboo* goes #in front# (the feathers in the back).\<br></br>Militant vegetarians fire# arrow#s made out of sustainably raised, animal product-free *bamboo* at a *butcher’s shop*. Watch out everyone!\<br></br>Warriors carrying their BAMBOO shields IN FRONT of them to guard against# arrow#s.
筋	*Bamboo* easily cuts through #tendon#, which is the connective tissue between *flesh* and *muscle*.\<br></br>A samurai runs after Achilles with a *bamboo* sword, knowing that if he can slice through the *flesh* of his Achilles’# tendon#, he will lose all of his *power*.\<br></br>#Tendon#s are a PART OF THE BODY that have the POWER of BAMBOO.
伍	MR. T greets Spock with his FIVE fingers making a V.\<br></br>*Mitt Romney* agrees that Star Wars V, the *5th* movie of the franchise, is the best of all time, and is hence his favorite. The light saber scene with Luke and Darth Vader near the end is just so good . . . [I have no idea what Mitt Romney’s favorite movie is.].
仇	MR. T a Yankees fan, feels# animosity# toward any other BASEBALL team.\<br></br>There is a lot of# animosity# towards *Mr. T* in the *nine* circles of hell, because so many of his opponents ended up there.\<br></br>[In Book 1, I depicted Mitt Romney during his time on the campaign trail. Book 2 depicts an alternate universe in which *Mitt Romney* is the president.] *President Romney* encounters such immense# animosity# in his first month at the White House that he considers leaving the presidency and coaching a little league *baseball team*.
倡	*Mr. T's prosperous* acting career #started# with Rocky III.\<br></br>*President Romney* explains that his goal as president is to# start# the economy again and make everyone *prosperous*.\<br></br>MR. T has defeated the dictator and the once oppressed people are now ready to# start# a PROSPEROUS new future.
伯	MR. T searching for his father's older brother sends out a DOVE to locate him.\<br></br>I have no clue who *Mitt Romney’s* father’s older brother is, but he is likely to be *white*.\<br></br>Everyone has one of THOSE uncles... My father's older brother is a total white supremacist. He screams whenever he sees Mr. T on television. I'm ashamed to be related to him...
仲	When *Mr. T* was a bouncer, he often came upon two people #mid-#fight, so he would have get in the *middle* and break it up.\<br></br>*President Romney* must prepare for the# mid-#term elections that will occur in the *middle* of his first term.\<br></br>How old is Mr. T anyway? He's not really popular anymore, must be going through a# mid-#life crisis.\<br></br>MR. T always finds himself in the MIDDLE or# mid-#way fighting the battle of good versus evil.
估	MR. T is ANCIENT but no one can# estimate# just how old he really is.\<br></br>Trying to# estimate# this ancient person's age (soon to be in the pictographic graveyard) when each year for them melds into one is very tough!\<br></br>Trying to #estimate# the age of a #person# who is #ancient# is a bad scenario! CAREFUL: approximate {<a href="/study/kanji/1102">approximate</a> <span class="index">(#1102)</span>}, 概.\<br></br>*President Romney* #estimates# that the sushi in the White House fridge is pretty *ancient*, and hence he doesn’t want to have a single piece.
偵	MR. T has been with a lot of women and can easily# detect# which ones are CHASTE. (Sorry!).\<br></br>*Mr. T* has been hired as a private# detect#ive. Here we see him lying in the bushes with binoculars as he# detect#s whether the husband is *chaste* when he is 'away on a business trip'.\<br></br>You don’t need to be a# detect#-ive to# detect# that *Mitt Romney* lives a *chaste* life, i.e. no adultery.
俱	#Altogether#, *Mr. T* actually owns three *tool* boxes: one to fix his car, of course, and then one for his hair styling supplies, and finally, a third one for his jewelry cleaning items.\<br></br>#Altogether# *Mitt Romney* pays about $2,000 for power *tools* to redecorate the Oval Office.\<br></br>MR. T like Macguyver with any TOOL can accomplish any task# altogether#.
側	MR. T defies the RULES of physics by dodging the bullet with a quick# lateral# move.\<br></br>[Neither the meaning nor the part of speech of# lateral#, but:] *President Romney* declares that it is no longer against the *rules* of American football to throw a forward# lateral#, since that way the game will be more fun.
佑	#People# on the #right# are often more religiously focused and thus may be found saying "God #bless#!".\<br></br>MR. T# bless#es his opponents with a RIGHT hook to the jaw.\<br></br>Ah-chu!# Bless# you! -- *Mr. T* covers his face with his *right* elbow as he sneezes.\<br></br>*President Romney* says that it should not just be the political *right* who says “God# bless# America.” The left protests, saying that they say it too.
佐	*Mr. T* puts his *left* arm around his# assistant# as he gives him some instructions.\<br></br>(It seems easier to expand the primitive here) An #assistant# is a *person* *by my side* that is actually doing all my *work*.\<br></br>A right-hand man is second-in-command, but a left-hand-man is nothing more than an# assistant#.\<br></br>#People# on the #left# are generally more compassionate and thus willing to work as an #assistant#.\<br></br>*President Romney* appoints a couple of# assistant#s from the political *left* to demonstrate how open-minded and inclusive his presidency will be.

They had to look perfect!\<br></br>*President Romney* makes headlines by appointing a very# meticulous# *child* to be his secretary of education, arguing that she’ll be a good role model for the other students and inject some youth into his cabinet.
俏	A #person# always looks more #comely# by the light of a *candle*.\<br></br>MR. T may be a hero, but if you put a CANDLE to his face, few will see# comely# (good-looking).\<br></br>*President Romney*’s first executive order: only# comely# (pleasant/attractive) *candles* will permitted in the White House. None of this postmodern junk.

侍	It's *Mr. T's* first time to visit a *Buddhist temple*. It's now time for the customary vegetarian lunch, but not knowing any better, Mr. T bluntly asks, "So when are they going to# serve# the meat?".\<br></br>*President Romney* says that we should admire the residents of *Buddhist temples* for the many ways that they# serve# the surrounding community.\<br></br>MR. T has retired and now# serve#s at the TEMPLE.
伙	Mr. T is a highly passionate man. When he has a new# mate#r-- even if it's just a partner# mate#, not some kind of lover-- the fires in his soul burn passionately for that person. What a# mate#!\<br></br>Generally, your #mate# is the #person# that makes you feel on #fire# (be it with anger, lust, love, etc)!\<br></br>Imagine *President Romney* saying that Anne, his# mate#, still lights him on *fire* with love.\<br></br>MR. T yells to his first# mate#: "FIRE!".
宿	MR. T charges you a HUNDRED dollars to# stay overnight# at his HOUSE. Hey, even he has to pay the bills!\<br></br>Imagine winning a contest to# stay overnight# at *Mr. T's* *house* with a *hundred* other contest winners. It'll be the slumber party of the century!\<br></br>To #stay overnight# at this *house*, the charge per #person# is one #hundred# local currency units.\<br></br>*Mitt Romney* tries to persuade voters that he’s not an aloof rich guy by saying, “I once #stayed overnight# at a guest *house* that only charged *100* dollars a night!” As opposed to, you know, $400 or $1000. Sound: su4 If you’re lucky, your *Japanese* guest will cook su-shi for you when he #stays overnight.#.\<br></br>To# stay overnight#, even *Thor* is expected to pay *one hundred* dollars. Remember, this all takes place in a *house* of ill repute.
伏	(NSFW) Mr. T tells his lover "bend over!" and then they do it doggy style.\<br></br>The doctor has an incredibly unique way of performing prostate exams and colonoscopies: he asks the #person# to #bend over# and then jams a *chihuahua* up their rear to scout things out.\<br></br>When people see MR. T they# bend over# like CHIHUAHUAS in respect.\<br></br>*Mr. T* is in tough times and he gets told to# bend over# and play the role of a *chihuahua*.\<br></br>Encounter between *Mr. T* and a (loudly barking) *chihuahua*: you can see Mr. T# bend over# deeply to stare down the chihuahua, causing the dog to shut up# bend over# backwards to do Mr. T's bidding.\<br></br>*President Romney* kills time on boring days by teaching the White House *chihuahua* to# bend over#.
袱	(Essentially Swilkins1984’s story): Using# wrapping cloth# is easy: take a large, unwanted *cloak* and just repeatedly *bend* it *over* the thing you want to take with you.\<br></br>This makes me think of swaddling cloth like in the manger story, and since I sometimes use 人 for Jesus (even though I am an atheist): the #wrapping cloth# used in the manger was a dirty *cloak* they wrapped *Jesus* and (accidentally) a *chihuahua* (it was a manger full of animals after all) up in.\<br></br>BEND OVER the CLOAK and it becomes a# wrapping cloth#.
偷	If a #person# is found guilty of #stealing#, they are sent to the *slaughterhouse*. This s not because of the death penalty, but because the *slaughterhouse* is just a really shitty place to work.\<br></br>MR.T is hungry so he# steal#s from the SLAUGHTERHOUSE.\<br></br>*President Romney* disputes in a press conference that Mexican *slaughterhouse* workers are really #stealing# American jobs, because honestly, who wants to work in a slaughterhouse?
伐	*Mr. T* can use all sorts of weapons. In this episode of the A-Team he# fell#s an opponent with a *halberd*.\<br></br>If you can# fell# *Mr. T* in the octagon, he'll throw a big *fiesta* just for you!\<br></br>*Jesus* #fell# a huge *fiesta* because he thought is was too sinful.\<br></br>*President Romney* #fells# the Education Department’s budget once he learns that they essentially have a *fiesta* in their headquarters every day.\<br></br>MR. T# fell#s the monster and is honored at the FIESTA.
佩	*Mr. T* has just gotten out of the shower when a gust of *wind* from the *ceiling* fan blows his *towel* off. Now he has nothing to# wear at the waist#!\<br></br>My friend *Phil* has been caught in a #windstorm# wearing nothing but a #towel#, which blows up the *ceiling*. HOMG.\<br></br>*President Romney* disputes that people should be allowed to# wear at the waist# a gun wherever they want. A political *windstorm* ensues, and hate mail reaches the *ceiling* of the White House. But President Romney remains firm, saying, “I’m right, and I won’t throw in the political *towel*.”.\<br></br>Even *Thor*, mighty god of thunder that he is, will take shelter from the *wind* beneath the *ceiling* of his house. There, he'll likely be seen with his favorite *towel* that he likes to# wear at the waist#.
佈	Don't think of this as Thor with a cloth, but rather rich tapestries that# announce# all of Thor's victories and triumphs.\<br></br>*President Romney*# announce#s that the country has ran out of *cloth*, and hence no more American flags can be created. Weeks of mourning ensue.\<br></br>There's a myth about a hero (Mr. T) who slays the Minotaur. Coming home, he was to raise either a black or yellow cloth to# announce# whether he won or lost-- but he forgot and the king was in depression.
僑	*Mr. T* aint no *angel*, so he prefers to# live abroad# and experience the. . ."finer" things in life.\<br></br>*Mr. T* gets visited by an *angel* who tells him to go and# live abroad# because America is about to be subject to divine vengeance!\<br></br>Mr. T, like many celebrities, is an expat who lives abroad under a pseudonym. He now pretends that he was never an American, so the locals don't get suspicious about his real identity.\<br></br>(NOTE: I am not a Christian, but I find Jesus works well as a person for 人.) The Mormons believe that *Jesus* did indeed #live abroad#, as was revealed to Joseph Smith by an *angel*.\<br></br>For various reasons (like not wanting to pay as much in taxes), a lot of American companies currently ‘live abroad’ in places like the Cayman Islands. *President Romney* offers to give money to those businesses who currently #live abroad# if they will move to the City of *Angels* (LA) and help grow the economy there.\<br></br>MR. T dies in battle and is taken by ANGEL to# live abroad# in heaven.
億	Simplified 亿# one hundred million# = *person*, *fishhook*. Story: *Mr. T* is so famous, that he could be in a TV commercial about something as lame as *fishhooks* and still make# one hundred million# dollars.\<br></br>Mr T doesn't get million dollar ideas, he thinks bigger, he gets# one hundred million# dollar ideas.\<br></br>My friend *Phil* thinks all his lousy #ideas# are worth #one hundred million# dollars.\<br></br>*President Romney* has what he thinks is a great *idea*: help all Americans earn# one hundred million# dollars.
傾	*President Romney* authorizes funds for a ski resort in Northeast DC that will be *100 Chinese acres* wide and will# incline# steeply downhill.\<br></br>*Phil* builds an #inclined# plane using a *spoon*and a piece of *paper*. Primitive!\<br></br>Remember again our story of balancing a spoon on your head. *Thor* himself has taken this test and discovered that he# incline#s to one side.
侮	MR. T# insult#s EVERY person he sees.\<br></br>The best way to# insult# *Mr. T* is to throw a *Yo' momma* joke at him because he's actually very sensitive about his mother.\<br></br>#Every# #person# is susceptible to some form of #insult#. Or, alternatively, *Phil* has come up with a super-#insult#: an #insult# that can offend #every# person.\<br></br>It seems that *every* journalist loves to# insult# *President Romney.* That is their first amendment right, of course.
倍	MR. T has been captured and MUZZLED by the enemy many# times#, but he always escapes.\<br></br>*Mr. T* can *muzzle* everyone into silence. He's so intimidating that he manages even to *muzzle* the New York# Times# and prevent them from publishing a negative article about Mr. T.\<br></br>Some writers for the New York# Times# fantasize about putting a large *muzzle* over *President Romney*’s mouth so that he can’t say anything.\<br></br>The New York# Times# always has a special section dedicated to Mr. T! In the latest issue, it shows that Mr. T managed to capture a bunch of terrorists and muzzle them.
仿	MR. T refuses to# mimic# anybody. He operates on his own COMPASS.\<br></br>*Mr. T* has become so adept at #mimicry# that the only way you can be sure that the person you're talking to isn't *Mr. T* in disguise is by using this special *Mr. T compass* that always points in his direction. (I find this an amusing story considering how unconvincing Mr. T would be at# mimic#king anyone!).\<br></br>In RPGs,# mimic#s usually appear as chests. This *person*, though, has #mimicked# into a *compass*! Sneaky prick!\<br></br>A comedian makes a healthy living by #mimicking# *Mitt Romney*. He goes around saying “now the country is heading in the right *direction*.”.
傲	The most #haughty# people I know are evangelical Christians: they believe that *Jesus* rose from the *dirt* to #release# them from their sins.\<br></br>Crazy ol' Hitler is so# haughty#-- he flings dirt in all directions, screaming "you're dirt! Dirt!" at everyone it hits. Finally, it hits passing Mr. T; Hitler's in for it now...\<br></br>Most fonts write #傲# as *Mr T ,cornstalk over ten thousand,taskmaster*. Thus : #Mr T# has constructed a huge straw effigy of #Hitler# from #10,000 cornstalks # -on the night of Halloween he'll be *proud* (# haughty# ) to set it alight for charity.\<br></br>(Thanks swilkins1984 and thecite) Regarding Imperial Japan (how did this come up at a press conference?), *President Romney* says, “the *Imperial Japanese Army* was so# haughty#, but the *direction* they were moving the country in was worth less than *dirt*.” (Note that, appropriately, *dirt* is above their *direction*.).\<br></br>KURT hates# HAUGHTY# people, so he SETS FREE SOIL on them.\<br></br>MR.T, the# haughty# TASKMASTER he is, assures the group he’s leading them in the right direction. Until he realizes his COMPASS is filled with DIRT. (Thanks thecite @ RTK).
僧	MR. T becomes a# Buddhist monk# to INCREASE his spiritual development.\<br></br>*Mr. T* decides to become a# Buddhist monk#. Imagine his surprise when he discovers that the *artist formerly known as Prince* is to become his spiritual master.\<br></br>An intriguing rumor spreads on the interwebs that *President Romney* was *formerly* a# Buddhist monk# before he decided to abandon monastic life and austerity for fame and riches.
悠	Now that Hitler's insulted Mr. T, the latter grabs a walking stick and tells the former dictator that his beating will come slowly,# without haste#... This can't be good for Hitler's heart!\<br></br>A member of the *Imperial Japanese Army* tries to attack *President Romney*, but *President Romney* fends off the *Imperial Japanese Army* with a *walking stick*. He does so# without haste#, however, because he knows that deep inside, this troubled man has a good *heart*.
俄	*Mr. T* visits# Russia# and comes back wearing an *I* (heart)# Russia# T-Shirt!\<br></br>*President Romney*’s first international affairs gaffe: he says, “I’m not a *miser*. If you’re looking for a miser, go to# Russia#.”.\<br></br>Mr T's ego swells when he is in# Russia#, they love him there after growing up watching the A-team in the 80's.\<br></br>MR.T goes to# Russia# where everything is expensive. He must be a MISER with his money to not go broke.
儀	*Mr. T* throws the most *righteous*# rite# of passage parties!\<br></br>Many Christians consider it their primary #rite# to be *Jesus*-#righteous#. (And given the Christians I've met online and the quality of their spelling, they think it is also their primary #rite# [right] - hahaha!).\<br></br>*President Romney* naturally disagrees with a columnist who says that Mormon# Rite#s are full of self-*righteousness*.\<br></br>Becoming an adult means you must be strong and wise. As a# rite# of passage, all boys of the age of 18 must fight Mr. T while reciting righteous passages from multiple great literary works! Good luck!\<br></br>When a PERSON becomes RIGHTEOUS it is a# rite# of passage.
侄	You can't call *Mr. T* an uncle *until* he actually gets a# nephew#.\<br></br>MR. T can't wait UNTIL his# nephew# arives.\<br></br>*President Romney* can’t wait *until* he has a# nephew# because then he’ll get to be someone’s ‘rich uncle.’.
仙	An #immortal# is, by definition, a #person# who will live to be as old as #mountains#.\<br></br>MR. T climbs the MOUNTAIN to fight the supposedly un-killable# immortal#.\<br></br>The #immortal# Elves are *mountain* *people*. (仙人 = elf).\<br></br>A columnist sneers, “*President Romney* must think he’s an# immortal# and that he gets his own *mountain* when he dies.”.
俗	*Mr. T* has many strange# custom#s. They originate from his early years, when he grew up in a secluded *valley*.\<br></br>*Mr. T* is an amateur anthropologist, studying the local #customs# of the *valley folk*.\<br></br>It is an ever-growing #custom# for *Jesus-freaks* to procreate via the #valley# (rather than the other entryway) in order to maintain their virginity.\<br></br>Imagine that it’s *Mitt Romney’s*# custom# to travel to Silicon *Valley* to solicit political donations from Republican computer manufacturers, however few there are there.\<br></br>Like a god, Mr. T was never a baby-- he sprang fully-formed from the nadir of a valley. Every year, it's his# custom# to go back and visit the place of his birth.\<br></br>It is not# custom# for MR.T to be spotted in the VALLEY.
償	*Mr. T* receives a *prize* from the president, to# repay# him for the great service he has done to the country.\<br></br>Simplified [#偿#] : see <a href="/study/kanji/1896">taste</a> <span class="index">(#1896)</span> . #Mr T's# has always liked the #taste# of a really hot curry but the one he had last night gave him food poisoning - *he was in the outhouse misting up the window* all night long - he's going back to the curry house today and they sure better# repay# him !\<br></br>*Mr T* pulling his *prize*, a shell, out of the outhouse toilet bowl. This was to #repay# him for his daily service of placing the prizes in the toilet in the first place. (This #fulfills# his life-long dream of getting the prize himself. 得償夙願）.\<br></br>*Jesus* was illegible to receive the #prize#, and as a result, has to #repay# it.\<br></br>*President Romney* says to his campaign workers, “I can never# repay# you guys for winning first *prize* for me in the election.” [Again, we’re in an alternate universe here in Hanziland.].\<br></br>Mr. T won a bunch of boxing prizes! But he didn't know that the winner still has to# repay# the organizers the cost of the prizes, what a ripoff...
臥	Every place that is #for sleeping# now requires one #feudal official# to be posted per #person# to ensure that the facilities are indeed used #FOR SLEEPING# and not for any hanky-panky.\<br></br>Simplified 卧 : SnowWhite, the pantomine #underling/servant# , had been sweeping and cleaning the dwarves house and was nearly finished when the the evil Queen came dressed as an old hag .......... the Prince approached the glass cask made #for the sleeping# SnowWhite ... and with one kiss the #magic spell# was broken..... cue end titles.\<br></br>Simplified 卧# for sleeping# = *feudal official*, *magic wand*.\<br></br>I caught my goons sleeping on the job. I ask them "what do you think I hire people for?!" They had the gall to say "for sleeping...".
傍	#Mr T#'s fear of flying means he is sailing to Europe. His liner approaches Lisbon - "Look, #Magellan#'s statue - we're# close to# land !!!!" .....#BANG# ... *too close* !\<br></br>*President Romney* takes a summer vacation by visiting a couple of the tropical islands that *Magellan* sailed# close to#.\<br></br>A *person* has informed his captain *Magellan* that they are, in fact,# close to# land!\<br></br>Mr. T's actually a big softie, you know! He's even kind of romantic. He says things to his lover like "Stay# close to# me... always be by my side" like some cliche shoujo manga male lead.
俺	*Mr. T* tells his hapless companions, standing on top of an impossible cliff: "we are going to fly a *hang glider* to get down." "How are# we# going to do that, as there's only one hang glider?" "Did I say# we#? I meant #we (exclusive)#.".\<br></br>The #exclusive# we## being referred to here are the #persons# who can afford such luxuries as *hang gliding*.\<br></br>*President Romney* admits:# we# are a little exclusive; #we (exclusive)# own his-and-hers *hang gliders*.
淹	When the world has been# INUNDATE#D with WATER, the only way to travel around the water world is with HANG GLIDERS.\<br></br>If someone wants to be fully initiated into *hang gliding* without being #inundated# and dying, the best thing to do is make sure you are over #water# while *hang gliding* to avoid injury.\<br></br>You unfortunately# inundate# your expensive *hang glider* in a body of *water* -- by slamming into it! Fortunately you’re OK, but I’m not very optimistic about the *hang glider*.
掩	A true miracle of modern science would be a *hang glider* that you could #conceal# in your *fingers*: "Go, go gadget *hang glider*!\<br></br>The secret agent has snapped his *fingers* to quickly deploy the *hang glider* he has# conceal#ed inside his suit.\<br></br>Imagine *hang gliders* are absolutely forbidden in *Tokyo*, and hence you need to find a place to# conceal# your *Hang glider*. Unfortunately there’s absolutely no space to# conceal# a *Hang glider* in *Tokyo*, so best to fess up to the authorities, I suppose.
催	You are walking your pet *pterodactyl* when you see *Mr. T* approaching down the sidewalk. However, he promptly crosses the street while mumbling, "I wouldn't# prod# that thing with a ten-foot-pole.".\<br></br>*Pterodactyl* Lovers of America gently #prods# *President Romney* to double federal spending on dinosaur fossil research.\<br></br>Curious of this strange creature, here we see *Thor* gently trying to# prod# the vicious *pterodactyl*.
摧	My cute pet *pterodactyl Cui* used his talon *fingers* to# wreck# his cage and break free. Now I'm a nervous# wreck# worrying about if he's okay =(.\<br></br>If you want to understand the meaning of a #wreck# (nervous #wreck#), try the job of *pterodactyl*-*finger*er.\<br></br>#Wreck# just makes me think of# Wreck#-it Ralph. One of the video game levels he goes to (that didn't make it into the movie, I guess) is a dinosaur land. He uses his freakishly huge hands to grab hold of and tame a pterodactyl, and rides that pterodactyl into all the other game lands.\<br></br>A *Pterodactyl* #wrecks# much of downtown *Tokyo* before Godzilla, of all creatures, stops him. “This is my city, not yours!” he says.\<br></br>In 'Jurassic Park 3', the PTERODACTYLS used their huge talon FINGERS to# wreck# their cage and break free.
攜	You# take along# your toy pterodactyl everywhere you go in your backpack, but unfortunatedly it was *wrecked* recently. When you lift the *hood* of your backpack, you see wrecked *animal legs* and the huge *mouth* (beak) of the pterodactyl all mixed in a big mess. You decide never to# take along# your toys anymore.\<br></br>A little hooded thing with two legs and a prominent mouth? Why, who does Wreck-it Ralph# take along# with him on his journey other than the chatty hoodie-wearing Vanellope Von Schweetz?\<br></br>Simplified 携# take along# = *finger*, *turkey*, *fist*. Story: You are going to a friend's house and want to# take along# your pet *turkey*. You first call it nicely with your *finger*, but eventually you get tired of waiting and just grab it by the feet with your *fist*. Let's go!\<br></br>Notice that the motorcycle helmet element on the bottom right is the same as in #salesman# (character <a href="/study/kanji/416">salesman</a> <span class="index">(#416)</span>), so I take this to mean *for sale*. No matter where you go, always #take along# your prize possession: the *finger* of a *pterodactyl*. If you ever need money, you can put it up *for sale* and know that you will be safe.\<br></br>[Once you learn this character you will have fewer than 1000 to go!] The *Pterodactyl* had to# take along# a disguise to make it into *Tokyo* (in order to wreck it, see <a href="/study/kanji/2036">wreck</a> <span class="index">(#2036)</span>). This disguise was simply a *hood* with *animal legs* taped to the bottom and a *mouth* drawn over the top. Hence, people assumed that the Pterodactyl was just a strange foreigner or an actor, rather than a vicious monster.\<br></br>Well, we've *wreck*ed this sample. We better #take it along# and hope the scientists can figure out what the hell kind of animal had a *hood*, *animal legs* and a mouth.
符	This made me think of calligraphy stamps. If you buy a premade one, they are cheap, but if you want a nice *bamboo* one with your own #symbol#, you have to #pay#.\<br></br>*Factoid* : In the 1800's there was a severe silver shortage and this resulted in #bamboo# *tallies* being used as a# symbol# of "trust" - that the bank would honour the face value - just like paper money. These #bamboo# *tallies* were used to #pay# for all the goods and services that previously silver coins had.\<br></br>Here is someone *paying* $500 for the latest status# symbol#, a Tiffany *bamboo* necklace.\<br></br>*Bamboo* is just one of the many signs of China. Given the current economic situation, you'd likely have to *pay* a hefty fee just to see some.

So if you ask me any question about# Holland#, my answer will be flowers.\<br></br>When it comes to *flowers*, the answer to every *question* is #Holland#.\<br></br>#Holland# is a place where someone like *President Romney* *can* go and buy all the *flowers* he wants.\<br></br>WHAT country do these FLOWERS come from and WHERE can I get them?

仗	The #Battle# of the Bulges consists of #people# fencing with their #100 Chinese inches#. :-).\<br></br>*President Romney* and the Chinese government mutually sign a historic piece of legislation: rockets over *100 Chinese inches* long may not be used in# battle# so as to prevent civilian casualties.
杖	This #cane# made of *wood*, instead of serving as a prosthetic for your legs, is a prosthetic for your #100 Chinese inches#, if you know what I mean.\<br></br>A philanthropic family buys a *Christmas tree* that is *100 Chinese inches* in length. They then reveal their charitable side by cutting it into dozens of# cane#s for the elderly poor.\<br></br>The# cane# for a really tall man is WOODEN and about 100 CHINESE INCHES long.\<br></br>The piece of *wood* the old man uses just to walk *100 Chinese inches*.
夾	Our #St Bernard# is growing and growing - to get it in the back of the truck the *two of us* have to# press from both sides#...\<br></br>Simplified 夹# Press from both sides# = *husband*, *animal horns*. (I believe Heisig makes a mistake by using *not yet* instead of *husband*). Story: *Homer* is stuck between a pair of *animal horns* that# press from both sides#.\<br></br>The very definition of a chivalrous person is the guy who still doesn't complain when he's pressed from both sides by people and feeling like a lowly dog. Going to use this as the primitive meaning 2044 "chivalrous person.".
俠	#Mr T# may not slay dragons or rescue damsels in distress - but if #pressed from both sides# he will stand back, hold the door open , and let everyone else enter first . As a# chivalrous person# he knows that *manners maketh man*.\<br></br>A #chivalrous person# must remain chivalrous despite being #pressed from both sides# by temptation and evil.
頰	This character refers to that nasty habit that people have of grabbing people's #head# and squeezing their #cheeks# (#pressing from both sides#).\<br></br>During the war women could not get *rouge* so they #pressed their head from both sides# to make their# cheek#s red.\<br></br>A normal person would be angry when slapped on the head, but a chivalrous person, like Jesus, would turn the other# cheek#.\<br></br>A woman has two lovers who are unaware of each other – and she’s unaware of them. They simultaneously kiss her# cheek# and hence *press from both sides* into her *head*. Then they see each other, and . . . hey! She sees them, and . . . hey!
狹	The successful #wild dog pack# starts with stampeding their quarry by #pressing from both sides# and then they must# narrow# their sights on the weak and .....\<br></br>Even when he's in a# narrow# alleyway and there's not much room to move, a chivalrous person will deliberately back out just so that a wild animal can pass through, rather than shooing the animal away. What a nice guy!\<br></br>It is #narrow# to think that *wild dog* *animal abuse* is worse than the abuse of domestic livestock.\<br></br>Jesus instructs us to go the# narrow# way. Here is a figurative illustration of that# narrow# way: *packs of wild dogs* are *pressing from both sides* onto you. You must have the courage and go down this path despite the challenges it presents.
挾	In order to #coerce# you, your *fingers* are placed into a vice grip and progressively #pressed in from both sides#.\<br></br>One meaning of# coerce# is “to restrain by force” (Wiktionary), which seems to go in line with Wiktionary’s translations for this character: “clasp under arm” and “hold to bosom”. In *Tokyo*’s subways, the fellow passengers *press from both sides* onto you because the trains are so crowded. You feel as though they are #coercing# you to stay on the train, even though you’d like to get off at the next stop.
峽	A #gorge# is just an area where the #mountains# #press from both sides#.\<br></br>A# gorge# is simply a river that *mountains* *press from both sides.*.
傘	Here we have an# umbrella# (or to put it more primitively, an *umbrella*) being tugged at by *four people* to the point that it is almost ripping apart. Why do they want it so badly? Because it’s normally $300, but on sale today for *ten* dollars.\<br></br>A Taiwanese# Umbrella# has #10# *traditional* ribs and can shelter #4 persons#,wife,mother-in-law,father-in-law and husband - whereas the simple mainland# umbrella# [ 伞 } with #10# simple ribs can only shelter the wife and mother-in-law - the husband and father-in-law are on the #horns# of a dilemma - get soaking wet or emigrate to Taiwan...
聚	To lead an uprising against the evil director, you ask all the factory workers to *take* a weapon and# assemble# in the courtyard. You expect a whole *multitude*, but unfortunately only half turned up.\<br></br>TAKE -> 衣 CLOTHING (375) and take away stroke 1 and 2 and place them to the lower left - then# ASSEMBLE# once more into a piece of CLOTHING.\<br></br>After you #assemble# things, you #take# them off the *assembly line*.\<br></br>When people# assemble#, the first thing you want to do is *take* the attendance.

Better luck next week.\<br></br>Remember this hit summer blockbuster, Avengers# Assemble#? *Take* a *multitude* of hit franchises and# assemble# them all together into one mega movie. It's a definite recipe for record breaking results.
挫	Something that really #frustrate#s is when you want to #sit# on the bus but can't because someone insists on occupying two seats by putting their *fingers* on the second seat.\<br></br>Thinking of training my dog-- I point and it and yell "sit!" but it doesn't move, and that# frustrate#s me...\<br></br>If you wish to *sit* down in the *Tokyo* subway, your fellow riders will likely# frustrate# your efforts, simply because they pack about a thousand people into each car.\<br></br>SITTING tapping your FINGERS on the table, you are# frustrate#d.
劍	Today we have debates on gun control.

What sharpness? Were background checks necessary?\<br></br>Simplified 剑# saber# = *hootenanny*, *saber*. Story: The owls are having a *hootenanny* to watch the Buffalo *Sabers* play in the NHL finals. A goal has just been scored, and all the owls are celebrating by ecstatically waving around their toy #sabres#.\<br></br>剑 This# SABER# is so sharp that it can slice a HOOTENANNY clean in two.
斂	In the psych ward, there is a heated *debate* amongst the *taskmasters* as to whether or not they should #restrain# the patients.\<br></br>敛 The TASKMASTER is going crazy in the HOOTENANNY. It's going to take everyone to# restrain# him.
撿	The minimum currency of change worthwhile to #pick up# off the ground with your *fingers* is a matter of some *debate*.\<br></br>A *finger* flies through the air and hits a passer-by in the *face*. The first thing he does it #pick it up# to check if it has a ring on it. Damn, not this time.\<br></br>捡 With your FINGERS you# pick up# garbage in the HOOTENANNY.
簽	There is a tie and which petition you decide to #sign# your name to will put an end to the #bamboo# #debate#: to support or prohibit bamboo farming.\<br></br>You must# sign# the BAMBOO log book to gain entry into the HOOTENANNY.
儉	The *people* of the world are all having *debates* about austerity measures, or how best to be# thrifty#.\<br></br>*President Romney* is appearing in the presidential *debates* in 2016 for his second term. He tells the voters, “with me, the government will always be# thrifty#, just like it should be. I can promise you that.”.\<br></br>俭 MR. T is a# thrifty# guy and lives in a low cost HOOTENANNY.
萊	So imagine you are working in a *flower* shop. A lady comes up to you, and you ask, ‘what *flowers* would you like to buy?’ She says that she would like to buy# lambsquarters#. You say, “*come* again?” She says,# lambsquarters#. You say, “*come* again?” She says,# lambsquarters#. You say, “*come again?*” . . .\<br></br>#Lambsquarters# are *flowers* (plants) that *come* from the foreign lands.\<br></br>As they are notorious weeds with seeds that stick to you, no matter where you go, #lambsquarters# *flowers* seem to #come# along for the ride.
葛	#Kudzu# is that clever kind of *flower* that infiltrates people’s backyards right when they are taking a *siesta* and don’t notice.\<br></br>#Kudzu# are *flowers* that grow over you when you take a *siesta*.
褐	For *siestas*, instead of the traditional martial arts belts, you receive *cloaks* for your level of expertise. #Brown# is the highest level colour of *cloak* you can get in the art of *siestas*.\<br></br>Why is my package late? Imagine a UPS driver dressed in# brown# CLOAK taking a SIESTA.
竭	After you #use up# the contents of a gigantic *vase*, it makes a perfect place to take a shady *siesta*.\<br></br>If you# use up# all of your money at the mall buying expensive *vases*, I guess all you can do is go back home and take a spending *siesta* as you evaluate your finances.\<br></br>We always have to# use up# all the water in the *vase* in order to wake up the men from their afternoon *siesta*.
歇	You really ought to# take a rest# if you are still *yawning* even after a *siesta*.\<br></br>Remember how food that is lacking is just a <a href="/study/kanji/2454">beverage</a> <span class="index">(#2454)</span>? well a *drink* that is *lacking* is just a break = '#take a rest#' is all you get.
揭	At the SIESTA, Zorro raises his mask with his FINGERS to# reveal# his true identity.\<br></br>Imagine that the Japanese media# reveal# that the prime minister spends all his days in *Tokyo* taking an all-day *siesta*.
淫	The# promiscuous# VULTURE is on top of the PORTER and appears to be committing a lewd act, so I throw WATER over the pair of them. (thanks Katsuo @ RTK).\<br></br>The# promiscuous# *vulture* lady (one that preys) will pour *water* over herself (oops!) every time the *porter* is near as he is obliged to help.\<br></br>Here we have the image of a #promiscuous# hotel *porter*: she is so riddled with STDs that a *vulture* sits on her, and in order to fend off death for another day, we have to spray her down with *water*.\<br></br>Here we have a# promiscuous# *vulture* (literally, a vulture) who hangs around the entrance to a hotel. He often swoops down to the lobby to try a pickup line on one woman or another. That’s when the luggage *porter* has to hose him off with *water*.
挺	#Erect# an insulting middle *finger* to the #royal court#.\<br></br>FINGERS to the brow, the soldiers stand# erect# in the presence of the ROYAL COURT.\<br></br>In *Tokyo’s* *royal court*, all the guards, officials and staff stand# erect# whenever the emperor happens to walk by.
瓦	Horror scene: Hanging from the CEILING, a PLOW and FISHHOOK DROPS OF blood down onto the# tile# bathroom floor. (thanks vosmiura @ RTK).\<br></br>Why not use reinforced steel #tiles# to protect your *ceiling*? Even if a hurricane slams *plows* and *fishhooks* into them, not a *drop* of water will leak inside.
瓷	The *next* best thing in bathroom decoration is to have Chinese# porcelain# *tiles*.\<br></br>My *secondary* school opted to go with lovely# porcelain# *tiles* to decorate our entrance, but all the kids started bashing them in with hammers. Really a shame.\<br></br>After marble, the NEXT best type of TILE is# porcelain#.
瓶	This is not an actual #bottle#, but one of those *puzzles* made of #tiles# that slide around, and the final image is actually of a #bottle#.\<br></br>*Puzzle* makers have to be creative. Here we see a jigsaw *puzzle* where all the little *tiles* have been put into a# bottle#. It's sold at the gift store.\<br></br>Yeah, it’s a real *puzzle* how that coke# bottle# got on the *tiles* of your roof. Did someone throw it up there? Did it get dropped from an airplane? Was it dropped from the International Space Station? Sound: ping2 The *Chinese* Ping Pong team knows that you should not drink a# bottle# of vodka before your match.\<br></br>It is a serious *puzzle* how they got this *tile* inside of the small# bottle#.\<br></br>The funky# BOTTLE# of elixir you bought actually looks like a jigsaw PUZZLE made of ceramic TILES (RTK keyword FLOWER POT).
鋁	The *metal* chosen for the *spine* replacements is, of course, lightweight, sturdy #aluminum#.\<br></br>This Wolverine is a phony. His METAL SPINE is coated with# aluminum# not adamantium.\<br></br>Suppose that# aluminum# has become the *metal* of choice for *spine* replacements because of its weight and bendability. [Don’t trust me on this – I’m no doctor, I’m just here to study Hanzi!!].
宮	The# palace# is a HOUSE that is the BACKBONE of a kingdom.\<br></br>The# palace# is the king’s super-private *house*, no guests allowed. Imagine that a guy tries to trespass by climbing over a security fence but then lands badly and damages his *spine*. Yeowwch!\<br></br>it's quite a sight.--thanks to fuaburisu.
瑩	I own a piece of jade that's so# lustrous#, my neighbor saw it and thought that its bright glow was a fire. He called the fire department, and they confiscated it to prevent further false alarms... now my# lustrous# jade is decoration for the firehouse!\<br></br>*simplified* [ #莹# ] - The *green*# lustrous# glow from my #greenhouse# has the appearance of #jade# - but are infact my girlfriends melons - MMmmmm tasty !!\<br></br>The local *firehouse* covers itself in *jade* stones in order to win the coveted Guinness Book of World Records title of “most# lustrous# *firehouse*.”.\<br></br>2 fires + crown = Olympic Cauldron, all the world's royalty along with their crown jewels were in attedence to watch the# lustrous# lighting of the cauldron.
螢	After the alarm was sounded, the whole *firehouse* ran out. Turns out it was just a bunch of #fireflies#: *insects* that look like fire.\<br></br>*Simplified* [ #萤# ] : When the nights get cold the #fireflies# head for my #greenhouse# - a pretty smart #insect# - they can keep warm and still attract mates and prey with their *lights*.\<br></br>The #firefly# is the official mascot *insect* of the *firehouse*.\<br></br>The# firefly# is the only *insect* banned from *firehouses*, given that it lights fires . . . pretty obvious from the name, right?
撈	Reminds me of the trash collectors in China who# scoop up# trash all day, having nothing but their *fingers* to perform their *labor* (as opposed to dump trucks in the US).\<br></br>In order to #scoop up# all the things they need to, the *fingers* of the *firehouse* men are incredibly *strong*.\<br></br>I imagine *Tokyo* desperately needs to hire foreign *labor* to manage its services, but some citizens probably wouldn’t even invite foreign *labor* there to# scoop up# . . . you know what.
煥	Here you have the most badass #glowing# animals of all time: a *firey* *dogsled team* of hellhounds!\<br></br>The reward for your team of four *sled dogs* is to sit in front of a# glowing# log cabin *fire* after a long day in rural Alaska.
旋	This character reminds me of the rhythmic gymnasts who compete in the Olympics—their specialty is #whirling# around with colorful *banners*. Now, the winner of the Superbowl gets to go to Disneyland. Suppose that the rhythmic gymnasts who# whirl# the very best with their *banners* merely get to visit the local *zoo* (lack of sponsorship funding is an issue).\<br></br>The BANNER at the ZOO showcases the new Tilt -a-# Whirl# ride.
吻	If a #kiss# is good, your *mouth* ends up in a *knot*!\<br></br>Have you ever seen two snails# kiss#? They start at the *mouth* and intertwine their whole bodies in a *knot*. The pinnacle of romance!\<br></br>When a guy ties the *knot* with his girlfriend, he might as well# kiss# her in the *mouth*. [Funny story about this character: to ask a teacher a question, you must really emphasize the fourth tone in qing3 wen4, since if you say qing3 wen3, you’re literally saying, ‘please# kiss# me.’ (This character for# kiss# is wen3. I made this mistake a lot!].\<br></br>This couple# kiss#es and their MOUTHS get caught in a KNOT.
匆	You# hurriedly# tie the KNOT but in your rushing you leave a little DROP in it.\<br></br>When I think "hurriedly," I think of a guy running out the door, late, with a piece of toast in his mouth. But instead of toast, it's a bread knot-- a delicious twist of bread that has a drop coming out of it (the part tnat can go into your mouth to hold on to). Tasty!
錫	#Tin#, being so malleable, is *metal* that is super #easy# to work with.\<br></br>Imagine that Big# Tin# (if there is such a thing) tries to market# tin# as “The *Easy* *Metal*.” Easy to bend, easy to recycle, easy to pick up, easy to drink out of . . . in short, the metal of choice for a place like the Big Easy.\<br></br>#Tin# is a METAL that is great for sculpting because it is EASY to shape.
惕	Building an android is tough-- a lot of the functions that are natural for humans are difficult to program a machine to do. Even walking is difficult. Probably the only thing you can easily get an android to do is to be# watchful#-- just install some surveillance camera. Easy!\<br></br>For many, if you feel that the authorities are #watchful#, then your *state of mind* is #easy#.\<br></br>*Mother Teresa* must always be# watchful# when she is walking the streets of Calcutta . . . I imagine it’s too *easy* to be pickpocketed, swindled or robbed.\<br></br>#Watchful# is your STATE OF MIND when you can EASILY spot anything.
屑	Computer #bits* are used as *flags* (in programming) and can be represented by *candles* (because candles have an on/off state).\<br></br>I put the CANDLE to the FLAG and it burned to# bits#.\<br></br>I walk under the *flag* of a foreign country to enter an embassy for a *candle* - lit dinner. To my surprise, the main course is nothing other than Alpha-#bits#. Why? They explain that it’s a quintessentially *American* food and did it to honor my country. Oh, OK!
尿	A FLAG is raised at the pool then there is# urine# in the WATER.\<br></br>You don't feel like cleaning this puddle of pet #urine# right now, so for now, mark the #water#y-patch with a *flag* so you can avoid stepping in it.
刷	Think of how you could, without a #brush#, paint a Japanese *flag*: you put a #towel# on a *flag* and paint the red circle with blood from a *saber*.\<br></br>Here’s a very patriotic guy who #brushes# his teeth under an American *flag* each night. He then spits out the toothpaste onto a red *towel*, which he proceeds to cut apart with a *saber*. [300 Hanzi in 7 days. I mention this only because if I can do it, you surely can too. I had a lot of free time over my college break. First I did all my stories, then I looked through the handwritten character index to look for writing irregularities, then I wrote each once and checked my work, redoing any I got wrong.].
犀	We need a #rhinoceros# but all we have is this stupid #cow#: attach a *flag* to its head with *snowflakes* to simulate a horn as best you can.
遲	Obviously your excuse for being #tardy# is that a #rhinoceros# was blocking the *road*.\<br></br>Simplified 迟# tardy# = *flag*, *drop*, *road*. Story: The scuba diving instructor was# tardy# because his dive *flag dropped* somewhere along the *road* and he had to go buy a new one.\<br></br>You explain to your teacher that you were# tardy# for class because a *rhinoceros* was ambling down the *George Washington Parkway*, blocking traffic for miles.\<br></br>Terrible excuse for being# TARDY# to class: a RHINOCEROS was blocking the ROAD.
漏	Wikileaks# leak#s some disparaging information about a general: he left the American *flag* outside in the *rain* and hence it got soaked with *water*.\<br></br>If you are experiencing a #leak#, it is generally in the form of *water*. It can be hard to detect unless there is #rain#, in which case, erect a *flag* where you find the# leak#.\<br></br>If you use a FLAG to keep out the RAIN it will# leak# WATER.
屁	Nobody can *compare* with someone who can# fart# the national anthem under the national *flag*, both in patriotism and in the art of# fart#ing.\<br></br>Bring your #fart# to *compare* under the *flag*: whoever has the worst smelling #fart# wins the #fart#-*flag* (emblem: a huge butt with stink waves)!\<br></br>It is very inappropriate to *compare* the smell of your #farts# under your country’s *flag*.\<br></br>This is a# fart# contest where# fart#s are COMPARED and the winner is signaled with a raised FLAG.
履	Watching the World Cup and you see the fancy# footwear# of the players bearing the *flag* of their respective countries. Your own# footwear# feels ashamed and will take many weeks to *recover*.\<br></br>I equipped some# footwear# with +1 healing recovery. They're basically a shroud for my feet, covering them and protecting them from the elements, and they recover 1 HP for every step I take!\<br></br>People suffering from lapses of patriotism get to wear special# footwear# made of American *flags* to *recover* their love of the country.\<br></br>Big flag of Nike (see the swoosh on the left) as a big queue doubles back and back to get their latest# footwear#.\<br></br>A commercial claims that this new# footwear# will let you *recover* your abilities in *flag* [American] football.
屎	Sometimes, *rice* becomes contaminated with #excrement#. Mark with a *flag* this *rice* to warn people against human consumption!\<br></br>China has come up with a terrible ad to export more *rice*. It features a waving Chinese *flag* and the slogan: "Eat more *rice*, it will increment your# excrement#!".\<br></br>Every student at *Rice* University knows that, while school pride is a good thing, if your# excrement# is the color of *rice*, that’s a red *flag* for digestive troubles, and you should probably go to the hospital.\<br></br>Eat too much RICE and you'll be running to the DOOR of the bathroom to let loose some# excrement#.
屏	The #folding screen# depicts all the *flags* of the world. Like a map, trying to fold it back up is a dastardly *puzzle*.\<br></br>I have no more closet space, so I store my *puzzle* collection behind a# folding screen# in my living room, and covered with a *flag* to keep the dust off.\<br></br>The CIA found it a real *puzzle* as to where the terrorist hid the beloved American *flag* -- but then they realized it was hiding behind a# folding screen# in Pakistan!\<br></br>A# folding screen# is a FLAG whose intricate art patterns leave you PUZZLED.
屈	Your army is losing, and hence the general says, “we’ve got to# knuckle under#” – let’s raise the white *flag* and *exit* the battlefield.\<br></br>To #knuckle under# is to raise the white *flag* and #exit#.\<br></br>When you# knuckle under# pressure, you raise your surrender FLAG and head for the EXIT.
掘	The determined archaeologist will never KNUCKLE UNDER and keeps digging with his FINGERS to# excavate# artifacts.\<br></br>My favorite ancient sites to# excavate# are tombs-- there's just so much excitement in using your own hands to peel back the shroud of some sarcophagus, then use your own fingers to pull out some treasure!\<br></br>To #excavate# - a function of archaeology - you use your *fingers* to dig in a location *flagged* in the *mountains*.
尺	This primitive #ruler# measuring technique relies on placing a *flag* every *foot* (the last stroke is like a foot stepping forward).\<br></br>The person underneath the flag is the new# ruler# about to be sworn in.
眉	The# eyebrows# hover over the EYES like a divided FLAG.
媚	Some men believe that to #flatter# a #woman#, you can just suggestively raise your #eyebrows#.\<br></br>The best (or worst!) way to# flatter# a woman is to waggle your eyebrows suggestively at her. "Hey lady, you're lookin' gorgeous today, how 'bout you an' me--" "Don't# flatter# yourself!".\<br></br>Men, some relationship advice: if you wish to# flatter# a woman, you must be very careful about what part of the body to mention. A safe route is to complement her on her *eyebrows*, saying something like, “*woman*, you have wonderful *eyebrows*!” Then she’ll bat her eyes and say, “Tee he, you# flatter# me.”.\<br></br>Complimenting a WOMAN'S EYEBROWS is a way to# flatter# her.
肩	Think of the part of the body you use to break down a door-- shove it with all your weight at the# shoulder#.\<br></br>The# shoulder# is the *part of the body* you use to give someone the cold# shoulder#, which is sometimes done by slamming a *door* in someone’s *flesh*.\<br></br>The #shoulder# is the *flesh* you use to break down a *door*.\<br></br>Your# shoulder# is the PART OF THE BODY that helps you raise a FLAG.
妒	A *woman* is# jealous of# the girl next *door*.\<br></br>When a WOMAN blocks the DOOR to keep you from hanging out with your college friends, she is# jealous of# them.\<br></br>When #jealous of# something, a #woman# may block your way to the *door* to keep you where she wants you.\<br></br>Think of the jealous geisha woman, who sits by the sliding door peering out of the crack ready to get her chance to discover something sordid!\<br></br>It seems that many women may be# jealous of# Michelle Obama – she’s the *woman* who gets to open the *door* to the White House. Note that *woman* is to the left of *door*, rather than inside it – so perhaps you can imagine a jealous woman standing outside the white house door. Then you won't forget it in review like I did! ;-).\<br></br>Whenever a girl comes to visit my house, my wife gets# jealous of# her-- if she sees the new girl, she'll slam the door in the poor girl's face! But that girl was only my sister...
淚	You open your front door and there's an adorable chihuahua with big wet# tears# in its eyes-- the famous "puppy dog eyes" stare! You can't help but adore this little doggy and immediately adopt it. Just as planned...\<br></br>The *chihuahua* is in# tears# after it is locked out of the *door* and to make matters worse a few drops of *water* fall suggesting rain.\<br></br>#Tears# are the *water* that flow from a *chihuahua* when a *door* stands between you and it.\<br></br>Simplified 泪# Tears# = *water*, *eye*.\<br></br>[Sad story warning!] A family breaks down in# tears# once they realize that when their house flooded with *water*, their *chihuahua* was trapped behind the locked *door* and hence drowned.
啓	"I can only show you the *door*, but you must step through it," the *taskmaster* tells you. You start to open your *mouth* to protest, when suddenly you are# enlighten#ed.\<br></br>*Simplified* [ #启# ] :The teachings from the Budha's #mouth# opened the #door# for his followers to enter the temple of truth and for the master to# enlighten# them. Whereas [ #啓# ] there are some who say it was the teachings from the #mouth# of *Mao*, the *great helmsman*, that opened the #door# for the #enlighten#ed intelligentsia to escape through from the mainland to Taiwan.\<br></br>My dictionary says that this character's standard form is actually 啟 (simplified: 启) and that 啓 is the variant uncommon form, so my story works with 啟 instead. One often goes to a monastery to be #enlighten#ed. Usually, one has to demonstrate their resolve to be admitted. Here, the *door* has a magic *mouth* that is operated by a monk *taskmaster*.\<br></br>A man heads up to monastery with the desire to #be# enlighten#ed#. However, when he gets to the *door*, he receives a shocking message that makes his *mouth* open wide: “This monastery has been seized by the *Imperial Japanese Army*. Leave or be shot.” His *mouth* remains open as he walks back down the trail (which is why *mouth* is below the door and taskmaster, rather than to the left or above).\<br></br>You really get# enlighten#ed when you see how freely to task masters talk behind closed doors.\<br></br>To# enlighten# someone, you merely have to open the *door* that is the *taskmaster's* *mouth*.
扇	Entering the DOORS of the castle, you see the prince being cooled by the FEATHER# fan#s of his servants.\<br></br>This primitive automatic #fan# consists of a small *door* that you open, revealing two magical *wings* that flap to cool you.\<br></br>The turbo-fans that power aircraft spool up intensely after the cabin *door* closes and allow the *wings* to take flight.
奈	If you put something too BIG on the ALTAR it can't help but break.\<br></br>I can’t help but wonder why a *big dog* is guarding the entrance to the *crypt altar.* Watching for government spies, maybe? (Again, I’m using *crypt altar* for when the altar is below another element or otherwise in its full form; *altar* will be reserved for when it appears in its condensed form, to the left.).
款	A *soldier* who was unable to find a job after work goes down to a *crypt altar* and prays to God that he will find# funds#, since he currently *lacks* money.\<br></br>Spending too much# funds# on *altars* and *soldiers* means there'll be a *lack* of# funds# for education and medical care.\<br></br>The SOLDIER falls on hard times and LACKS any# funds# so he comes to the ALTAR of the church for prayer.
祟	This is an exorcism where a trip to the ALTAR makes the# evil spirit# EXIT the body.\<br></br>An# evil spirit# tries to persuade a priest to *exit* his service at the *crypt altar*.
祝	When Japanese people turn 20 they usually visit the ALTAR at their local shrine and people WISH them WELL (CELEBRATE RTK1 keyword) for no longer being a TEENAGER.--thanks to SammyB.\<br></br>#WISH WELL#. When your older brother goes to the altar, you WISH him WELL!
祥	In old times, they brought SHEEP to the ALTAR for sacrifice hoping for# propitious# blessings.\<br></br>The priest says, “It is# propitious# for you to be a good *sheep* in God’s eyes and visit the *altar* each day.”.
祕	There aren't that many professions that require# confidential#ity, but being a priest at an altar or confession booth is definitely one. A priest definitely has to be able to keep a secret!\<br></br>Simplified 秘# confidential# = *wheat*, *certainly*. Story: "Hey, can you keep this document# confidential# for me?" "Why *certainly*! I'll hide it in the *Wheat Chex* box, no one will ever look there.".\<br></br>What you tell the priest in the Sacrament of Reconciliation next to the *altar* is *certainly*# confidential#.
慰	Imagine #consoling# the imposing *Cardinal Richelieu* after he had a serious *heart* attack. “It’s going to be OK,” you say in broken French.\<br></br>尉 means OFFICER/MILITARY RANK. An OFFICER always treats the flag like an altar and keeps it within a Chinese inch. Can substitute it for Cardinal Richelieu.\<br></br>An inch-sized scrap of holy shroud (laid on an altar) is the Shroud of Turin, an ancient relic that shows an eerie suffering face. When you see the shroud's heartbroken expression, doesn't it just make you want to# console# the poor guy depicted?\<br></br>You# console# *Cardinal Richelieu*, for his lover -Queen Anne of Austria- has broken his *heart*.
蔚	Imagine that only the most# luxuriant# of *flowers* were allowed in *Cardinal Richelieu*’s house. Tulips from the Netherlands, exotics from China, desert flowers from the Sahara . . .\<br></br>The military officer brought along a# luxuriant# bouquet of flowers.\<br></br>On the top of the Shroud of Turin's face's head, it looks like there's a faint outline of thorns. Because the figure's suffering is so palpable, don't you wish his tears would turn those thorns into the most# luxuriant#, beautiful flowers?
蒜	#Garlic# FLOWERS were placed on the 2 ALTARS of the small village that had been ravaged by vampires in an attempt to drive them away. (thanks koohiikun @ RTK).\<br></br>Here we see two *crypt altars*, one of Western Christianity and one of Eastern Christianity. This represents the spirit of ecumenism – previously separated altars coming together. Perhaps if we offer prized# garlic# to the leaders of the Eastern and Western Churches, ecumenical dialogue between the two *crypt altars* will *flower*.\<br></br>#Garlic# are *flowers* that have the same effect on vampires as *two altars*.
棕	Suppose that the# palm tree# was the first tree to be used as a *Christmas tree* in the Christian *religion,* located (I guess) around Jerusalem and all. Doubtful, but a convenient story for this Hanzi. Sound: zong1 Many *Americans* see their ideal vacation as sitting under a# palm tree# and listening to island zong-s.\<br></br>In the Christian RELIGION, when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the people waved# palm TREE# leaves in celebration.\<br></br>We think of fir trees as the tree of religion because of Christmas, but don't forget about Palm Sunday's# palm tree#s.
宙	The# universe# is just a big *house* that originated with the big *sprout* (big bang).\<br></br>The Earth is our *house*, but despite its size (about six sextillion metric tons), it’s really just a *sprout* in the# Universe#.\<br></br>Your HOUSE is a mere SPROUT compared to the vast# universe#.
軸	You design an eco-friendly# axle# made out of *sprouts* for your *car*, but it doesn’t work as well as you’d like – it just falls to pieces once you start driving!\<br></br>This CAR is really cheap so much so that when it hits a SPROUT it will break an# axle#.
袖	Imagine that if you immerse a *cloak* in the ground and add water, two #sleeves# will sprout out from it.\<br></br>#Sleeve#s SPROUT from your CLOAK.
笛	Perhaps the first# flute# was simply a nice *sprout* of *bamboo*, hollowed out with holes poked in the top.\<br></br>You fashion a *bamboo*# flute# to fit over a tub of decaying brussels *sprouts*, turning the noisome gasses they give off into beautiful music.\<br></br>A# flute# is a piece of *bamboo* from which can *sprout* the most beautiful music.\<br></br>This# flute# is made of BAMBOO SPROUTS.
坤	The# female# *monkeys* busy themselves planting seeds in *dirt*, while the male monkeys either hunt for prey or just sit on the couch and watch football.\<br></br>The first male was made from a clump of dirt, and the first# female# was made from that dirt's rib.\<br></br>You can tell which MONKEYS are# female# by seeing if they are covered in DIRT like the males usually are.
呻	You open your *mouth* wide to# groan# once you learn that your pet *monkey* has escaped and is currently wreaking havoc in the town center.\<br></br>A# groan# comes from the MONKEY'S MOUTH when it can't get the banana.
暢	Advertisers temp you to take money out of your *piggy bank* to buy “smooth” beer. But many would say (from experience) that any beer labeled “smooth” is too bad even to give to a *monkey*. Don’t dismiss that as elitist.\<br></br>Both the tail of a MONKEY and PIGLET are# smooth# to the touch.\<br></br>Want to learn to be# smooth# and suave, to pick up chicks? It's not that hard; even a monkey can learn to be a# smooth# gentleman with just a little money-- enough for a piggy bank. Just buy some nice clothes and don't speak roughly.\<br></br>A child is trying to pick a doll. "I want that little *monkey*, his fur is so# smooth#!" Says his dad: "Well, let's see how much you have saved in your *piggy bank*.".
夥	Here we see a *fruit*ful# partnership# between *many* local *fruit* farmers. With that many working together, they can make "many" money.
巢	The animal leaves the# nest# and heads alongside the STREAM looking for FRUIT for its young.\<br></br>The best place for a bird or squirrel to build a# nest# is an area with plentiful fruit and near a stream. The mother animal knows that these places are the most fertile and will provide for their young.\<br></br>Hitler had a mountain house of sorts in Germany titled “the Eagle’s# Nest#” in English. Imagine that the Allied forces sought to kill him while he was there by releasing a *flood* of *fruits* down on top of it.

晰	(thanks swilkins1984 for help) When it’s night and I’m outside, I sometimes have to *analyze* (right primitive, tree + tomahawk, <a href="/study/kanji/2121">analyze</a> <span class="index">(#2121)</span>) what something in the distance might be, since I can’t see very clearly. But once the *sun* comes out, I don’t have to *analyze* like that – everything becomes# distinct#.\<br></br>The SUN chops through night like a TOMAHAWK and everything that is hidden becomes clear and# distinct#.

Thwack!\<br></br>When the Count asked for a# discount# on a *tomahawk*, the seller gave him the the *finger*. Enraged, the Count killed him with the *tomahawk*.

They’re so offended that they chase you out with a *tomahawk*.
哲	Here we have a rather lackluster# philosopher# who is intellectually unimpressive. You must therefore *discount* the things that come out of his *mouth*. (His *mouth* is thus lower than that of the mouths of other# philosopher#s, which is why the *mouth* sits at the bottom of this character.).\<br></br>This character was made up by someone making fun of# philosopher#s, depicting them as people who try to get a *discount* by clever use of their *mouth*.\<br></br>Demosthenes -prominent Greek# philosopher#- used to with speak with *fingers* and *axes* in his *mouth*, not only pebbles.\<br></br>A two-hour lesson of philosophy in high school.

逝	How's your friend? Not good, she #passed away#. How did that happen? Well, you know how much she loves shopping. She was killed in a road accident when she saw a *discount* in the shop on the other side of the *road*.\<br></br>Imagine that the U.S. government subsidized the passage of hearses on the George Washington Parkway (which they wish to use for more funeral processions), and hence when your loved one #passes away#, you get a *discount* if you arrange for a hearse to drive them down the *George Washington Parkway.*.\<br></br>On the *road*, you find a bloody *finger* hacked by an *axe*. Its unfortunate owner must have passed away already.\<br></br>"How did he# pass away# ?" - " The lumberjack husband of his mistress dragged him into the #road# and #axed# his #finger# ..... he just happened to be picking his nose at the wrong moment!!".\<br></br>The stingy old man #passed away# when the driver ignored his pleas to stop the bus when he saw a *discount* while they were on the *road*.

We will take your word for it, but if we find out that it wasn't, we'll come back and chop your *fingers* off with an *axe*..." A used car salesman's nightmare.\<br></br>The salesman makes a# vow# that he is selling this *dictionary* to you at a steep *discount*, but you suspect that the ‘discount’ comes from his first doubling the price, then cutting it back to the MSRP.\<br></br>After getting his FINGERS chopped off with a TOMAHAWK, the man# vow#ed WORDS of revenge.

祈	A family #supplicates# God at the *altar* for a new *tomahawk* so that they can prepare supp-er (supper --># supplicate#.).\<br></br>You decide to give this new religion a try. So you set up a *shrine* in your living room and# supplicate# (humbly ask) for divine intervention to help you win the lottery. When it doesn't happen - "To hell with this crap!" - you take a *tomahawk* and smash the *shrine* to pieces.\<br></br>A warrior# supplicate#s to God at the altar and leaves his tomahawk there as a sign of his seriousness-- he needs his wish fulfilled enough to give up on war forever.\<br></br>The warrior goes to the ALTAR with his TOMAHAWK to# supplicate# his God for help in the coming battle.

嶄	In West Virginia, some companies wish to *hew* away the tops of# towering# *mountains* so that they can access the coal inside. Naturally this plan has been met with fierce opposition that is not going away.

妻	A feminist claims that the most exciting moment in the day of a *woman* who becomes a# wife# will be something like finding a sewing *needle* while she is sweeping the house with her *broom*.\<br></br>The perfect# wife# is a *woman* plying a *needle* to darn your socks and using a *broom* to keep things tidy.
淒	How do you make your #wife## miserable# ?

煞	*Hitler* was fed up with all the# goblin# infestation in his house, so after getting out his *broom* to sweep them all together and having them *bound up*, he grilled them over a *cooking fire* to enjoy a# goblin# dinner.\<br></br>This is the Green# Goblin# from Spiderman, taskmaster, flies around a bound up rake/broom, and throws fireballs at people.\<br></br>During World War II, a# goblin# in Japan, who evidently is on the Allied side, has *bound up* a member of the *Imperial Japanese Army* and is ready to sweep him with a *broom* into the *cooking fire*. But he mercifully relents at the last minute.\<br></br>The evil# goblin# is a TASKMASTER who catches little children with a giant HAIRNET and cooks them over the COOKING FIRE for dinner.

You call this non-alcoholic creation “the *snowman*.”.
彙	I made a beautiful snowman with a *whisk broom*, a *crown* on his head and pieces of *fruit* for his eyes, nose and mouth.

Her husband has been building a# collection# of various *fruits* with homemade *crowns* on top of them, next to a sign that says ‘Fruits: the kings of food.’ It was cute at first, but now the fruits have rotted and it smells terrible. Hence she takes a sturdy, hypoallergenic *whisk broom* and sweeps them onto the *floor* and out of the house.
兼	The# double# #rake# was the precursor to the plough - with a *water buffalo* pulling the huge# double# #rake# with *twin shafts* - and the #rake's# #eight# *trailing tines* , the crop yield# double#d .\<br></br>I'm going to use this# double# to mean an inferior clone. You performed some dark magic with a witch's broom and animal horns to create your# double#. It walks kind of bow-legged (which explains the other extraneous strokes) and sometimes needs some walking sticks, but it's pretty great to have your own# double# regardless!\<br></br>To add onto Heisig’s story, I suggest you view the person as a guy *raking* up evidence for the two sides during the cold war: the ‘Right’ and the ‘Left’.
賺	I can# earn# a lot of *money* as a stunt *double*, but the real actor# earn#s at least double!\<br></br>You# earn# more money as your SHELLS (money) have DOUBLED.\<br></br>One of the perks of working as a *double* agent, is that you# earn# *double* the *shells* of a regular spy.\<br></br>The first thing you make your double do is go to work in your place-- your double# earn#s the shells, and you spend them! Perfect!\<br></br>A commercial for owning platinum alleges that if you put all the *shells* you# earn# into platinum coins, your *shells* will *double*.
嫌	A *woman* goes into service as a *double* agent. When she finishes, she fines that she intensely #dislikes# both of the countries, now that she knows all of the stuff they get into.\<br></br>If you DOUBLE-cross the WOMAN she may# dislike# you forever.\<br></br>The woman you're dating, however, isn't a big fan of your double. Even though she likes you, she# dislike#s the double. Maybe it's because you try to bring the double into your intimate times?
謙	This# unassuming# guy walked into the spelling bee, sat down next to me, and won. He must have known *double* the *words* in the *dictionary* that I did.\<br></br>Whereas the real actor is in the spotlight with everyone listening to his *words*, his stunt *double* is that# unassuming# guy that does all the real work.\<br></br>Your double knows that its entire purpose for living is to make your life more convenient, so it's developed a very# unassuming# personality. Whenever it speaks, its words are very quiet.
歉	I offer an# apology# after DOUBLE YAWNING during the program.\<br></br>You make your double work day in and day out, and it starts to yawn. "No!" you yell at it, "No slacking from you!" The poor double offers up an# apology# to you, its master.\<br></br>A caught *double agent* makes a tearful# apology# to the CIA saying that her allegiance is truly to the U.S. now and won’t he please let her stay on, but the director just *yawns* listening to her – he doesn’t believe a single word she’s saying.

簾	A quick Google image search with this character confirms that lots of# drapes# in Asia are made out of *bamboo*. Well, imagine an elderly guy in China lamenting that nobody buys nice *bamboo*# drapes# anymore – they all go for the *inexpensive* Western kinds.\<br></br>Simplified 帘# drapes# = *hole*, *towel*. Story: Imagine using a *towel* to patch up a giant *hole* in your# drapes#.
睜	A staring contest is when two people's *eyeballs contend* against each other to see who can keep them# unshut# the longest.\<br></br>Every morning in college, I must# unshut# my *eyeballs* in order to *contend* with whatever the day has to bring. [Not to be negative about it all – I’m enjoying school quite a lot.].\<br></br>You have to *contend* against your *eyes* to keep them# unshut#.
掙	For me, the word “to# struggle#” has lots of archaic Communist connotations. Imagine a team of bored Marxists (still kicking themselves after the fall of the USSR) traveling to *Tokyo* in order to persuade the public there to “struggle for workers’ rights.” But they must *contend* with the fact that people there are happy to live in a capitalist country where human rights are respected and people retain their personal freedoms.\<br></br>Class# STRUGGLE# is the work of innumerable HANDS CONTENDING with the forces of history. Can be likened to a boxing match, wherein the CONTENDERs# STRUGGLE# with each other using their HANDS.
箏	You have to *contend* against that thicket of *bamboo* to transform it into a# Chinese zither#.\<br></br>In# Chinese Zither# Hero, You must *contend* with thousands of other competitors as you play the large *bamboo* instrument to your utmost ability.

Their job becomes easier once the sleepy butler takes ‘a-rest’ on the road.\<br></br>The BONDSERVANT fed up with his treatment decides to hit the ROAD and is immediately# arrest#ed.
隸	This# bondservant# wishes he could be a *butler* for a cathedral and do interesting things like chop down the *Christmas tree* and get the *crypt altar* prepared for a service.\<br></br>While hacking away at a *tree* to provide firewood for his master, the# bondservant# overthinks his career choices. He could become a# bondservant# to God at the *altar* and lead a rich spiritual life, or become a *butler*, which is still like a# bondservant#, but paid.\<br></br>The# bondservant# puts the tree through a sieve so it can fit on the alter.

糠	The# chaff# (husk) of brown RICE keeps your bowels regular and you HALE.\<br></br>The *Rice* University dietitian says that when eating at the cafeteria, students need to separate the healthy wheat from the unhealthy# chaff# – and only eat the wheat, so that they can be *hale*.
耍	Never# mess around# with a WOMAN's COMB. It's her prized possession.\<br></br>Another demeaning character, that shows how Chinese men looked upon women: while a man takes care of serious business, they see a *woman*# mess around# with her *comb*.\<br></br>In the past, a *woman*'s notion of #messing around# was to play with her *comb*.\<br></br>Girls combing each other's hair at a slumber party.

喘	The *prospector*# wheeze#s happily with his *mouth* as he strains to carry a sack of gold down from the mountain.

揣	The *prospector* suddenly raises his *finger* and says, "I have a new# conjecture#.

甩	This is a magic spice *rack*. You hang the spice jars on one of its *tails*, and then whenever you need something, the rack will# fling# the spices right into the dish you're cooking.\<br></br>I see this character as a drying *rack* with a little fuse attached (see how the vertical stroke curves to the left like a fuse attached to a firework?).

惜	You# rue# over the *times past* when you could watch new episodes of Star Trek with *Data* and the gang.\<br></br>To# rue# is the STATE OF MIND of regretting something that happened in TIMES PAST.\<br></br>I imagine many in Calcutta# rue# the day when *Mother Teresa* passed away, given that in *times past* *Mother Teresa* helped the poor immensely.

This one's a little different-- instead of driving your car up, there's a giant outdoor# screen#, with tons of saunas over cooking fires in the middle of the road (in other words, outdoor jacuzzis), so it's more like a soak-up outdoor movie theater!\<br></br>A# screen# of pines trees between the #interstate highway# and the #sauna# ,which is lit up at night by its charcoal #fire#, affords some discrete privacy.\<br></br>You race down the *George Washington Parkway* because you don’t want to be late for a movie being #screened# about a man who lives in the Luray *Caverns* and survives by putting bats in a *cooking fire*.
畔	[Does anyone else find that they are learning English and Chinese at the same time by reading this book? ;-)] Take your typical *rice field* -- one *half* is a# littoral#, bordering the water.

牆	"All in all you're just another brick in the# WALL#." Think of Pink Floyd and the Berlin# WALL#. In this industrial wasteland, boys sleep in BUNK BEDS, SOILED workers toil on the ASSEMBLY line, dreaming of a RETURN to better times.\<br></br>I’m sure# Wall# Street is a fiercely competitive environment for young workers. Imagine a group of junior traders who are so overloaded with work that they must sleep in *bunk beds* in the *soil* outside# Wall# street so that they can *return* to the trading floor as early as possible. They’re treated like *assembly line* workers, and that’s what# Wall# Street is: an *assembly line* for wealth (and sometimes bankruptcy).\<br></br>Simplified 墙# Wall# = *soil*, *soil*, *animal horns*, *return*. Story: "All in all, you're just another brick in the# wall#." The first *dirty* hoodlum (first *soil* for *brick*) is on the left, and the other *dirty* hoodlum (second *soil* for *brick*) is off on the right satisfying his *horny* desires, only to be caught and *returned* to the# wall#.\<br></br>I use *Doozers* for the combination of *dirt* and *assembly line*. (Google "Fraggle Rock Doozers" if you don't know what I'm talking about). Now picture those little dudes at work, putting up the four# wall#s of a room. For scaffolding, they use *bunkbeds*, and the bunkbeds go around and around a bunch of *times* (an alternate meaning for *return*) as each of the# wall#s are put up.\<br></br>The *bunkbed* goes against the# wall#, but it's low quality *dirt*, thrown together by an *assembly line* and will likely be *returned*.
鼎	An# old cooking pot# with *eyeball* design. The bottom part looks like people dancing to tribal music. Probably worshiping the great eye, same eye depicted on the pot.\<br></br>While you’re sleeping happily in your military *bunk bed*, a deranged military recruit takes a *slice* of your *eyeball* and puts it in an# old cooking pot#, passed down through generations of his family for this exact purpose, to eat.
寢	Another low grade, for which you are punished... The teacher at your boy school locks you in the sleeping *house*, telling you to sit on your heels all night in the corner opposite the *bunk beds* and wear a *dunce* cap. It's hard to# get some shuteye# like this!\<br></br>I've been such a #dunce# - I've forgotten our wedding anniversary and now I'm having to# get some shuteye# in the old #bunk bed# our twins slept in when they were still at #home#. Our matrimonial bed will be off limits for a while..... this could prove expensive !!\<br></br>You try to# get some shuteye# when you are on break from your job/school and resting in your parents’ *house*, but your little siblings are acting like *dunces*, jumping around in their *bunk beds*, and it’s impossible to tune them out. AARGH!
侵	Back in school, young *Mr. T* once suggested to just# invade# Russia to end the Cold War. For that dumb suggestion, he was made to wear a *dunce* cap all week.\<br></br>*President Romney* says our military is so strong that anyone who tried to# invade# us would be a total *dunce*.\<br></br>MR. T catches the DUNCE kid# invade# the school. He is in trouble now!
浸	“I was a *dunce* for too long, but now I'm changing my life,” says a guy before he is #immersed# in *water* for his baptism.\<br></br>The DUNCE in class is# immerse#d in WATER as a punishment.\<br></br>When asked to take care of the plants in the classroom, I just# immerse#d them in *water* (easy solution to make sure they wouldn't dry out, I though). After my teacher found out, she made me wear a *dunce* cap for a week.\<br></br>Reminds me of the carnival game with the *dunce* sitting on the platform as someone hits the bulls-eye to# immerse# him in the *water*.
贓	While you’re *surfboarding*, you can’t help but pick up some beautiful *shells* that you see on the beach. When you try to leave the Honolulu airport, however, the authorities claims that these are# stolen goods# and put you under arrest. “Our shells stay here!” they say.
藏	During your stay on the tropical island, you're visited by the island police. "We've had reports of illegal *flower* picking, surely you have nothing to# hide#?" Nope, as long as you don't check behind the *surfboard*...\<br></br>This is also the hanzi for Tibet (西藏). The Dalia Lama is secretly returning to Tibet. To# hide# from Chinese authorities, he travels in a motor-home-type vehicle covered in *flowers* as part of a holiday *parade*. Inside, he has his own *bunk bed*, and is dressed as a *feudal official* to help bypass the checkpoints.\<br></br>A guy must# hide# his private parts from view (with his hands) when, while *surfboarding*, his *flower*-print swim trunks fall off and sink to the ocean floor. How embarrassing! “Give me a towel!” he shouts.\<br></br>As a prank, the boys stole some FLOWERS from the STOREHOUSE and# hide# them under their BUNK BEDS.
臟	When someone hates your# guts#, the logical thing is to *hide* that *part of the body* so that it can't be harmed . . .\<br></br>A Nazi soldier spills his# guts# to the Allied forces about where Hitler is to be found. He then must run and *hide*, because the German military knows what he did and has placed a million-DM reward on his *flesh*, dead or alive.
獎	Obviously, the *chihuahua* saved the *general's* life and is being# award#ed an# award#.\<br></br>[Typo in my RTH 2 copy – the bottom primitive is chihuahua, not Saint Bernard dog, given the drop.] A *general* gets the Medal of Honor# award# for rescuing a stranded *chihuahua* who worked as an emotional support dog. Public outcry emerges because most people don’t think this act deserved such a high honor – and it’s later found that the *general*# award#ed it to himself.\<br></br>I tend to imagine how the *general* rides the tiny *chihuahua* in front of his troops, hands out the# award#s and the *chihuahua* barks at the soldiers to step back in line after they've received the# award# .\<br></br>The original Academy# AWARD# was not Oscar, but rather a small golden statue of Napoleon the GENERAL with REN, a CHIHUAHUA.
漿	The *General* leads his troups into the desert, where there is so little *water* that their blood and urine quickly turns into a# thick liquid#.\<br></br>A *General* hands out bottles of Deer Park to his troops in Kuwait, saying, “Boys, if we’re going to secure the# thick liquid# refineries from the terrorists, you’re going to need a lot of *water*. It’s hot out there.”.
槳	When encountering a large river, the *General* orders his troups to cut down some *trees* and make a boat and# oar#s.\<br></br>The *general* realizes that the aircraft tanker has run out of fuel. To save face, he orders his troops to cut down the *Christmas tree* (it’s January so it doesn’t matter) and shape# oar#s out of it – they’ll just have to row to shore. [Note how primitives tend to go to the bottom when paired with *general*; thick liquid and# oar# are both examples.].
蔣	#Jiang# Kai-shek was the general-issimo of China and later Taiwan. Picture his admirers heaping *flowers* on the general’s grave. His detractors then brush the *flowers* away, but the admirers take back the flowers and put them on. The cycle continues until who knows when.
淵	What a beautiful character! Here’s my story: you find yourself facing a deep# abyss# that you must cross as part of some important quest. Your only option is to take the *bunk bed* you have been dragging along and cut it into many tiny *slices* that you then place, one after another, across the great# abyss#. It’s so high up that a large body of *water* appears as a tiny *line* below. Good luck!\<br></br>This character depicts a tightrope stretched in a *line* over an# abyss#, a tiny stream of *water* deep down in the distance. Your *bunk bed* is on one side, and a delicious breakfast of *sliced* bread on the other. You have to cross the tightrope to get from your bed to breakfast!\<br></br>Simplified 渊# abyss# = *water*, *crutches*, *rice*. Story: This hanzi is a pictograph of an NTI from the movie The# Abyss#. It, of course, resides in the *water*. The body is transparent, but it has streaks of light on its wings (the crutches) and spots of light on its body (the rice). Look up images for the# Abyss# NTI for a vivid visual.
肅	The villagers, carrying *rakes*, chase the vampire all the way to the Grand Canyon, right to the edge of the *abyss*. Then, when the vampire# solemn#ly floats across the abyss, the villagers silently look on and the scene takes on a# solemn# mood.\<br></br>肃 small rake... river...

Your only chance to escape is to# howl# as loud as you can with your *mouth*, and hopefully someone will come to help you!\<br></br>A wolf that is SOLEMN gives a load# howl# from its MOUTH.
蕭	This is a SOLEMN sight: All the FLOWERS in the garden are gone leaving it empty and# desolate#.\<br></br>What scene could be more# desolate# than a few desert *flowers* blooming all by themselves within the walls of the *Grand Canyon*, with no other natural life in sight? Note that the walking stick part of *rake* still pokes out over the top of the *broom*, even with a primitive on top.
鏽	Plans were made to create a railroad track through the *Grand Canyon*, but due to lack of money the project was abandoned halfway through. Now, all that is left are parts of the *metal* tracks, left to# rust#, slowly taking on the same color as the rest of the landscape.\<br></br>Simplified 锈# rust# = *metal*, *elegant*. Story: This *gold* medal from the 1980 Winter Olympics gathers# rust#, mimicking how #rusty# its owner's *elegant* figure skating skills have become.\<br></br>When *metal* #rusts# it takes on the same color as the *Grand Canyon*.
芝	You try to get a secret door to open by saying “open# sesame#!” It doesn’t work, however. Only when you make the *sign of Zorro* with a sword do your efforts *flower* and the gatekeeper opens the door.\<br></br>#Sesame# (bun,oil, paste) - #芝#加哥 #zhi# jia ge = #Chicago# . The best# sesame# buns are to be found in #Chicago# where they cut the #Mark of Zorro# into the bun and then sprinkle on top# sesame# seeds from freshly cut# sesame# #flower# heads.

泛	WATER can help you when you are WEARY and with many other# nonspecific# ailments.\<br></br>You met him near a pond (or some other body of *water*) and asked for an advice, but his words were very# nonspecific#. "I don't know what to think". He says, "Think!". "What can I do?" He whispers, "Do!" You were so *weary* that only much later you realized that all the time you were looking into the *water* and talking to yourself.
歪	You're trying to hang a picture frame, and you ask you friend for help to get it absolutely straight. "Is it correct?" "No, it's# askew#." "Is it correct now?" "Nope, it's# askew#." "Now is it correct?" "No, still# askew#." You're not sure if you just suck at this or your friend's being a jerk...\<br></br>This morally# askew# person thinks it’s *correct* to violate a *no symbol*.\<br></br>When the alignment of the picture frame is NOT CORRECT, it is# askew#.
矯	The *angel* cupid is trying to# rectify# a mistaken love by using his *darts* (as oppose to arrows which are for causing love).\<br></br>Imagine someone prays to the Arch-*angel* Saint Michael to# rectify# a situation by throwing a *dart* at evil.\<br></br>You find out that your best friend has only pretended to like you all this time, and he's actually betrayed you. Angrily, you put his picture on your dartboard (as if you're some kind of villain, mwahaha) and throw your darts into it every day, muttering under your breath "I'll# rectify# this situation, you'll see, if it's the last thing I do...".\<br></br>ANGELS are said to# rectify# human emotions with their heavenly DARTS.
矮	You know how they say Napoleon was# short of stature#? Apparently this isn't actually accurate at all. Maybe this rumor spread because of historical revisionism-- perhaps a committee of historians from countries Napoleon defeated were really angry, so they decided to spread bad rumors about him. Maybe they had a long list of negative traits and just threw a dart to choose one: "All right, let's all say he was# short of stature# and had a big complex about it! What a loser!".\<br></br>Did you know that the head of the International *Dart* Regulations *Committee* is very #short of stature#? Yes, he's a midget from Ireland actually.\<br></br>The U.S. Olympic *committee* deliberates whether this guy who is very# short of stature# (3 feet 5) yet ‘fast as a *dart*’ should be allowed on the sprinting team.\<br></br>The committee decides he is too short to participate in the dart tournament.\<br></br>The guy is# short of stature# and DARTS pass before the COMMITTEE can spot him.
唉	#Sigh--ay-ay#, that's the defeated sound that comes out of your *mouth* when someone has their *crossbow* aimed at you.\<br></br>You're an expert sniper assassin who kills people with a crossbow. You have your sights on your new target, a famous politician, but you hope this is your last case. You sigh-- and at the same moment, the weary politician sighs-- and suddenly you feel too much empathy and can't pull the trigger. "Sigh--ay-ay, what about my paycheck though?".
埃	When you shoot a ball of *soil* with your *crossbow*, the force of the launch should be enough to turn the soil into# fine dust#.\<br></br>You shouldn't have ordered that *crossbow* made from *soil* baked into clay. One shot and the strain turns the entire crossbow into# fine dust#.\<br></br>When you're in sniper assassin school, you need to practice using your crossbow even though there's no one to practice assassinating. One of the best exercises is to shoot at the earth-- if you do it with enough force and accuracy, the soil will turn into# fine dust#.\<br></br>When the CROSSBOW is fired at the SOIL, it kicks up a cloud of# fine dust#.\<br></br>Based on thecite's RtK story: You wipe the *dirt* off the surface with your *elbow*, throwing #fine dust# everywhere. It stings like *dart*s (in your eyes).
挨	Once you have loaded the *crossbow*, you only need a single *finger* to make your target# suffer#.\<br></br>As a sniper assassin, you're used to killing people, but lately you# suffer# an acute pain in your shooting hand. It turns out it's a manifestation of your conscience# suffer#ing-- you never realized it until now, but you feel guilty for killing all those people...\<br></br>The people of *Tokyo* have recently #suffered# a series of anonymous *crossbow* attacks in crowded places.

橘	#Tangerine#s are obviously in *trees*. To get them down, it's best to use a *spear* to knock them off the branches.

Indeed, the salesman wears such a helmet to prevent brain injury from the various things thrown at him, such as these# tangerine#s from Tangier island.\<br></br>The SALESMAN from frame 416 sits down beneath a# TANGERINE# TREE on his lunch break (that is, he is no longer standing).

犧	A religious group #sacrifices# a *cow* and then a *sheep* because they seek favor with God. After that the fun begins – they *snare* some *wild rice* and have a *fiesta* to celebrate their offering.\<br></br>I used some wheat in a snare to trap a sheep to# sacrifice# at the fiesta, but someone brought a huge cow to# sacrifice# ahead of me, bugger!\<br></br>This character shows the tolerance Chinese people show to religion. It doesn't matter what your faith is, whether you# sacrifice# a *cow*, a *sheep*, perhaps just some *wild rice* or animal you caught in a *snare*: after the# sacrifice# there's always a *fiesta*!\<br></br>Just sacrificing a sheep or a cow to a god barely shows devotion. Instead, to be the most devout follower, you must# sacrifice# a cow, a sheep, 10% of your first wheat harvest (think of a tithe), any game you might have caught in a snare, and most importantly, you have to hold a tournament among your finest virgin maidens, and the winner of that get# sacrifice#d too.

They were left by the *fingers* of those who took this exam before you and failed and were# flog#ged on the spot. "Can I reschedule? I think I need a couple more years to prepare.".\<br></br>There was a hilarious T-shirt in *Tokyo* that showed a picture of a frog but titled it “flog.” Imagine that to prevent this embarrassment from happening again, the Japanese government makes everyone take an *exam* in English in *Tokyo*, and only those who score well should be allowed to design T-shirts!
暑	You give your *special someone* some *sun*-block to protect him/her from the# summer heat# during a trip to ‘lover’s beach’.\<br></br>With the# summer heat# at its worst, the *sun* mercilessly shining down on the wax *puppets* caused them all to melt.

篩	At strict schools in China, teachers smack their students with a bamboo rod when they miss points. One teacher needs to remember which is the best student in the class; he# sift#s through them, re-smacking the ones he remembers smacking before. Finally he finds one student he doesn't remember smacking ever before-- that's the one!\<br></br>A *teacher* #sifts# through all the applications to the *Bamboo* Cultivation School. “None of these applicants look good,” she mutters to herself.\<br></br>The *teacher* got his best *bamboo* brush mixed up with those of his hundreds of students.

踐	At the opening ceremonies for the *Paralympics* a *float* emerges carrying a flag that says “don’t# tread on# me.” Some say the message is overtly political, but the float defends itself because the guy waving the flag has a *wooden leg*.\<br></br>足 = *Oscar Pistorius* - : The annual Pretoria Parade has an "#Oscar# is innocent !" #float# - which would seem to# tread on# the evidence and Reeva Steenkamp's family's sensibilities.
蹄	If you say the# hoof# of the *sovereign’s* horse looks ugly, protestors may very well attack you so forcefully that you may need a *wooden leg* afterwards.\<br></br>Our SOVEREIGN is horse-crazy and even had her own WOODEN LEG fitted with a# hoof#. (thanks Katsuo @ RTK).
捉	The bug takes off running but you# catch# it by the LOWER LEG with your FINGER .\<br></br>“Catch!” In *Tokyo*, you make trouble by taking off your *wooden leg* and then throwing it at innocent passersby, saying “here,# catch#!” Well, one of them #catches# it and then runs away with it, leaving you hobbling through Roppongi and kicking yourself for your immaturity. [The right primitive is technically lower leg, as seen in Heisig, but I will use *wooden leg* for it in its full form at least sometimes.].
踩	PICKING on the younger pirate, the older pirate steps on him with his WOODEN LEG.\<br></br>The worst rules violation at the *Paralympics* that I can imagine: someone first #steps on# you, then *plucks* out your *wooden leg* so that you’re out of the competition.
蹦	A guy with a *wooden leg* gets a free ticket to a hip-#hop# concert. He’s so excited at the concert that he #hops# around in the air, but unfortunately this causes his *wooden leg* to *crumble*.\<br></br>#Hop# too high and your WOODEN LEG will CRUMBLE from the weight.
跌	Despite its appearance in so many of my stories, the *wooden leg* industry is likely #slumping# because of the popularity of metal and plastic alternatives. Hence I imagine many *wooden leg* manufacturers are *losing* their jobs.\<br></br>If the pirate LOSES his WOODEN LEG his productivity will# slump#.
促	MR. T can# urge# you to do anything with a kick to the LOWER LEG.\<br></br>To counter the rise of the Chinese Paralympics team, *President Romney*# urge#s everyone with a *wooden leg* to try out for the Paralympics. Surely America is the superior nation!
踢	If you have a *wooden leg*, then #kicking# a soccer ball is very *easy* -- it’s just like swatting a ball with a baseball bat.\<br></br>When you have a WOODEN LEG it is not EASY to# kick# anything.
躁	This character for# impetuous# means ‘tense, excited, irritable’ (Wiktionary). Here’s an# impetuous# person who begged his parent for a *wooden leg*, but the day after he got it, smashed it into *wood pulp,* saying, “I hate this!” Very# impetuous# indeed.\<br></br>Here is an# impetuous# (impatient, hot-tempered) person, running around and generally treating his *wooden leg* so badly, that it is turned into *wood pulp* in no time.

澡	When taking a nice# bath# in the *water*, spice things up a bit with some scented *wood pulp*.\<br></br>After working hard, the lumberjack takes a nice long# bath# to let the *water* wash off the *wood pulp* on his body.\<br></br>Imagine an ancient iron Chinese kettle# BATH# heated from below. The WATER is bubbling, and in order to keep the occupants' feet from touching the hot metal, a thick layer of WOOD PULP is placed on the bottom of the# bath#.
藻	Leave FLOWERS in the BATH and they will form# algae#.\<br></br>Take a *bath* in some green# algae#, and I can promise you, you won’t emerge smelling like *flowers*.
操	A common# exercise# in kung fu is to use your *fingers* to smash a piece of wood into *wood pulp*.\<br></br>(Right-hand side 喿 is *a tree full chirping birds*). So, your new morning# exercise# is to stand in front of *a tree full chirping birds* and move your *fingers* as if trying to conduct a church choir.\<br></br>In *Tokyo* (a land of many trends and fads), the latest fashionable# exercise# is to take a block of wood and smash it (with your arm, leg, abs, whatever needs exercising) until it becomes *wood pulp*. Feel the burn!\<br></br>Taking heavy WOOD GOODS in your FINGERS and lifting them is good# exercise#.
燥	The *wood pulp* in the saw mill was# parched#, so the *fire* spread very quickly and soon the whole building was aflame.\<br></br>You try in vain to light a *fire* with some *wood pulp*, but unfortunately it’s not yet# parched#, and hence there’s too much water for you to light a fire.\<br></br>FIRE# parched# the WOOD GOODS drying out all the natural moisture .
躍	To join our sect, you must take the# leap# of faith: strap on these *wooden legs*, wear this *headdress* made from turkey feathers, and now take the# leap# into the unknown.\<br></br>Simplified 跃# leap# = *wooden leg*, *die young*. "Look before you# leap#" or you could literally end up with a *wooden leg*, or worse, *die young*.\<br></br>In the 3rd annual ski-leaping competition, a guy wearing a *wooden leg* and a giant *headdress* #leaps# off a cliff and does a double backflip. He’s a Paralympics athlete representing the Navajo nation.
戳	At the local Native American *fiesta*, a guy makes a derogatory comment about someone’s *headdress* (“is that your mom’s?), and hence the wearer# jab#s him in the face.\<br></br>Stealing the chief's HEADDRESS at the FIESTA, the thief is caught and given a# jab# to the face.
耀	Here’s something to# show off#: a *headdress* that simultaneously shoots out *rays* of multicolored light. Hence you don’t need a disco ball at a party when you wear this; you are the disco ball. [Note that the right *human leg* of *ray* gets condensed into a *hook* because there’s another primitive on the right.].\<br></br>RAYS of light gleaming on his HEADDRESS, the Cherokee chief loves to# show off#.
猾	In a# cunning# move, the man scares away the PACK OF WILD DOGS with a SKELETON making it look like it was still alive.\<br></br>The# cunning# *skeleton* makes his escape from a ferocious *pack of wild dogs* by taking out his appendix bone (which he doesn't need anyway) and throwing it at the dogs.\<br></br>A# cunning# woman finds herself threatened by a *pack of wild dogs*, so she simply picks up a deer *skeleton* and throws it 20 yards away – the dogs run over to eat it and she escapes.\<br></br>As the *pack of wild dogs* chased the *skeleton*, it quickly realized that without great# cunning#, it was boned.
髓	#Marrow# is obviously found in a *skeleton*. If a *body* is *left* on the *road*, then dogs are sure to tear it apart to find the pieces.\<br></br>Bone# marrow# donors are in such short supply in Russia that they have resorted to extracting# marrow# from cadavers. Here we see the *skeleton* of *Lenin's embalmed corpse* lying adandoned on the *road*, having been stripped of its# marrow#.\<br></br>Note that this character is almost the same as <a href="/study/kanji/985">as you wish</a> <span class="index">(#985)</span>. To continue that story, the person from *as you wish* has already left the Acropolis on his journey. He is now in a desert area with no food or drink, so to stay alive he sucks the# marrow# out of the *skeletons* he finds here and there.\<br></br>#Marrow# for transplants is in short supply - #skeleton# donors are sought . #Flesh left# on the #road# - *ie., road kill* , is the prime source.\<br></br>As you drive down the *George Washington Parkway* you see a *skeleton* *left* on the *left* side of the road. you pick it up and put it in the back seat, since the# marrow# it contains will be great-tasting *flesh*. [Ewwww! Never do this!!!].
髒	The# dirty# job of society was to *inter skeletons*. It was considered so# dirty# that the people who did these jobs were shunned. The Burakumin of Japan are an example.\<br></br>A guy lugs a# dirty# *skeleton* (visualize it – it’s scratched, covered in dirt, blood and worms) through an *inter-* national airport because he wants to mount it on his wall. But he’s stopped by customs because they figure it will spread at least 10 new diseases to his country.

禍	When *Jaws* came to terrorize the coastal village, the villagers turned to the *altar* to complain about their# misfortune#.\<br></br>There was a student once, his life was one# misfortune# after another, it was so bad that everybody knew him as Unlucky Lee. Once he decided to change this, so he arranged a ritual in the temple of the God of Luck. After a sizable donation he was led to the altar, where he was going to light some incense. There he, somewhat predictably, dropped the incense, stepped on it, bent down to pick it up, slipped and fell. And broke his *jawbone* on the side of the lucky *altar*.\<br></br>A guy has experienced the# misfortune# of having his *jawbone* broken (while eating snail pizza, actually – see <a href="/study/kanji/2275">snail</a> <span class="index">(#2275)</span>). Hence he goes to the *altar* and prays to God for healing, especially because he’s a professional eater and the competition is on Wednesday . . .
陌	The# footpath# up the PINNACLE is a HUNDRED miles long.\<br></br>[Once you learn this one you will be 75% done!

It’s an alternative to climbing up the structure.\<br></br>The * Parthenon* has a *hundred* different# footpath#s around it.
隙	There is a SMALL# rift# in the PINNACLE and it contains a little SPRING that hikers can relax in.\<br></br>Obi-Wan Kenobi detects a# rift# in the force. This leads him to the *Burj Khalifa*, where he finds a *few* people building a *small* *sun* that they want to use to overheat (and hence exterminate) everyone on earth. After an epic light saber battle he defeats them.\<br></br>There's a# rift# between the worlds of the Gods and mortal men somewhere in the *Acropolis*.

陪	Dogs are welcome to# accompany# Westerners on a visit to the *Burj Khalifa*, but they must wear a *muzzle* to make sure that nobody is bit.\<br></br>Any trip up to the PINNACLE should be accompanied with an oxygen MUZZLE. The air gets very thin.
隧	The PINNACLE is in a region that experiences earthquakes and to SATISFY building regulations ,# TUNNEL#s must be provided for refuge for when the building starts to "sui" - sway.\<br></br>Although the kids like our visit to the *Acropolis*, nothing will really *satisfy* them until we go to the vast# tunnel# complex below the temples.\<br></br>The *Burj Khalifa* will only *satisfy* Dubai’s wealthy residents once a huge# tunnel# is built underground where they can park their sports cars and relax in the shade.

窯	The# kiln# is a *hole* with a *cooking fire* inside that is usually used for drying porcelain or bricks but now being improvised to cook a *sheep*.\<br></br>In the absence of more specialized equipment, you can certainly use a# kiln# for cooking *sheep*. Just leave a small *hole* on top for air to escape, and make sure the *cooking fire* is the right temperature.\<br></br>The great *hole* in which we can put a whole *sheep* and then blast it with a *cooking fire* is a# kiln#.
窺	It is against REGULATIONS to# peep# through HOLES and spy on people.
窟	Put the prisoner in the *hole* into he *knuckles under* and tells us where his secret# den# is hidden.\<br></br>If your mom makes you do a chore, it used to be that you had to *knuckle under* and comply with her wishes. But now you’ve dug a *hole* that goes straight to your basement# den#, so you can jump through there and escape!
窄	The# Strait# of Gibraltar is quite# strait# [This character means narrow, not straight as in# Strait# of Gibraltar, but oh well.] During World War II, the British wanted to make sure the U-Boats had no *hole* to pass through, so imagine they built a giant *hacksaw* that would saw all enemy ships in half.\<br></br>Imagine a scene from a horror movie, where you make a *hole* in the door with a rusty chain*saw* to get to the frightened woman inside ("Here's Johnny!") . . . and then the doctors come, put you in a# strait#jacket and take you back to the mental hospital.\<br></br>If the HOLE is too# strait# (narrow), take a SAW and make it bigger.

窘	All of the *holes* in the city walls and streets are a result of mismanagement by the *monarch* who has left the country# poverty-stricken#.\<br></br>This country is so# poverty-stricken# that even the *monarch* has *holes* in his shoes.\<br></br>When disaster strikes the *monarch’s* subjects, because he has not established any safety net, they fall through a financial *hole* and become #poverty-stricken# (strike --> stricken). Hence everyone appeals to the *monarch* to set up a safety net.
窮	Simplified 穷# poor# = *hole*, *muscle*. Story: This# poor# guy spent all his money on *muscle* enhancement drugs, and his *muscles* got so big that they ripped a *hole* in his back pocket where he usually keeps his wallet. Consequently, he now has no money and is very# poor#.\<br></br>Because of great *holes* in their diets,# poor# people tend to walk with a *stoop*.\<br></br>Here we have a# poor# person who has fallen through the financial *hole* mentioned in <a href="/study/kanji/2291">poverty-stricken</a> <span class="index">(#2291)</span>.

窩	You tell your dentist, “I feel there’s a# hollow# inside of me.” It turns out that this# hollow# is just a *hole* in your *jawbone*, so he puts some resin in it to fill it up. Much better!\<br></br>Trou/hole... hotpot (from 火锅) se mange dans un récipient creux/hollow.\<br></br>If you have a root canal they# hollow# a hole in your jawbone.\<br></br>That little dimple in your face is a# hollow# that must be caused by a *hole* in your *jawbone*.

累	When you feel like your BRAIN is hanging on by a THREAD, you are very# tired#.\<br></br>Here we have a *Cardinal* sitting by the *window* (one of my alternate primitive meanings for rice field/brains). He’s near the end of his life on earth, and hence is quite# tired#. Sound: lei4 A *Japanese* tourist has arrived in Hawaii. He’s extremely# tired# due to jet lag and is just slumped on the deck chair outside the pool with a lei on his neck. It’s kind of funny to see.
螺	*Insects* are very lucky – whenever they get *tired*, they can just coil up and rest inside their# spiral shell#. They probably have a blanket and mattress inside and everything. I wish I had something like that.\<br></br>This character is based on hermit crabs: the Chinese thought they were little *insects* that must get very *tired* from always having to carry around a huge# spiral shell# on their back.\<br></br>The INSECT is TIRED so it rests for a while in a# spiral shell#.\<br></br>The *insect* is very *tired* from walking through his# spiral shell#.

絡	*Spider-man* is caught in his own *web*! Luckily he has a *walkie-talkie* that he can use to call for backup.\<br></br>EACH THREAD a spider weaves contributes to its elaborate# web#.\<br></br>Someone has put up a massive spider# web# in the Sistine Chapel. *Each* *cardinal* is needed to help pull it down – even 70 people isn’t enough.
綢	SPIDER-MAN weaves# SILK FABRIC# in his free time. He does that by running LAPS around a track, making a giant circular pattern.\<br></br>Which *Cardinal* gets the nicest# silk fabric# to use in his clothes? Imagine that it’s the one who runs the fastest *lap* around the Vatican’s banked track.
絨	All the grandmas have gotten together for a knitting *fiesta*! They're all using their *needles* to make *Spider-man* blankets for their grandsons, then filling it with# down# to keep them warm at night.\<br></br>Imagine a *Cardinal* from New Zealand who really doesn’t care for *fiestas*. He spends them knitting woolen# down# jackets using a bendy *needle* that curves away from the fiesta and towards him (as seen in the character).

Because in *this (literary)* text, I can color my dental *floss* whatever color I want, including my favorite color:# purple#.\<br></br>Members of the# purple# (a word used to denote the Catholic bishops) wait to see of whom the Pope will next write: “*This (literary)* member of the# purple# will become a *cardinal*.”.\<br></br>Someone tell me why THIS dental FLOSS is# purple# and that one is white!
繁	When you are QUICK-WITTED, your THREADS of thought are# numerous#.\<br></br>After# numerous# failed attempts to design a toothbrush that could clean between teeth, one *quick-witted* individual finally invented dental *floss*.\<br></br>#Numerous# *cardinals* are *quick-witted* people, as the Imperial Japanese Army finds out when their own *quick-witted* folks compete against the *cardinals*, and the cardinals win.

We want to be known for# delicate# fabrics, not low quality linens.\<br></br>The *Cardinals* ask themselves a# delicate# question: will the Pope *bring about* changes in the Catholic Church? And should he do that?

Good thing we have Spider Man here, so that he can make sure our seat belts are# fasten#ed tightly by sealing them with his spider silk THREADS! *Note the doubling up of the final stroke of CAR and the first of MOUNTAIN.\<br></br>The top part of this character is the same as <a href="/study/kanji/636">beat</a> <span class="index">(#636)</span>. You thought you could *beat* *Spider-man*, but he just# fasten#s a thread around your body and you're done for.\<br></br>An excited inventor asks a *Cardinal* to# fasten# himself into a new *car* that, if all goes well, will launch up a *mountain* and then fly through the air like a *missile* before landing safely, a thousand miles away.
納	No-one is# let in# the top-secret archives of *internal* affairs, not even *Spider-man*.\<br></br>If you are wearing THIRD class THREADS, there is no way you will be# let in# the party.
紛	A man was convicted of# DISORDERLY# conduct when he yelled out at SPIDER-MAN "Hey, wait a minute!" (PART also means "minute").

縮	The *threads* in your fine clothes will# shrink# if you let them *stay overnight* in warm water.\<br></br>A not-so-thin *Cardinal* *stays overnight* at a monastery for a retreat, and in the morning finds that his waistline has already shrunk, given the ascetic lifestyle of these monks.
綜	To# sum up# this hanzi: *Spider-man* is a comic book character, and has no affiliation with any *religion*. . .thank god.\<br></br>You can# sum up# a *religion* by comparing it to *Spider-man*: an eternal battle between good and evil, fought by a fictive character.\<br></br>Whom better to ask than a *cardinal* to# sum up# the tenets of the Catholic *religion?*.\<br></br>It takes more than one THREAD of information to# sum up# an entire RELIGION.
紳	*Spiderman* met the *Monkey* king for the first time when they both coincidentally went to the# gentry# examinations.\<br></br>A *Cardinal* asks the# gentry# openly to stop acting like *monkeys* and contribute to anti-poverty and anti-hunger efforts worldwide.
緣	There's a simple# reason# why Marvel comics chose *Spider-man* over a *sow* flying around on a *whisk broom*: the first would appeal to a wider audience.\<br></br>The# reason# why #Spiderman# is never far from his #whisk broom# and #pig# is that he loves to make and eat tempura pork balls - he's a sucker for Japanese cuisine.\<br></br>In the opening issue of Catholic# Reason# magazine, a *Cardinal* explains that the# reason# why you shouldn’t stir up *sow* soup with a *whisk broom* on Good Friday is in order to honor God.
緒	In# Inception#, the movie, *Spiderman*'s dream was embarrassingly with Mary Jane, his special *someone*.\<br></br>The point of# inception#, the movie, is to plant an idea into someone's subconsciousness. In this case, Marvel tries to plant the idea that you really want to buy a *Spider-man* *puppet* into the heads of many people.\<br></br>A *cardinal* does not have a special *someone* to go see the movie# Inception# with, since he lives a chaste life.\<br></br>At Pinnochio's# inception# (beginnings) he was a mere PUPPET with THREADS and now he is a real boy.

援	With my FINGERS I# provide assistance# to the MIGRATING DUCKS looking for the way to fly for the winter.\<br></br>Here we see a poor *migrating duck* whose neck has been caught in a plastic soda ring. Our *fingers* can easily# provide assistance# for the little bird.\<br></br>A pair of *migrating ducks* flies to *Tokyo* Narita International in order to# provide assistance# to the air traffic control there – they discuss temperatures, prevailing winds and currents, all in perfect Japanese.
索	*Spiderman* has had a request from his neighbourhood #chapel# for a really thick #thread# to act as a# large rope# to toll their bell. A change in diet is called for - one in high fibre !!!\<br></br>To raise money for charity, a *Cardinal* climbs the Sistine *Chapel* using a# large rope# and the cheers of supporters down below.\<br></br>The# large rope# that the priest killed himself with from the roof of the *chapel* was little more than a *thread*.
勃	A *Sunday school* class produces a# vibrant# presentation about why their church should switch to solar *power* -- it’s the right kind of power (hence *power* being on the right of the character).\<br></br>Jesus even after being forced to wear the needled crown he still had power to make his most# vibrant# teaching: only those who are innocent like children can enter the kingdom of god.\<br></br>The *Sunday school* was built next to a fitness center, from which a# vibrant# community of very *muscular* Christians emerged.\<br></br>The SUNDAY SCHOOL was destroyed in the hurricane and with a bit of sweat and MUSCLE, it has been rebuilt and is as# vibrant# as ever.
脖	I was so sleepy in SUNDAY SCHOOL that the FLESH of my# head-hinge# (neck) could not support my nodding head.\<br></br>The *Sunday school* class learns that God loves even the *flesh* on their# head-hinge#.
繳	A *Cardinal* #shells out# some Euros for a *homing pigeon* that will ferry documents and letters from his diocese to the Vatican. Much cheaper than taking a train.
邀	To avoid having to get out on the *road*, I usually send out *homing pigeons* to# request the presence of# someone I want to see.\<br></br>Your car runs out of fuel on the *George Washington Parkway,* and thus you call AAA to# request the presence of# a *homing pigeon* to deliver a gallon or two of fuel.

A long *queue* of curious hikers comes to watch some forest rangers create a# trail# in this manner.

The problem is, the Mona Lisa subsequently becomes defaced by all the people touching it with stones and throwing stones at it.

Answer: someone *ladled* them on with a dark pigment. This is why they are blotchy and not uniform.
貓	You give your pet *leopard* *tomato seedlings* to eat, and it says, “Who do you think I am, a house# cat#?”.\<br></br>#Cat# is to *leopard* what *tomato seedlings* is to tomato.\<br></br>The *leopard* is a# cat# whose camouflage allows it to blend in with *flowers* in a *field*.\<br></br>In Taiwan , #tomato seedlings# are prone to being uprooted by a defecating# cat# , but becos' the# cat# in question is usually a #leopard# there is little one can do - whereas the *simple mainlanders* [ 猫 ]were instructed by *Mao* to set #wild dogs# on the squatting# cat# .... #leopard# or *pet moggy*...\<br></br>Lots of elements that look like things we are used to. The vulture element is missing one stroke, and the sow/pig element is missing the last 2 strokes. So we have: The# CAT# is an almost predator. It is like a HALF vulture, and instead of hunting PIGS it hunts HALF-PIGS (Guinea Pig). Poor guinea pig had to be buried in the rice field with some flowers on top.
貌	What's the# mien# of somebody who's just met a leopard? There's the *white* face above the shaking *legs*...\<br></br>To determine whether a *leopard* prefers to eat *white doves* or *human legs*, you need to carefully observe its# mien# (= appearance or facial expression) when you offer him one or the other.\<br></br>Although the snow *leopard* has a beautiful snow-*white*# mien#, don’t get too close because it will bite off your *human legs*.\<br></br>This LEOPARD has a weird# mien# (appearance). It's WHITE and had HUMAN LEGS.

So don't be fooled by this one--a *wild dog* pretending to be saintly, wearing a *halo*!\<br></br>A PACK OF WILD DOGS has to be really GOOD to catch a# wolf#. (thanks mantixen @ rtk).
飢	A massive *wind* blew away all of the *food* you had at the BBQ, and hence you and your guests are# starving#.\<br></br>Someone is# starving# when, instead of having *food*, he can hear the *wind* whistling through his empty cupboards.

Then they put a red and green *towel* over the# ornaments# so that they’re not tempted to eat anything until tomorrow morning.
飲	Best not too drink too many alcoholic# beverage#s when you *lack* *food* in your stomach: you'll get drunk very quickly.\<br></br>If your party has lots of great *food* but *lacks* alcoholic# beverage#s, some people will *yawn* at the idea of coming and will go somewhere else.

餃	If you want people to come to your party and *mingle*, the only *food* you need to serve is a tray of# dumpling#s!\<br></br>*Meat*# dumpling# - #food# doesn't get any easier . Flour, water, minced pork,fingers and lots of #mingling# - classic chinese cuisine - DONE.\<br></br>When people in China get together to MINGLE, the FOOD of choice is often# dumpling#s.\<br></br>Jiaozi are such a communal FOOD that everyone is inevitably MINGLING around the jiaozi plate.

齣	A reviewer of# shows# must be very brave, because if he or she writes negative *sentences* about a play, the director might come and knock his/her *teeth* out.\<br></br>This is a measureword for theater and other kinds of# shows#. The designer of this character noticed that in these# shows#, you can see the *teeth* of the actors with every *sentence* they speak. The reason for this is obvious: they have to e-nun-ci-ate ve-ry clear-ly to make themselves understood in a large theater hall.
齡	In ancient China, the# length of service# for a soldier in the military was measured by how many *teeth* he had left: for each *order* not followed well enough his superior would knock one out.\<br></br>If you didn't complete your# length of service# in the French military, *Napoleon* would find you and pull out all your *teeth*, one by one.\<br></br>I remember my# length of service# in the military by thinking to the first day when I received *orders* to punch this guy until he has no more *teeth*.\<br></br>This guy’s# length of service# in the Paraguayan navy has been very relaxing; the only *orders* he has been given so far are to brush his *teeth* twice a day.

董	Heavy flowery movies usually win best# director# at the academy awards.\<br></br>The# director# of a project gets the FLOWERS when the project succeeds and the HEAVY criticism when it fails.\<br></br>The# director# of the 747-*heavy* program looks on proudly as *flowers* from admirers rain down on the first 747-8.
鍾	Imagine a *heavy* *metal* concert (Deep Purple maybe?) that takes place on a 747-*heavy* flying from New York to Tokyo. Now that would really# draw together# an interesting crowd.
痰	SICKNESS with INFLAMMATION = in# phlegm# ation!\<br></br>The *sick caveman* had a serious throat *inflammation* and was constantly coughing up foul-looking yellow# phlegm#.\<br></br>During #sickness #, #inflammation# is the body's attempt to remove damaged cells, irritants, or pathogens -# phlegm# is its successful outcome. So #sickness# causes #inflammation# which causes #phlegm# which we spit out and this results in healing - aint nature a wondrous thing...\<br></br>Not to be confused with <a href="/study/kanji/2222">snot</a> <span class="index">(#2222)</span>. As in Book 1, I will sometimes use *The Sickness*, a made-up band, as the name for the *sickness* radical. Here, *The Sickness* needs to cancel a show because their lead singer has a bad *inflammation* of the nose and is coughing up buckets of# phlegm#.
症	When you have a SICKNESS, get checked out CORRECTLY to make sure its not a serious# disease#.\<br></br>You ask the *sick caveman* if he's sick because of a# disease#, to which the answer is: *correct*!\<br></br>The *sick caveman* loves playing "Name that# Disease#" because he knows all the *correct* answers from experience.\<br></br>A member of *The Sickness* blurts out before a concert: “some say rock and roll is a# disease#. But we think rock and roll is *correct!*”.
疼	SICKNESSES you get in the WINTER typically# hurt# (cold, flu, etc).\<br></br>And don’t confuse this one with <a href="/study/kanji/1167">harm</a> <span class="index">(#1167)</span>. An especially cold *winter* in North America #hurts# ticket sales for *The Sickness* because they like to play outdoors.
癒	The *sick cavemen* feels his appetite growing *more and more*, so he knows he's on his way to# get well#.\<br></br>*More and more* admirers of the leading singer for *The Sickness* (who was coughing up all that phelgm, see <a href="/study/kanji/2594">phlegm</a> <span class="index">(#2594)</span>) send him# get well# cards. This inspires them to record the album “#Get Well#,” with all proceeds going to charity.
疫	An# epidemic# is like a *missile* of *sickness* that explodes on the ground, sending coughs, flus and worse to everyone around.\<br></br>The *sick caveman* has come down with a very dangerous virus that could potentially start an# epidemic#, so he sacrifices himself for the good of humanity by having a *missile* shot at his cave.\<br></br>An# epidemic# is a SICKNESS that can take out populations faster than a MISSILE.
癌	This type of# cancer# is a SICKNESS that can only be treated by GOODS from the MOUNTAIN.\<br></br>#Cancer# is a *sickness* that is currently best treated by offering a *mountain* of *goods* to the gods.\<br></br>*The Sickness* raises money to cure# cancer# by selling a *mountain* of official *goods* -- old guitars, T-shirts, autographed posters and so forth. The goods donated are so high that they could cover a mountain, just as they do in this character (*goods* over *mountain*).
疲	The *sick cavemen* is easily# fatigued# and has to sleep often, covering himself with an *animal pelt*.\<br></br>Our *sick caveman* is very# fatigued# after spending the day skinning *animal pelts*. So he curls up with one and takes a nap.\<br></br>*The Sickness* is very# fatigued# after their tour through the Middle East, when they played in front of crowds of women wearing *burqas* (coverings).\<br></br>When you are# fatigued#, you are likely suffering from a disease, but this simple symptom covers up a much deeper problem.
疾	When you are struck with a poison DART, the SICKNESS sets in at a# rapid# pace.
痴	Being# idiotic# is like a SICKNESS where you seem not to KNOW anything.\<br></br>Our *sick caveman* *knows* he's# idiotic#, especially concerning medicine, but can't do anything about it. After all, he's just a caveman.\<br></br>The (imaginary) band *The Sickness* has become so popular that, if you don’t *know* who they are, you must be# idiotic#!\<br></br>Your stuck in the hospital and know exactly why you're sick but the# idiotic# hospital staff doesn't have a clue.\<br></br>To be# idiotic# is like having a *sickness* where you don't *know* anything.
瘤	A# tumor# could indicate you have an SICKNESS and must not be allowed to STAY in the body.\<br></br>A# tumor# is a kind of *sickness* of the cells that is very hard to get rid of and often *stays* within the body until death.\<br></br>Due to a malignant# tumor# that must be treated, a member of *The Sickness* must *stay* at home in his mansion while the rest of the band goes on tour.
痕	A ridiculous idea (that someone actually tried) is that if you have a# trace# amount of *silver* in you, you will never get *sickness* because the silver will act as an antiseptic. Sorry, doesn’t quite work that way.\<br></br>A werewolf develops a SICKNESS even if it has# trace# amounts of SILVER in it's blood.
癢	An allergic reaction is like a *sickness* that is *raised* from its slumber by some substance like pollen, and causes you to# itch# all over.\<br></br>*Simplified* [ #痒# ]: *Factoid* :# Itch# is a common #sickness# of #sheep# - caused by# itch# mite . Humans also succumb to this #sickness# - but each species has its own species of# itch# mite .\<br></br>Everyone in *The Sickness* #itches# terribly recently. That’s because one of them had asked their manager for a *raise*, and as revenge he slipped poison ivy into their body wash.
癱	#Paralysis# is not a SICKNESS, but it makes it DIFFICULT if not impossible to move.\<br></br>The *sick caveman* finds it *difficult* to move when he has# paralysis#.\<br></br>*The Sickness* complains that it’s really *difficult* to accommodate audience members with# paralysis# in their concerts. But the manager says, “tough, they have a right to be there too.”.
瘡	#Sore#s are little STOREHOUSES that form on your body when you have certain SICKNESS.\<br></br>The *sick cavemen* developed terrible# sore#s on his body after snooping around the *storehouse*. It turned out they stored# sore#s in the storehouse.\<br></br>When a member of *The Sickness* gets a cold# sore#, he decides to treat it by visiting an oil *storehouse* and dipping his face in a barrel of the black, gooey stuff.
穩	In my stories, we’ll visualize the *Heartbreak Hotel* as a place that you go after you’re heartbroken in order to recover. This guy, for example, visited the *Heartbreak Hotel* after his girlfriend dumped him and was on the verge of giving up, but after a steady diet of *wild rice* and lots of hugs from staff, he became# stable# again.\<br></br>The guy standing on the roof of the *Heartbreak Hotel* lamented his miserable life just before he jumped: I just wanted to have a# stable# life! Be a farmer and grow *wild rice*, something like that. Where did my life go wrong?\<br></br>Simplified 稳# stable# = *wheat*, *anxious*. Story: I invested a lot of money into *Wheat Chex* stock, so I was very anxious during the 2008 debacle. Luckily, everyone loves *Wheat Chex*, so it's stock remained# stable#.
隱	Aren’t# hidden# rooms interesting? Imagine that deep underground the *Burj Khalifa* is a# hidden# *Heartbreak Hotel* for Dubai residents to visit when they’re in romantic agony.\<br></br>One of the best kept secrets of human history is that the original recording of the *Heartbreak Hotel* is kept# hidden# deep inside the *Acropolis*.\<br></br>Simplified 隐# hidden# = *pinnacle*, *anxious*. Story: There's been a bomb threat at the *Burj Khalifa*. The security staff is very *anxious* as they search every nook and cranny to try and find the# hidden# bomb.
癮	Drug# addiction# is a HIDDEN SICKNESS that often goes unnoticed by the addict's family and friends.\<br></br>The *sick caveman* has a *hidden*# addiction# to cough syrup, but no one notices because he's always sick anyways.\<br></br>The lead drummer for *The Sickness* keeps his# addiction# to alcohol *hidden* from the public, and even from his fellow band members, because he’s too embarrassed to tell anyone.
巨	#Gigantic# means E-normous.\<br></br>I will name this primitive *Bowser*, Mario’s arch-enemy. Although you may not need a story to memorize this character, you can see# gigantic# *Bowser* as the *mouth* that features prominently in various *N64* games (N64 being my primitive name for *box*).
渠	The# canal# is blocked when a GIANT TREE falls into the WATER.\<br></br>To pass the time as you pass the *waters* of the Panama# Canal# (as the captain of a container ship), you face *Bowser* in the Nintendo game that you got under the *Christmas tree*.
拒	The best way to# refuse# someone is to give them the *giant* middle *finger*.\<br></br>The *giant* ape King Kong wrapped his *fingers* around Ann Darrow and# refuse#d to let her go.\<br></br>Who could# refuse# the opportunity to visit *Tokyo* and face *Bowser* in Nintendo’s latest games?\<br></br>The GIANT bouncer points his FINGER at you and# refuse#s to let you in the club.
矩	A DART can easily hit a GIANT# square#.\<br></br>They tried shooting poisonous *darts* at the *giant* King Kong to take him down, but it was back to# square# one when it turned out he was impervious to them (even when the darts were shot# square# in the face).\<br></br>Recall the first (1977) Star Wars movie when Luke shoots a *dart* into the 2m# square# target to destroy the *giant* Death Star.\<br></br>Instead of playing four# square#, kids these days only play against *Bowser* and throw *darts* at their teacher. No wonder scores on tests are declining!
距	With a GIANT WOODEN LEG, you can travel long# distance#s.\<br></br>The *giant* has a gigantic *wooden leg* that you can hear (knock... knock...) from a great# distance#.\<br></br>You have to be careful when facing *Bowser*, because even if he has a *wooden leg* after past fights against Mario, he can ‘go the# distance#’. So keep your# distance#!
框	A# rectangular frame# is a wooden box in which we keep a picture of the king.\<br></br>This and the next frame deal with making your N64 as stylish as possible. In January, you cut your *Christmas tree* into a nice# rectangular frame# that you use to panel your *N64* because to you, this classic console is a true *jewel*.
筐	When the wooden *box* (the <a href="/study/kanji/2616">rectangular frame</a> <span class="index">(#2616)</span>) with the *king*'s portrait needs to be transported to another museum, the best way to do so is to put it in a suitably sized# rectangular basket# made of *bamboo*.\<br></br>Get a nice *bamboo*# rectangular basket# to store your *N64* in in order to protect it from overheating, dust and water damage, since this console is a true *jewel*. And this way you’ll be the *king* of gaming.
砸	If you fill a BOX with TOWELS it might prevent a STONE from totally# smash#ing it.\<br></br>I found a treasure box, but it was locked. I was so curious to know what was inside, that I used a *stone* to# smash# the *box*, only to find out that the box just contained dirty *towels*.\<br></br>Your mother warns you: “If you spend your time playing Super# Smash# Brothers on the *N64*, wearing only a *towel*, your brain will turn to *stone*.”.
匯	I noticed that the little streams of water coming down the hill all# converge#d to a single point, so I put a *box* underneath to provide *water* to my *turkeys*.\<br></br>Instead of Schrodinger's Cat, a scientist who doesn't really get the idea does a Schrodinger's Chicken experiment. Instead of poison, he fills a box completely with water and puts a live chicken inside. "The chicken is simultaneously alive and dead!" Actually, the unknown state of the chicken definitely# converge#s upon being dead...\<br></br>*Factoid* #淮河# : The #Huái# river is a major river in China, located between the Yellow River and Yangtze . The #turkeys# of western China are transported in #boxes# along the major #water#way of the #Huái# river which# converge#s with the Yangtze River at Jiangdu, Yangzhou.\<br></br>Instead of eating the *turkey* lovingly prepared for their Christmas dinner, all the guys in the house# converge# downstairs, like streams of *water* becoming a lake, to sit in the basement and play *N64*.
匠	The# artisan# crafted the BOX with a TOMAHAWK.\<br></br>This Native American# artisan# sells beautifully crafted *boxes* with authentic *tomahawks* inside.\<br></br>This Native American# artisan# stores a *tomahawk* in a *box* under the counter in case someone tries to rob him.\<br></br>With all the money he made selling# artisan# *tomahawks*, this Native American buys an *N64* for his kid, not realizing that this system is 16 years old.
匪	The# bandit# was locked up in a BOX-like JAIL CELL.\<br></br>This# bandit# is notorious for stealing the *N64*s in your neighborhood. This makes him end up in a *jail cell*.\<br></br>To this# bandit#, a prison cell may as well be a box for how well it keeps him locked up.
匿	When you go to *Disneyland*, they carefully# keep out of sight# any indication that it's just make-believe. All the *boxes* with electronics and stuff that provide the illusion are hidden away.\<br></br>An introverted and video game-obsessed kid #keeps out of sight# even on a family trip to *Disneyland*. He spends all the time holed up in the hotel room, playing *N64*. Well, two years later he wins a video game championship!\<br></br>Make sure that the evidence we are going to Disney World #keeps out of sight# of our kids. It's supposed to be a big surprise so put it in a big box!
兜	#Pocket#s on WHITE pants look like 2 flat BOXES on each side of your HUMAN LEGS.\<br></br>OK, view the boxes on the left and right as the *mouth* of your# pocket#. It’s split in half because a confused *white bird* dove into it, causing the# pocket# to break. Note how the left box slants upward. Meanwhile the bird is stuck, so you run with your *human legs* out to a veterinarian who can hopefully pull the little chirp back out.
嘔	This REGION is known for its disgusting food. As soon as you put it in your MOUTH you want to# vomit#!\<br></br>This dog they use at the airport is specially trained. It opens it *mouth* to# vomit# as soon as it smells a suitcase with illegal *DVDs*.\<br></br>If you’re going to# vomit# the *goods* in your *mouth*, make sure not to do it on my *N64*!
毆	During the war, many REGIONS were# hit# by MISSILES killing many locals.\<br></br>Your watching a *DVD* about war: "I'm# hit#, I'm# hit#! May day, may day!" the pilow cries as his plane is# hit# by a *missile*.\<br></br>When this *DVD*# hit# the shelves, it was like a *missile*# hit# and became an immediate# hit#.\<br></br>The region was# hit# by a missile.
軀	She is SOMEBODY whose# human body# has some REGIONS I'd like to explore.\<br></br>Seems the *ugly science nerd* has found himself a *DVD* about the "human body" ^.^.\<br></br>“I know *somebody* who . . . “ is one way of bragging about some famous person you know. Well, say that you know *somebody* who knows about every single *region* of the# human body# (both PAL and NTSC ;-)). Who is it? Your doctor, of course.
昂	The stamp collector has finally completed his STAMP COLLECTION and hold's his head high to the SUN in pride.\<br></br>At Stamp-Con 2013, while everyone else brags about their *stamp collections* with their *tongues wagging in the mouth*, you simply #hold your head high#, because you know that yours is going to win the gold medal.
抑	The passionate stamp collector, trying to# curb# his emotions, could barely keep his *fingers* from shaking as he leafed through the *stamp collection* of incalculable value.\<br></br>You find a postage stamp for your letter, but luckily# curb# your *fingers* just in time as you realize it's part of this man's expensive *stamp collection*.\<br></br>You can barely# curb# your enthusiasm about going to *Tokyo* and compete in the world’s largest *stamp collection* competition after winning nationals (see <a href="/study/kanji/2627">hold one's head high</a> <span class="index">(#2627)</span>).\<br></br>The stamp collector can't# curb# his desire to get his FINGERS on a new STAMP COLLECTION.
葵	The# large-flowered plants# have FLOWERS that grow as tall as a TEEPEE and reach for the HEAVENS.\<br></br>Imagine a young guy in a *teepee* who dreams of going to *Heaven* and seeing large-flowed plants there, which, naturally, have very large *flowers*.
僚	*Mr. T's*# coworker# lives in a *pup tent*, because it's his doberman pincer guard dog!\<br></br>*President Romney’s*# coworker#, Vice President Ryan, sometimes sleeps outside the White House in a little *pup tent*, just because he hates being at the Naval Observatory (it’s not his style).\<br></br>This# coworker# is a PERSON that doesn't have a home so he lives in a PUP TENT at the office.
遼	When Shrek and Donkey travelled on the *road* to the kingdom of Far# Far Away#, they had to share a *pup tent*.\<br></br>You decide you need to get# far away# from it all, so you place your *pup tent* down on the median of the *George Washington Parkway*. Turns out# far away# wasn’t all that# far away# when you awake to the morning commute.
瞭	It's difficult to# comprehend# how one could lose an *eyeball* in an accident with a *pup tent*.\<br></br>You can’t# comprehend# how to put your *pup tent* back in the *sideways net* that it is supposed to go in, so you pore over the instructions with your *eyeball*.
療	The best way to# cure# our *sick caveman* is to get him out of this drafty *pup tent* and back to his comfortable cave, as it's probably just home sickness he suffers from.\<br></br>Simplified 疗# cure# = *sickness*, *-ed*. Story: You see this hanzi on traditional Chinese medicine/massage joints. Imagine our *sick caveman* visiting one to get his *sickness*# cure# *-ed*.

凳	The dwarf climbed the STEPLADDER to reach his# bench# to eat at his SMALL TABLE.\<br></br>There's an easy# bench#mark to decide the size of a table: if you need a *stepladder* to climb on top of it, it's definitely not a *small table*.\<br></br>Get two *small tables*, some length in-between, and put a *stepladder* on top of both to create a# bench#.\<br></br>Here we have a wannabe baseball player who# bench# presses a *stepladder* while doing crunches atop a *small table* -- it’s the full core workout.
澄	The swimmer climbed down the STEPLADDER into the# transparent# WATER.\<br></br>While doing minor construction work at the local pool, you drop your *stepladder* into the *water*, but fortunately the water is# transparent# – the trouble will be lugging the thing up!
潑	A grouchy store owner #splashes# the *courier* with *water* because he came an hour late with a critical document. A court case ensues, with both sides suing the other.\<br></br>泼 The COURIER out making deliveries is# splash#ed with WATER by a truck.

杉	To make the competition more exciting, the owners of a *ski jump* place #fir trees# down the slope, meaning the skier has to first dodge these *trees*, then still execute a nice jump.\<br></br>The# fir tree# is a TREE that grows into distinct triangular SHAPE.
彬	The FIR TREE is# well-mannered# and because of this it is the official Christmas TREE.\<br></br>A# well-mannered# rooster doesn't shit in the *woods* as he might get his *rooster tail* dirty.
衫	A #shirt# is a *cloak* that doesn't change it's *shape*. That is to say, it doesn't billow like an ordinary cloak does.\<br></br>The most flamboyant# SHIRT# in the world looks like a giant CLOAK made of ROOSTER TAILS. (Think of '70s Elton John).\<br></br>Instead of wearing a# shirt# to go down the *ski jump*, you should really go for a thick *cloak* instead in case you fall. Sound: shan1 When the *American* made it to the top of Mount (shan) Everest, he immediately took off his# shirt# and waved it around in the air!

膠	[Although Heisig implies that# gum# refers to tree sap instead of chewing# gum#, I’ll use the latter for a more memorable story.] Trouble at a tourist restaurant in Florida: a boy takes his# gum# out of his mouth and sticks it on his sister’s *flesh*; she reacts by tossing the contents of her *kiddie cocktail* into his face.\<br></br>*Icarus and Daedalus* glued #feathers# to their #flesh# with a #cocktail# of# gum# from resinous pine trees.

斑	The two *kings* of Ireland and England considered the *Highlanders* of Scotland to be tiny insignificant# speck#s of dust - until Braveheart came running down the hills.\<br></br>The HIGHLANDER is crushed between the 2 giant BALLS into a tiny# speck#.

薩	The American# Samoa# tourist board sets up an advertising campaign inside the *Burj Khalifa*, since they assume they will find plenty of rich travelers there. The ads encourage you to “Visit the fabulous American# Samoa#, where you can admire the tropical *flowers* and sample delicious island *products* with your spouse.”.
脊	*Mr. T* has just finished an epic battle and his *flesh* becomes a *sprinkler* of blood. When asked why he does this so often he answers, "A man must have# backbone#".\<br></br>President *Romney* visits the South, which he decides to call “America’s cultural# backbone#.” While there he waves a *sparkler* in the air and eats barbecued *flesh*.\<br></br>The# backbone# (spinal cord) lets a PERSON feel it when a SPARKLER touches their FLESH.

洪	When a lot of WATER gets TOGETHER there's a# deluge# (flood).\<br></br>Hurricane Katrina was a tragic# deluge# that must have wiped away many *French cuisine* restaurants in a flood of *water*. More tragic, of course, was the terrible loss of life it caused.
烘	The way to keep# WARM BY A FIRE# is to huddle TOGETHER down by the FIRE.\<br></br>Although this character likely refers to a verb, I’ll treat it as an adjective for my story.

[Once again (as in <a href="/study/kanji/2696">respectful</a> <span class="index">(#2696)</span>, because something is under the *animal legs*, the *animal legs* become longer strokes and connect to the base of the wire mesh, forming an enclosure for the *snowflake.].

撰	This is cowboy school where the students are TOGETHER wearing their SNAKESKIN boots, pencils in their FINGERS to# compose# their term papers.\<br></br>The newest fad in *Tokyo* is to# compose# a letter or even an essay by taking two *snakeskins*, stitching them *together* and then writing on them. The idea is that your writing remains concise and looks stylish (snakeskins are good-looking, are they not?), yet animal rights activists are horrified.\<br></br>Imagine someone trying to# compose# a very difficult essay. Naturally, the work is being done with his *fingers*, either by typing or grasping a pen. What he has to do next is similar to making choices. It's like he's struggling with a pair of *snake skins*. The arguments he has work great *together* and meet all of his needs, but he's only allowed to argue from one side.
啞	*Asia*, a land of over four billion *mouths*, will surely not be# mute# in global geopolitics in the decades to come.\<br></br>During *Mao's* Hundred Flowers campaign, it was best to keep your *mouth*# mute#.\<br></br>North Korea censors its media more than any other country in ASIA and MOUTHS that protest are# mute#d.
壺	*Asia* puts an honorary *crown* on the *soldier* who, on assignment abroad, introduced them to# kettle# chips and# kettle# popcorn, now staples of the modern Asian diet.

They put the# kettle# on to give him a taste of the *crown* of *Asia*: their excellent tea.
蟹	Before eating a# crab#, you must first *untie* the rubber bands holding its pincers shut, before breaking its *insect*-like legs in order to get at the meat under the carapace.\<br></br>A poor but wise man says that it would be better to *untie* yourself from your obsession to# crab# meat and eat *insects* than it would to go on addicted to the stuff.\<br></br>The# crab# isn’t truly an INSECT, but certainly looks like one. They’re real tasty, too, but you have to UNTIE it if you want to eat it. (thanks Megaqwerty @ rtk).

Perhaps it’s a popular pastime among the executives for PepsiCo and MasterCard, whose headquarters are based there.
溝	Visualize someone trying to remove some waste *water* from their# ditch# using a *sieve*! Don’t they know any better? You ought to use a bucket.\<br></br>Have you heard about the budget mineral *water* 'Eau de# ditch#'? Instead of claiming that it's been filtered through volcanic rock for millions of years, all they boast is that it's been put through a *sieve* for 30 seconds!\<br></br>If your survival depends on drinking# DITCH# WATER then first strain it through WIRE MESH - then strain it ONCE MORE - continue until clear.

Fortunately, after realizing their map contains a message that can only be read under a full *moon*, they realize that their map is the# key#! The message says that the door only opens on Durin's day, which is the last day of the last *month* of autumn.\<br></br>The# key# to learning this# key# character is that the# key# is made of #metal# - and it is has the pronunciation of the radical #flute 籥# - *yue4* - the most complicated radical No 214 - whereas the *simple mainlanders* opt for the radical moon #月# which has the same pronunciation.\<br></br>The university awards a particularly studious *study group* a *gold*# key# to the reference library so that they can use the space whenever they want.\<br></br>The only GOLD you might see at a STUDY GROUP are the little bits on the ends of USB# KEY#S.

倫	*Mr. T* wasn't always that, erm, social; when he was young he learned most about# human relationships# from the *library*.\<br></br>Simplified [#伦#] : A simple guy from the mainland may think that a #human relationship# may begin if he pretends to drown in the hope that a Baywatch babe #lifeguard# will save him and give him *mouth-to-mouth* - whereas in Taiwan [倫] guys are more serious and hang around #libraries# on the prowl for sophisticated *tottie*.\<br></br>Human relationship consists of *humans* and each of their stories require a *library* to tell.\<br></br>*President Romney* says that Americans need to develop more true# human relationships#, and in order to do so authorizes talking inside *libraries*.
抵	My *fingers* itch towards the loan shark's *calling card*, but I must# resist#.\<br></br>In *Tokyo*, even though you’re desperate for a job, you must learn to# resist# the urge to hand out your *calling card* out to everyone you see – you won’t find a job that way.\<br></br>A Japanese businessman can't# resist# getting a CALLING CARD in their FINGERS to give to a another businessman.

哺	This soldier must have been allowed to# breastfeed# for too long since he always has his DOG TAGS in his MOUTH.\<br></br>To# breastfeed# is an essential part of growing up and probably helps mother and child bond. But *Dr. Fu* never opened his *mouth* to# breastfeed# because his mother was not close to him – she abused and neglected him. Maybe that helps explain why he became so evil.

Whether that has happened or not is a matter of debate.\<br></br>The *tiger* managed to *drag* his victim down the *road* for a while (leaving a bloody trail) before he was apprehended by the cops and forced to# hand over# the body to the authorities.\<br></br>Simplified 递# hand over# = *younger brother*, *road*. Story: Your *younger brother* is tied up and strewn across the *road*. The criminals will run him over with a semi-truck unless you# hand over# a brief case filled with $100,000 cash.\<br></br>Before the tiger eats you he drags you on the road for awhile.
虜	It's very difficult to# take captive# a *male* *tiger*, because it has a bigger brain.\<br></br>#TAKE CAPTIVE# TIGER MALE. The prisons of Sri Lanka are full of Tamil TIGER MALES . They should be treated as PRISONERS OF WAR.
虐	This# despotic# ruler of a southeast Asian country says that he wants to ‘sweep some things away’ with a broom so that his country can become an Asian *tiger*. He could have swept with a ‘forward broom’ to remove corruption, totalitarianism and poverty. But instead, he swept with a *backward broom* and ‘swept’ all those who disagreed with him into political prisons. Now the country is far worse off.\<br></br>The# despotic# tyrant is as fierce as a TIGER and "sweeps" his critics away as easily as a BROOM.
膚	Sorry, but this *tiger’s* seeming love for you is only# skin# deep. In truth, he wants you in his *stomach*.\<br></br>Simplified 肤 :# Skin# is to #flesh# as a #husband# is to a wife - reassuringly protective although a bit sweaty.\<br></br>If you go into a tiger's stomach, all you will find is chewed up# skin#.\<br></br>Simplified 肤# skin# = *part of the body*, *husband*.

That’s convenient, since you’re in the mood for some tea – so you light a *fire* under it and get out your tea kettle. Unfortunately your *fire* burns the# stove# in the *Louvre* down to the ground, and you’re permanently kicked out of the museum.
蘆	Mr #Lu#'s eatery's speciality #dish# - #Tiger Brains# can also be served as a kebab - skewered on *bamboo*# reeds# on a bed of *jasmine* #flowers#.\<br></br>There's a modern piece of art at the *Louvre*: an entire room filled with *flowering*# reeds# through which visitors have to make their way.\<br></br>When told to bring a special kind of *flower* to exhibit at the *Louvre*, the post-modern artist brought# reeds#.\<br></br>Imagine “#reeds#” as a term referring to Reed University students.

驢	Mr #Lu# has been prosecuted - the food inspectors have found #horse# in his specialty #dish - Tiger Brains# .

You’d much rather stay in the hotel and play# Donkey# Kong 64.

垮	This *blowhard* ‘blows hard’ various things, true or false, out of his mouth all day. This makes him so tired that one day, without warning, the *blowhard* #collapses# onto the *soil*. When he picks himself back up he comes to see the need to change his ways.\<br></br>BRAGGING about his new home, the SOIL under it gives out causing it to# collapse# to the ground.
跨	This *blowhard* claims that he was the first one to# straddle# Tibet and India by standing high on Mount Everest, and what’s more, he did it with a *wooden leg* after a polar bear chewed his off on the way there.\<br></br>*足 = Oscar Pistorius* : # Oscar brags# that he can beat the 100 metres 9 sec barrier.

One ends up lost and the other winds up in some psycho's CAULDRON for dinner.\<br></br>Visualize a large water *cauldron* #separating# from the roof of the *Burj Khalifa*, falling 2,700 feet and crashing to the ground. Fortunately no one is hurt (except for the engineers’ pride).
濾	You *ponder* the nature of your water# filter# as you fill up the basin. Does it really# filter# the *water*, you *ponder*, or is this all a big marketing scam?\<br></br>As I came upon a stream of *water*, I *pondered* whether I should# filter# it before drinking.\<br></br>The TIGER passed some funny coloured pee and was THINKING about undergoing renal dialysis - but decides instead to# FILTER# his WATER ... always best to choose the simpler option first !!
慶	As the song goes, “Celebrate good times, come on!” What are we #celebrating?# You just killed your first *deer* while hunting.

麟	The# Chinese unicorn# has the body of a DEER and a JACK-O'-LANTERN for a head.\<br></br>You’re extremely pleased with your *Jack-o-lantern* because you intricately carved a# Chinese unicorn# into it. Unfortunately, all the trick-or-treaters assume it’s a misdrawn *deer painting* and point out its flaws to you – “what’s with the horn?”.\<br></br>Tom Cruise rode a# Chinese Unicorn# in the movie Legend.

You can start by letting them eat your *jack-o-lantern* instead of just throwing it out.”.

Like this guy in the character: he’s jealous of your *jack-o-lantern* carving skills, so he tosses it over the *city walls*, just to spite you.\<br></br>Tom Cruise (American with sunglasses) is my# neighbor# but I never see him because his walls are so darn high.

毀	First a *mortar* hits your *land*, then a *missile*, leaving the soil# ruin#ed. War is terrible.\<br></br>The MORTAR hit like a MISSILE# ruin#ing all the I-BEAMS in the building causing it to collapse.

竄	No use trying to catch a *mouse* -- it will just# scurry# back into its *hole*.\<br></br>Mice# scurry# into the hole.
臘	Mouse hairs primitive: This *mouse* puts a veritable *flood* of mouse hairs into his *mouth* to eat, as if they were *sheaves* of wheat. He eats this delicacy to celebrate the fact that there are no longer any *mortars* landing to disturb him; the war has ended (hence the absence of *mortar*). 2919.# dried meat# How disgusting!

The story is false, but he was indeed a great cardinal. [Heisig says these are *stitching*, but I see them more as ‘right hands’; see the DfKai font, for instance, which is what Reviewing the Hanzi seems to use.].\<br></br>The quilt is# embellish#ed with fine THREADS and intricate STITCHES.

[There's evidently a major difference in writing styles for this character; many fonts show the right part as *side by side*, whereas Heisig terms it as *animal horns* and *saguaro cactus*.].

濁	Fishermen can make the *water* below# turbid# when they pass a giant *butterfly net* of sorts under the water, a technique known as ‘bottom trawling.’.\<br></br>Simplified 浊# Turbid# = *water*, *insect*. Story:# Turbid# *water* is ideal for aquatic *insects*, so they can hide from predators.

觸	The wings of the insect you caught in your *butterfly net* are sticking out at a strange *angle*. It looks very agitated, so you'd better not# touch# it.\<br></br>Simplified 触 : Jesus (primitive for carpenter's square) was very specific when he created the insects, he warned "Don't# Touch#..." (you might get stung!).\<br></br>Ever heard MC Hammer say “Can’t# touch# this?” Imagine that you know you did terribly on a *math test* (my primitive name for *angle*).

劑	剂# Pharmaceutical# grade goods are carefully divided with a SABER until the portions are IDENTICAL and bottled up.
齋	Many people, especially the young, have a disordered desire to be the *mirror* image of the very *small* figures they see in magazines, so they# abstain from food# in hopes of reaching this unrealistic body size. Note that there’s no hook on the bottom of *small*!\<br></br>An interesting experiment: if you take *identical* twins and one of them will# abstain from food#, does that one remain *small* whilst the other one will grow fat?
擠	Simplified 挤# squeeze# = *finger*, *identical*. Story: I point my *finger* in between a couple of hot *identical* twins on a crowded subway and ask, "Excuse me, could I# squeeze# in there? Thanks =)".\<br></br>As a fat white guy #squeezes# into the *Tokyo* subway, everyone looks at him, because he’s not exactly the *mirror image* of your average Japanese resident.\<br></br>挤 Your FINGERS are in IDENTICAL formation when you# squeeze# something.

羞	A *clown* in real life is often very# shy# and the opposite of his stage character, somewhat like a wolf dressed in *wool* (sheep's clothing).\<br></br>Here we have someone whom we wouldn’t expect to be# shy#: a *clown*. But indeed he is: he asks everyone to cover their faces with *wool* so they can’t actually see him perform.\<br></br>This CLOWN is really# shy# and is so embarrassed about his appearance that he wears a WOOL cover.
紐	The *Joker* has left Gotham to terrorize *New York*. Looks like it's *Spider-man's* turn to take him down.\<br></br>Typical day in# New York# for Spider-man as he catches another CLOWN (criminal) with his web THREADS.\<br></br>Sound: Niu3 When the *Germans* learned that Niu York (New York) had more knobs and buttons than does any other city, they gave up and surrendered in WWII since Niu York was obviously more technologically advanced.
脾	Some would argue that relative to the heart or the lungs, the# spleen# is a *lowly* *part of the body*: not only does it get less attention, you can still survive after it is removed (although you may have a higher chance of dying from pneumonia, along with some other health risks).\<br></br>The# spleen# is considered a LOWLY PART OF THE BODY because it takes care of the leftovers in the blood like a hobo does in a garbage bin.
啤	Into the MOUTH of the LOWLY peasant goes his beverage of choice. Not wine, not whiskey, not cognac or brandy, but# BEER#.\<br></br>The LOWLY homeless man in the alley, MOUTH guzzling a# beer#.
碑	The #steles# for *lowly* people are made from rough *stones* that haven't been carved into any nice shapes.\<br></br>He died a *lowly* man, without any *stone*# stele# to mark his achievements. (Thanks haraksha and swilkins1984).\<br></br>In Ancient China, the# stele# was a STONE grave marker that was generally reserved for the nobility not LOWLY people.\<br></br>This stone# stele# is dedicated to a lowly man.
赫	When he came into office, he found out that his# illustrious# predecessor actually had a dark past; in fact, it was *crimson* upon *crimson*, as he had several of his opponents violently murdered.\<br></br>Seeing all the cardinals of the Catholic Church assemble in the Sistine Chapel would be# illustrious# -- *crimson* upon *crimson*.\<br></br>The# illustrious# (awe-inspiring) RED dress makes all the people in the room turn RED feeling insecure about there own attire.
嚇	Simplified 吓# Terrify# = *mouth*, *below* Story: Christians are all #terrified# that if they open their *mouth* and curse God, he will send them down *below*.\<br></br>The *mouth* that speaks *illustrious* truths can# terrify# those who hold on to falsehood and ignorance.\<br></br>What could# TERRIFY# you more than the image of a zombie who has freshly dined on human flesh? Its gaping, putrescent MOUTH is a geyser of blood, gushing with CRIMSON rivulets. (Reduplicated CRIMSON also appears as ILLUSTRIOUS #2971, but breaking the primitives apart again for this character makes more sense).
奕	A BIG RED apple is ripe and radiates vitality.\<br></br>This phrase is redolent of an advertisement for a shampoo, '#Radiant Vitality# - with *apple*. First we see a woman being mauled and slobbered over by a *big St. Bernard's dog*, before reaching for the product 'infused with natural essence of *apple*; she washes hair hair with it, and is immediately once again# radiating vitality#.\<br></br>William Tell first placed APPLES on ST BERNARDS heads for practice before trying it out on his son . Becos' of this his son is still# RADIATING VITALITY# whereas there are a few ST BERNARDS whose health paid the ultimate price - RIP .\<br></br>[I’ll also use *apple pie* as an alternate term for the *apple* primitive.] His wife is so upset to see him train the family *Saint Bernard dog* to fetch the *apple pie* that she makes him go to the# Radiating Vitality# fitness center three times a week until he does indeed display# radiating vitality#. [Note how *apple pie* sits atop the *big dog*, perhaps demonstrating how the pie is carried – atop its back.].
跡	Simplified : 迹 and the Lord saw that the apple had gone from the tree of good and evil and verily he summoned his cherubs and angels to hunt down the “perps” - so they scoured every HIWAY for# INDICATION#S of APPLE theft. Can you “Adam & Eve”(Cockney rhyming slang=believe) it !?!.\<br></br>Here we have an# indication# that the disabled pie-stealer is close by: we see his *wooden leg* and a piece of the *apple pie* that he snatched.
辭	After the <a href="/study/kanji/1500">chaos</a> <span class="index">(#1500)</span> died down and you could finally put away your fishhook, you found out that the reason for the vulture's weird behaviour was that it had been eating *chilli peppers*. And this, my friends, is where the expression "hot bird" in teenage# phraseology# comes from.\<br></br>Simplified 辞# phraseology# = *tongue*, *chili pepper*. Story: Your *tongue* is totally numb because you just ate a really hot *chili pepper*. . .and right before your oral# phraseology# exam! Doh!\<br></br>Basing this on the <a href="/study/kanji/1500">chaos</a> <span class="index">(#1500)</span> story: so this *vulture* stole your name *chop* that you need to sign your presentation, along with your *belt*, forcing you to hold up your pants by pinning your *elbow* against your *crotch*. You realize there’s no way to get the stuff back with a fishhook, which you tried in <a href="/study/kanji/1500">chaos</a> <span class="index">(#1500)</span>. So instead you make use of your only vulture# phraseology#: ‘food good’. You toss it a bright red *chili pepper* and it gladly accepts it, dropping the belt and chop back to the ground.
龜	This is a complicated pictograph of a# tortoise# seen from the side. The *bound up* primitive is its head. Below that is a kind of *mouth* with a hole in the bottom stroke, which indicates the entrance to its shell. The two vertical strokes are the *body* and the *tail*. Next are its feet, which are like the radical for *flower* but turned 90 degrees. Finally we see the# tortoise#'s shell on the right: a *mobile phone* (or farmer's almanac) without antenna.\<br></br>A# tortoise#, *bound up* in handcuffs and wearing a *crown*, is dragged into the police station. He’s quite a chatterbox, saying ‘I did nothing, I’m innocent!’. Well, he’s proven wrong – the police department finds a right human leg, a walking stick and two brooms inside the# tortoise#. They accomplished this by taking an *x-ray* inside the# tortoise#’s *mouth* [Note that the chatterbox primitive is tilted inwards both ways. Also note the hook at the end of the first stroke in mouth.].
繩	绳 A power cord /# rope# is like a long THREAD that plugs into an ELECTRICAL OUTLET.\<br></br>*Spider-man* likes to go water skiing by tying a# rope# to a large sea *turtle*. Don't let the animal cops hear about it!\<br></br>The primitive element for tortoise shows a real *chatterbox* of a *tortoise* who, like in <a href="/study/kanji/2977">rope</a> <span class="index">(#2977)</span>, swallowed a person’s *walking stick* and *right human leg*. But he was never *bound up* with handcuffs nor had an *x-ray machine* stuck inside his *mouth*. Instead, he wags his *wagging tongue* in the *sun* all *day*. 2977.# rope# (N) The *cardinal* gives some advice to an aspiring boxer: “Don’t go for the# rope# a dope strategy; you’ll be so beat-up afterward that a *tortoise* could outrun you.”.
蠅	Fat, lazy# flies# are the only *insects* that really move slow enough for a hungry *tortoise* to eat – there’s no way he can catch grasshoppers, bees and so forth.\<br></br>蝇# Flies# are INSECTS that get fried in ELECTRICAL OUTLETS (bug zappers).
蝴	Without the #Butterfly’s front end#, this *insect* would fly around *recklessly*, flapping its wings with no sense of direction.\<br></br>Despite butterflies beauty they are uncivilized like Tarzan.\<br></br>A# butterfly# (front end) is an INSECT that RECKLESSLY flutters about.
蝶	Without the #Butterfly’s back end#, this *insect* could not have a *family tree* of its own because it couldn’t reproduce.\<br></br>A# butterfly# (back end) color pattern tells the INSECT'S FAMILY TREE.
蜘	A# spider# (front end) is an INSECT that always KNOWS when something is in it's web.
蛛	A Black Widow# Spider# (back end) shows the INSECT'S VERMILLION hourglass marking.
駱	A# camel# is a kind of *horse*, that's obvious. But did you know that it has an inbuilt *walkie talkie* in the #camel's front end# to talk to other# camel#s across the desert?\<br></br>The #camel’s front end# spits on *each* and every *horse* it sees. Really not nice. But the horses don’t mind too much, because . . . (see <a href="/study/kanji/2984">camel (back end)</a> <span class="index">(#2984)</span>).\<br></br>Just imagine the# camel#s trekking the silk road hauling cellphones and cold beer.
駝	The *horses* use the #camel’s back end# as a refuge while playing tag in order to avoid becoming *It*.
蜻	2985 and 2986 discuss a very special# dragonfly# that helps guard the royal palace. The king bought it via mail-order, thinking it was an actual dragon, but he kept it in order to act as though it was his idea all the time to have a little *insect* guard his premises. The #dragonfly’s front end#” is like the *insect’s* *telescope*; it watches for intruders, whether of the insect or human variety.\<br></br>The# dragonfly# is an *insect* that has two large faceted eyes that act like *telescopes* in the #dragonfly's front end#.
蜓	The #dragonfly’s back end# is the part of the *insect* that stays within the *royal court*, so that if there’s any danger it can buzz its wings and alert the king.\<br></br>The emperor's kid is really mean. He likes to catch *insects* and torture them, which is why you find so many #dragonfly back ends# at the *royal court*.
鳳	High in the WIND there is ONE BIRD soaring above them all: the# MALE PHOENIX#.\<br></br>Simplified 凤 - The# MALE PHOENIX# is soaring on thermals (WIND) looking for ..... well, what are males of any species looking for .... CROTCH !! ( "Girls just wanna' have FENG.."Cyndi Lauper).\<br></br>2987 and 2988 will illustrate two married phoenixes that live in the *windy* city, Chicago. The# male phoenix# is a *bird* who is also a successful trader at the Merc and hence lives on the *ceiling* level of the Willis Tower.
凰	Soaring in the *wind* next to the male phoenix is the# female phoenix#, a *white empress* among birds.\<br></br>The# FEMALE PHOENIX# is soaring on a thermal ( WIND) looking for some hunky well-HUANG toy boy ... before having to return to her frail, inadequate and elderly EMPEROR .\<br></br>The# female phoenix# lives with her husband in the *windy city*, but dreams of using their riches to becoming the next *emperor* of China.\<br></br>#Female phoenix# is the *white queen* carried by the *wind*.
橄	Here are Grade #A# Olive#s#. They grow at the very top of the *tree*, where *brave* farmers must climb up to reach them.\<br></br>Extending an# olive# branch to your enemy takes bravery and daring.\<br></br>Branches from the# OLIVE# TREE were worn in ancient times by Olympic victors in order to symbolize their BRAVEry, among other things.
欖	Here are Grade #B# Olive#s#, certainly not to be confused with <a href="/study/kanji/2989">olive (A)</a> <span class="index">(#2989)</span>. They grow right at the bottom of the *tree* so they’re easy to pick, but they’re so puny that you would need a *magnifying glass* to see the hole in them.

You can only see the jewel if you look in through the #glass at the front side#.\<br></br>The #king# is dead and laying in state with a# glass# #covering# and queues of mourners filing past ....

葡	There are 2 parts to establishing the quality of #grapes# : PART 1 : their provenance ; which experts can establish by the vines FLOWER (or by a sneaky look at the BOUND ON ID label(DOG TAG) on the vine ) and by (to be continued).\<br></br>Again, I will visualize #grapes (A)# as #Grade A# grapes##.

萄	PART 2: (from prev. )...the resultant flavour of the FLOWER which is best discerned from the BOUND UP concentrate found in the TINNED grape juice. (Why anyone would taint the juice of the vine with tin is beyond me !

崔	What sound does a *pterodactyl* make?# Cui#.\<br></br>I named my cute pet *pterodactyl*# Cui# after the Chinese rockstar:# Cui# Jian. It's a real conversation hook with the Chinese girls when I take it for a walk/fly.\<br></br>‘C’ in Chinese is pronounced like ‘ts’, so keep that in mind with my (strange) story: Mr.# Cui# is a *pterodactyl*, and hence he wants everyone to# cui# (‘sway’) before him in fear!
曹	This CADET is a deserter and deemed a# Cao#ward.\<br></br>The poor *cadet* that suffered so much in our stories later became the famous warlord# Cao## Cao# (the second# Cao# is a different character).

He is depicted here with a *golden* *letter opener* and *saber*, to show both his political skills and his fighting abilities.\<br></br>Simplified 刘# Liu# = *highlander*, *saber*.

潘	When cooking and stirring the soup, you are TURNING the WATER in the# Pan#.\<br></br>The discovery of *fertilizer* in addition to *water* to help plants grow, was like the opening of# Pan#dora's (潘多拉) box : although plants grew faster, it could also harm the environment.\<br></br>Mrs.# Pan# is excited to drive up the# Pan#-American highway, but she finds to her dismay that it’s mainly made up of *fertilizer* and *water*.
梁	Ms.# Liang# spends a# liang# (long) time preparing her *Christmas tree* by adding *water* to it and trimming the branches with a razor *blade*. Sometimes her fingers slip and a *drop* of blood emerges on the right of the blade. She wants the tree to look at beautiful as possible. [Note that ‘water’ is bunched up at the top along with *blade* and *drop*; it may help to think of her pouring *water* down from the top of the tree through all its leaves, thinking this is more ‘natural’.].\<br></br>#Liang# Qichao, one of the most celebrated Chinese in the 20th century, was also a master swordsman. When he had time, he would sit on top of a *tree* and would clean his *sword* with *water*, a peaceful repose from the tragic times that he lived in. See the two *drops* being wiped from his sword.

譚	Tam is apparently a typo and this character is actually# Tan#, which is how it’s pronounced. Story: *early* in the morning, a cowboy in the *old west* sits down with a copy of Amy #Tan#’s “The Joyluck Club” and a *dictionary* to help him understand the sometimes-complicated language.
趙	Wikipedia says that# Zhao# was one of the seven large states in China during the Warring States Period.

He# xue#r (sure) is surprised when one day someone gives him a *chilli pepper*.

莉	I imagine it would be easy to retire in China and just grow# jasmine# *flowers* for a *profit* since they love their# jasmine# tea so much.\<br></br>Alt: Let’s imagine that# jasmine# *flowers* are extremely expensive, but if you make a good *profit* at work, you can probably save up enough to buy them.\<br></br>All your profit went to buying# Jasmine# flowers.

蓉	In China, the *flowers* of a #cottonrose hibiscus (B)# are said to resemble beautiful ladies, because they *contain* such beauty.
