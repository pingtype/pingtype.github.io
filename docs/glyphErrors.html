			Sometimes I'm trying to type a character, but can't find it from the parts. When I finally figure out which character it's supposed to be, the font on my iPhone looks different to the printed text. What's happening?
			
			<p></p>
			
			For example, let's look at "望" (盼望). Notice anything strange? Look at the photo.

			It looks like it's made of 亡 + 匀 + 王.
			
			<p></p>
			
			But on my computer, <font style="font-size:30px">望</font> looks like 亡 + 月 + 王.

			<p></p>
			
			Who is right? I asked a local person, and was told "Oh, it's just because computers think that Chinese is hard to write. But we can still understand. " As an engineer, I'm impressed about how forgiving people are. 
			
			<p></p>
			
			So I tried to tell Richard Cook from the Unicode Consortium. Again, he wouldn't admit fault, and refused to consider it without an academic proposal and consultation in front of 400+ experts. It's a font problem, he said, so it's none of his business and he doesn't want to change the recommended appearance. However, the Unicode website has a page of corrigenda, and that shows that they are making this type of fix. 
			
			<p></p>
			
			<a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum4.html" target=_blank>http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum4.html</a>
			
			<p></p>
			
			I think that he's just not willing to talk to me because I'm not an academic.

			一起 de 起 is 走巳 not 走己
			<p></p>
			打 de 丁 should be below the top line of 扌
			<p></p>
			"為甚麼" de "麼" and "摩西" de "摩" both share a part "麻" (má), which is 广 + 林. But it looks different to 林 in "摩". 
			<p></p>
			
			I'm keeping track of these in a file, <a href="../hubtext.html?filename=glyphErrors.txt" target=_blank>glyphErrors.txt</a>. Please add to it if you find any more.
