6. [1 min] Add Chinese to index (folderToIndex.sh)
7. [1 min] Find words in movie (referencesForWords.html)
	Edit code to select input index file
	Both numberWordsInSources and Output are outputs

	Input: Subtitles srt from extendSubtitles
	Click Times button
	Output: Output Times for Words, Output Words for Times, Output Times Commands, Output Words Commands
9. [1 min] Find new words (findNewWords.html)
10. Add new words to dictionary (PinyinDefinitions to Dictionary.scpt)
11. Proofread whole movie (pingtype -> translate)
12. [5 min] Generate subtitles (pingtype -> advanced -> regional, tocfl, load word lists, srt text into simplified textbox, subtitles button. 
	Chinese spaced is wordHeadings, simplified spaced is pingtype subtitles, text output is wordHeadings subtitles)
13. [30 min] Pad: /Users/peter/ApplicationSupport/ffmpeg/ffmpeg -i "movie.mp4" -vf "pad=width=1280:height=644:x=0:y=0:color=white" -threads 9 -preset ultrafast -strict -2 "moviePad1.mp4"
14. [25 min] Burn subtitles into movie
	/Users/peter/ApplicationSupport/ffmpeg/ffmpeg -i "moviePad9.mp4" -vf subtitles="moviecht&engExtendedPingtype.srt:force_style='FontName=PingFangTC-Regular,Outline=0'" -threads 9 -preset ultrafast "moviePad9SubPingfang.mp4"
15. [24 min] Make clips: clipsLengths.sh from "Output Times Commands" from subtitleWordsToTimes.html
16. [9 min] Make clip PNGs: lastFrameFolder.sh
	Move PNG files to another folder
	Check if the padding is correct, if not then repeat from step 13. Pad
17. [3 min] Make word clips: clipsToWords1.sh to clipsToWords6.sh from "Output Words Commands" from subtitleWordsToTimes.html
18. [4 min] Convert word headings subtitles to single files (Word Heading Subtitle Single Files.scpt)
19. [1 min] Make pinyin audio headings (wordHeadings -> lines beginning with cat -> pinyinAudioWords.sh)
	Go back and fix the dictionary when words don't exist, repeat from step 12. generate subtitles
20. [1 min] Make base video with same dimensions for word headings
	ffmpeg -i "last5SecondsPadCropPad.mp4" -vf "pad=width=1280:height=1014:x=0:y=0:color=white" -threads 5 -preset ultrafast -strict -2 "last5SecondsPad7.mp4"
	ffmpeg -i "last5SecondsPad7.mp4" -ss 0 -t 4 -acodec copy -vcodec copy "last4SecondsPad7.mp4"
21. Make word headings videos (wordHeadings -> lines beginning with ffmpeg -> wordSrtHeadingsToClips.sh)
22. [44 min to 5 hours] Combine word clips and word headings: wordHeadingsAndClips.sh or words1.sh, words2.sh, ... words6.sh
	The number of words you get out is different. Maybe this is because of word spacing (刮 = shave is not the same as 刮目相看 = admiration)
	When splitting the script into 6 parallel, don't do a linear split of e.g. 186 lines. Do 10 lines in script 1, 20 lines in script 2, 40 in script 3. (long videos are slower to combine)
23. Use TOCFL Word Levels.scpt to sort by level. 
	Sometimes you'll get missing words. This is because of word spacing errors. Manually edit the Pingtype index.html function examplesButtonClicked to add the data you need. 
	Then save the examples HTML, and add the extra lines to the bottom of the examples file e.g. youAreTheAppleOfMyEyeTocfl0-6.html. 
	If you want to change the dictionary and apply these changes over the whole movie, you can restart from step 11. 
24. Copy words to level folders using wordsToLevelFolders.sh
25. Rename to add level number and data source name
26. Upload to Google Drive. There is a maximum upload limit of 50 per day to YouTube. 
27. Put direct links to each video into the index HTML. 
28. Upload HTML index file to website.
