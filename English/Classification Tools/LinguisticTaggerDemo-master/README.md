LinguisticTaggerDemo
====================

This is a very simple demo showing the use of NSLinguisticTagger to highlight different lexical classes of words. (For example, nouns, adjectives, etc.)

It is inspired by the very cool Syntax Control feature in [Writer Pro](http://writer.pro). I was curious to see what sort of output NSLinguisticTagger produced.

It is largely based on Apple's TextKit demo for token highlighting.
