- a pop
- and all
- speaking
- that was
- to-be
a bad lot
a bag of bones
a bag of tricks
a ball of fire
a barrel of laughs
a bed of roses
a better mousetrap
a big deal
a big fish
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
a bit
a bit much
a bit of all right
a bit thick
a blast from the past
a blessing in disguise
a bowl of cherries
a breath of fresh air
a bump in the road
a bundle of joy
a bundle of nerves
a call to arms
a can of worms
a change of heart
a chip off the old block
a chip on one's shoulder
a clean bill of health
a cut above
a deal of
a dime a dozen
a dog's life
a done deal
a double-edged sword
a dying breed
a fact of life
a fair deal
a fate worse than death
a fine line
a firm hand
a fish out of water
a fool and his money are soon parted
a foregone conclusion
a free hand
a free ride
a friend in need is a friend indeed
a glutton for punishment
a good few
a good job
a good word
a great deal
a great many
a hard nut to crack
a head start
a helping hand
a hill of beans
a hornets' nest
a kick in the teeth
a kind of
a king's ransom
a labour of love
a laugh a minute
a leap in the dark
a leopard can't change his spots
a level playing field
a light touch
a little bird told me
a lump in the throat
a man's man
a matter of
a matter of course
a matter of life and death
a matter of opinion
a matter of record
a means to an end
a meeting of minds
a mile a minute
a monkey on one's back
a month of Sundays
a mouth to feed
a mug's game
a multitude of sins
a nasty one
a necessary evil
a needle in a haystack
a new one
a nice little earner
a pat on the back
a penny for your thoughts
a piece of cake
a piece of piss
a place in the sun
a play on words
a pretty penny
a quick one
a race against time
a rainy day
a raw deal
a rebel without a cause
a red rag to a bull
a right one
a road to nowhere
a rolling stone gathers no moss
a rope of sand
a rough ride
a sack of potatoes
a second thought
a shot in the arm
a shot in the dark
a shoulder to cry on
a sight for sore eyes
a sight to behold
a sinking ship
a slap in the face
a slap on the wrist
a slice of life
a slow burn
a small fortune
a song and dance
a square peg in a round hole
a stab in the back
a stab in the dark
a stiff upper lip
a stitch in time saves nine
a stone's throw
a storm in a teacup
a straight face
a straw in the wind
a tall order
a tangled web
a thing of the past
a thing or two
a touch
a tough nut to crack
a trifle
a voice in the wilderness
a walk in the park
a watched pot never boils
a wolf in sheep's clothing
a word to the wise
a year and a day
abandon ship

above suspicion
above the bit
above the law
