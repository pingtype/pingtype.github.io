the high ground
the how and why
the ins and outs
the international community
the jig is up
the joker in the pack
the jury is out
the land of Nod
the land of the free
the last minute
the last straw
the last word
the law of the jungle
the length and breadth of
the light of day
the likes of
the line of least resistance
the lion's den
the lion's share
the little woman
the Lord's Day
the Lord's Prayer
the Lord's Supper
the lowest of the low
the luck of the draw
the man in the moon
the Midas touch
the middle of nowhere
the mile-high club
the more the merrier
the naked eye
the name of the game
the nature of the beast
the new black
the new kid on the block
the new normal
the next world
the object of the exercise
the old days
the oldest profession
the oldest trick in the book
the one
the only game in town
the opposite sex
the order of the day
the other side of the coin
the other thing
the path of least resistance
the pen is mightier than the sword
the penny dropped
the plot thickens
the point of no return
the pot calling the kettle black
the powers that be
the printed word
the proof of the pudding is in the eating
the public eye
the real thing
the red planet
the rest is history
the right stuff
the roof of the world
the salt of the earth
the scheme of things
the school of hard knocks
the seven deadly sins
the seven seas
the shape of things to come
the sharp end
the short end of the stick
the silent majority
the silent treatment
the silver screen
the sky is the limit
the small of the back
the small screen
the spirit world
the sport of kings
the staff of life
the story goes
the straight and narrow
the streets are paved with gold
the strength of
the sun is over the yardarm
the Supreme Being
the thin end of the wedge
the three Rs
the thrill of the chase
the tip of the iceberg
the top of the tree
the upper crust
the very same
the water of life
the way of the world
the weaker sex
the weakest link
the weight of the world
the whip hand
the whole ball of wax
the whole enchilada
the whole nine yards
the wind of change
the windows of the soul
the witching hour
the word on the street
the world is your oyster
the worse for wear
the wrong side of the tracks
the wrong way round
then and there
there and then
there is no knowing
there is no saying
there is no telling
there it is
there will be hell to pay
there you go again
there you have it
there's no fool like an old fool
there's no such thing as a free lunch
thereby hangs a tale
these days
these presents
they say
thick and fast
thickish
thickly
thin air
thin end of the wedge
thin on the ground
things that go bump in the night
think again
think back
think big
think fit
think for oneself
think nothing of
think nothing of it
think on
think outside the box
think the world of
think twice
thinly
thinness
third cousin
this is it
this is the life
this much
this side of
thorned
those were the days
thread-like
three cheers
three parts
throated
through and through
through the ages
through thick and thin
