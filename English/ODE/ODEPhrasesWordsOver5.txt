if the mountain won't come to Muhammad, Muhammad must go to the mountain
when the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into a ditch
you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
the best-laid plans of mice and men gang aft agley
set a beggar on horseback and he'll ride to the Devil
look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves
if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
he who sups with the devil should have a long spoon
better the devil you know than the devil you don't know
be unable to punch one's way out of a paper bag
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
a prophet is not without honour save in his own country
a nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
what the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve over
there's none so blind as those who will not see
there's many a good tune played on an old fiddle
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth
the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing
six of one and half a dozen of the other
not trust someone as far as one can throw them
he who lives by the sword dies by the sword
every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost
you pays your money and you takes your choice
you can't put an old head on young shoulders
you can't get a quart into a pint pot
there's more than one way to skin a cat
the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
the proof of the pudding is in the eating
the devil finds work for idle hands to do
shut the stable door after the horse has bolted
run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
not to put too fine a point on it
look as if butter wouldn't melt in one's mouth
it's an ill wind that blows nobody any good
give a dog a bad name and hang him
don't spoil the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar
be not worth the paper it is written on
be born with a silver spoon in one's mouth
you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
you can't teach an old dog new tricks
you can't judge a book by its cover
there's no such thing as a free lunch
there's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip
there are plenty more fish in the sea
the devil can quote scripture for his purpose
the darkest hour is just before the dawn
the apple never falls far from the tree
take to something like a duck to water
take it into one's head to do something
put that in your pipe and smoke it
out of the frying pan into the fire
one can't make an omelette without breaking eggs
not let the grass grow under one's feet
not know if one is coming or going
not have a penny to bless oneself with
not be able to do something for toffee
not be able to do something a lick
need something like a hole in the head
ne'er cast a clout till May be out
many a true word is spoken in jest
look as if one has seen a ghost
lightning never strikes twice in the same place
know something like the back of one's hand
knock someone into the middle of next week
kill the goose that lays the golden eggs
it's a long lane that has no turning
it takes all sorts to make a world
it isn't over till the fat lady sings
in for a penny, in for a pound
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
he who pays the piper calls the tune
have eyes in the back of one's head
half a loaf is better than no bread
fools rush in where angels fear to tread
find it in one's heart to do something
don't put all your eggs in one basket
don't look a gift horse in the mouth
cut off one's nose to spite one's face
cross that bridge when one comes to it
count something on the fingers of one hand
born on the wrong side of the blanket
between the devil and the deep blue sea
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
be laughing all the way to the bank
as plain as the nose on someone's face
accidents will happen in the best regulated families
a miss is as good as a mile
a friend in need is a friend indeed
a fool and his money are soon parted
a change is as good as a rest
would not touch something with a bargepole
with the best will in the world
with one's hand in the cookie jar
why keep a dog and bark yourself?
where there's a will there's a way
want one's bread buttered on both sides
wait for the other shoe to drop
too many chiefs and not enough Indians
to err is human, to forgive divine
time and tide wait for no man
throw the baby out with the bathwater
throw one's toys out of the pram
things that go bump in the night
there's no fool like an old fool
there is only one thing for it
there is no rose without a thorn
the world, the flesh, and the devil
the wish is father to the thought
the pen is mightier than the sword
the long and the short of it
that one could cut with a knife
talk the hind leg off a donkey
take the words out of someone's mouth
take the wind out of someone's sails
take the law into one's own hands
take a leaf out of someone's book
spare the rod and spoil the child
sort out the men from the boys
someone's bark is worse than their bite
sell something for a mess of pottage
Rome was not built in a day
rise like a phoenix from the ashes
put someone on a charge of something
put one's money where one's mouth is
pull someone's chestnuts out of the fire
play one's cards close to one's chest
pick up one's marbles and go home
pay someone back in their own coin
one swallow does not make a summer
one man's meat is another man's poison
one could have bitten one's tongue off
one could do something in one's sleep
not the only pebble on the beach
not stand the ghost of a chance
not know what to do with oneself
not know the meaning of the word
not know one's arse from one's elbow
not have a shot in one's locker
not have a pot to piss in
not have a leg to stand on
not have a cat in hell's chance
not for all the tea in China
not as black as one is painted
nice work if you can get it
move heaven and earth to do something
make the best of a bad job
make it a rule to do something
make a rod for one's own back
make a mountain out of a molehill
look like something the cat brought in
like a bull in a china shop
like a bear with a sore head
light at the end of the tunnel
let the cobbler stick to his last
let the cat out of the bag
keep a civil tongue in one's head
it's no use crying over spilt milk
it'll be all right on the night
it is only a matter of time
in one ear and out the other
in a fair way to do something
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
if you can't beat them, join them
if wishes were horses, beggars would ride
if the worst comes to the worst
if it ain't broke, don't fix it
I will thank you to do something
how long is a piece of string?
hewers of wood and drawers of water
heap coals of fire on someone's head
have steam coming out of one's ears
have something coming out of one's ears
have someone eating out of one's hand
have one's heart in the right place
have a bone to pick with someone
go so far as to do something
give something up as a bad job
give someone a piece of one's mind
fall off the back of a lorry
enough is as good as a feast
eat someone out of house and home
drive a nail into the coffin of
dot the i's and cross the t's
don't count your chickens before they're hatched
don't come the raw prawn with me
dogs bark, but the caravans move on
discretion is the better part of valour
cut your coat according to your cloth
cut the ground from under someone's feet
bite off more than one can chew
between you and me and the wall
between you and me and the gatepost
between a rock and a hard place
be in the process of doing something
be full of the joys of spring
be drinking in the last chance saloon
be at the top of one's game
be all fur coat and no knickers
be able to hold a candle to
be able to hear a pin drop
all's fish that comes to the net
a trouble shared is a trouble halved
a square peg in a round hole
a cat may look at a king
a big fish in a small pond
a bad workman always blames his tools
you can't make bricks without straw
wouldn't say boo to a goose
work one's fingers to the bone
with the pedal to the metal
with one's tail between one's legs
with one's nose in the air
with one's heart in one's boots
with one's head in the clouds
when the shit hits the fan
when all is said and done
wear one's heart on one's sleeve
warm the cockles of one's heart
wake up and smell the coffee
wait on someone hand and foot
variety is the spice of life
two wrongs don't make a right
two heads are better than one
two can play at that game
twist someone around one's little finger
turn to ashes in one's mouth
turn something over in one's mind
too many cooks spoil the broth
to the best of one's knowledge
to the best of one's ability
to the best of my belief
to be on the safe side
throw something back in someone's face
throw one's hat in the ring
there will be hell to pay
there is no help for it
there is method in someone's madness
the wrong side of the tracks
the thin end of the wedge
the sun is over the yardarm
the streets are paved with gold
the short end of the stick
the shape of things to come
the scales fall from someone's eyes
the rough end of the pineapple
the pot calling the kettle black
the other side of the coin
the oldest trick in the book
the new kid on the block
the man on the Clapham omnibus
the game's not worth the candle
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
the fat is in the fire
the early bird catches the worm
the dirty end of the stick
the devil looks after his own
the bloom is off the rose
the be-all and end-all
the ball is in your court
that's the way the cookie crumbles
that's about the size of it
teach one's grandmother to suck eggs
tar people with the same brush
take the rough with the smooth
take the gilt off the gingerbread
take the bull by the horns
take something to the next level
take one's life in one's hands
take one's courage in both hands
take a load off someone's mind
suit the action to the word
suit someone down to the ground
strike while the iron is hot
stick out like a sore thumb
stand out like a sore thumb
squeeze someone until the pips squeak
so near and yet so far
shake the dust off one's feet
separate the wheat from the chaff
separate the sheep from the goats
separate the men from the boys
sell someone a bill of goods
see which way the cat jumps
see the error of one's ways
see the colour of someone's money
see a man about a dog
rule with a rod of iron
put the cart before the horse
put something on the long finger
put someone's nose out of joint
put someone in the way of
put salt on the tail of
put one's shoulder to the wheel
put one's head in a noose
put one's hand in one's pocket
put one's finger in the dyke
put a spoke in someone's wheel
put a brave face on something
pull the wool over someone's eyes
procrastination is the thief of time
price oneself out of the market
play both ends against the middle
pin one's colours to the mast
pick something out of a hat
out of sight, out of mind
out of a clear blue sky
one cannot live by bread alone
on which the sun never sets
on the tip of one's tongue
on the spur of the moment
on the side of the angels
on the horns of a dilemma
on the edge of one's seat
on the crest of a wave
on a wing and a prayer
off the top of one's head
not take no for an answer
not playing with a full deck
not know where to put oneself
not know the first thing about
not do something for the world
neither one thing nor the other
needs must when the Devil drives
necessity is the mother of invention
nail one's colours to the mast
marry in haste, repent at leisure
make someone's hair stand on end
make hay while the sun shines
make a man out of someone
make a clean job of something
make a clean breast of it
look like a bomb's hit it
look for all the world like
like water off a duck's back
like shooting fish in a barrel
like a shag on a rock
like a moth to the flame
like a lamb to the slaughter
like a dog with two tails
like a bull at a gate
like a bat out of hell
leave someone to their own devices
lay oneself out to do something
law of the Medes and Persians
know what one is talking about
know someone in the biblical sense
know how many beans make five
knock something into a cocked hat
kill two birds with one stone
kick someone when they are down
keep the wolf from the door
keep one's side of the bargain
keep one's nose to the grindstone
it never rains but it pours
in the lap of the gods
in the land of the living
in the heel of the hunt
in the heat of the moment
in the cold light of day
in no condition to do something
in a world of one's own
if the shoe fits, wear it
home is where the heart is
hitch one's wagon to a star
hit the nail on the head
hide one's light under a bushel
heads I win, tails you lose
he who laughs last laughs longest
have to hand it to someone
have the neck to do something
have the heart to do something
have the goodness to do something
have the face to do something
have the courage of one's convictions
have something to say for oneself
have one's nose in a book
have one's heart in one's mouth
have one foot in the grave
have many strings to one's bow
have had a drop too much
have been known to do something
have a word in someone's ear
have a will of one's own
have a whale of a time
have a plum in one's mouth
have a mind of one's own
have a frog in one's throat
have a foot in both camps
have a finger in the pie
have a finger in every pie
have a bun in the oven
have a bee in one's bonnet
has the cat got your tongue?
hand someone something on a plate
great oaks from little acorns grow
go to hell in a handbasket
go the way of all flesh
give someone the time of day
give as good as one gets
get something out of one's system
get one's knickers in a twist
get one's feet under the table
get in on the ground floor
from the bottom of one's heart
fall over oneself to do something
faint heart never won fair lady
everything in the garden is rosy
every cloud has a silver lining
err on the side of caution
enter into the spirit of something
drive a coach and horses through
don't give up the day job
don't call us, we'll call you
do bears shit in the woods?
do anything for a quiet life
distance lends enchantment to the view
desperate diseases must have desperate remedies
cost an arm and a leg
convert something to one's own use
chance would be a fine thing
catch someone with their trousers down
cast one's bread upon the waters
by the sweat of one's brow
by the skin of one's teeth
bury one's head in the sand
burn the candle at both ends
burn a hole in someone's pocket
brevity is the soul of wit
break one's neck to do something
bite the hand that feeds one
birds of a feather flock together
before one can say Jack Robinson
beat someone at their own game
beat a path to someone's door
be worth one's weight in gold
be unable to hear oneself think
be struck all of a heap
be staring something in the face
be staring one in the face
be on to a good thing
be on a hiding to nothing
be nothing to write home about
be not long for this world
be not about to do something
be carved on tablets of stone
be built like a brick shithouse
be blown out of the water
be barking up the wrong tree
be as good as one's word
be all hat and no cattle
be a weight off one's mind
at the risk of doing something
at the end of the rainbow
at the end of the day
at the drop of a hat
as one door closes, another opens
as far as one can tell
as far as I can see
art is long, life is short
an Englishman's home is his castle
an army marches on its stomach
all's fair in love and war
all that glitters is not gold
absence makes the heart grow fonder
a stitch in time saves nine
a sprat to catch a mackerel
a spare prick at a wedding
a rolling stone gathers no moss
a red rag to a bull
a peg to hang something on
a nasty taste in the mouth
a nail in the coffin of
a monkey wrench in the works
a matter of life and death
a leopard can't change his spots
a chip off the old block
a brick short of a load
a bad penny always turns up
