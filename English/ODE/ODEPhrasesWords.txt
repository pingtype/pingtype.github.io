with the best of them
with egg on one's face
wipe something off the map
who's she-the cat's mother?
whistle something down the wind
where there's muck there's brass
where someone is coming from
when the spirit moves someone
when the chips are down
when the balloon goes up
when push comes to shove
what someone is driving at
what planet are you on?
what goes around comes around

the great and the good
the gift of the gab
the ghost in the machine
the fruit of the vine
the female of the species
the fact of the matter
the face of the earth
the eye of a needle
the exception proves the rule
the end of the world
the end of the road
the end of the line
the end of one's tether
the end justifies the means
the elephant in the room
the devil's in the detail
the cut of someone's jib
the calm before the storm
the birds and the bees
the benefit of the doubt
the beginning of the end
the ball of the thumb
the ball of the foot
the back of one's mind
the back of an envelope
the apple of one's eye
the answer to someone's prayers
the angel in the house
that will be the day
that makes two of us
that is as may be
