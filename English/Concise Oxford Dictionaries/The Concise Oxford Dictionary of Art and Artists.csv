"abstract art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>abstract art</b>.<div class=""content"">Art that does not depict recognizable scenes or objects, but instead is made up of forms and colours that exist for their own expressive sake. Much decorative art can thus be described as abstract, but in normal usage the term refers to 20th-cent. painting and sculpture that abandon the traditional European conception of art as the imitation of nature. Herbert <a href=""entry://Read, Sir Herbert ""><span class=""links"">Read </span></a> (<i>Art Now</i>, 1948) gave the following definition: ‘in practice we call “abstract” all works of art which, though they may start from the artist's awareness of an object in the external world, proceed to make a self-consistent and independent aesthetic unity in no sense relying on an objective equivalence.’ Abstract art in this sense was born and achieved its distinctive identity in the decade 1910&ndash;20 and is now regarded as the most characteristic form of 20th-cent. art. It has developed into many different movements and ‘isms’, but three basic tendencies are recognizable: <blockquote>(i)&nbsp;the reduction of natural appearances to radically simplified forms, exemplified in the sculpture of <a href=""entry://Brancusi, Constantin""><span class=""links"">Brancusi </span></a> (one meaning of the verb ‘abstract’ is to summarize or concentrate);<br class=""nLine"" /> (ii)&nbsp;the construction of works of art from non-representational basic forms (often simple geometric shapes), as in Ben <a href=""entry://Nicholson, Ben""><span class=""links"">Nicholson's </span></a> reliefs;<br class=""nLine"" /> (iii)&nbsp;spontaneous, ‘free’ expression, as in the <a href=""entry://Action painting""><span class=""links"">Action painting</span></a> of Jackson <a href=""entry://Pollock, Jackson""><span class=""links"">Pollock </span></a>. Many exponents of such art dislike the word ‘abstract’, but the alternatives they prefer, although perhaps more precise, are usually cumbersome, notably non-figurative, non-representational, and <a href=""entry://Non-Objective art""><span class=""links"">Non-Objective</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><br class=""nLine"" />The aesthetic premiss of abstract art&mdash;that formal qualities can be thought of as existing independently of subject-matter&mdash;existed long before the 20th century. In 1780, in his 10th <i>Discourse</i> to the students of the Royal Academy, Sir Joshua <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a> advised that ‘we are sure from experience that the beauty of form alone, without the assistance of any other quality, makes of itself a great work, and justly claims our esteem and admiration’; and in discussing the <i><a href=""entry://Belvedere Torso""><span class=""links"">Belvedere Torso</i></a></span> he referred to ‘the perfection of this science of abstract form’. In the 19th cent. several notable writers followed this line (Maurice <a href=""entry://Denis, Maurice""><span class=""links"">Denis </span></a>, for example) and many of the leading painters of the 1890s&mdash;notably the <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolists</span></a>&mdash;stressed the expressive properties of colour, line, and shape rather than their representative function. This process was taken further by the major avant-garde movements of the first decade of the 20th cent.&mdash;especially <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauvism</span></a>. By 1910, then, the time was ripe for abstract art, and it developed more or less simultaneously in various countries. <a href=""entry://Kandinsky, Wassily""><span class=""links"">Kandinsky </span></a> is often cited as the first person to paint an abstract picture, but no artist can in fact be singled out for the distinction. (A work by Kandinsky known as <i>‘First Abstract Watercolour’</i> (Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris) is signed and dated 1910, but some scholars believe that it is later and was inscribed by Kandinsky several years after its execution. This kind of problem arises not only with Kandinsky : several early abstract artists were keen to stress the primacy of their ideas and were not above backdating works.) Among the other artists who produced abstract paintings at about the same early date as Kandinsky were the American Arthur <a href=""entry://Dove, Arthur""><span class=""links"">Dove </span></a> and the Swiss Augusto Giacometti, cousin of Alberto <a href=""entry://Giacometti, Alberto""><span class=""links"">Giacometti </span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />The individual pioneers were soon followed by abstract groups and movements&mdash;among the first were <a href=""entry://Orphism""><span class=""links"">Orphism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Synchromism""><span class=""links"">Synchromism</span></a> in France. There was a particularly rich crop in Russia, with <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Rayonism""><span class=""links"">Rayonism</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Suprematism""><span class=""links"">Suprematism</span></a> all launched by 1915. The almost religious fervour with which some of the Russian artists pursued their ideals was matched by the members of the De <a href=""entry://Stijl, De""><span class=""links"">Stijl</span></a> group in Holland, founded in 1917. To such artists, abstraction was not simply a matter of style, but a question of finding a visual idiom capable of expressing their most deeply felt ideas. In the period between the two World Wars, the severely geometrical style of De Stijl and the technologically orientated Constructivism were the most influential currents in abstraction (they came together in the <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a>), although <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a> also had a strong abstract element. The first international exhibition of abstract art was held in Paris in 1930 and there were many outstanding individual achievements in abstraction in this period&mdash;the sculpture of <a href=""entry://Calder, Alexander""><span class=""links"">Calder </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Hepworth, Dame Barbara""><span class=""links"">Hepworth </span></a>, for example. However, in general figurative art was dominant, and abstract art was banned in totalitarian countries such as Germany and Russia. The second heroic period of abstract art came after the Second World War, when the enormous success of <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a> in the USA and its European equivalent <a href=""entry://Art Informel""><span class=""links"">Art Informel</span></a> made abstraction for a time virtually the dominant orthodoxy in Western art."
"Abstract Expressionism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Abstract Expressionism</b>.<div class=""content"">The dominant movement in American painting in the late 1940s and 1950s. It was the first major development in American art to lead rather than follow Europe, and it is often reckoned the most significant art movement anywhere since the Second World War. The energy and excitement it brought to the American art scene helped New York to replace Paris as the world capital of contemporary art, and much of the subsequent history of painting can be written in terms of reactions to it. The phrase ‘Abstract Expressionism’ had originally been used in 1919 to describe certain paintings by <a href=""entry://Kandinsky, Wassily""><span class=""links"">Kandinsky </span></a>, but in the context of modern American painting it was first used by the <i>New Yorker</i> art critic Robert Coates in 1945; by the end of the decade it had become part of the standard critical vocabulary. The painters embraced by the term worked mainly in New York (hence the term <a href=""entry://New York School""><span class=""links"">New York School</span></a>) and there were various ties of friendship and loose groupings among them, but they shared a similarity of outlook rather than of style&mdash;an outlook characterized by a spirit of revolt against tradition and a demand for spontaneous freedom of expression. The stylistic roots of Abstract Expressionism are complex, but despite its name it owed more to <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>&mdash;with its stress on <a href=""entry://automatism""><span class=""links"">automatism</span></a> and intuition&mdash;than to <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a>. A direct source of inspiration came from the European Surrealists who took refuge in the USA during the Second World War. The most famous Abstract Expressionist is Jackson <a href=""entry://Pollock, Jackson""><span class=""links"">Pollock </span></a>, whose explosive energy best sums up the movement, but the work of other leading exponents was sometimes neither abstract (the leering <i>Women</i> of <a href=""entry://de Kooning, Willem""><span class=""links"">de Kooning </span></a>) nor expressionist (the serene visions of <a href=""entry://Rothko, Mark""><span class=""links"">Rothko </span></a>). Even allowing for these wide differences, however, there are certain qualities that are basic to most Abstract Expressionist painting: the preference for working on a huge scale; the emphasis placed on surface qualities so that the flatness of the canvas is stressed; the adoption of an <a href=""entry://All-over painting""><span class=""links"">all-over</span></a> type of treatment, in which the whole area of the picture is regarded as equally important; and the glorification of the act of painting itself (see <a href=""entry://Action painting""><span class=""links"">ACTION PAINTING</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />Alongside de Kooning, Pollock, and Rothko, the painters who are considered central to Abstract Expressionism include <a href=""entry://Gorky, Arshile""><span class=""links"">Gorky </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Gottlieb, Adolph""><span class=""links"">Gottlieb </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Guston, Philip""><span class=""links"">Guston </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Kline, Franz""><span class=""links"">Kline </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Motherwell, Robert""><span class=""links"">Motherwell </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Newman, Barnett""><span class=""links"">Newman </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Still, Clyfford""><span class=""links"">Still </span></a>. Most of them struggled for recognition early in their careers, but during the 1950s the movement became an enormous critical and financial success. It had passed its peak by 1960, but several of the major figures continued productively after this. By 1960, also, reaction against the emotionalism of the movement was under way, in the shape principally of <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Post-Painterly Abstraction""><span class=""links"">Post-Painterly Abstraction</span></a>. Sculptors as well as painters were influenced by Abstract Expressionism, the leading figures including Ibram Lassaw (1913&ndash; ), Seymour Lipton (1903&ndash;86), and Theodore Roszak (1907&ndash;81)."

The group was open to artists of all nationalities and the organization was loose, so that at one time its numbers rose to as many as 400. It operated by arranging group exhibitions and by publishing an illustrated annual (1932&ndash;6) called <i>Abstraction-Création: Art non-figuratif</i>. Within this general principle the association was extremely catholic in its outlook and embraced many kinds of non-figurative art, although the emphasis fell increasingly upon geometrical rather than expressive or <a href=""entry://lyrical abstraction""><span class=""links"">lyrical abstraction</span></a>.

"academy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>academy</b>.<div class=""content"">Association of artists, scholars, etc., arranged in a professional institution. Although the name was applied to various informal gatherings of artists from <i>c.</i>1500, the first formal art academy was not set up until 1563, when Duke Cosimo de' <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici </span></a> founded the Accademia del Disegno in Florence. The prime mover was Giorgio <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>, whose aim was to emancipate artists from control by the guilds, and to confirm the rise in social standing they had achieved during the previous hundred years. <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, who more than anyone else embodied this change of status, was made one of the two heads and Duke Cosimo was the other. The next important step was taken in Rome, where the Accademia di S. Luca was founded in 1593, with Federico <a href=""entry://Zuccaro, Taddeo""><span class=""links"">Zuccaro </span></a> as its first president. More stress was laid on practical instruction than at Florence, but the Academy was not at all successful in its war against the guilds until the powerful support it received from Pope Urban VIII (Maffeo <a href=""entry://Barberini""><span class=""links"">Barberini </span></a>) in 1627 and 1633. Thereafter it grew in wealth and prestige. The only other similar organization in Italy was the Academy established in Milan by Cardinal Federico Borromeo in 1620. But meanwhile the word was very frequently used of private institutions where artists met to draw from life. The most famous example of this kind was organized by the <a href=""entry://Carracci""><span class=""links"">Carracci</span></a> in Bologna.<br class=""nLine"" />In France a group of painters, moved by the same reasons of prestige as had earlier inspired the Italians, persuaded Louis XIV to found the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1648. Here too the guilds put up powerful opposition, and its supremacy was not assured until Louis' chief minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, was elected Vice-Protector in 1661 and found in the Académie an instrument for imposing official standards and principles of taste. Colbert and <a href=""entry://Lebrun, Charles""><span class=""links"">Lebrun </span></a>, the Director, envisaged dictatorship of the arts, and for the first time in history the expression ‘academic art’ acquired a precise significance. The Académie assumed a virtual monopoly of teaching and of exhibition, and an orthodoxy of artistic and aesthetic doctrine obtained official sanction. Implicit in the academic theory and teaching was the assumption that everything to do with art can be brought within the scope of rational understanding and reduced to logical precepts that can be taught and studied.<br class=""nLine"" />Other art academies were founded in Germany, Spain, and other countries after the middle of the 17th cent., and by the end of the 18th cent. well over a hundred were flourishing throughout Europe. Among these was the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> in London, founded in 1768. Everywhere the academies made themselves champions of <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a> in opposition to the surviving styles of <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a>. There was some opposition to these bodies from the start. Towards the end of the 18th cent. French Revolutionary sentiment was especially bitter about the exclusive privileges enjoyed by members of the Académie, and many artists, with <a href=""entry://David, Jacques-Louis""><span class=""links"">David</span></a> in the lead, demanded its dissolution. This step was taken in 1793, and the Ecole des <a href=""entry://Beaux-Arts, École Nationale Supérieure des""><span class=""links"">Beaux-Arts</span></a> was set up in 1795. While this looked after practical instruction, social functions were left to the fine arts section of the Institut de France, which in 1816 was reconstituted as the Académie des Beaux-Arts.<br class=""nLine"" />The principal threat to academies, however, came from the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> notion of the artist as a genius who produces his masterpieces by the light of inspiration which cannot be taught or subjected to rule. Virtually all the most creative artists of the 19th cent. stood outside the academies and sought alternative channels for exhibiting their works, although <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a> for example, always craved traditional success at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a>. Academies still retained prestige in conservative cities, but they were condemned out of hand by the adventurous, and in 1898, in his book <i>Modern Painting</i>, the novelist and critic George Moore wrote ‘that nearly all artists dislike and despise the Royal Academy is a matter of common knowledge.’ Gradually compromises were made on both sides, and academies became more liberal in the face of competition from rival teaching institutions and artists' groups (such as the <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School and the <a href=""entry://New English Art Club""><span class=""links"">New English Art Club</span></a> in England and the <a href=""entry://Sezession""><span class=""links"">Sezessionen</span></a> in Germany and Austria). In spite of this liberalization, however, the word ‘academic’ now almost always carries a pejorative meaning, and is associated with mediocrity and lack of originality."

"académie","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>académie</b>.<div class=""content"">A French term for a private art school, several of which flourished in Paris in the late 19th and early 20th cents. The term ‘atelier libre’ has also been used to refer to such establishments. Entry to the official École des <a href=""entry://Beaux-Arts, École Nationale Supérieure des""><span class=""links"">Beaux-Arts</span></a> was difficult (almost impossible for foreigners, who from 1884 had to take a vicious examination in French) and teaching there was conservative, so private art schools, with their more liberal regimes, were often frequented by progressive young artists. Four of them are particularly well known. The <i>Académie Carrière</i> was opened in 1890 by Eugène Carrière (1849&ndash;1906), a painter of portraits, religious pictures, and&mdash;his speciality&mdash;scenes of motherhood. His style was characteristically misty, monochromatic, and vaguely <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolist</span></a>. <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a> was a great admirer of his work. There was no regular teaching at the school, though Carrière visited it once a week. It was here that <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a> met <a href=""entry://Derain, André""><span class=""links"">Derain </span></a>, thus helping to form the nucleus of the future <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauves</span></a>. The <i>Académie Julian</i> was founded in 1873 by Rodolphe Julian (1839&ndash;1907), whose work as a painter is now forgotten. The school had no entrance requirements, was open from 8 a.m. to nightfall, and was soon the most popular establishment of its type. Julian opened several branches throughout Paris, one of them for women artists, and by the 1880s the student population was about 600. Although the Académie Julian became famous for the unruly behaviour of its students, it was regarded as a steppingstone to the École des Beaux-Arts (Julian had been astute in engaging teachers from the École as visiting professors). Among the French artists who studied there were <a href=""entry://Bonnard, Pierre""><span class=""links"">Bonnard </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Denis, Maurice""><span class=""links"">Denis </span></a>, Matisse, and <a href=""entry://Vuillard, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Vuillard </span></a>. The list of distinguished foreign artists who studied there is very long. The <i>Académie Ranson</i> was founded in 1908 by Paul Ranson (1864&ndash;1909), who had studied at the Académie Julian. After Ranson's early death, his wife took over as director, and his friends Denis and <a href=""entry://Sérusier, Paul""><span class=""links"">Sérusier </span></a> were among the teachers. Among later teachers the most important was Roger <a href=""entry://Bissière, Roger""><span class=""links"">Bissière </span></a>, whose style of expressive abstraction influenced many young painters in the 1930s; his pupils included <a href=""entry://Manessier, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Manessier </span></a>. The <i>Académie Suisse</i> was founded in about 1850 by a former artists' model called Suisse ‘in an old and sordid building where a well-known dentist pulled teeth at one franc apiece
artists could for a small fee work from the living model without any examinations or tuition’ (John <a href=""entry://Rewald, John""><span class=""links"">Rewald </span></a>. <i>The History of Impressionism</i>). <a href=""entry://Courbet, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Courbet </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a>, and several of the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a> drew at the Académie Suisse, and it was there in 1861 that Camille <a href=""entry://Pissarro, Camille""><span class=""links"">Pissarro </span></a> first noticed the ‘strange Provençal’ Paul <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cezanne </span></a>, whose life drawings were ridiculed by his fellow students."

Acrylic paint first became available to artists in the 1940s in the USA and certain American painters discovered that it offered them advantages over oils. <a href=""entry://Colour Field painting""><span class=""links"">Colour stain painters</span></a> such as Helen <a href=""entry://Frankenthaler, Helen""><span class=""links"">Frankenthaler </span></a> and Morris <a href=""entry://Louis, Morris""><span class=""links"">Louis </span></a>, for example, found that they could thin the paint so that it flowed over the canvas yet still retained its full brilliance of colour. David <a href=""entry://Hockney, David""><span class=""links"">Hockney </span></a> took up acrylic during his first visit to Los Angeles in 1963; he had earlier tried and rejected the medium, but American-manufactured acrylic was at this time far superior to that available in Britain, and he felt that the flat, bold colours helped him to capture the strong Californian light. Hockney used acrylic almost exclusively for his paintings until 1972, when he returned to oils because he now regarded their slow-drying properties as an advantage: ‘you can work for days and keep altering it as well; you can scrape it off if you don't like it. Once acrylic is down you can't get it off.’ Other artists have remained loyal to acrylic and it is now a serious rival to oil paint, but in the 1990s doubts were expressed about its permanence."
"Action painting","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Action painting</b>.<div class=""content"">A type of dynamic, impulsive painting in which the artist applies paint with energetic <a href=""entry://Gestural painting""><span class=""links"">gestural</span></a> movements&mdash;sometimes by dribbling or splashing&mdash;and with no preconceived idea of what the picture will look like. It is sometimes used loosely as a synonym for <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a>, but such usage is misleading, as Action painting represents only one aspect of that movement. The term was coined by the critic Harold <a href=""entry://Rosenberg, Harold""><span class=""links"">Rosenberg </span></a> in an article entitled ‘The American Action Painters’ in <i>Art News</i> in December 1952. Rosenberg regarded Action painting as a means of giving free expression to the artist's instinctive creative forces and he regarded the act of painting itself as more significant than the finished work. Although the term soon became established, many critics were unconvinced by Rosenberg's idea of the canvas being ‘not a picture but an event’: Mary McCarthy, for example, wrote that ‘you cannot hang an event on a wall, only a picture.’ Rosenberg's article did not mention individual painters, but the one who is associated above all with Action painting is Jackson <a href=""entry://Pollock, Jackson""><span class=""links"">Pollock </span></a>, who vividly described how he felt when working on a canvas laid on the floor: ‘I feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be <i>in</i> the painting
When I am <i>in</i> my painting, I am not aware of what I'm doing. It is only after a sort of “get acquainted” period that I see what I have been about. I have no fears about making changes, destroying the image, etc., because the painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come through.’ In the work of lesser artists than Pollock, Action painting could easily degenerate into messy self-indulgence, and it came in for a good deal of mockery, especially after the British painter William Green (1934&ndash; ) took to riding a bicycle over the canvas, a feat imitated by the comedian Tony Hancock in the film <i>The Rebel</i> (1961)."

"aerial perspective","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>aerial perspective</b>.<div class=""content"">Term describing the means of producing a sense of depth in a painting by imitating the effect of atmosphere whereby objects look paler and bluer the further away they are from the viewer. Dust and large moisture particles in the atmosphere cause some scattering of light as it passes through it, the amount of scattering depending on the wavelength (hence colour) of the light. Short wave-length (blue) light is scattered most and long wave-length (red) is scattered least. This is the reason why the sky is blue and why distant dark objects appear to lie behind a veil of blue. The term ‘aerial perspective’ was invented by <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, but the device was used by Roman painters, for example at Pompeii. In the work of Italian painters of Leonardo's time, backgrounds sometimes look artificially blue, and in general aerial perspective has been more subtly exploited in Northern Europe, where the atmosphere tends to be hazier.

"air brush","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>air brush</b>.<div class=""content"">An instrument for spraying paint or varnish by means of compressed air. It looks rather like an outsize fountain pen and is operated in a similar fahion, the pressure of the forefinger on a lever regulating the air supply. It can be controlled so as to give large areas of flat colour, delicate gradations of tone, or a fine mist. The device was invented by Charles Burdick, an American watercolour painter, who patented it in England in 1893. He used the tradename Aerograph, which for many years was used as a general term for air brushes (<a href=""entry://Man Ray ""><span class=""links"">Man Ray </span></a> called paintings he did with an air brush ‘aerographs’).

As a painter Albers was best known for his long series, begun in 1950, entitled <i>Homage to the Square</i>. The paintings in this series consisted of squares within squares of closely calculated sizes and subtly varied hues.

Born in Genoa, the illegitimate son of an exiled Florentine merchant, he was educated at Padua and Bologna, and was an outstanding Latinist (at the age of 20 he wrote a Latin comedy that was acclaimed as a rediscovered Roman work). In about 1428 he went to Florence and became a friend of the most advanced artists&mdash;<a href=""entry://Brunelleschi, Filippo""><span class=""links"">Brunelleschi </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti </span></a>, Luca della <a href=""entry://Robbia, Luca della""><span class=""links"">Robbia </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a>. To all these, jointly, he dedicated his first theoretical work on the arts, <i>Della Pittura</i> (1436). (This was initially written in Latin as <i>De Pictura</i>, but Alberti translated it into Italian for Brunelleschi's benefit.) Alberti wrote on a wide variety of other topics, complementing <i>Della Pittura</i> with treatises on architecture (<i>De Re Aedificatoria</i>) and sculpture (<i>De Statua</i>). He worked on <i>De Re Aedificatoria</i> until his death and it became the first printed <i>book on architecture</i> in 1485: <i>De Statua</i> is generally dated to the 1460s. In these works Alberti turned away from the medieval outlook in which art was considered a symbolic expression of theological truths. Instead he emphasized the rational basis of the arts, and the necessity for the artist to have a thorough grounding in such ‘sciences’ as history, poetry, and mathematics. Alberti spent most of his life in Florence and Rome (he held a secretarial post in the papal court from 1432 to 1464), and he worked as an architect in both these places as well as in Mantua and Rimini. His buildings&mdash;among them the churches of S. Andrea and S. Sebastiano in Mantua, and the façade of Sta. Maria Novella and the Palazzo Rucellai in Florence&mdash;are among the outstanding architectural works of the early Renaissance, but almost no trace survives of his work as a painter or sculptor.

During the First World War Albright served in France as a medical draughtsman and worked with a meticulous detail and clinical precision that anticipated his later paintings, which shows a morbid obsession with death and corruption: sagging, almost putrescent flesh (which he described as ‘corrugated mush’), decrepit, decaying objects, and lurid lighting are typical of his work. Often it evokes a feeling of melancholy for a beauty that is past. He came from a wealthy family and his financial independence allowed him to work slowly, producing a small number of elaborate, highly finished paintings. For most of his life he lived in or near Chicago, and the city's Art Institute has the best collection of his works. It includes the painting Albright did for the Hollywood film (1943) of Oscar Wilde's <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, showing the loathsomely corrupted title figure; Albright's identical twin brother, <i>Malvin Marr Albright </i> (1897&ndash; ), did the portrait of the young and beautiful Dorian for this film."

whether I contemplate him in the character of a Poet, a Painter, or a Philosophic Analyst’. Allston spent his working life in Boston apart from two lengthy visits to Europe: during the first, 1801&ndash;8, he studied under Benjamin <a href=""entry://West, Benjamin""><span class=""links"">West </span></a> at the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a>, subsequently visiting France with John <a href=""entry://Vanderlyn, John""><span class=""links"">Vanderlyn </span></a>; the second stay in England was from 1811 to 1818. Up to <i>c.</i>1818 his Romanticism expressed itself in the grandiose and dramatic, and his large canvases exploited the mysterious, monumental, and terrific aspects of nature (<i>The Rising of a Thunderstorm at Sea</i>, Mus. of Fine Arts, Boston, 1804). In his later period he was a forerunner of the subjective and visionary trend in American landscape painting, which relied more upon mood and reverie than upon observation or drama, as in his famous <i>Moonlight Landscape</i> (Mus. of Fine Arts, Boston, 1819). Through his pupil <a href=""entry://Morse, Samuel Finley Breese""><span class=""links"">Morse</span></a> this type of landscape painting became indigenous to the USA.

<b>Alma-Tadema, Sir Lawrence</b><div class=""content""><i>(1836&ndash;1912).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter who settled in London in 1870 and took British nationality in 1873. He specialized in historical genre scenes, beginning with medieval subjects, but then&mdash;following a visit to Pompeii in 1863&mdash;turning to the ancient world. His paintings evoke a Hollywood vision of ancient Greece and Rome (and sometimes Egypt), with their sensuous depiction of beautiful women, exotic costumes, and marbled settings&mdash;<i>Punch</i> called him a ‘marbellous artist’. They were enormously successful and he had a sumptuous lifestyle in his house in St John's Wood, which had previously been owned by <a href=""entry://Tissot, James""><span class=""links"">Tissot </span></a> and which Alma-Tadema remodelled as a Roman villa. He was knighted in 1899 and received the Order of Merit in 1905. His success encouraged several imitators, including his wife <i>Laura</i> (1852&ndash;1909), his daughter <i>Anna</i> (1865&ndash;1943), and painters such as John William Godward (1861&ndash;1922) and Edwin Long (1829&ndash;91). However, Alma-Tadema's work went completely out of favour after his death, and his reputation did not revive until the 1970s. Now he once again pleases a large public; visitor surveys at the Getty Museum, Malibu, have revealed that his <i>Spring</i> (1894) is the most popular work in the collection."

Yet in spite of these varied influences Altdorfer's style always remained personal. Most of his paintings are religious works, but he was one of the first artists to show an interest in landscape as an independent genre. In works such as the altar for S. Florian near Linz (1518) or the <i>Christ Taking Leave of His Mother</i> (NG, London) he achieved a wonderful unity of mood between action and landscape, and two pure landscape paintings (without any figures) by him are known (NG, London, and Alte Pinakothek, Munich). His patrons included the emperor Maximilian and Louis X, Duke of Bavaria, for whom he painted the celebrated <i>Battle of Issus</i> (Alte Pinakothek, Munich, 1529), which formed part of a large series of famous battle-pieces from classical antiquity. With its dazzling light effects, teeming figures, and brilliant colours, it is one of the finest examples of Altdorfer's rich imaginative powers. From 1526 until his death Altdorfer was employed as town architect of Regensburg. No architectural work by him is known, but his interest in architecture and his skill in handling intricate problems of <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a> are demonstrated by his <i>Birth of the Virgin</i> (Alte Pinakothek, Munich)."

In 1440 he is said to have painted frescos at the Palazzo del Podestà depicting rebels against Cosimo de' <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici </span></a> who were sentenced to be hanged by the heels, earning him the sobriquet Andreino degli Impiccati (of the hanged men). These have been destroyed, and Andrea's earliest known surviving works are frescos in the church of Sta Zaccaria in Venice (1442). By 1444 he was back in Florence, designing a stained-glass window for the cathedral, and soon after he began his greatest work, a series of frescos on Christ's Passion for the monastery of Sta Apollonia (now a Castagno museum), dominated by one of the most celebrated of all portrayals of <i>The Last Supper</i>. In their emotional vigour and sinewy realism these paintings have been regarded as the pictorial equivalent of the sculpture of <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello </span></a>, but they also have something of Masaccio's monumentality. Andrea's other noteworthy works in Florence include the <i>St Julian</i> (S S.

Apart from a visit to Fontainebleau in 1518&ndash;19 to work for Francis I, Andrea was based in Florence all his life, although he probably visited Rome soon after his return from France, and made short visits else-where. He excelled as a fresco decorator (there are outstanding examples in Florence in SS. Annunziata and the Chiostro dello Scalzo), and he also painted superb altarpieces (<i>The Madonna of the Harpies</i>, Uffizi, Florence, 1517) and portraits (<i>A Young Man</i>, NG, London). His reputation was largely made and marred by <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>, who said that Andrea's works were ‘faultless’ but represented him as a weakling completely under the thumb of his wicked wife. In Robert Browning's poem on the painter (1855) and in a psychoanalytic essay by Freud's disciple Ernest Jones (1913) attempts are made to link a supposed lack of vigour in his mellifluous art with these traits of character. This, however, is hardly just and a good deal of Vasari's account of Andrea's private life has been shown to be factually inaccurate (the scandalmongering is mainly in the 1550 edition of his book and was suppressed in the 1568 edition). Andrea has suffered from being the contemporary of such giants as Michelangelo and Raphael, but he undoubtedly ranks as one of the greatest masters of his time. In grandeur and gracefulness he approaches Raphael, and he had a feeling for colour and atmosphere that was unrivalled among Florentine painters of his period. He also numbers among the finest draughtsmen of the Renaissance (the best collection of his drawings is in the Uffizi). Certain features of his art foreshadow the <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> experiments of his great pupils <a href=""entry://Pontormo""><span class=""links"">Pontormo</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Rosso, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Rosso Fiorentino </span></a>.

<b>Angelico, Fra</b>
<i>(Guido di Pietro )</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1395&ndash;1455).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter, a Dominican friar. Although in popular tradition he has been seen as ‘not an artist properly so-called but an inspired saint’ (<a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a>), Angelico was in fact a highly professional artist, who was in touch with the most advanced developments in contemporary Florentine art and in later life travelled extensively for prestigious commissions. He probably began his career as a manuscript <a href=""entry://illuminated manuscripts""><span class=""links"">illuminator</span></a>, and his early paintings are strongly influenced by <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a>. But even in the most lavishly decorative of them all&mdash;the <i>Annunciation</i> in the Diocesan Museum in Cortona&mdash;<a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio's </span></a> influence is evident in the insistent perspective of the architecture. For most of his career Angelico was based in S. Domenico in Fiesole (he became Prior there in 1450), but his most famous works were painted at S. Marco in Florence (now an Angelico museum), a Sylvestrine monastery which was taken over by his Order in 1436. He and his assistants painted about fifty frescos in the friary (<i>c.</i>1438&ndash;45) that are at once the expression of and a guide to the spiritual life of the community. Many of the frescos are in the friars' cells and were intended as aids to devotion; with their immaculate colouring, their economy in drawing and composition, and their freedom from the accidents of time and place, they attain a sense of blissful serenity. In the last decade of his life Angelico also worked in Orvieto and Perugia, and most importantly in Rome, where he frescoed the private chapel of Pope Nicholas V in the Vatican with <i>Scenes from the Lives of SS. Stephen and Lawrence</i> (1447&ndash;50). These differ considerably from the S. Marco frescos, with new emphasis on the story and on circumstantial detail, bringing Angelico more clearly into the mainstream of 15th-cent. Italian fresco painting. Angelico died in Rome and was buried in the church of S. Maria sopra Minerva, where his tombstone still exists. His most important pupil was Benozzo <a href=""entry://Gozzoli, Benozzo""><span class=""links"">Gozzoli </span></a> and he had considerable influence on Italian painting. He painted numerous altarpieces as well as frescos, several outstanding examples being in the S. Marco museum. His particular grace and sweetness stimulated the school of Perugia, and Fra <a href=""entry://Bartolommeo, Fra""><span class=""links"">Bartolommeo </span></a>, who followed him into S. Marco in 1500, had something of his restraint and grandeur. <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>, who referred to Fra Giovanni as ‘a simple and most holy man’, popularized the use of the name Angelico for him, but he says it is the name by which he was always known, and it was certainly used as early as 1469. The painter has long been called ‘Beato Angelico’ (the Blessed Angelico), but his beatification was not made official by the Vatican until 1984."

Critics often dismissed his work as portentously inflated and tasteless, but his royal portraits particularly were highly popular with the general public: more than 200,000 people went to see his second portrait of the Queen (NPG, London) during the fortnight when it was first exhibited in 1970."

He was deeply interested in historical methodology, and is regarded as the leading exponent of an approach that attempted to apply the Marxist interpretation of history to the arts. His views are most fully expressed in <i>Florentine Painting and its Social Background</i> (1948), in which he argues that developments in style and subject matter were directly influenced by social and political changes. The book was widely admired, but it was also attacked as being over-rigid in the way it linked artistic phenomena with social and economic causes. Antal's other books include the posthumously published <i>Hogarth and his Place in European Art</i> (1962), in which he applied his methods more subtly and flexibly, revealing his fascination with <a href=""entry://Hogarth, William""><span class=""links"">Hogarth </span></a> as an expression of English middle-class morality and culture.

<b>antique, the</b>.<div class=""content"">The physical remains of the Greek and Roman world, or more particularly the remains of antique sculpture, which have been for later artists an inspiration, a challenge, and a canon of perfection. Such remains have never been totally absent and seldom totally disregarded. Memories of classical ornament or drapery forms recur throughout the Middle Ages, but it was in Renaissance Italy that the recovery of the classical antique as a Golden Age in the past became a deliberate ideal. <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti's </span></a> writings, for example, testify to his admiration for antique statues and <a href=""entry://cameo""><span class=""links"">cameos</span></a>, and much of <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello's </span></a> work would be unthinkable without a close study of the antique. <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> attributed the attainment of perfection by the generation of <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> in no small measure to the discovery of the famous antiques of the Vatican collection, notably the <i><a href=""entry://Apollo Belvedere""><span class=""links"">Apollo Belvedere</i></a></span> and the <i><a href=""entry://Laocoön""><span class=""links"">Laocöon</i></a></span> (found 1506), though it was mainly the next generation, particularly visitors from northern Europe (<a href=""entry://Heemskerck, Maerten van""><span class=""links"">Heemskerck </span></a> for example), who systematically drew after the antique. Towards the middle of the 16th cent. the role of the antique in the curriculum of artists became firmly established. Giovanni Armenini in his <i>De' Veri Precetti della Pittura</i> (1587) already gives a list of ‘canonic’ antiques, including the famous <i><a href=""entry://Belvedere Torso""><span class=""links"">Belvedere Torso</i></a></span>, and such works were carried by means of engravings, casts, and copies into every artist's studio. The philosophical justification for this dependence on antique models was given in <a href=""entry://Bellori, Giovanni Pietro""><span class=""links"">Bellori's </span></a> famous oration, <i>Idea</i> (1664), where he claimed in the ancient statuary a revelation of an absolute beauty that had been discovered once and for all (see <a href=""entry://ideal""><span class=""links"">IDEAL</span></a>). To the followers of the academic doctrine each of the great antiques, to which now had to be added the <i><a href=""entry://Farnese Hercules""><span class=""links"">Farnese Hercules</i></a></span>, the <i><a href=""entry://Borghese Warrior""><span class=""links"">Borghese Warrior</i></a></span>, the <i><a href=""entry://Medici Venus""><span class=""links"">Medici Venus</i></a></span>, and the <i><a href=""entry://Barberini Faun""><span class=""links"">Barberini Faun</i></a></span>, represented a type of physique that could serve as a permanent standard for the artist. Nor was antique influence confined to those artists whose work was most obviously classical (such as <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>). <a href=""entry://Bernini, Gianlorenzo""><span class=""links"">Bernini </span></a>, for example, when he addressed the Academy in Paris in 1666, said ‘In my early youth I drew a great deal from classical figures, and when I was in difficulties with my first statue I turned to the <i><a href=""entry://Antinous""><span class=""links"">Antinous</i></a></span> as to the oracle.’ Reverence for the antique was given a new lease of life when the <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> movement reacted against the frivolities of <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> fashions. In opposition to earlier ideas, <a href=""entry://Winckelmann, Johann Joachim""><span class=""links"">Winckelmann </span></a> preached the belief that classical artists had deliberately avoided representing extreme passions, and he regarded the antique less as a source of expressive formulas than as a model of noble restraint. The authority of the antique declined with the onset of <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a>, with its stress on self-expression, but its influence has still continued. Drawing from casts of antique sculpture remained a part of most official art training into the 20th cent., and <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>, for example, often used classical art as a source of inspiration; in particular, his ‘Neoclassical’ paintings of the 1920s owed much to visits to the Archaeological Museum in Naples."

In 1475&ndash;6 Antonello visited Venice, where he painted the S. Cassiano altarpiece, of which two fragments only remain, both in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.

<b>aquatint</b>.<div class=""content"">An engraving method related to <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etching</span></a> but producing finely granulated tonal areas rather than lines. The term applies also to a print made by this method. There are several variants of the technique, but in essence the process is as follows. A metal plate is sprinkled with acid-resistant varnish, which is fused to the plate by heating, and when the plate is immersed in an acid bath the acid bites between the tiny particles of resin and produces an evenly granulated surface. The design is created by drawing on the plate with acid-resistant varnish, and great variety of tone can be obtained by immersing in acid and varnishing in turn (the longer the acid bites, the darker the tone). Aquatint was invented around the middle of the 18th cent., and in the late 18th and early 19th cents. was highly popular in England for reproducing water-colours (colour could be added by hand or by using several plates with different coloured inks). It has also been used as an original creative medium (sometimes in conjunction with other graphic techniques) by many distinguished artists, including <a href=""entry://Goya, Francisco de""><span class=""links"">Goya </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Degas, Edgar""><span class=""links"">Degas </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Rouault, Georges""><span class=""links"">Rouault </span></a>."

In sculptures such as <i>Walking Woman</i> (Denver Art Mus., 1912), he analysed the human figure into geometrical forms and opened parts of it up with holes and concavities to create a contrast of solid and void, issuing in a new idiom in modern sculpture. He had a one-man exhibition at the <a href=""entry://Sturm, Der""><span class=""links"">Sturm</span></a> Gallery, Berlin, in 1913, and he taught in that city between 1921 and 1923, when he settled in the USA. He taught in various places, but principally in New York, where he opened his own school of sculpture in 1939. Archipenko pursued an independent course, and was inventive in technique. He created sculpto-painting, in which forms project from and develop a painted background, and he was a pioneer in the revival of <a href=""entry://polychrome""><span class=""links"">polychromy</span></a> in sculpture. In 1924 he invented the <i>Archipentura</i>, an attempt to make movable paintings, and from <i>c.</i>1946 he experimented with ‘light’ sculpture, making structures of Plexiglas lit from within. Archipenko had a considerable influence on the course of sculpture both in Europe and in America, particularly in the use of new materials and in pointing a course away from the sculpture of solid form towards one of space and light."

A typical work is <i>Rudolph II as Vertumnus</i> (National-museum, Stockholm), showing the emperor as the Roman god of orchards, his head composed of fruit, flowers, and so on.

Though not naturalistic, his sculpture was figurative and humanistic, capturing typical gesture and attitude, as for example in <i>People in the Wind</i> (Tate, London, 1951). At the same time all his work gave great prominence to the qualities of the material&mdash;usually at this period bronze&mdash;in which the sculptures were cast. From the mid 1950s his figures became more impersonal in character and often larger in scale, and a new phase began in 1969, when he began to combine sculpture and drawing in figures of wood, plaster, and paper. In the 1970s he returned to bronze and began to explore non-human subject-matter."

<b>Armory Show</b>.<div class=""content"">An art exhibition (officially entitled the International Exhibition of Modern Art) held in New York, 17 February-15 March 1913, at the Sixty-ninth Regiment Armory. The initiative came from a group of artists, several of them from the circle of Robert <a href=""entry://Henri, Robert""><span class=""links"">Henri </span></a>, who in 1911 formed the Association of American Painters and Sculptors to organize the show. The breadth of conception with which the project was envisaged and conceived was largely due to the president, Arthur B. <a href=""entry://Davies, Arthur Bowen""><span class=""links"">Davies </span></a>. It was both a mammoth exhibition in sheer quantity (estimated at 1,600 works) and a daring presentation of new and still controversial art. The American portion gave a cross-section of contemporary US art heavily weighted in favour of the younger and more radical groups. The foreign section traced the evolution of modern art, showing works by <a href=""entry://Goya, Francisco de""><span class=""links"">Goya </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Courbet, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Courbet </span></a>, and the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionists</span></a>, as well as leading contemporary artists such as <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Kandinsky, Wassily""><span class=""links"">Kandinsky </span></a>. From New York the show went to Chicago (Art Institute) and Boston (Copley Hall). It was estimated that over a quarter of a million visitors paid to see it, and its impact was enormous. There was a good deal of ridicule and indignation (directed particularly at Duchamp's <i>Nude Descending a Staircase</i>), but there were also many positive reviews. It created a climate more favourable to experimentation and had a profound effect on many young American artists. Several important patrons and collectors made their first tentative purchases of modern art at the show. It has therefore become a commonplace to speak of the Armory Show as the real beginning of an interest in progressive art in the USA."

In 1277 he went to Rome, where he was in the service of Charles of Anjou: his portrait of Charles (Capitoline Mus., Rome) is one of the earliest portraitstatues since the ancient world. His most important surviving work, however, is the tomb of Cardinal de Braye (d. 1282), in S. Domenico at Orvieto, which set the type of wall tomb for more than a century. The most famous piece of sculpture attributed to him is the bronze statue of St Peter in St Peter's, Rome. As an architect, Arnolfo had a great reputation in his day and began the building of Florence Cathedral. No other buildings are documented as being by him, but several other important Florentine buildings, including Sta Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio, have been attributed to him, notably by <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>.

Before the First World War he came into contact with the <a href=""entry://Blaue Reiter, Der""><span class=""links"">Blaue Reiter</span></a> group in Munich and participated in their second exhibition (1912), where he met Robert <a href=""entry://Delaunay, Robert""><span class=""links"">Delaunay </span></a>.

During the 1940s Arp lived first at Grasse with Sophie Taeuber, Sonia <a href=""entry://Delaunay-Terk, Sonia""><span class=""links"">Delaunay </span></a>, and Alberto Magnelli, then in Switzerland.

Dubuffet claimed that such art&mdash;‘springing from pure invention and in no way based, as cultural art constantly is, on chameleonor parrot-like processes’&mdash;is evidence of a power of originality that all people possess but which in most has been stifled by educational training and social constraints. In 1945 he began to make a collection of works free from cultural norms, and in 1972 his collection, by then numbering more than 5,000 items, was presented to the city of Lausanne, where it was inagurated at the Château de Beaulieu in 1976. Although nearly half the collection was produced by patients, usually schizophrenics, in psychiatric hospitals, Dubuffet repudiated the concept of psychiatric art, claiming that ‘there is no art of the insane any more than there is an art of dyspeptics or an art of people with knee complaints’. He also distinguished Art Brut from <a href=""entry://naïve art""><span class=""links"">naïve art</span></a> on the more dubious ground that the naïve or ‘primitive’ painters remain within the mainstream of painting proper, hoping for public if not official recognition, whereas the Art Brut artists create their works for their own use as a kind of private theatre."

The style takes its name from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, held in Paris in 1925. Initially it was a luxury style, with costly materials such as ivory, jade, and lacquer much in evidence, but partly because of the effects of the Depression it also found expression in materials that could be easily and economically mass produced. Although the term is not often applied to painting or sculpture, the Art Deco style is clearly reflected in the streamlined forms of certain artists of the period, for example the painter Tamara de <a href=""entry://Lempicka, Tamara de""><span class=""links"">Lempicka </span></a> and the sculptor Paul <a href=""entry://Manship, Paul""><span class=""links"">Manship </span></a>."

"Art Nouveau","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Art Nouveau</b>.<div class=""content"">Decorative style flourishing in most of western Europe and the USA from about 1890 to the First World War. It was a deliberate attempt to create a new style in reaction to the academic ‘historicism’ of much 19th-cent. art, its most characteristic theme being the use of sinuous asymmetrical lines based on plant forms. Primarily an art of ornament, it had its most typical manifestations in the practical and applied arts, <a href=""entry://graphic art""><span class=""links"">graphic work</span></a>, and illustration. The style takes its name from a gallery called L'Art Nouveau opened in Paris in 1895 by the art dealer Siegfried <i>(or Samuel)</i> Bing, a leading propagandist for modern design. However, the roots of the style were in England, where the <a href=""entry://Arts and Crafts Movement""><span class=""links"">Arts and Crafts movement</span></a> had established a tradition of vitality in the applied arts, and it spread to the Continent chiefly from London. In France, indeed, Art Nouveau is sometimes known by the name ‘Modern Style’, reflecting its English origin. In Germany the style was called Jugendstil (a name connected with the popular review <i>Die Jugend</i> founded in 1896); in Austria it was called Sezessionstil (see <a href=""entry://Sezession""><span class=""links"">SEZESSION</span></a>); in Italy Stile Liberty after the Regent Street store which had played so large a part in the dissemination of designs; and in Spain Modernista.

<i>(or Art Povera)</i>.<div class=""content"">Term (Italian for ‘poor’ or ‘impoverished art’) coined by the Italian art critic Germano Celant to unite certain aspects of <a href=""entry://Conceptual art""><span class=""links"">Conceptual</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Minimal art""><span class=""links"">Minimal</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Performance art""><span class=""links"">Performance art</span></a>. Celant, who organized an exhibition of Arte Povera at the Museo Civico, Turin, in 1970 and edited a book on the subject (<i>Art Povera: conceptual, actual or impossible art?</i>, 1969), hoped that the use of ‘worthless’ materials such as soil, twigs, and newspapers and the avoidance of the traditional idea of art as a collectable ‘product’ would undermine the art world's commercialism. However, dealers have shown that even this kind of of art can be commercially exploited. Among the artists whom Celant embraced by the term were Carl <a href=""entry://Andre, Carl""><span class=""links"">Andre </span></a>, Joseph <a href=""entry://Beuys, Joseph""><span class=""links"">Beuys </span></a>, and Walter <a href=""entry://De Maria, Walter""><span class=""links"">de Maria </span></a>."

<b>Arthois, Jacques d'</b><div class=""content""><i>(1613&ndash;86).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish landscape painter active in Brussels. He specialized in large wooded landscapes, with figures that were often added by other artists, notably <a href=""entry://Teniers, David the Younger""><span class=""links"">Teniers </span></a> the Younger. Few dated works exist, the development of his style is not easily followed, and the work of his brother, <i>Nicolas</i>, and his son, <i>Jean-Baptiste</i>, is sometimes indistinguishable from his. D'Arthois led an unstable life, being imprisoned for debt and dying in poverty despite his successful career. Paintings from his busy studio were often used to decorate churches; examples are in Brussels Cathedral."
"Arts and Crafts Movement","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Arts and Crafts Movement</b>.<div class=""content"">English social and aesthetic movement of the latter half of the 19th cent. that aimed to reassert the importance of craftsmanship in the face of increasing mechanization and mass production. The name derives from the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society founded in 1888, but the movement had its basis in the ideas of <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a> and the architect A. W. N. Pugin . They were the most eloquent and influential of the writers who deplored the aesthetic as well as the social effects of industrialization and nostalgically longed for the standards of craftsmanship of the medieval guilds, but it was left to the business-like genius of William <a href=""entry://Morris, William""><span class=""links"">Morris </span></a> to translate their ideas into practical activity. Morris set about the re-creation of hand industry in a machine age, producing hand-printed, hand-woven, hand-dyed textiles, printed books, wallpaper, furniture, and so forth. Aesthetically his work was highly successful, but his ideal of producing art for the masses failed for the simple reason that his products were necessarily expensive. Nevertheless, his ideas had great influence on craftsmen, teachers, and propagandists. In the 1890s the Arts and Crafts Movement was connected with the International style of <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a>. It spread abroad in the early years of this century, being particularly successful in Germany, Austria, the Low Countries, and Scandinavia, where it is still influential. In Germany it came to terms with the machine and may be considered an ancestor of the <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a>. The movement died out, or rather was transformed by the acceptance of modern industrial methods, but it has had a lasting legacy."
"Arts Council of Great Britain","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Arts Council of Great Britain</b>.<div class=""content"">Independent government body established in 1946 ‘to preserve and improve standards of performance in the various arts’. It has a large collection of British art, but this does not have a permanent home, and its main activity in connection with the visual arts consists of the organization and circulation of exhibitions, many of which are accompanied by scholarly catalogues. The Arts Council has two galleries in London used for such exhibitions: the Hayward Gallery, part of the South Bank arts complex alongside the Thames&mdash;a large, rather grim concrete building opened in 1968; and the much smaller and prettier Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens, which was originally an Edwardian tea-house and was opened as a gallery in 1970. Many Arts Council exhibitions travel to other venues in Britain."

Both men worked as architects, but Cosmas Damian was also a prolific fresco painter, and Egid Quirin was a sculptor and <a href=""entry://stucco""><span class=""links"">stuccoist</span></a>. They worked best as a team, and their ecclesiastical buildings were the supreme expression of the Bavarian delight in decorative display; architecture, painting, and sculpture unite to set a scene in which light and colour are the chief actors. The best known of their churches is that of St John Nepomuk, Munich (1733&ndash;46). The brothers themselves paid for the building (which was attached to Egid Quirin's house), and it is often referred to simply as the ‘Asamkirche’."
"Ash-can School","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ash-can School</b>.<div class=""content"">A term (first used in print in 1934) loosely applied to a group of American painters active in New York from about 1908 until the First World War, in reference to the everyday urban subject matter they favoured.

All four had been artist-reporters on the <i>Philadelphia Press</i> and so had been used to making rapid sketches of scenes of everyday life. In style and technique the artists of the Ash-can School are now seen to have differed less from contemporary academic painting than they themselves believed. Although they often painted slum life and outcasts, they were interested more in the picturesque aspects of these subjects than in the social issues they raised. <a href=""entry://Bellows, George Wesley""><span class=""links"">Bellows</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Hopper, Edward""><span class=""links"">Hopper </span></a> are among the other artists associated with the group."
"Ashmolean Museum","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ashmolean Museum</b>, Oxford.<div class=""content"">The most important of the museums belonging to the University of Oxford. The nucleus of the Ashmolean collection was formed by the ‘closet of rarities’ (a collection of curiosities rather than works of art) assembled by the traveller and gardener John Tradescant (1608&ndash;62) and given in 1659 to the antiquary Elias Ashmole (1617&ndash;92), who offered it to Oxford University in 1675. The original Ashmolean Museum was built by the University to the design of the mason and sculptor Thomas Wood to house this collection and was opened in 1683&ndash;the first public museum in Great Britain. The new building in Beaumont Street, designed by C. R. Cockerell, was opened in 1845, and this was enlarged in 1894. In 1899 the designation ‘Ashmolean Museum’ was transferred to the new building and the original museum of Thomas Wood became known as the ‘Old Ashmolean Building’. It now houses the Museum of the History of Science. The collections of the Ashmolean are large and varied. It is particularly rich in works from the ancient world (including marbles from the collection formed by Thomas <a href=""entry://Arundel, Thomas Howard, 2nd Earl of""><span class=""links"">Arundel </span></a> in the 17th cent.) and in Italian <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> paintings.

<b>Audubon, John James</b><div class=""content""><i>(1785&ndash;1851).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter-naturalist. Born at Haiti, the illegitimate son of a chambermaid and a French sea captain, he was educated in France and received instruction in drawing from J.-L. <a href=""entry://David, Jacques-Louis""><span class=""links"">David </span></a>. He moved to the USA in 1803 to avoid conscription in Napoleon's army and lived as a naturalist, hunter, and taxidermist, also earning some money as a portraitist and drawing master. His combined interests in art and ornithology grew into a plan to make a complete pictorial record of all the bird species of North America. Audubon was unable to find a publisher for this ambitious enterprise in America, so he went to England in 1826. His <i>The Birds of America, from Original Drawings, with 435 Plates Showing 1,065 Figures</i> was published in four volumes of hand-tinted aquatints (1827&ndash;38) and now ranks among the most famous and prized books of the world. The engraver and publisher was the London firm of Robert Havell and Son. It was followed by <i>The Viviparous Quadrupeds of America</i> (1845&ndash;8), which was completed by his son <i>John Woodhouse Audubon </i> (1812&ndash;62) after his sight failed in 1846.

"Bacon, Francis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Bacon, Francis</b><div class=""content""><i>(1909&ndash;92).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter, born in Dublin of English parents. He left home in 1925 at the age of 16 and moved to London, where he worked for a time as an interior decorator. In the late 1920s he lived in Berlin and then Paris (where he was powerfully affected by an exhibition of <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso's </span></a> work), then returned to London in 1929. He had no formal training as a painter. In the 1930s he began exhibiting in London commercial galleries, but he destroyed much of his early work and dropped out of sight until 1945, when his <i>Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion</i> (Tate, London), painted in the previous year, was exhibited at the Lefevre Gallery and made him overnight the most controversial painter in the country. Visitors to the exhibition were shocked by ‘images so unrelievedly awful that the mind shut snap at the thought of them. Their anatomy was half-human, half-animal, and they were confined in a low-ceilinged, windowless and oddly proportioned space. They could bite, probe, and suck, and they had very long eel-like necks, but their functioning in other respects was mysterious. Ears and mouths they had, but two at least were sightless. One was unpleasantly bandaged’ (John Russell, <i>Francis Bacon</i>, 1971). The emotional impact that Bacon's work makes depends not only on his imagery&mdash;characteristically single figures in isolation and despair&mdash;but also on his handling of paint, by means of which he smudged and twisted faces and bodies into ill-defined jumbled protuberances suggestive of formless, slug-like creatures from some nightmare fantasy: ‘I would like my pictures to look as if a human being had passed between them, like a snail, leaving a trail of the human presence and memory trace of past events as the snail leaves its slime.’. From the 1950s Bacon's work was shown in numerous exhibitions in Europe and the USA and won him an international reputation as one of the giants of contemporary art. In the catalogue of a major retrospective exhibition of his work held at the Tate Gallery in 1985, the Director of the gallery, Alan Bowness, called Bacon the ‘greatest living painter’, a judgement in which many critics at the time concurred, although others found the unrelenting pessimism of his vision hard to take. Alongside his reputation as a painter he built up a sulphurous personal legend on account of his promiscuous homosexuality, hard drinking, and heavy gambling."

He started work as a modeller in a porcelain factory and this experience left a permanent mark on his style as a sculptor, as his work, even in marble, is soft, often showing much pretty detail. The favour of George III gained him the important commission for the monument to the Earl of Chatham (the Elder Pitt) (Westminster Abbey, 1779&ndash;83), and he also carried out much sculpture at Somerset House, but his finest work is the monument to Thomas Guy (Guy's Hospital, 1779), showing the founder succouring a sick man.

His output was varied and extensive, including religious works, allegories and mythologies, portraits, designs for stained glass and tapestries, and a large body of graphic work, particularly book illustrations. He was active mainly in Strasburg, but from 1512 to 1517 he lived in Freiburg-im-Breisgau, where he worked on his masterpiece, the high altar for Freiburg Cathedral, the centre panel of which is a radiant <i>Coronation of the Virgin.</i> His most characteristic paintings, however, are fairly small in scale&mdash;erotic allegories such as <i>Death and the Maiden</i>, a subject he treated several times. Eroticism is often strongly present in his engravings, the best known of which is <i>The Bewitched Stable Boy</i> (1544), which has been interpreted as an allegory of lust."

From a visit to Paris in 1900&ndash;1 Balla brought back to Italy a feeling for <a href=""entry://divisionism""><span class=""links"">divisionism</span></a> and for colour and light, which he passed on to his pupils <a href=""entry://Boccioni, Umberto""><span class=""links"">Boccioni </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Severini, Gino""><span class=""links"">Severini </span></a>. His early works included landscapes and portraits, but after the turn of the century he became increasingly interested in portraying aspects of modern industrialized life. In 1910 he joined the Futurists and soon became preoccupied with their characteristic aim of portraying movement. Unlike the other Futurists, however, Balla was not interested in machines and violence and his paintings tend towards the lyrical and the witty. The most famous is the delightful <i>Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash</i> (Albright-Knox Art Gal., Buffalo, 1912), in which the multiple impressions of the dog's legs and tail convey movement in a manner that later became a cartoon convention. By 1913 he was painting semi-abstract pictures originating in observations of reality (<i>Abstract Speed&mdash;the Car Has Passed</i>, Tate, London, 1913). After the First World War, Balla stayed true to the ideals of Futurism after his colleagues had abandoned them, but he turned to a more conventional style in the 1930s. By the end of his long life he was much admired as the last survivor of a brilliant phase of modern Italian art."

From 1961 to 1977 he was Director of the French Academy in Rome. Otherwise he has spent most of his life living in seclusion in France or Switzerland. He works slowly and his output is small, but his highly distinctive, erotically charged images have made him internationally famous, indeed something of a cult figure. His work has appealed to critics as well as the public and he is widely regarded as one of the 20th cent.'s leading upholders of the great tradition of figure painting."

<b>Barnes, Dr Albert C.</b><div class=""content""><i>(1872&ndash;1951).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American drug manufacturer and art collector. He made a fortune with the antiseptic Argyrol, which he created in 1901 (its success depended largely on its being adapted as the standard anti-venereal treatment of the French Army), and by 1913 was devoting his life to collecting. His greatest interest was in modern French painting (his representation of <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a> being particularly outstanding), but he also bought Old Masters and primitive art. According to Kenneth <a href=""entry://Clark, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Clark </span></a> he was ‘not at all an attractive character. His stories of how he had extracted Cézannes and Renoirs from penniless widows made one's blood run cold.’ In 1922 he established the Barnes Foundation at Merion, Pennsylvania, to house his collection and to provide education in art appreciation. Barnes commissioned Matisse to paint a mural decoration for the Foundation in 1931, and when it turned out to be unusable because of an error in the measurements he had been given, Matisse did a new version. The abortive scheme, <i>The Dance I</i> (1931&ndash;2), is in the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and the second scheme, <i>The Dance II</i> (1932&ndash;3), is <i>in situ</i> in the Barnes Foundation. The museum Barnes created was closed to the public during his lifetime, and after his death the trustees engaged in litigation over whether it should be opened. An agreement was reached in 1960 allowing restricted public access, but it retained its reputation as a virtually inaccessible treasure house. In 1993&ndash;4, however, following court action, a selection of paintings went on tour to Washington, Paris, and Japan."
"Barocci, Federico","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Barocci, Federico</b>, <i>(or Baroccio Federico)</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1535&ndash;1612).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter. Barocci was born in Urbino and apart from two trips to Rome early in his career was based there all his life. He is said to have abandoned his frescos in the Casino of Pius IV in the Vatican Gardens (1561&ndash;3) for fear that rivals were trying to poison him, and the hypersensitive temperament this suggests comes out in his work. It consists mainly of religious paintings, which combine the influence of <a href=""entry://Correggio ""><span class=""links"">Correggio </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> (also a native of Urbino) in a highly individual and sensitive manner. His colour harmonies are sharp but subtle, and although his paintings often convey a feeling of intimate tenderness, his handling has great vigour. Despite the fact that he worked away from the main centres of art, his work was much sought after, his patrons included the emperor Rudolf II in Prague. And although Barocci constantly claimed to be ill, he had a long and productive career; he was prolific as a draughtsman as well as a painter and was one of the first artists to make extensive use of coloured <a href=""entry://chalk""><span class=""links"">chalks</span></a>. Barocci is generally considered the greatest and most individual painter of his time in central Italy; certain features of his work are thoroughly in the <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> tradition (his rather indefinite treatment of space, for example, and his delight in fluttering draperies), but in his directness and freshness he looked forward to the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a>. <a href=""entry://Bellori, Giovanni Pietro""><span class=""links"">Bellori</span></a>, the pre-eminent biographer of the Baroque age, considered him the finest Italian painter of his period and lamented that he had ‘languished in Urbino’."
"Baroque","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Baroque</b>.<div class=""content"">A term used in the literature of the arts with both historical and critical meanings and as both an adjective and a noun. The word has a long, complex, and controversial history (it possibly derives from a Portuguese word for a misshapen pearl, and until the late 19th cent. it was used mainly as a synonym for ‘absurd’ or ‘grotesque’), but in English it is now current with three principal meanings. Primarily, it designates the dominant style of European art between <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a>. This style originated in Rome and is associated with the Catholic Counter-Reformation, its salient characteristics&mdash;overt rhetoric and dynamic movement&mdash;being well suited to expressing the self-confidence and proselytizing spirit of the reinvigorated Catholic Church. It is by no means exclusively associated with religious art, however, and aspects of the Baroque can be seen even in works that have nothing to do with emotional display&mdash;for example in the dynamic lines of certain Dutch still-life paintings. Secondly, it is used as a general label for the period when this style flourished, broadly speaking, the 17th cent. and in certain areas much of the 18th cent. Hence such phrases as ‘the age of Baroque’, ‘Baroque politics’, ‘Baroque science’, and so on. Thirdly, the term ‘Baroque’ (often written without the initial capital) is applied to art of any time or place that shows the qualities of vigorous movement and emotional intensity associated with Baroque art in its primary meaning. Much <a href=""entry://Hellenistic""><span class=""links"">Hellenistic</span></a> sculpture could therefore be described as ‘baroque’. The older meaning of the word, as a synonym for ‘capricious’, ‘overwrought’, or ‘florid’, still has some currency, but not in serious criticism.<br class=""nLine"" /><a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio </span></a> and Annibale <a href=""entry://Carracci""><span class=""links"">Carracci </span></a> are the two great figures who stand at the head of the Baroque tradition, bringing a new solidity and weightiness to Italian painting, which in the late 16th cent. had generally been artificial and often convoluted in style. In doing so they looked back to some extent to the dignified and harmonious art of the High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, but Annibale's work has an exuberance that is completely his own, and Caravaggio created figures with an unprecedented sense of sheer physical presence. From the Mannerist style the Baroque inherited movement and fervent emotion, and from the Renaissance style solidity and grandeur, fusing the two influences into a new and dynamic whole. The supreme genius of Baroque art was Gianlorenzo <a href=""entry://Bernini, Gianlorenzo""><span class=""links"">Bernini </span></a>, an artist of boundless energy and the utmost virtuosity, whose work&mdash;imbued with total spiritual conviction&mdash;dominates the period sometimes called the ‘High Baroque’ (<i>c.</i>1625&ndash;75). Slightly later, Andrea <a href=""entry://Pozzo, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Pozzo </span></a> marks the culmination in Italy of the Baroque tendency towards overwhelmingly grandiose display.<br class=""nLine"" />In the 17th cent. Rome was the artistic capital of Europe, and the Baroque style soon spread outwards from it, undergoing modification in each of the countries to which it migrated, as it encountered different tastes and outlooks and merged with local traditions. In some areas it became more extravagant (notably in the fervent religious atmosphere of Spain and Latin America) and in others it was toned down to suit more conservative tastes. In Catholic Flanders it had one of its finest flowerings in the work of <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>, but in neighbouring Holland, a predominantly Protestant country, the Baroque made comparatively slight inroads; nor did it ever take firm root in England. In France the Baroque found its greatest expression in the service of the monarchy rather than the church. Louis XIV realized the importance of the arts as a propaganda medium in promoting the idea of his regal glory, and his palace at Versailles&mdash;with its grandiose combination of architecture, sculpture, painting, decoration, and (not least) the art of the gardener&mdash;represents one of the supreme examples of the Baroque fusion of the arts to create an overwhelmingly impressive whole. (The German term <i>Gesamtkunstwerk</i>&mdash;‘total work of art’&mdash;has been applied to this ideal.) In France, as in other countries, the Baroque style merged imperceptibly with the Rococo style that followed it."

His scheme of large decorative paintings on <i>The Progress of Human Culture</i> (1777&ndash;83), for the Great Room of the Society of Arts, London, is the most grandiose achievement of this kind by any artist of the British School, but its weak draughtsmanship and flabby rhetoric show that his ambitions far outstripped his talent. Barry was elected Professor of Painting at the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> in 1782, but after a series of quarrels was expelled in 1799.

<b>Bartolommeo, Fra</b>
<i>(Baccio della Porta )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1472/5&ndash;1517).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter. After training with Cosimo <a href=""entry://Rosselli, Cosimo""><span class=""links"">Rosselli </span></a>, he was deeply influenced by the preaching of Savonarola and entered the Dominican Order in 1500, giving up painting until 1504.

The two artists also evolved a new treatment, first adumbrated by <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, of the theme of the <i>Madonna and Child with the Infant St John in a Landscape</i>. Raphael, <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, and Leonardo had all left Florence by 1509 and in the second decade of the century Fra Bartolommeo was rivalled only by <a href=""entry://Andrea del Sarto ""><span class=""links"">Andrea del Sarto </span></a> as the leading painter in the city, which he left only briefly for visits to Venice in 1508 and Rome in 1514. His style acquired a solemn restraint and monumentality that made him one of the purest representatives of the High Renaissance (<i>The Mystical Marriage of St Catherine</i>, Louvre, Paris, 1511). Fra Bartolommeo was a brilliant draughtsman and the mystical element in his nature is expressed in his drawings, which escape the tendency to empty rhetoric occasionally shown in his later paintings. His drawings include not only figure studies, but also landscape and nature studies."

Apart from a period in the 1530s when he trained with <a href=""entry://Bonifazio Veronese ""><span class=""links"">Bonifazio Veronese </span></a> in Venice, Jacopo worked in Bassano all his life. His father, <i>Francesco the Elder</i> (<i>c.</i>1475&ndash;1539), was a village painter and Jacopo always retained something of the peasant artist, even though the influence of, for example, the fashionable etchings of <a href=""entry://Parmigianino ""><span class=""links"">Parmigianino </span></a> is evident in his work. He treated biblical themes in the manner of rustic genre scenes, using genuine country types and portraying animals with real interest. In this way he helped to develop the taste for paintings in which the <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> or still-life element assumes greater importance than the ostensible religious subject. From around 1560 his work became vested with a more exaggerated search for novel effects of light, taking on something of the iridescent colouring of <a href=""entry://Tintoretto ""><span class=""links"">Tintoretto</span></a>.

<b>Baudelaire, Charles</b><div class=""content""><i>(1821&ndash;67).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French poet and critic. As well as being a major poet, Baudelaire was one of the foremost art critics of his day. He held that there is no absolute and universal beauty but a different beauty for different peoples and cultures. Moreover, the individuality of the artist is essential to the creation of beauty and if it is suppressed or regimented, art becomes banal: ‘the beautiful is always bizarre’ was a favourite maxim. Baudelaire resisted the claims that art should serve social or moral purposes and was one of the leaders of the ‘art for art's sake’ school (see <a href=""entry://Aestheticism""><span class=""links"">AESTHETICISM</span></a>). He sought to assess the stature of an artist by his ability to portray the ‘heroism’ of modern life. <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a>, to whom he devoted some of his most perceptive essays, he found unsuitable owing to his predilection for <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> and exotic subject-matter. <a href=""entry://Courbet, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Courbet </span></a> seemed to him too materialistic and he finally chose the relatively minor painter Constantin <a href=""entry://Guys, Constantin""><span class=""links"">Guys</span></a> as the representative <i>par excellence</i> of contemporary society, and wrote a long appreciation of his work entitled <i>Le Peintre de la vie moderne</i> (1863). He was a friend and supporter of <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a> and he is one of the persons depicted in Manet's <i>Music in the Tuileries Gardens</i> (NG, London, 1863) as well as in Courbet's <i>The Painter's Studio</i> (Musée d'Orsay, Paris, 1854&ndash;5).

"Bauhaus","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Bauhaus</b>.<div class=""content"">A school of art and design founded by Walter <a href=""entry://Gropius, Walter""><span class=""links"">Gropius </span></a> in Weimar in 1919 and closed by the Nazis in 1933; although it had such a short life it was the most famous art school of the 20th cent., playing key roles in establishing the relationship between design and industrial techniques and in breaking down the hierarchy that had previously divided ‘fine’ from ‘applied’ arts. The Bauhaus was created when Gropius was appointed head of two art schools in Weimar in 1919 and united them in one; they were the Kunstgewerbeschule (Arts and Crafts School) and the Hochschule für Bildende Kunst (Institute of Fine Arts). He gave his new school the name Staatliches Bauhaus in Weimar (Weimar State ‘Building House’), coining himself the word ‘Bauhaus’ (an inversion of ‘Hausbau’&mdash;house construction). His prospectus formulated three main aims for the school: first, to unite the arts so that painters, sculptors, and craftsmen could in future embark on co-operative projects, combining all their skills harmoniously; secondly, to raise the status of the crafts to that enjoyed by the fine arts; and thirdly, to establish ‘constant contact with the leaders of the crafts and industries of the country’ (an important factor if the school were to survive in a country that was in economic chaos after the war).<br class=""nLine"" />All students had to take a six-month ‘Preliminary Course’ (<i>Vorkurs</i>) in which they studied the principles of form and colour, were acquainted with various materials, and were encouraged to develop their creativity. After that they moved on to workshop training in the field of their choice. Gropius brought together a remarkable collection of teachers at the Bauhaus. The first head of the preliminary course was Johannes <a href=""entry://Itten, Johannes""><span class=""links"">Itten </span></a>, and when he left in 1923 he was succeeded by László <a href=""entry://Moholy-Nagy, László""><span class=""links"">Moholy-Nagy </span></a>, who replaced Itten's rather metaphysical approach with an austerely rational one. The other teachers included some illustrious painters, most notably <a href=""entry://Kandinsky, Wassily""><span class=""links"">Kandinsky </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Klee, Paul""><span class=""links"">Klee </span></a>. Several students went on to become teachers at the school, notably Josef <a href=""entry://Albers, Josef""><span class=""links"">Albers </span></a>. In 1924 the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, where it was housed in a group of new buildings designed by Gropius . The school had been involved in architectural commissions from the beginning, but it was only in 1927 that an architectural department was established, with the Swiss architect Hannes Meyer (1889&ndash;1954) as its first professor. When Gropius resigned in 1928 to devote himself to his own practice he named Meyer as his successor. It was an unpopular choice with the staff, as Meyer was a Marxist and instituted a sociological approach that changed the whole tone of the school, with politics occupying an important place in the curriculum. In 1930 Meyer was forced to resign and was replaced by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886&ndash;1969), one of the greatest architects of the 20th cent. Mies tried to rid the Bauhaus of its political associations and thereby make it a less easy target for its right-wing opponents, but in 1932 the Dessau parliament closed the school. In an attempt to keep it alive Mies rented a disused factory in Berlin and reopened the Bauhaus there as a private enterprise, but it was closed by the Nazis in April 1933, soon after Hitler assumed power. In its last few years the Bauhaus was dominated by architecture, but it produced a great range of goods, with many of them (furniture, textiles, and electric light fittings in particular) being adopted for large-scale manufacture. They were highly varied in appearance, but the style that is generally thought typical of the Bauhaus was severe, geometric, and undecorated. The Bauhaus published a journal (<i>Bauhaus</i>, 1926&ndash;31) and a series of books, and its ideas were spread also by the emigration of many of its teachers before and during the Second World War. It has had an enormous influence on art education in the Western world and on visual creativity in general: ‘The look of the modern environment is unthinkable without it. It left an indelible mark on activities as varied as photography and newspaper design
[and] achieved a language of design liberated from the historicism of the previous hundred years’ (Frank Whitford, <i>Bauhaus</i>, 1984). After the Second World War Dessau became part of East Germany and the Bauhaus buildings were left derelict. In 1976 the school was faithfully restored for the 50th anniversary of its opening in Dessau, and after the reunification of Germany in 1990 it was reopened as a design institution."

Between 1911 and 1914 he had several stays in Paris (sometimes in company with his close friend Oskar <a href=""entry://Schlemmer, Oskar""><span class=""links"">Schlemmer </span></a>) and his early work was influenced by <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>. After military service in the First World War, he began to develop a personal style in a series (1919&ndash;23) of <i>Mauerbilder</i> (wall paintings), so called because he added sand, putty, etc., to his pigments to give a textured effect. In the mid-1920s his work became more figurative in a manner recalling <a href=""entry://Léger, Fernand""><span class=""links"">Léger </span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Purism""><span class=""links"">Purists</span></a> (he met Léger, <a href=""entry://Le Corbusier ""><span class=""links"">Le Corbusier </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Ozenfant, Amédée""><span class=""links"">Ozenfant </span></a> when he revisited Paris in 1924), and his work met with considerable acclaim in France. In 1928 he was appointed Professor of Typography at the Städel School in Frankfurt, but in 1933 he was dismissed by the Nazis, who declared his work <i><a href=""entry://degenerate art""><span class=""links"">degenerate</i></a></span>. From then until the end of the Second World War he worked in obscurity in Stuttgart. During this time his painting became freer, with suggestions of primitive imagery, creating a kind of abstract <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>. His interest in imagery from the subconscious was described in his book <i>Das Unbekannte in der Kunst</i> (The Unknown in Art), written in 1943&ndash;4 and published in 1947.

He made a name for himself in 1893 with illustrations for an edition of Malory's <i>Morte d' Arthur</i>, and in the following year he became the rage with the publication of his illustrations to the English version of Oscar Wilde's <i>Salome</i> and the appearance of the first issue of <i>The Yellow Book</i>, a quarterly periodical of which he was art editor. Owing perhaps partly to the tuberculosis which carried him off at the age of 25, his work had a morbid suggestion of depravity which made it the most controversial illustration of its day. Some of his work was frankly pornographic, including illustrations for his own <i>Story of Venus and Tannhauser</i> (he wrote poetry as well as prose), which was privately published in an unexpurgated edition in 1907.

"Beckford, William","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Beckford, William</b><div class=""content""><i>(1760&ndash;1844).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English collector, writer, and eccentric. A pampered millionaire from boyhood (at the age of 5 he had piano lessons from the 8-year-old Mozart), he became a legendary figure in his own lifetime. One of his cousins referred to him as ‘a second Lucifer’ (a reference to both his youthful beauty and his depravity), and in 1784 he left England after a homosexual scandal involving a 13-year-old boy. For the next decade he travelled widely on the Continent and after his return to England he lived in eccentric seclusion at Fonthill in Wiltshire, where the architect James Wyatt built for him Fonthill Abbey (1796&ndash;1807, now destroyed), a huge mansion dressed in ecclesiastical garb. He formed an excellent library and a vast collection of objects of every kind, both natural and artificial; it drew from William <a href=""entry://Hazlitt, William""><span class=""links"">Hazlitt </span></a> the wry comment that ‘the only proof of taste he has shown in this collection is his getting rid of it’, but it included some outstanding paintings (twenty of them are now in the National Gallery, London).

Early in his career Beckmann painted in a conservative, more or less <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> style, with which he made a good living, but his experiences as a medical orderly in the First World War completely changed his outlook and his style. His work became full of horrifying imagery, and his forms were expressively distorted in a manner that reflected the influence of German <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> art. The combination of brutal realism and social criticism in his work led him to be classified for a time with the artists of the <a href=""entry://Neue Sachlichkeit""><span class=""links"">Neue Sachlichkeit</span></a>, but Beckmann differed from such artists as <a href=""entry://Dix, Otto""><span class=""links"">Dix </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Grosz, George""><span class=""links"">Grosz </span></a> in his concern for allegory and symbolism. His paintings were intended as depictions of lust, sadism, cruelty, etc., rather than illustrations of specific instances of those qualities at work, and he ceased to regard painting as a purely aesthetic matter, and thought of it as an ethical necessity. In 1933 Beckmann was dismissed by the Nazis from his professorship at the Städelsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt, and in that year he began <i>Departure</i> (MOMA, New York), the first of a series of nine great <a href=""entry://triptych""><span class=""links"">triptychs</span></a> painted between then and his death in which he expressed his philosophy of life and society, and his horror at man's cruelty. He moved to the Netherlands in 1937 (the year in which his work was included in the infamous Nazi exhibition of <a href=""entry://degenerate art""><span class=""links"">Degenerate Art</span></a>), settling in Amsterdam until 1947. The last three years of his life were spent in the USA, where he taught in Washington and New York. Beckmann's philosophical outlook, which he expressed in <i>My Theory of Painting</i> (a lecture delivered in London in 1937 and published in 1941), is somewhat incoherent, but his work has been hailed as the most authentic comment of German culture on the disorientation of the modern world. Apart from his allegorical figure compositions, Beckmann is best known for his portraits, particularly his self-portraits, in which he charted his spiritual experiences."

<b>Bellini</b>.<div class=""content"">Family of Venetian painters who played a dominant role in the art of their city for three-quarters of a century. Jacopo (<i>c.</i>1400&ndash;70/1) was the father of Gentile and Giovanni and father-in-law of <a href=""entry://Mantegna, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Mantegna </span></a>. He was a pupil of <a href=""entry://Gentile da Fabriano ""><span class=""links"">Gentile da Fabriano </span></a>, with whom he worked in Florence, and he achieved early popularity both in Venice and elsewhere. His most notable paintings have disappeared, however, and it is not easy to form an assessment from those that survive&mdash;mainly fairly simple and traditional representations of the Madonna and Child. Although he has the grace of the late <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a>, there is a certain dryness and stiffness in his figures. Yet he was obviously keenly alert to contemporary ideas and shared the fashionable interests in archaeology, <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a>, and anatomy. His artistic personality is manifested best in his two surviving sketchbooks (Louvre, Paris, and BM, London), containing more than 230 drawings in all, many of them remarkable for bold perspective effects conveying an exhilarating sense of space.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>Gentile</i> (1429?&ndash;1507) inherited his father's sketchbooks and took over as head of his studio, so he was presumably the elder son. He carried on the reputation of his father and was greatly admired in his time, but many of his major works have perished. They included erotic scenes painted for the harem of Sultan Mehmet II, when Gentile worked at the court of Constantinople in 1479&ndash;81; his portrait of Mehmet, however, survives (albeit much restored) in the National Gallery, London. The most famous of his extant works are probably the <i>Procession of the Relic of the True Cross</i> (1496) and the <i>Miracle at Ponte di Lorenzo</i> (1500), two huge canvases crowded with anecdotal detail of contemporary Venetian life. Both are in the Accademia, Venice.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>Giovanni</i> (<i>c.</i>1430?&ndash;1516) was far and away the greatest artist of the family and during his long and prolific career he transformed Venice from an artistically provincial city into a <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> centre rivalling Florence and Rome in importance. He was trained by his father Jacopo, but the major influence on his formative years was that of his brother-in-law, Mantegna. This and Bellini's own originality are made clear by a comparison of their pictures of the <i>Agony in the Garden</i>, both painted about 1460 and both now in the National Gallery, London. The compositions are clearly related, both deriving from a drawing in one of Jacopo's sketchbooks, but there is great difference in treatment, particularly of the landscape. Mantegna's is sharp, precise, and analytical, Bellini's is lyrical and atmospheric. To Mantegna's influence was later added that of <a href=""entry://Antonello da Messina ""><span class=""links"">Antonello da Messina </span></a>, who was in Venice in 1475&ndash;6. Like him, Bellini became one of the great early masters of the <a href=""entry://oil paint""><span class=""links"">oil technique</span></a>, the linear style of his early work mellowing into one of masterly breadth, initiating the characteristically Venetian conception of painting in which colour and light were the primary means of expression. Bellini was remarkably inventive <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">iconographically</span></a> and to the end of his long life he continued to learn from new ideas. From the year before his death dates the dreamy <i>Woman with a Mirror</i> (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), which is strongly influenced by <a href=""entry://Giorgione ""><span class=""links"">Giorgione </span></a>, who predeceased him; it shows that his genius remained undiminished by advancing years, and it is easy to credit the remark made by <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a> on his visit to Venice in 1505&ndash;7 that although Bellini was ‘very old’ he was still ‘the best painter.’ He painted excellent portraits, of which the <i>Doge Leonardo Loredan</i> (NG, London, <i>c.</i>1501) is the best-known example, and a few mythologies and allegories, notably <i>The Feast of the Gods</i> (NG, Washington, 1514, altered after his death by <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a>), but he was above all a religious painter. His most characteristic subject was the Madonna and Child, and only <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> has rivalled his treatment of the theme, which ranges from the wistful melancholy of <i>The Madonna of the Meadow</i> (NG, London, <i>c.</i>1510), one of the most marvellous examples of his ability to bring together figures and landscape in perfect harmony, to the monumentality of the San Zaccaria Altarpiece (S. Zaccaria, Venice, 1505), perhaps the grandest of all <a href=""entry://sacra conversazione""><i><span class=""links"">sacra conversazioni</i></span></a>. His influence on Venetian painting was enormous. He was appointed official painter to the republic in 1483, and from about that time almost all the painters who became eminent in Venice during the next generation (including Giorgione, <a href=""entry://Sebastiano del Piombo ""><span class=""links"">Sebastiano del Piombo </span></a>, and Titian) are either known to or believed to have trained in his workshop."

<b>Bellmer, Hans</b><div class=""content""><i>(1902&ndash;75).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Polish-French graphic artist, painter, sculptor, and writer, all of whose work is explicitly erotic.

In 1933 he constructed an articulated plaster figure of a young girl, inspired partly by an infatuation with his 15-year-old cousin Ursula. He photographed his creation in various attitudes and states of dismemberment (sometimes partly clothed) and published a collection of the photographs as <i>Die Puppe</i> (‘The Doll’) in Karlsruhe in 1934; a French edition, <i>La Poupée</i>, was published in Paris in 1936. Bellmer sent samples of the photographs to André <a href=""entry://Breton, André""><span class=""links"">Breton </span></a> in Paris, and the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealists</span></a> were highly excited by these striking images of ‘vice and enchantment’. In 1938, in danger of arrest by the Nazis, Bellmer fled to Paris to join the Surrealists. He was interned at the beginning of the war (with Max <a href=""entry://Ernst, Max""><span class=""links"">Ernst </span></a>), then lived in the South of France, 1942&ndash;6, before returning to Paris, where he began a long series of drawings and etchings that developed the violent eroticism of his dolls. Bellmer also produced paintings and sculpture in a similar vein. His work includes some of the acknowledged masterpieces of erotic art, but it was not well known until a large retrospective in 1971&ndash;2 at the Centre National d'Art Contemporain, Paris."

In contrast to former biographers, his method was to concentrate on artists selected for their importance and only these received comprehensive treatment. The Preface to the work was a lecture given in 1664 to the Academy of St Luke at Rome, which became the seminal statement of the concept of <a href=""entry://ideal""><span class=""links"">ideal</span></a> art. In the prominence he gave to <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>, Annibale <a href=""entry://Carracci""><span class=""links"">Carracci </span></a>, and Poussin, his rational Platonism, and his acceptance of the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> as the model of excellence, his formulation expressed the ideals of the Roman Academy and proved a decisive influence on French academic theory.

Bellotto left Italy for good in 1747, to spend the rest of his life working at various European courts, notably Dresden and Warsaw, where he died. He called himself Canaletto, and this caused confusion (perhaps deliberate) between his work and his uncle's, particularly in views of Venice. Bellotto's style, however, is distinguished from his uncle's by an almost Dutch interest in massed clouds, cast shadows, and rich foliage. His colouring is also generally more sombre, much of his work being characterized by a steely grey. The best collections of his work are in Dresden (Gemäldegalerie) and Warsaw (National Museum). In the rebuilding of Warsaw after the Second World War his pictures were used as guides, even in the reconstruction of architectural ornament."

Such works rapidly won him a reputation, and in 1909&mdash;aged 27&mdash;he became the youngest person ever elected an associate member of the <a href=""entry://National Academy of Design""><span class=""links"">National Academy of Design</span></a>. He took a highly active part in the art life of his day and was one of the organizers of the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a> in 1913. After this, his work tended to become less concerned with movement, placing more emphasis on formal balance. He was a man of strong social conscience, and his work included scenes of the urban poor&mdash;of which the most famous is the crowded tenement scene <i>Cliff Dwellers</i> (Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1913)&mdash;and a series of paintings and lithographs about First World War atrocities. He did not take up lithography until 1916, but in the nine remaining years of his life he produced almost 200 prints, and he is accorded a high place among modern American print-makers. In the last five years of his life Bellows turned to landscapes and portraits and was considered one of the finest American portraitists of his day. His early death was caused by a ruptured appendix."
"Belvedere Torso","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Belvedere Torso</b>.<div class=""content"">A marble torso of a poweful male figure seated on a rock, now in the Vatican Museums and named after the Belvedere Court in the Vatican in which it was once displayed. It is signed by a Greek sculptor ‘Apollonius, son of Nestor, Athenian’, about whom nothing is known, and there is scholarly dispute as to whether it is an original <a href=""entry://Hellenistic""><span class=""links"">Hellenistic</span></a> work or a Roman copy. (It is sometimes alleged that the signature of Apollonius occurs also on the famous and stylistically similar bronze figure of a seated boxer in the Terme Museum in Rome, but most authorities now consider that this is a mirage.) The date of the discovery of the torso is uncertain, but it is first mentioned in the 1430s. It had become well known by 1500 and had a profound influence on <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> among other <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> artists. From then until the early 19th cent. it was widely regarded as one of the greatest works of art in the world, rivalled in status probably only by the <i><a href=""entry://Apollo Belvedere""><span class=""links"">Apollo Belvedere</i></a></span> and the <i><a href=""entry://Laocoön""><span class=""links"">Laocoön</i></a></span> among ancient sculptures, although its fame was generally more academic than popular.

<a href=""entry://Macdonald-Wright, Stanton""><span class=""links"">Macdonald-Wright</span></a>. After his return to the USA (he settled in New York in 1912) he continued painting in the Synchromist manner for some years, but having failed to win success working in an avant-garde style, he abandoned modernism around 1920 and gained fame as one of the leading exponents of <a href=""entry://Regionalism""><span class=""links"">Regionalism</span></a>. His style became richly coloured and vigorous, with restlessly energetic rhythms and rather flat, sometimes almost cartoonish figures. His work included several murals, notably scenes of American life (1930&ndash;1) at the New School for Social Research in New York. In 1935 he left New York to become director of the City Art Institute and School of Design in Kansas City, Missouri, and he lived in that city for the rest of his life. When Regionalism declined in popularity in the 1940s Benton turned more to depicting scenes from American history, and some of his later work introduced American types into representations of Greek myths or biblical stories. Benton wrote two autobiographies, <i>An Artist in America</i> (1937) and <i>An American in Art</i> (1969). A passage from the second shows how completely he turned his back on the modernism he had espoused in his youth: ‘Modern art became, especially in its American derivations, a simple smearing and pouring of material, good for nothing but to release neurotic tensions.

"Bernini, Gianlorenzo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Bernini, Gianlorenzo</b><div class=""content""><i>(1598&ndash;1680).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian sculptor, architect, painter, and designer, the supreme artist of the Italian <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a>. His father, <i>Pietro</i> (1562&ndash;1629), was a <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> sculptor of some distinction, active in Naples and then from <i>c.</i>1605 in Rome, and Gianlorenzo owed to him not only his early training in the handling of marble but also his introduction to the group of powerful patrons, the <a href=""entry://Borghese Gallery""><span class=""links"">Borghese</span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Barberini""><span class=""links"">Barberini</span></a>, who so promptly fostered his genius. For Cardinal Scipione Borghese he executed a remarkable series of life-size marble sculptures; in their dramatic vigour and movement they made a complete break with the Mannerist tradition, and they showed unprecedented virtuosity in making cold stone seem as supple as living flesh. These are <i>Aeneas, Anchises, and Ascanius</i> (1618&ndash;19), the <i>Rape of Proserpine</i> (1621&ndash;2), <i>David</i> (1623), and <i>Apollo and Daphne</i> (1622&ndash;5), all in the Borghese Gallery in Rome. After the election of Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII (1623) Bernini became the principal artist in the papal court and in Rome. According to <a href=""entry://Baldinucci, Filippo""><span class=""links"">Baldinucci</span></a>, Maffeo had ‘scarcely ascended the sacred throne’ when he summoned Bernini and told him: ‘It is your great fortune to see Cardinal Maffeo Barberini Pope, but our fortune is far greater in that Cavalier Bernini lives during our pontificate.’ In 1629 he was appointed architect to St Peter's, for which his work included the great <a href=""entry://baldachin""><span class=""links"">baldacchino</span></a> over the High Altar (1624&ndash;33), and the huge statue of <i>St Longinus</i> (1629&ndash;38), which stands in a niche in one of the piers of the crossing. However, after Urban's death in 1644 Bernini fell under a cloud. This was partly because of one of his rare failures (a bell-tower he added to the façade of St Peter's was demolished in 1646 because of structural problems), but as much because of the different artistic tastes of the new pope, Innocent X, who favoured Bernini's rival, <a href=""entry://Algardi, Alessandro""><span class=""links"">Algardi </span></a>. During Innocent's papacy Bernini worked mainly for private patrons. The Cornaro Chapel, with the celebrated marble group of the <i>Ecstasy of St Teresa</i>, in Sta Maria della Vittoria dates from this period (1645&ndash;52). It is a comparatively small work, but an excellent example of Bernini's aims and achievement in the fusion of sculpture, architecture, and painting into a magnificent decorative whole. Bernini never lost his position as architect to St Peter's, however, and he did do some work for Innocent X, including the <i>Fountain of the Four Rivers</i> (1648&ndash;51) in the Piazza Navona. This is the most celebrated and spectacular of Bernini's fountains, and with these, his buildings, and his outdoor statuary he has had a greater effect on the face of Rome than any other artist. After Innocent's death in 1655 and the accession of Alexander VII Bernini was restored to full favour and was almost immediately given two major commissions at St Peter's: the decoration of the <i>Cathedra Petri</i> (Throne of St Peter), and the building of the vast colonnade round the piazza in front of the church. The <i>Cathedra Petri</i> (1657&ndash;66), a setting for the wooden chair believed to have been used by St Peter, provides an appropriately spectacular sight to conclude the vista at the east end of the church. Four immense bronze figures of Doctors of the Church support the chair, also encased in bronze, and gilt angels and cherubs float above on stucco clouds; they surround a window bearing an image of the Dove of the Holy Spirit, from which a burst of light seems to emanate. The enclosure of the piazza in front of St Peter's is his greatest achievement as an architect&mdash;a design of the utmost dignity and grandeur, expressing the overwhelming authority of the Church. Bernini himself compared the sweeping colonnades to motherly arms that reach out to ‘embrace Catholics to reinforce their belief’.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1665 Louis XIV invited Bernini to Paris to build the east front of the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a>, but his plans were abandoned in favour of a French design, and the trip&mdash;which he had made unwillingly&mdash;was not a success. He returned to Rome in 1666 and continued to be extremely active into his old age. His late religious works were intensely spiritual, reflecting his own ardent commitment to Catholicism (<i>The Blessed Lodovica Albertoni</i>, S. Francesco a Ripa, Rome, 1671&ndash;4). As an architect his late work included important secular as well as religious buildings, notably the Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi (begun 1664), which had great influence on Baroque palace design throughout Europe, and S. Andrea al Quirinale (1658&ndash;70), a fairly small church but one of his most so-phisticated designs in its use of rich architectural and sculptural decoration to create an appropriate setting for the mysteries of the Catholic faith. In addition to large works of sculpture and architecture, Bernini executed many portrait busts, among the finest of which are those of his mistress Costanza Buonarelli (<i>c.</i>1645), in the Bargello, Florence, and Louis XIV (1665) at Versailles. He was also a brilliant wit, a <a href=""entry://caricature""><span class=""links"">caricaturist</span></a>, and&mdash;for his private pleasure&mdash;a painter of such high quality that his rare surviving works (which include several self-portraits) have sometimes been attributed to <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez </span></a>. Examples of his paintings are in the National Gallery, London, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Bernini also had a passionate interest in the theatre. There are few material remains of his activity in this field, but the diarist John Evelyn saw a remarkable demonstration of his versatility when visiting Rome in 1644: ‘Bernini
gave a public opera wherein he painted the scenes, cut the statues, invented the engines [stage machinery], composed the music, writ the comedy, and built the theatre.’<br class=""nLine"" />Bernini accurately predicted that his reputation would decline after his death. To the <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> taste of the 18th cent. his approach to sculpture was anathema, to <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a> in the 19th cent. it seemed ‘impossible for false taste and base feeling to sink lower’, and to the devotees of the idea of ‘truth to materials’ in the 20th cent. he appeared, in the words of his most distinguished apologist, Rudolf <a href=""entry://Wittkower, Rudolf""><span class=""links"">Wittknower </span></a>, as Antichrist personified’. It is only fairly recently that he has come to enjoy a reputation, comparable with his status in his lifetime, as the greatest sculptor since <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> and one of the giants of Baroque architecture."

<b>Bernward of Hildesheim</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>960&ndash;1022).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> German ecclesiastic and art patron. He was abbot of the Benedictine monastery at Hildesheim in Saxony from 993 until his death, and for the church of St Michael there (begun 1001) he commissioned the famous bronze doors (<i>c.</i>1008&ndash;15) and a great bronze column (<i>c.</i>1018&ndash;20) probably intended to support the paschal candle. They are important not only for being among the outstanding European works of their period, but also for marking the revival of the <a href=""entry://cire-perdue""><i><span class=""links"">cire-perdue</i></span></a> technique of casting, which had virtually disappeared since the time of Charlemagne. A contemporary biographer records that Bernward himself practised metalwork and manuscript <a href=""entry://illuminated manuscripts""><span class=""links"">illumination</span></a>, but no work can be attributed to him.

"Berruguete","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Berruguete </b>.<div class=""content"">The name of two Castilian artists, father and son, who are respectively associated with the beginnings of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> styles in Spain. <i>Pedro</i> (d. 1504) was court painter to Ferdinand and Isabella. He may have been the ‘Pietro Spagnuolo’ employed in 1477 with <a href=""entry://Melozzo da Forlì ""><span class=""links"">Melozzo da Forlì </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Joos van Cleve ""><span class=""links"">Joos van Wassenhove </span></a> on the decoration of the palace library at Urbino. He was working at Toledo from 1483. Ten panels from the Dominican convent at Avila, now in the Prado, demonstrate that his Renaissance style was modified by the Flemish influences then prevailing in Spain. <i>Alonso</i> (<i>c.</i>1488&ndash;1561), sculptor and painter, was the son and probably pupil of Pedro. For some years, between 1504 and 1517, he was in Italy, where he completed Filippino <a href=""entry://Lippi, Filippino""><span class=""links"">Lippi's </span></a>
<i>Coronation of the Virgin</i> (Louvre, Paris). Berruguete was back in Spain by 1518; in that year he was appointed court painter to Charles V, but his career flourished mainly as a sculptor. He worked in Valladolid and Toledo, his finest works including the <a href=""entry://reredos""><span class=""links"">reredos</span></a> of the monastery church of S. Benito, Valladolid, dating from 1526 (Valladolid Mus.), and a set of choir stalls with <a href=""entry://alabaster""><span class=""links"">alabaster</span></a> figures above for the choir of Toledo Cathedral (1539&ndash;43). The emotional intensity and expressive <a href=""entry://contrapposto""><i><span class=""links"">contrapposto</i></span></a> characteristic of his style reflected the influence of <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> (who refers to Berruguete in his letters) and of the <i><a href=""entry://Laocoön""><span class=""links"">Laocoön</i></a></span>, which he had studied in Rome.

<b>Bertoldo di Giovanni </b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1420&ndash;91).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine sculptor.

Marco. Thirdly, he developed a new type of sculpture&mdash;the small-scale bronze, intended, like the <a href=""entry://cabinet painting""><span class=""links"">cabinet picture</span></a>, for the private collector. Bertoldo was responsible for the completion of the two pulpits in S. Lorenzo left unfinished by Donatello at his death. His own most noteworthy work is a bronze <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> of a battle scene in the Bargello, Florence, which inspired Michelangelo's <i>Battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs</i> (Casa Buonarroti, Florence).

"Beuys, Joseph","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

Like Yves <a href=""entry://Klein, Yves""><span class=""links"">Klein </span></a>, he was one of the leading lights in shifting emphasis from what an artist makes to his personality, actions, and opinions, and he succeeded in creating a kind of personal mythology. (As a Luftwaffe pilot he was shot down in the Crimea in 1943 and was looked after by nomadic Tartars who kept him warm with fat and felt&mdash;materials that came to figure prominently in his work. The hat that he habitually wore hid the head injuries he received in the crash.) After the war he studied at the Düsseldorf Academy, 1946&ndash;51, and he became Professor of Sculpture there in 1961. He worked in various media, but is perhaps best known for his performances, of which the most famous was probably <i>How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare</i> (1965). In this he walked around an exhibition in the Schmela Gallery in Düsseldorf, his face covered in honey and gold leaf, carrying in his arms a dead hare, to which he gave an explanation of various pictures. He described the performance as ‘A complex tableau about the problems of language, and about the problems of thought, of human consciousness and of the consciousness of animals.’ In 1962 Beuys became a member of <a href=""entry://Fluxus""><span class=""links"">Fluxus</span></a>, an international group of artists, opposed to tradition and professionalism in the arts, and he was also active in politics, aligning himself with the West German ecology party, the Greens. His ‘presumptuous political dilettantism’ eventually led to conflict with authority and in 1972 he was dismissed from his professorship. The protests that followed included a strike by his students, and a settlement was eventually reached whereby he kept his title and studio but his teaching contract was ended. He devoted a good deal of his later career to public speaking and debate, and in 1982 he had a meeting with the Dalai Lama in Paris. By the end of his life he was an international celebrity and was regarded by his admirers as a kind of art guru."

Bewick ran a busy workshop in which most of the day-to-day jobs involved metal-engraving, but for his own projects he preferred <a href=""entry://wood engraving""><span class=""links"">wood engraving</span></a>, and he was the first artist to show the full potential of this technique. He had a great love of the countryside, and his finest works are natural history illustrations, particularly those to his celebrated books <i>A General History of Quadrupeds</i> (1790) and <i>A History of British Birds</i> (2 vols., 1797 and 1804), for which he wrote the texts himself. The animals and birds are characterized with great skill, but Bewick is as much admired for his tail-pieces&mdash;little (sometimes tiny) vignettes with which he concluded his account of each animal or bird. These miniature scenes give a wonderfully shrewd and sensitive picture of rural life, bringing out its bleakness and cruelty as well as its beauty and humour. Bewick himself punningly called these scenes ‘<i>Tale</i>-pieces’, for they were ‘seldom without an endeavour to illustrate some truth or point some moral’. The success of his books made wood engraving a popular medium for illustration and his work was carried on by several followers in Newcastle, notably his son Robert (1788&ndash;1849). Bewick wrote an autobiography, which was published in an incomplete edition in 1862; the full text did not appear until 1975. A year before his death he was visited by <a href=""entry://Audubon, John James""><span class=""links"">Audubon </span></a>, another great artist-naturalist, who left a touching account of his meeting with this ‘perfect old English-man’, who was ‘kind and attentive’ and still&mdash;at the age of 74&mdash;‘active and prompt in his labours’, using ‘delicate and beautiful tools

In 1938 he retired to Lot and during the war contracted an eye ailment that left him unable to paint. Instead, he produced compositions pieced together from tapestry and other materials. A successful operation in 1948 enabled him to resume painting and during the 1950s he achieved international recognition for his large, tapestry-like compositions in rich and glowing colours. Abstract in appearance, they resulted from the careful and sensitive reduction of natural scenes to scintillating patterns of interacting colours, and Bissière himself always refused to accept the term ‘abstract’ for his own work."

It was run by the teaching staff, with no outside control, and was kept deliberately small (with an average of about 50 students a year) to reduce administration; a variety of arts were taught and interaction between them was encouraged. Mary Emma Harris describes the college as ‘a unique combination of liberal arts school, summer camp, farm school, pioneer village, refugee centre and religious retreat’ and writes that it was ‘a catalyst for the emergence of the American avant-garde after the Second World War’ (Chapter on Black Mountain College in the catalogue of the exhibition ‘American Art in the 20th Century’, Royal Academy, London, 1993).

<b>Blake, Peter</b><div class=""content""><i>(1932&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter, a leading exponent of <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a>. His use of imagery from comics, pin-up magazines, consumer goods, and advertisements captures the flavour of the times in a manner that now evokes nostalgia for the ‘swinging sixties’, as was made clear during his enormously successful retrospective exhibition at the Tate Gallery, London, in 1983 (his most famous work is the cover design for the Beatles LP <i>Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, 1967). The combination of sophistication and naïvety typical of Blake's style is seen particularly clearly in his work as a member of The Brotherhood of Ruralists, a group of seven painters based in the West Country, of which Blake (then living near Bath) was one of the founders in 1975. The members had several group exhibitions, took working holidays together, and shared a commission to design covers for the New Arden edition of Shakespeare's work, but they had common ideals rather than a common style, taking as their inspiration ‘the spirit of the countryside’. A series of winsome fairy paintings are characteristic of this facet of Blake's work, and many critics found the work of the group as a whole insufferably twee&mdash;one newspaper review of a 1981 Ruralists exhibition was headed ‘Tinkerbell lives’. The Brotherhood last exhibited as a group at Blake's retrospective at the Tate in 1983. The other members were: Ann Arnold (1936&ndash; ) and her husband Graham Arnold (1932&ndash; ); the American-born Jann Haworth (1942&ndash; ), who was married to Blake, 1963&ndash;81; David Inshaw (1943&ndash; ); Annie Ovenden (1945&ndash; ) and her husband Graham Ovenden (1943&ndash; )."
"Blake, William","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Blake, William</b><div class=""content""><i>(1757&ndash;1827).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English artist, philosopher, and poet, one of the most remarkable figures of the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> period. From childhood he possessed visionary powers, and the engraving of <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i>, done at the age of 16, shows him already using a personal symbolism to express his mystical philosophy. His apprenticeship (1772&ndash;9) to the engraver James Basire (1730&ndash;1802), for whom he made drawings of the monuments in West-minster Abbey and other London churches, led him to a close study of <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> art and intensified his love of linear design and formal pattern. In 1779 he entered the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> Schools, but his relations with *Reynolds were painful; later he was to find more sympathetic spirits in <a href=""entry://Stothard, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Stothard</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Flaxman, John""><span class=""links"">Flaxman </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Fuseli, Henry""><span class=""links"">Fuseli, </span></a> and *Barry . During the 1780s Blake worked as a commercial engraver, but from about 1787 he became engrossed in a new method of printing his own illustrated poems in colour, which he claimed to have been revealed to him in a vision by his brother Robert, then recently deceased. The first of these major works of ‘illuminated printing’, in which handwritten text and illustration were engraved together to form a decorative unit, was <i>Songs of Innocence</i> (1789). In 1793 with his wife, Catherine Boutcher, he settled in Lambeth, where he engraved his principal prose work. <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>. He had little material success and in 1800, at the suggestion of William Hayley, poet and man of letters, he left London to settle for three years at Felpham on the Sussex coast. Here he continued a series of watercolours illustrating biblical subjects for his first and most generous patron, Thomas Butts, and also began to engrave <i>Jerusalem</i>, the last and longest of his surviving mystical writings. On his return to London, Blake made a series of drawings for Robert Blair's poem The Grave, and in 1809 held a small one-man exhibition for which he issued <i>A Descriptive Catalogue</i>, eloquently summarizing his aims and convictions about art. In 1818 he met John <a href=""entry://Linnell, John""><span class=""links"">Linnell </span></a>, whose sympathetic patron-age ensured him a livelihood for the re-mainder of his life. For Linnell he carried out his engravings for <i>The Book of Job</i> and his magnificent designs for <i>The Divine Comedy</i>, on which he was working up to the time of his death. Linnell introduced to him a group of younger artists, including <a href=""entry://Varley, Frederick""><span class=""links"">Varley </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Calvert, Edward""><span class=""links"">Calvert </span></a>, and Samuel <a href=""entry://Palmer, Erastus Dow""><span class=""links"">Palmer </span></a>, who were inspired and stimulated by Blake's imaginative power. He thus passed his last years surrounded by a group of admiring disciples, who formed themselves into a kind of brother hood called the <a href=""entry://Ancients""><span class=""links"">Ancients</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />In art as in life Blake was an individualist who made a principle of nonconformity. He had a prejudice against painting in oils on canvas and experimented with a variety of techniques in colour printing, illustration, and <a href=""entry://tempera""><span class=""links"">tempera</span></a>. His work as an artist is almost impossible to divorce from the complex philosophy expressed also through his poetry. He believed that the visible world of the senses is an unreal envelope behind which the spiritual reality is concealed and set himself the impossible task of creating a visual symbolism for the expression of his spiritual visions. He refused the easy path of vagueness and misty suggestion, remaining content with nothing less than the maximum of clarity and precision. To most of his contemporaries Blake seemed merely an eccentric, and his genius was not generally recognized until the second half of the 19th cent. (<a href=""entry://Rossetti, Dante Gabriel""><span class=""links"">Rossetti </span></a>&mdash;another painter-poet with mystical leanings&mdash;was an early champion.) His output was enormous; there are important collections in the British Museum, the Tate Gallery, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and several American museums."

As the entire text had to be cut letter by letter on wood blocks, the process was extremely laborious and suitable only for short books in continuous popular demand.

<b>Bloomsbury Group</b>.<div class=""content"">A loosely knit association of writers, artists, and critics which had an important influence on cultural and intellectual life in Britain during the early decades of the 20th cent. The association stemmed from student friendships formed at Cambridge, where many of the group had been ‘Apostles’&mdash;members of a semi-secret intellectual club&mdash;and took its name from the Bloomsbury district of London, where members frequently met at the houses of Clive and Vanessa <a href=""entry://Bell, Clive""><span class=""links"">Bell </span></a> or of Vanessa's sister, the writer Virginia Woolf. There was no formal membership and the group was unified by no common social or aesthetic ideology; the ‘Bloomsberries’ were linked rather by attitudes and interests which have caused them to be represented as an intellectual élite in revolt against the artistic, social, and sexual restrictions of Victorian society. In the visual arts, it was during the 1920s and early 1930s that the influence of Bloomsbury was most effective. The persistent propaganda of Roger <a href=""entry://Fry, Roger""><span class=""links"">Fry </span></a> for <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionists</span></a> converted ridicule and outraged rejection into interest, if not full understanding, heralding the reaction from the anecdotal sentimentalism of 19th-cent. criticism and laying the foundation for a more just appreciation of the aims of contemporary art.

Advocating a complete break with the art of the past, Boccioni was centrally concerned with the two main preoccupations of the Futurists&mdash;the production of emotionally expressive works and the representation of time and movement. He believed that physical objects have a kind of personality and emotional life of their own, revealed by ‘force lines’ with which the object reacts to its environment. These ideas are perhaps best shown in Boccioni's most famous piece of sculpture, <i>Unique Forms of Continuity in Space</i> (casts in Tate, London, MOMA, New York, and elsewhere, 1913), which vividly expresses bodily movement. His theories on sculpture were very forward-looking. He advocated the use of materials such as glass and electric lights and the introduction of electric motors to create movement.

Sometimes works of Body art are executed in private and communicated by means of photographs or films; sometimes the execution of the ‘piece’ is public. Sometimes the demonstration is prechoreographed; sometimes it is extemporaneous. Spectator participation is not usually invited. Several leading exponents of Body art have been concerned with self-inflicted pain or ritualistic acts of endurance. For example, in ‘Seedbed’ (1972) the American Body artist Vito Acconci (1940&ndash; ) spent several hours daily masturbating under a gallery-wide ramp while the sounds of his activity were relayed via loudspeakers to visitors overhead. The philosophy behind such works is obscure."

<b>Bonington, Richard Parkes</b><div class=""content""><i>(1802&ndash;28).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, active mainly in France, where his family moved when he was 15. In 1819 he went to Paris, where he became a pupil of <a href=""entry://Gros, Antoine-Jean""><span class=""links"">Gros </span></a> and formed a friendship with <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a>. He was influenced by the medievalism and orientalism of the French <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantics</span></a> and produced paintings in their manner. However, he established his reputation as a landscapist, particularly with his works exhibited at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> of 1822 and the so-called ‘English’ Salon of 1824, at which his own paintings (which won him a gold medal) and those of <a href=""entry://Constable, John""><span class=""links"">Constable</span></a> were the star attractions. In 1825 he accompanied Delacroix to England and sought out pictures by Constable, whose influence is apparent in his subsequent work, and in 1826 he visited Italy, producing some of his finest work in Venice. Bonington was overloaded with work and his delicate health suffered; he died of consumption in London a month before his 26th birthday. Although his career was so brief, Bonington was highly influential, the freshness and spontaneity of his fluid style in both oil and watercolours attracting many imitators. Delacroix wrote of him: ‘Other artists were perhaps more powerful or more accurate than Bonington, but no one in the modern school, perhaps no earlier artist, possessed the lightness of execution which makes his works, in a certain sense, diamonds, by which the eye is enticed and charmed independently of the subject or of imitative appeal.’ These qualities are particularly apparent in the <i>pochades</i> (oil sketches done rapidly on the spot as records of transitory effects in nature), a fashion which he together with <a href=""entry://Turner, J.

He prospered steadily in his career and his life was quiet and uneventful. Like Vuillard, he is best known for peaceful domestic scenes to which the term <a href=""entry://Intimisme""><span class=""links"">Intimiste</span></a> is applied. Bonnard generally painted on a larger scale than Vuillard, however, and with greater richness and splendour of colour. His favourite model was his wife, and some of his most characteristic pictures are those in which he depicted her in the bath (she had an obsession with personal cleanliness and spent much of her time in the bathroom). His other subjects included flowers and landscapes. He also did numerous self-portraits. The late ones show his desolation after the death of his wife in 1940, but in general his work radiates a sense of warmth and well-being.

Spanish painting, but from about 1870 he turned increasingly to portraiture. His portraits are usually as glum as his religious paintings, but their almost photographic realism won them an appreciative audience and the fortune he earned painting them enabled him to form a superb art collection, particularly of Old Master drawings. He donated it to Bayonne, his native city, where it forms the nucleus of the Musée Bonnat, one of France's finest provincial galleries.

<b>Bosch, Hieronymus</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1450&ndash;1516).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Netherlandish painter, named after the town of 's Hertogenbosch (Bois-le-Duc) in northern Brabant, where he seems to have lived throughout his life. His real name was Jerome van Aken (perhaps indicating family origins in Aachen, Germany). Bosch married well and was successful in his career (although his town was fairly isolated, it was prosperous and culturally stimulating). He was an orthodox Catholic and a prominent member of a local religious brotherhood, but his most characteristic paintings are so bizarre that in the 17th cent. he was reputed to have been a heretic. About forty genuine examples of Bosch's work survive, but none is dated and no accurate chronology can be made. It seems likely, however, that the conventional compositions, such as <i>The Crucifixion</i> (Musées Royaux, Brussels), are early works. The paintings for which he is famous are completely unconventional and are immediately recognizable by the fantastic half-human half-animal creatures, demons, etc. that are interspersed with human figures. The basic themes are sometimes quite simple, but heavily embroidered with subsidiary narratives and symbols. Scenes from the life of Christ or a saint show the innocent central figure besieged by horrific representations of evil and temptation&mdash;<i>The Temptation of St Anthony</i> (Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon) is the most spectacular instance. Other subjects were allegorical representations of biblical texts or proverbs, stressing in morbid vein the greed and folly of human beings and the fearful consequences of their sins. Of these, <i>The Haywain</i> and <i>The Garden of Earthly Delights</i>, both in the Prado, Madrid, are perhaps his best-known paintings.<br class=""nLine"" />Although his father was a painter, the origins of Bosch's style and technique are far from clear. His manner had little in common with those of Jan van <a href=""entry://Eyck, Jan van""><span class=""links"">Eyck </span></a> or Rogier van der <a href=""entry://Weyden, Rogier van der""><span class=""links"">Weyden </span></a>, the two painters who most influenced the development of style in the Low Countries until <i>c.</i>1500. There is, indeed, something strangely modern about Bosch's turbulent and grotesque fantasy and it is no surprise that his appeal to contemporary taste has been strong. But attempts to discover the psychological key to his motivation or to trace the origin of his imagery or find a coherent interpretation of the symbolism remain inconclusive. In his own time his fame stood high and a generation or so after his death his paintings were avidly collected by Philip II of Spain. Through the medium of prints his works reached a wider public and imitators appeared even in his lifetime. But it was not until Pieter <a href=""entry://Bruegel, Pieter""><span class=""links"">Bruegel </span></a> the Elder that another Netherlandish artist appeared with a genius strong enough to extend Bosch's vision rather than simply pastiche it. Apart from the riot of fantasy and that element of the grotesque which caused the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealists</span></a> to claim Bosch as a forerunner, the haunting beauty of his genuine works derives largely from his glowing colour and superb technique, which was much more fluid and painterly than that of most of his contemporaries. Bosch was also an outstanding draughtsman, one of the first to make drawings as independent works."

<b>Boshier, Derek</b><div class=""content""><i>(1937&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter, sculptor, designer, and experimental artist.

His work at this time was much concerned with the manipulative forces of advertising, treating the human figure in the same way as mass-produced goods and making them coalesce. However, his involvement in Pop art was short lived, and from 1966 he worked in sculpture, photography, film, and <a href=""entry://Conceptual art""><span class=""links"">Conceptual art</span></a> before returning to painting in 1979. Throughout the 1980s he taught painting at the University of Texas. Although his career has been fairly low key compared with those of some of his Pop art colleagues from the early 1960s, many critics think that Boshier's work has stood the test of time at least as well as theirs."

<b>Bosschaert, Ambrosius</b><div class=""content""><i>(1573&ndash;1621).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish flower and still-life painter, active mainly in the Netherlands, where he is recorded in Middelburg from 1593 to 1613 and later in the Utrecht Guild in 1616. Although he spent the major part of his life in the Netherlands, Bosschaert's style was basically Flemish&mdash;similar to that of Jan <a href=""entry://Brueghel, Jan""><span class=""links"">Brueghel </span></a>, with whom he ranks in quality and as one of the pioneers of flower painting as an independent genre. His bouquets have a rich variety of flowers from different seasons arranged in a formal way. The degree of finish and exactitude, and the subtlety of the colour, are exceptional. His <i>Vase of Flowers</i> (Mauritshuis, The Hague, <i>c.</i>1620) is one of the most reproduced of all flower pieces. Bosschaert may fairly be said to have initiated the Dutch tradition of flower painting and his style was continued by his three sons, <i>Ambrosius the Younger</i> (1609&ndash;45), <i>Abraham</i> (1613&ndash;43), and <i>Johannes</i> (<i>c.</i>1610&ndash;<i>c.</i>1650), and also by his brother-in-law, Balthasar van der <a href=""entry://Ast, Balthasar van der""><span class=""links"">Ast </span></a>."

"Both, Jan","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Both, Jan</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1618&ndash;52).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter, with Nicolaes <a href=""entry://Berchem, Nicolaes""><span class=""links"">Berchem </span></a> the most celebrated of the Italianate landscape painters. He came from Utrecht, where he studied with <a href=""entry://Bloemaert, Abraham""><span class=""links"">Bloemaert</span></a> before moving to Italy for a period of about four years, <i>c.</i>1637&ndash;41. Although he died young, his output was large, but none of the more than 300 paintings attributed to him can be convincingly dated to his Italian sojourn. His landscapes are typically peopled by peasants driving cattle or travellers gazing on Roman ruins in the light of the evening sun. Such contemporary scenes were an innovation, for <a href=""entry://Claude Gellée ""><span class=""links"">Claude Lorraine </span></a> and the earlier Dutch painters of the Italian countryside had populated it with biblical or mythological figures. They express the yearning of northerners for the light and idyllic life of the south, and proved immensely popular with collectors, not least in England, helping to shape ideas about Italy for two centuries. Jan's brother <i>Andries</i> (<i>c.</i>1612&ndash;41) lived with him in Rome 1639&ndash;41; they are said to have collaborated, but Andries is best known for paintings and drawings of lively peasant scenes that have little in common with Jan's idyllic tone. He was drowned in an accident in Venice."
"Botticelli, Sandro","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Botticelli, Sandro</b>
<i>(Alessandro di Mariano Filipepi )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1444/5&ndash;1510).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter, neglected for centuries but now probably the best-loved painter of the <a href=""entry://quattrocento""><span class=""links"">quattrocento</span></a>. The name ‘Botticelli’, meaning ‘little barrel’, was originally given to an older brother, presumably because he was portly, but it became adopted as the family name. Sandro trained with Filippo <a href=""entry://Lippi, Filippino""><span class=""links"">Lippi </span></a>, who was the most important influence on his style. By temperament he belonged to the current of late 15th-cent. art which reacted against the scientific naturalism of <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a> and his followers and revived certain elements of the <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> style&mdash;a delicate sentiment, sometimes bordering on sentimentality, a feminine grace, and an emphasis on the ornamental and evocative capabilities of line. Almost all Botticelli's life was spent in Florence, his only significant journey from the city being in 1481&ndash;2, when he worked on the decoration of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, where he painted side by side with <a href=""entry://Perugino, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Perugino </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Rosselli, Cosimo""><span class=""links"">Rosselli </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Ghirlandaio, Domenico""><span class=""links"">Ghirlandaio </span></a>. The fact that he was called to Rome for such a prestigious commission shows that he must have had a considerable reputation, and by this time the most characteristic idiosyncrasies of his style had already gained shape in the celebrated poetic allegory known since <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> as the <i>Primavera</i> (Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1478). There is evidence that the patron who commissioned this and two of his other famous mythological paintings (<i>The Birth of Venus</i> and <i>Pallas and the Centaur</i>, both in the Uffizi) was Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici </span></a> (second cousin of Lorenzo the Magnificent), a wealthy Florentine with strong interests in Platonic philosophy. It has been suggested that it was this philosophy that prompted the new idea of large-scale pictures with a secular content; the classical deities represented are not the carefree Olympians of Ovid's tales but the symbolic embodiment of some deep moral or metaphysical truth. Given that the Neo-Platonists regarded Beauty as the visible token of the Divine, there would be no blasphemy in using the same facial type and expression for Venus and for the Holy Virgin. According to Vasari, Botticelli later fell under the sway of Savonarola's sermons, repented of his ‘pagan’ pictures, and gave up painting. The final part of this statement is definitely incorrect and the rest is doubtful, but it is certainly true that Botticelli's later paintings are more obviously ‘serious’&mdash;solemn, intense, sometimes ecstatic&mdash;than his early work. The most telling example is the <i>Mystic Nativity</i> (NG, London, 1500), which bears a cryptic inscription seeming to imply that Botticelli expected the end of the world and the dawn of the millennium.<br class=""nLine"" />Botticelli ran a busy studio (his most important pupil was Filippino <a href=""entry://Lippi, Filippino""><span class=""links"">Lippi </span></a>) and his surviving output is large for a painter of his period. Apart from religious and mythological pictures, he produced some memorable portraits and also some marvellously delicate drawings&mdash;mainly in pen outline&mdash;for a lavish manuscript of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> (now divided between the Staatsbibliothek, Berlin, and the Vatican Library). Although little is known of his life, it seems clear that at the peak of his career he was the most popular painter in Florence. His patrons included some of the city's finest churches and most distinguished families, and several of his paintings (particularly those on the theme of the Virgin and Child) exist in several versions or copies, attesting to the vogue they enjoyed. After <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo's</span></a> return to the city in 1500, however, Botticelli's linear style must have looked archaic and he died in obscurity. His fame was not resurrected until the second half of the 19th cent., when the <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelites</span></a> imitated his wan, elongated types, <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a> sang his praises, and Walter <a href=""entry://Pater, Walter""><span class=""links"">Pater </span></a> dedicated to his art one of his most eloquent essays.

<b>Bouchardon, Edmé</b><div class=""content""><i>(1698&ndash;1762).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French sculptor whose work marks the beginning of the <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> reaction against the <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> style. From 1723 to 1732 he worked in Rome, where he made a marble bust of the antiquarian Philippe Stosch (Staatliche Museen, Berlin, 1727) that is very consciously in the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> manner. Although his style later softened somewhat, notably in the famous <i>Cupid Making a Bow from Hercules' Club</i> (Louvre, Paris, <i>c.</i>1750), it remained too severe for court taste. Bouchardon had many supporters, however, and his contemporary reputation stood high&mdash;indeed he was generally regarded as the greatest French sculptor of his time (subsequent taste has inclined more towards artists with greater warmth, such as <a href=""entry://Falconet, Étienne-Maurice""><span class=""links"">Falconet </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Pigalle, Jean-Baptiste""><span class=""links"">Pigalle </span></a>). His most important work was an equestrian statue of Louis XV, commissioned by the City of Paris in 1748. It was cast in 1758 but not erected until 1763, a year after Bouchardon's death. It stood in the Place Louis XV (later the Place de la Concorde) and was destroyed during the Revolution. Several small copies exist, as well as engravings, showing that it was based on the famous antique statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. Bouchardon's father, <i>Jean-Baptiste</i> (1667&ndash;1742), and his brother, <i>Jacques-Philippe</i> (1711&ndash;53), were also sculptors."

He was for a short time a pupil of François <a href=""entry://Lemoyne, François""><span class=""links"">Lemoyne </span></a> and in his early years was closely connected with <a href=""entry://Watteau, Jean-Antoine""><span class=""links"">Watteau </span></a>, many of whose pictures he engraved. In 1727&ndash;31 he was in Italy, and on his return was soon busy as a versatile fashionable artist. His career was hugely successful and he received many honours, becoming Director of the <a href=""entry://Gobelins""><span class=""links"">Gobelins</span></a> factory in 1755 and Director of the Academy and King's Painter in 1765. He was also the favourite artist of Louis XV's most famous mistress, Mme de Pompadour, to whom he gave lessons and whose portrait he painted several times (Wallace Coll., London; NG, Edinburgh). Boucher mastered every branch of decorative and illustrative painting, from colossal schemes of decoration for the royal châteaux of Versailles, Fontainebleau, Marly, and Bellevue, to designs for fans and slippers. In his typical paintings he turned the traditional mythological themes into wittily indecorous <i>scènes galantes</i>, and he painted female flesh with a delightfully healthy sensuality, notably in the celebrated <i>Reclining Girl</i> (Alte Pinakothek, Munich, 1751), which probably represents Louis XV's mistress Louisa O'Murphy. Towards the end of his career, as French taste changed in the direction of <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a>, Boucher was attacked, notably by <a href=""entry://Diderot, Denis""><span class=""links"">Diderot </span></a>, for his stereotyped colouring and artificiality; he relied on his own repertory of motifs instead of painting from the life and objected to nature on the grounds that it was ‘too green and badly lit’. Certainly his work often shows the effects of superficiality and overproduction, but at its best it has irresistible charm and great brilliance of execution, qualities he passed on to his most important pupil, <a href=""entry://Fragonard, Jean-Honoré""><span class=""links"">Fragonard </span></a>."

Bourdelle's work has been somewhat over shadowed by his association with Rodin (whom he revered), but he was already an accomplished artist when he started working for him and developed an independent style. His energetic, rippling surfaces owe much to Rodin, but his flat rhythmic simplifications of form, recalling <a href=""entry://Romanesque""><span class=""links"">Romanesque</span></a> art, are more personal. He was particularly interested in the relationship of sculpture to architecture, and his reliefs for the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1912) are among his finest works. Bourdelle had many other prestigious public commissions and also achieved great distinction as a teacher. From about 1910 he was generally regarded as the outstanding sculptor in France apart from Rodin himself. He was also a talented painter and draughtsman. His house and studio in Paris have been convented into the Musée Bourdelle; the first part opened in 1961 to mark the centenary of his birth."

It contains numerous exquisite borders of plants and insects, together with fifty-one large scenes&mdash;mainly from the New Testament and lives of the saints, but also including a portrait of Anne at prayer.

His major commissions there were the <i>Last Supper</i> altarpiece for the church of S. Pierre (still <i>in situ</i>, 1464&ndash;7) and two panels (out of a projected set of four) on the <i>Justice of Emperor Otto</i> for the Hôtel de Ville (Musées Royaux, Brussels, 1470&ndash;5). Apart from these, there are no documented works, but his style is highly distinctive and a convincing <i>œuvre</i> has been built up for him.

<b>Boyd, Arthur</b><div class=""content""><i>(1920&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Australian painter, potter, etcher, lithographer, and ceramic artist, a member of a family who have made a name in many of the arts. His father was a sculptor and potter, his mother a painter, but he was largely self-taught as an artist. After holding his first one-man show at the age of 17, his artistic career was interrupted by the Second World War. In the 1950s he became well known in Australia, particularly for his large ceramic totem pole at the entrance to the Olympic Pool, Melbourne (for the 1956 Olympic Games) and for his series (twenty pictures) <i>Love, Marriage and Death of a Half-Caste</i> (1957&ndash;9) concerned with the life and death of an aboriginal stockman and his half-caste bride. They are done in a style combining elements of <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>.

He made a fortune in the 1740s by publishing views of England and Wales, which he engraved from his own drawings. Later he published the work of other engravers and by developing a large foreign trade spread the fame of English artists and engravers on the Continent. In 1790 he was Lord Mayor of London. His most ambitious undertaking was the celebrated Shakespeare Gallery: from 1786 he commissioned from major artists (including <a href=""entry://Fuseli, Henry""><span class=""links"">Fuseli </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Romney, George""><span class=""links"">Romney </span></a>) 162 oil paintings illustrating Shakespeare's plays, exhibiting them in a purpose-built gallery in Pall Mall, opened in 1789. The engravings after them were published as illustrations to a nine-volume edition of Shakespeare in 1802 and separately in 1803. Boydell hoped by this venture to encourage the rise of a ‘great national school of <a href=""entry://history painting""><span class=""links"">history painting</span></a>’, and he intended to leave the collection to the nation, but he had heavy losses during the French wars and it was sold by lottery in 1804 shortly after his death.

<b>Bramante, Donato</b>
<i>(Donato di Angelo )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1444&ndash;1514).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian architect and painter. Bramante was the creator and greatest exponent of the High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> style in architecture, but most of his early career, which is ill-documented, seems to have been devoted to painting. He probably trained in Urbino and is first documented in 1477 working on fresco decorations at the Palazzo del Podestà in Bergamo. In about 1480 he settled in Milan, and in 1481 produced his earliest surviving dated work, the design of an engraving of an elaborate architectural fantasy (the British Museum, London, possesses one of only two known impressions). At about the same time he began his first building, Sta Maria presso S. Satiro, Milan, in which his knowledge of <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a> was used to create an illusion of recession in the choir, which is in reality only a few inches deep. His only certain surviving paintings are poorly preserved frescos of armed men (<i>c.</i>1480&ndash;5) in the Brera, Milan, which also houses the finest painting attributed to him (on the testimony of <a href=""entry://Lomazzo, Giovanni Paolo""><span class=""links"">Lomazzo</span></a>), a sombre and poignant <i>Christ at the Column</i>, which shows some influence from his friend <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>. In 1499 Bramante left Milan for Rome, where in 1506 he began the rebuilding of St Peter's. There is no evidence of any activity as a painter in Rome, but <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> says that Bramante designed the majestic architectural setting of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael's</span></a> fresco <i>The School of Athens</i> in the Vatican Stanze. Certainly Raphael paid tribute to Bramante by introducing his portrait into this painting as the mathematician Euclid. Bramante had an enormous influence as an architect, and his interest in perspective and <a href=""entry://trompe-l'œil""><i><span class=""links"">trompe-l'œil</i></span></a> left a mark on Milanese painting, notably in the work of his follower <a href=""entry://Bramantino ""><span class=""links"">Bramantino</span></a>."

He travelled widely in Italy and France, 1614&ndash;28, and drew on a variety of influences for his most characteristic paintings&mdash;small nocturnal scenes with vivid effects of light. Works such as the <i>Scene of Sorcery</i> (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux) have earned him the reputation of ‘an interesting independent who cannot easily be pigeonholed’ (J. Rosenberg, S. Slive, and E. H. ter Kuile, <i>Dutch Art and Architecture</i>, 1600&ndash;1800, 1966). Bramer was also one of the few Dutch artists to paint frescos in Holland, but none of his work in the medium has survived. He evidently knew well the greatest of his Delft contemporaries, <a href=""entry://Vermeer, Jan""><span class=""links"">Vermeer </span></a>, for he came to the latter's defence when his future mother-in-law was trying to prevent him from marrying her daughter.

<b>Brancusi, Constantin</b><div class=""content""><i>(1876&ndash;1957).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Romanian sculptor, active mainly in Paris, one of the most revered and influential of 20th cent. artists. After studying in Bucharest and afterwards in Vienna and Munich, in 1904 he settled in Paris, where he spent many years of poverty and hardship. In 1906 he was introduced to <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a>, whose offer to take him on as assistant Brancusi refused with the famous comment that ‘No other trees can grow in the shadow of an oak.’ His work of this time was in fact influenced by Rodin's surface animation, but from 1907 Brancusi began creating a distinctive style, based on his feeling that ‘what is real is not the external form but the essence of things.’ From this time his work (in both stone and bronze) consisted largely of variations on a small number of themes (heads, birds, a couple embracing&mdash;<i>The Kiss</i>) in which he simplified shapes and smoothed surfaces into immaculately pure forms that sometimes approach complete abstraction. He was particularly fond of ovoid shapes&mdash;their egg-like character suggesting generation and birth and symbolizing his own creative gifts. (His woodcarvings, on the other hand, are rougher&mdash;closer to the Romanian folk-art tradition and to African sculpture.) His reputation abroad began to grow after five of his sculptures were shown at the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a>, New York, in 1913, and during the 1920s his name became newsworthy when he was involved in two celebrated art scandals. In 1920 his <i>Princess X</i> was removed by police from the <a href=""entry://Salon des Indépendants""><span class=""links"">Salon des Indépendants</span></a> because it had been denounced as indecent (there is a clear resemblance to a phallus); and in 1926 he became involved in a dispute with the US Customs authorities. They attempted to tax his <i>Bird in Space</i> (one of his most abstract works) as raw metal, rather than treat it as sculpture, which was dutyfree. Brancusi was forced to pay up to get the work released for exhibition, but he successfully sued the Customs Office, winning the court decision in 1928. During the 1930s he travelled widely. In 1937 he made sculpture (including the enormous <i>Endless Column</i>, nearly 30m. high) for the public park at Tirgu Jiu near his birthplace and in the same year he visited India to design a Temple of Meditation (never built) for the Maharajah of Indore. By the time of his death he was widely regarded as the greatest sculptor of the 20th cent.<br class=""nLine"" />Brancusi's originality in reducing natural forms to their ultimate&mdash;almost abstract&mdash;simplicity had profound effects on the course of 20th-cent. sculpture. He introduced <a href=""entry://Modigliani, Amedeo""><span class=""links"">Modigliani</span></a> to sculpture, <a href=""entry://Archipenko, Alexander""><span class=""links"">Archipenko</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Epstein, Sir Jacob""><span class=""links"">Epstein</span></a> owed much to him, and <a href=""entry://Gaudier-Brzeska, Henri""><span class=""links"">Gaudier-Brzeska </span></a> was his professed admirer. Later, Carl <a href=""entry://Andre, Carl""><span class=""links"">Andre </span></a> claimed to have been inspired by <i>Endless Column</i>, converting its repeated modules into his horizontal arrangements of identical units. More generally, Henry <a href=""entry://Moore, Henry""><span class=""links"">Moore </span></a> wrote of Brancusi: ‘Since the Gothic, European sculpture had become overgrown with moss, weeds&mdash;all sorts of surface excrescences which completely concealed shape. It has been Brancusi's special mission to get rid of this undergrowth and to make us once more shape-conscious.’ On his death Brancusi bequeathed to the French Government his studio and its contents, which included versions of most of his best works (they often exist in multiple replicas in different materials). The studio has now been reconstructed in the <a href=""entry://Pompidou Centre""><span class=""links"">Pompidou Centre</span></a> in Paris.

He was an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a> in the First World War and was a skilful etcher and lithographer, but he became best known for his murals. His most famous undertaking in this field was a series of 18 panels on the theme of the British Empire, commissioned by the House of Lords. They were begun in 1926 and rejected&mdash;amid great controversy&mdash;in 1930. Offers for the panels came from all over the world, and in 1934 they were installed in the Guildhall in Swansea. During his lifetime Brangwyn had a great reputation on the Continent, and there is a museum devoted to him in Bruges and another almost entirely given over to his work in Orange. He was one of the finest draughtsmen of his time, but his painting tended to the decoratively sentimental."
"Braque, Georges","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Braque, Georges</b><div class=""content""><i>(1882&ndash;1963).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, graphic artist, and designer. Initially he followed his father's trade of house painter, but in 1902&ndash;4 he took lessons at various art schools in Paris, including briefly the École des <a href=""entry://Beaux-Arts, École Nationale Supérieure des""><span class=""links"">Beaux-Arts</span></a>. Through his friendship with his fellow students <a href=""entry://Dufy, Raoul""><span class=""links"">Dufy </span></a> and Friesz, he was drawn into the circle of the <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauves</span></a>, and in 1905&ndash;7 he painted in their brightly coloured, impulsive manner. In 1907, however, two key events completely changed the direction of his work: first, he was immensely impressed by the <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne</span></a> memorial exhibition at the <a href=""entry://Salon d'Automne""><span class=""links"">Salon d'Automne</span></a>; and secondly, he met <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>, in whose studio he saw <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i>. Although he was initially disconcerted by it, he soon began experimenting with the dislocation and fragmentation of form it had introduced, and the two men worked in close association until the outbreak of the First World War, jointly creating <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>. <i>The Portuguese</i> (Kunstmuseum, Basle, 1911) is one of the best-known paintings of this phase of Braque's career, and the first picture to incorporate <a href=""entry://stencil""><span class=""links"">stencilled</span></a> lettering. Braque also took the lead with the <a href=""entry://papier collé""><i><span class=""links"">papier collé</i></span></a> technique of introducing pieces of imitation wood engraving, marbled surfaces, etc., stuck on to the canvas. In 1914 he enlisted in the French Army and was twice decorated for bravery before being seriously wounded in the head in 1915 and demobilized in 1916. After the war his work diverged sharply from that of Picasso. Whereas Picasso went on experimenting restlessly, Braque's painting became a series of sophisticated variations on the heritage of his pre-war years. His style became much less angular, tending towards graceful curves. He used subtle muted colours and sometimes mixed sand with his paint to produce a textured effect. Still life and interiors remained his favourite subject, and many critics regard his <i>Studio</i> series, begun in 1947, as the summit of his achievement. Braque also did much book illustration, designed stage sets and costumes, and did some decorative work. By the end of his career he enjoyed immense prestige and he was given a state funeral&mdash;an occasion that seemed at odds with his life of unassuming dedication to his art."

It was first housed in Montagu House, Bloomsbury, and for nearly 50 years it was necessary to make formal application for admission.

Until 1881 the building also housed the collections now in the Natural History Museum, and one of its greatest attactions was a stuffed giraffe in the entrance hall. The Department of Prints and Drawings was originally part of the Library, but led a separate existence from 1808 onwards.

The origin of his nickname is uncertain, but possibly derived from his having a dark complexion. Bronzino was deeply attached to Pontormo and his style was heavily indebted to his master (in paintings of <i>c.</i>1530 it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the hand of one from the other). However, Bronzino lacked the emotional intensity that was such a characteristic of Pontormo's work, his colouring and brushwork were typically harder, and he excelled as a portraitist rather than a religious painter. He was court painter to Duke Cosimo I <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">de Medici </span></a> for most of his career, and his work influenced the course of European court portraiture for a century. Cold, cultured, and unemotionally analytical, his portraits convey a sense of almost insolent assurance. Bronzino was also a poet, and his most personal portraits are perhaps those of other literary figures (<i>Laura Battiferri</i>, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, <i>c.</i>1560). He was less successful as a religious painter, his lack of real feeling leading to empty, elegant posturing, as in <i>The Martyrdom of S. Lorenzo</i> (S. Lorenzo, Florence, 1569), in which almost every one of the extraordinarily contorted poses can be traced back to <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> or to <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, whom Bronzino idolized. It is the type of work that got Mannerism a bad name. Bronzino's skill with the nude was better deployed in the celebrated <i>Venus, Cupid, Folly, and Time</i> (NG, London), which conveys strong feelings of eroticism under the pretext of a moralizing allegory (one of the subsidiary figures has recently been interpreted as representing the effects of syphilis). His other major works include the design of a series of tapestries on <i>The Story of Joseph</i> for the Palazzo Vecchio. He was a much respected figure who took a prominent part in the activities of the Accademia del Disegno (see <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">ACADEMY</span></a>), of which he was a founder member in 1563. His pupils included Alessandro <a href=""entry://Allori, Alessandro""><span class=""links"">Allori </span></a>, who&mdash;in a curious mirroring of his own early career&mdash;was also his adopted son."

In 1631 he left Holland for Antwerp (where he was for a while detained by the Spaniards as a suspected spy) and evidently spent the rest of his career there.

Brouwer was an important link between the Dutch and Flemish schools and played a major role in popularizing low life <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes in both countries in which he worked. Early sources depict him as a colourful bohemian character and his most typical works represent peasants brawling and drinking.

<b>Bruegel, Pieter</b>
<i>(or Brueghel Pieter)</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1525&ndash;69).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> The greatest Netherlandish painter and draughtsman of the 16th cent. There is little documentary evidence concerning his career, but van <a href=""entry://Mander, Karel van""><span class=""links"">Mander's </span></a> laudatory biography, published in 1604, is a useful source of information, even though it misleadingly projects an image of Bruegel as above all else a comic painter. Far from being the yokel of popular tradition&mdash;‘Peasant Bruegel’&mdash;he seems to have been a man of some culture, as is indicated by his friendship with the great geographer Abraham Ortelius. He joined the Antwerp Guild in 1551, having been the pupil of Pieter <a href=""entry://Coecke van Aelst, Pieter""><span class=""links"">Coecke van Aelst </span></a>, whose daughter Bruegel later married. Between 1551/2 and 1554/5 he made a lengthy visit to Italy, working with <a href=""entry://Clovio, Giulio""><span class=""links"">Clovio</span></a> in Rome and travelling as far south as Sicily. On his journeys through the Alps he made extremely sensitive landscape drawings; the experience of the Alps affected him much more than the example of any art he had seen in Italy. Back in Antwerp he designed a series of landscapes which were engraved and published by Hieronymous <a href=""entry://Cock, Jan Wellens de""><span class=""links"">Cock </span></a>, for whom Bruegel produced many drawings of various subjects, including parables like ‘the Big Fish eat Little Fish’. The engraving after Bruegel's drawing of this subject (published in 1557), bears the inscription ‘Hieronymus Bos Inventor’, an attempt by Cock to cash in on the continued popularity of <a href=""entry://Bosch, Hieronymus""><span class=""links"">Bosch </span></a>, who influenced Bruegel considerably.<br class=""nLine"" />A drawing of Amsterdam dated 1562 probably indicates a visit there before his move to Brussels in 1563; he married there in that year. From this time until his death he concentrated on painting and produced his best-known works. His patrons included Cardinal Granvella, chief counsellor to Margaret of Parma, Philip II's regent in the Netherlands, and the wealthy banker Niclaes Jonghelinck, who in 1565 commissioned the series of <i>The Months</i>, of which five survive today. Three of these (including the celebrated <i>Hunters in the Snow</i>) are in the remarkable collection of fourteen paintings by Bruegel in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, which comprises nearly onethird of his surviving paintings; the other two are in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and the National Gallery, Prague. His style changed during the last six years of his life in Brussels; he abandoned the crowded panoramas of his earlier years, making his figures bigger and bolder, as is seen most notably in his novel treatment of proverbs, a genre that had previously been of minor account (<i>The Blind Leading the Blind</i>, Museo di Capodimonte, Naples, 1568). Bruegel enjoyed a considerable reputation in his lifetime, and his pictorial and spiritual influence, through his original works and the many prints after them, is incalculable in later Flemish painting, whether landscape or <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a>. It is only in the 20th cent., however, that he has come to be recognized also as a profound religious painter and an artist whose human sympathy and understanding have hardly been excelled. Bruegel's two painter sons were infants when he died and so they had no training from him (they were reputedly taught by their grandmother&mdash;the widow of Pieter Coecke &mdash;Mayken Verhulst). Both sons spelled their surname ‘Brueghel’, retaining the letter ‘h’ that their father had dropped in about 1559."

Early in his career he visited Cologne and Italy, bfore settling in Antwerp in 1597. He enjoyed a highly successful and honourable career there, becoming Dean of the Guild, working for the Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella, and making frequent visits to the Brussels court. His specialities were still lifes, especially flower paintings, and landscapes, but he worked in an entirely different spirit from his father, depicting brilliantly coloured, lush woodland scenes, often with mythological figures, in the manner of <a href=""entry://Coninxloo, Gillis van""><span class=""links"">Coninxloo </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Bril, Paul""><span class=""links"">Bril </span></a>.

The name was chosen by Schmidt-Rottluff and indicated their faith in the art of the future, towards which their own work was to serve as a bridge. They were moved by an impulse of revolt and wanted to achieve ‘freedom of life and action against established and older forces’, but their aims remained vague. In practice they created an intense and sometimes angst-ridden version of Expressionism, influenced by van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Munch, Edvard""><span class=""links"">Munch </span></a>, the <a href=""entry://Nabis""><span class=""links"">Nabis</span></a>, and the <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauves</span></a>.

Like the Fauves they were interested in <a href=""entry://primitive""><span class=""links"">primitive</span></a> art, which they saw in the Dresden Ethnological Museum, but the inspiration they derived from it was different; forms were often harshly distorted and colours were used symbolically in a violently clashing manner. There is often harsh vigour, too, in their graphic work, and they played an important part in the revival of <a href=""entry://woodcut""><span class=""links"">woodcut</span></a> as a medium for personal expression. Strong contrasts of black and white, bold cutting, and simplified forms were used to great effect. In 1910 Die Brücke shifted its activities to Berlin where Otto Müller (1874&ndash;1930) joined the group. The members had for a time lived together as a community, but the personal rifts that had been present from the beginning became more intense and led to the dissolution of the group in 1913."

This romanticized view has been highly influential but also much attacked. Burckhardt's other books included <i>Cicerone</i> (1855), a guidebook to Italian art that was a popular handbook for German tourists for many years, and <i>Erinnerungen aus Rubens</i> (Recollections of Rubens), published posthumously in 1898."

<b>Burgkmair, Hans the Elder</b><div class=""content""><i>(1473&ndash;1531).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German painter and designer of woodcuts. After learning his trade under <a href=""entry://Schongauer, Martin""><span class=""links"">Schongauer </span></a> in Colmar, he had settled in his native Augsburg by 1498. Before then he is presumed to have been to Italy, for his paintings, with their warm glow of colour, their decorative classical motifs, and their intricate spatial composition, show how decisively he transformed his late <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> heritage with <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> influence. Indeed, he occupied a place in Augsburg comparable to that of <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a> in Nuremberg in introducing the new style. Like Dürer he contributed to the famous series of woodcuts for the Emperor, the <i>Triumph of Maximilian</i>. He was also employed to illustrate the Emperor's own writings in <i>Teuerdank</i> and <i>Der Weisskunig</i>, moralizing knightly romances. A certain clarity of characterization, which is typical of all his works, not least his incisive portraits, seems to have influenced Hans <a href=""entry://Holbein, Hans""><span class=""links"">Holbein </span></a> the Younger.

"Burne-Jones, Sir Edward Coley","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Burne-Jones, Sir Edward Coley</b><div class=""content""><i>(1833&ndash;98).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, illustrator, and designer. He was destined for the Church, but his interest was turned to art first by William <a href=""entry://Morris, William""><span class=""links"">Morris </span></a>, his fellow divinity student at Oxford, and then by <a href=""entry://Rossetti, Dante Gabriel""><span class=""links"">Rossetti </span></a>, to whom Burne-Jones apprenticed himself in 1856 and who remained the decisive influence on him. Like Rossetti, Burne-Jones painted in a consciously aesthetic style (see <a href=""entry://Aestheticism""><span class=""links"">AESTHETICISM</span></a>), but his taste was more classical and his elongated forms owed much to the example of <a href=""entry://Botticelli, Sandro""><span class=""links"">Botticelli </span></a>. He favoured medieval and mythical subjects and hated such modernists as the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>, describing their subjects as ‘landscape and whores’. His own ideas on painting are summed up as follows: ‘I mean by a picture a beautiful romantic dream, of something that never was, never will be&mdash;in a light better than any that ever shone&mdash;in a land no one can define or remember, only desire&mdash;and the forms divinely beautiful.’ He exhibited little before 1877, but then became quickly famous, with a remarkably wide following abroad. His work had considerable influence on the French <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolists</span></a> and the ethereally beautiful women who people his paintings, like the more sensuous types of Rossetti, had a considerable progeny at the end of the century. Some of Burne-Jones's finest work was done in association with William Morris (he was a founder member of Morris and Co. in 1861), notably as a designer of stained glass and tapestries, and as an illustrator of some of the <a href=""entry://Kelmscott Press""><span class=""links"">Kelmscott Press</span></a> books.

<b>Burra, Edward</b><div class=""content""><i>(1905&ndash;76).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, draughtsman, and stage designer, one of the most delightfully eccentric figures in British art. He suffered chronic ill health continuously from childhood and lived almost all his life in the genteel Sussex seaside town of Rye (he called it an ‘over-blown gifte shoppe’), but he travelled in-domitably and had a tremendous zest for life. His career, in fact, represents a revolt against his respectable middle-class background, for he was fascinated by low-life and seedy subjects, which he experienced at first hand in places such as the streets of Harlem in New York and the dockside cafés of Marseilles. From 1921 to 1925 Burra trained in various art schools, including the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College</span></a> in London. He early formed a distinctive style, depicting squalid subjects with a keen sense of the grotesque and a delight in colourful detail. Usually he worked in watercolour, but on a larger scale than is generally associated with this medium and using layer upon layer of pigment so that&mdash;in reproduction at any rate&mdash;his pictures appear to have the physical substance of oil paintings. Burra's work has been compared with that of George <a href=""entry://Grosz, George""><span class=""links"">Grosz </span></a>, whom he admired, but whereas the satirical spirit of Grosz is linked with bitter castigation of evil and ugliness, Burra concentrated on the picturesque aspects of his subjects, which he depicted with warmth and humour. Particularly well known are his Harlem scenes of 1933&ndash;4, with their flam-boyant streetwise dudes and other shady characters. Burra's style changed little, but about the mid 1930s his imagery underwent a radical change and he became fascinated with the bizarre and fantastic (<i>Dancing Skeletons</i>, Tate, 1934). Many of his recurrent images&mdash;such as the bird-man&mdash;and his manner of juxtaposing incongruous objects acquired overtones of <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>, and although he generally kept aloof from groups he exhibited with the English Surrealists (he was also a member of <a href=""entry://Unit One""><span class=""links"">Unit One</span></a>, organized by his friend Paul <a href=""entry://Nash, Paul""><span class=""links"">Nash </span></a>). The sense of tragedy evoked in him by the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War found expression in occasional religious pictures and during the 1950s and 1960s his interest turned from people to landscape. By this time he had achieved critical and financial success, but he reacted with sardonic humour towards his growing fame."

He made an immense fortune from the family shipping business, which he sold in 1917, and devoted most of his life to collecting. His interests were extremely diverse, but his collection became particularly strong in 19th-cent. French painting. Burrell eventually amassed 8,000 objects, which he presented to the City of Glasgow in 1944, followed by the sum of £450,000 to build a new museum to house them. This was not opened until 1983 in Pollok Country Park, to the south of the city, and in the intervening years the Burrell Collection acquired something of a legendary reputation as a hidden treasure trove; it soon became one of the most popular museums in Britain. Apart from 19th-cent. French painting, it is particularly strong in medieval art. Burrell also gave paintings to the Museum and Art Gallery at Berwick-upon-Tweed; in his later years he lived nearby at Hutton Castle."
"Burri, Alberto","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Burri, Alberto</b><div class=""content""><i>(1915&ndash;95).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, <a href=""entry://collage""><span class=""links"">collagist</span></a>, and designer. Originally a doctor, he was captured while serving with the Italian Army in north Africa and began to paint in 1944 as a prisoner of war in Hereford, Texas. He used whatever materials were to hand, including sacking, and after his return to Italy in 1945 (when he settled in Rome) he frequently used the device of splashing red paint on cloth in a manner that suggested bloodsoaked bandages (<i>Sacking with Red</i>, Tate, London, 1954). His later works featuring materials such as charred wood and rusty metal also reflect the direct experience of the carnage of war he had as an army doctor, even though they are elegantly constructed. Burri won international fame for these works, which were among the first to exploit the evocative force of waste and trash, and looked forward to <a href=""entry://Junk art""><span class=""links"">Junk art</span></a> in America and <a href=""entry://Arte Povera""><i><span class=""links"">Arte Povera</i></span></a> in Italy.

His later works, however, explore the unaffectedly direct use of colour in a more personal way, as in his most famous painting, <i>Dazzle Red</i> (Art Gal. of Ontario, 1965), in which the colour is placed in joyous, broadly brushed bands. Bush worked as a commercial designer for most of his career and did not devote his whole time to painting until 1968, but by the end of his life he had an international reputation."

During her heyday in the 1870s she was one of the most popular and talked-about artists in Britain. Her work appealed to popular patriotic sentiment, but she was also praised by critics such as <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a>, who said she had forced him to admit he had been wrong in believing that ‘no woman could paint’. Lady Butler said ‘I never painted for the glory of war, but to portray its pathos and heroism’ and, although her pictures often have a glossy, Hollywood quality, they are sincerely felt, and she has been praised for trying to show the experience of the common soldier rather than concentrating&mdash;as was then traditional&mdash;on the heroic deeds of officers. Her best-known painting is probably <i>Scotland for Ever!</i>, showing the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo (Leeds City Art Gall., 1881)."
"Butler, Reg","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Butler, Reg</b><div class=""content""><i>(1913&ndash;81).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British sculptor. He was an architect by training (his work included the clocktower of Slough Town Hall, 1936), and architecture remained his main preoccupation until 1950. In 1953 he suddenly came to prominence on being awarded first prize (£4,500) in the International Competition for a monument to <i>The Unknown Political Prisoner</i> (defeating <a href=""entry://Calder, Alexander""><span class=""links"">Calder </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Gabo, Naum""><span class=""links"">Gabo </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Hepworth, Dame Barbara""><span class=""links"">Hepworth </span></a> among other established artists). The competition, financed by an anonymous American sponsor and organized by the <a href=""entry://Institute of Contemporary Arts""><span class=""links"">Institute of Contemporary Arts</span></a>, was intended to promote interest in contemporary sculpture and ‘to commemorate all those unknown men and women who in our times have been deprived of their lives or their liberty in the cause of human freedom’. His design was characterized by harsh, spindly forms, suggesting in his own words ‘an iron cage, a transmuted gallows or guillotine on an outcrop of rock’. The monument was never built (one of the models is in the Tate Gallery), but the competition established Butler's name and he won a high reputation among British sculptors of his generation. He had learned iron-forging when he had worked as a blacksmith during the Second World War (he was a conscientious objector) and his early sculpture is remarkable for the way in which he used his feeling for the material to create sensuous textures. His later work, which was more traditional (and to many critics much less memorable), included some bronze figures of nude girls, realistically painted and with real hair, looking as if they had strayed from the pages of ‘girlie’ magazines. Butler was an articulate writer and radio broadcaster and he vigorously argued the case for modern sculpture. Five lectures he delivered to students at the <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School in 1961 were published in book form the following year as <i>Creative Development</i>. He was a widely read man, who numbered leading intellectuals among his friends, and his liberal sympathies were shown by his donation of works to such causes as the campaign against capital punishment."

"Byzantine art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Byzantine art</b>.<div class=""content"">Art produced in or under the influence of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire; it was founded in AD 330 by the emperor Constantine (the first Christian emperor) and ended in 1453 when his capital Constantinople (originally named Byzantium) was captured by the Turks and under the name of Istanbul became the capital of the Ottoman Empire. The split between the Western and Eastern Empires became permanent in 395, when each adopted a separate ruler, and after the Western Empire was overrun by barbarians in the 5th cent. the Byzantine Empire became the great upholder of Christianity and of the cultural traditions of Greece and Rome. Byzantine territories varied greatly in extent; at one time they covered almost the entire Mediterranean basin, but from the 7th cent. many provinces were lost, first to the Arabs and later to the Turks. However, Byzantine art extended beyond the political or geographical boundaries of the Empire, penetrating, for example, into the Slav countries, and in certain areas&mdash;where the Eastern Orthodox Church flourished&mdash;its tradition continued long after the collapse of the Empire.<br class=""nLine"" />Byzantine art was, above all, a religious art. It was serious, otherworldly, and conservative, and the Byzantine artist did not aspire to freedom of individual interpretation but was the voice of orthodox dogma. The choice of subjects and the attitudes and expressions of figures were determined according to traditional schemes charged with theological meaning. In the domes of churches, for example, Christ was usually shown as ruler of the universe (the Greek term is Pantocrater, meaning ‘all-powerful’). Although Byzantine artists produced panel paintings, frescos, manuscript illuminations, ivories, enamels, textiles, jewellery, and metalwork of high quality, Byzantine art is seen at its finest and most typical in the mosaic decoration of churches. Mosaics were applied to all available surfaces of the interior, the luminous shimmering of the colours and the remote, implacably staring figures creating&mdash;in the finest works&mdash;a truly awe-inspiring effect, raising the art to unprecedented levels of grandeur and expressive power. Figures are flat and arranged frontally, occupying a spiritual dimension rather than a realistic space. Also typical of Byzantine art is the <a href=""entry://icon""><span class=""links"">icon</span></a>, which usually represented the head of Christ, the Virgin and Child, or a particular saint, although there are also much more complex figure groups of subjects such as the Crucifixion. Icons tended to become cult images, and the view that this was idolatrous led to the various outbursts of iconoclasm (‘image-breaking’), particularly in the 8th and 9th cents., when many figurative works were destroyed and artists had to revert to ornamental forms or symbols such as the cross. The austere conventions of Byzantine art were eventually challenged by the less ritualistic, more naturalistic ideals of artists such as <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Duccio di Buoninsegna""><span class=""links"">Duccio </span></a>."

He established his reputation with <i>Pan in the Reeds</i> (Neue Pinakothek, Munich, 1857), the beginning of his preoccupation with the world of nymphs and satyrs, naiads, and tritons, the results of which are sometimes slightly absurd. Later his style became more sombre and charged with mystical feeling, as in his best-known work, <i>The Island of the Dead</i> (Met. Mus., New York, 1880, and four other versions). Such works are considered among the most distinguished <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolist</span></a> paintings produced outside France, and their morbid imagery appealed to the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealists</span></a>.

Because Cadmus works very slowly his output as a painter has been small, but he has been a comparatively prolific draughtsman: ‘drawings are more saleable than paintings’, he writes, ‘they're less expensive.’"

From 1923 to 1926 he studied at the <a href=""entry://Art Students League of New York""><span class=""links"">Art Students League, New York</span></a>, where George <a href=""entry://Luks, George""><span class=""links"">Luks </span></a> and John <a href=""entry://Sloan, John""><span class=""links"">Sloan </span></a> were among the teachers. Calder and his fellow students made a game of rapidly sketching people on the streets and in the subway and Calder was noted for his skill in conveying a sense of movement by a single unbroken line. From this it was but a step to his wire sculptures, the first of which was done in 1925. He also made animated toys in a similar vein. His first exhibition of such works was in New York in 1928. From this point he divided his time between the USA and France and he knew many leading avant-garde artists in France, notably <a href=""entry://Miró, Joan""><span class=""links"">Miró</span></a>, who became his lifelong friend. In 1931 he joined the <a href=""entry://Abstraction-Création""><span class=""links"">Abstraction-Création</span></a> association and in the same year produced his first non-figurative moving construction. They were moved by hand or by motor power and were baptized ‘mobiles’ in 1932 by Marcel <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a>; <a href=""entry://Arp, Jean""><span class=""links"">Arp</span></a> suggested ‘stabiles’ for the non-moving constructions in the same year. It was in 1934 that Calder began to make the unpowered mobiles for which he is most widely known. Constructed usually from pieces of shaped and painted tin suspended on thin wires or cords, these responded by their own weight to the faintest air currents and were designed to take advantage of effects of changing light created by the movements. They were described by Calder as ‘four-dimensional drawings’, and in a letter to Duchamp written in 1932 he spoke of his desire to make ‘moving Mondrians’. Calder was greatly impressed by a visit to <a href=""entry://Mondrian, Piet""><span class=""links"">Mondrian </span></a> in 1930, but his pawky delight in the comic and fantastic, which obtrudes even in his large works, was at the opposite pole from the messianic seriousness of Mondrian. After winning first prize for sculpture at the 1952 Venice <a href=""entry://Biennale""><span class=""links"">Biennale</span></a> Calder received numerous public commissions. Some of his late works are very large: the motorized hanging mobile <i>Red, Black, and Blue</i> (1967) at Dallas airport, for example, is 14m. wide. Calder also worked in a variety of other fields, painting <a href=""entry://gouache""><span class=""links"">gouaches</span></a> and designing, for example, rugs and tapestries."

In addition to being the prime inspiration of the group, Sickert suggested the name. The group lasted only two years, but its name is also used in a broader sense to characterize a distinctive strain in British painting from about 1905 to 1920, and as Wendy Baron, the group's leading historian, has written, ‘If we define Camden Town painting as the objective record of aspects of urban life in a basically Impressionist-derived handling, and recognize it as a distinct movement in British art, then we must accept that the heyday of Camden Town painting was over by the time the Camden Town Group was born.’ Many of Sickert's disciples showed their work at the exhibitions of the <a href=""entry://Allied Artists' Association""><span class=""links"">Allied Artists' Association</span></a>, founded in 1908, and several of them also did so at the <a href=""entry://New English Art Club""><span class=""links"">New English Art Club</span></a>, but for some of them these institutions were not progressive enough, which led to the decision to form the Camden Town Group in 1911.

Their subjects included not only street scenes in Camden Town, but also landscapes, portraits and still lifes.

The Camden Town Group held two exhibitions at the Carfax Gallery, London, in 1911 and a third in 1912. They were financially disastrous, and as the gallery then declined to put on more exhibitions, they merged with a number of smaller groups to form the <a href=""entry://London Group""><span class=""links"">London Group</span></a> in November 1913.

"camera obscura","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>camera obscura</b><div class=""content"">(Latin: ‘dark chamber’). An apparatus which projects the image of an object or scene on to a sheet of paper or ground glass so that the outlines can be traced. It consists of a shuttered box or room with a small hole or lens in one side through which light from a brightly lit scene enters and forms an inverted image on a screen placed opposite the opening. The optical principle is essentially that of the photographic camera. For greater convenience a mirror is usually installed, which reflects the image the right way up on to a suitably placed drawing surface. The principle was known as early as Aristotle, but the first written account of its use for drawing is ascribed to Giambattista della Porta, a physician of Naples. His description in his work on popular science, <i>Magiae Naturalis</i> (1558), did much to make the device widely known, and by the 18th cent. the camera obscura had become a craze. Both amateurs and professionals&mdash;among them <a href=""entry://Canaletto ""><span class=""links"">Canaletto </span></a>&mdash;were using it for topographical painting, and we hear of an apparatus, somewhat like a sedan chair, inside which the artist could sit and draw, at the same time actuating bellows with his feet to improve the ventilation.

<b>Canaletto </b>
<i>(Giovanni Antonio Canal )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1697&ndash;1768).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Venetian painter, the most famous view-painter of the 18th cent. He began his career as a theatrical scene painter (his father's profession), but he turned to topography (see <a href=""entry://veduta""><i><span class=""links"">VEDUTA</i></span></a>) during a visit to Rome in 1719&ndash;20, when he was influenced by the work of Giovanni Paolo <a href=""entry://Panini ""><span class=""links"">Panini</span></a>. By 1723 he was painting picturesque views of Venice, marked by strong contrasts of light and shade and free handling, this phase of his work culminating in the splendid <i>Stone Mason's Yard</i> (NG, London, <i>c.</i>1730). Meanwhile, partly under the influence of Luca <a href=""entry://Carlevaris, Luca""><span class=""links"">Carlevaris </span></a>, and largely in rivalry with him, Canaletto began to turn out views which were more topographically accurate, set in a higher key, and with smoother, more precise handling&mdash;characteristics that mark most of his later work. At the same time he began painting the ceremonial and festival subjects which ultimately formed an important part of his work. His patrons were chiefly English collectors, for whom he sometimes produced series of views in uniform size. Conspicuous among them was Joseph Smith, a merchant, appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744. It was perhaps at his instance that Canaletto enlarged his repertory in the 1740s to include subjects from the Venetian mainland and from Rome (probably based on drawings made during his visit as a young man), and by producing numerous <a href=""entry://capriccio""><i><span class=""links"">capricci</i></span></a>. He also gave increased attention to the graphic arts, making a remarkable series of etchings, and many drawings in pen, and pen and wash, as independent works of art and not as preparation for paintings. Meanwhile, in his painting there was an increase in an already well-established tendency to become stylized and mechanical in handling. He often used the <a href=""entry://camera obscura""><i><span class=""links"">camera obscura</i></span></a> as an aid to composition. In 1746 he went to England, evidently at the suggestion of Jacopo <a href=""entry://Amigoni, Jacopo""><span class=""links"">Amigoni </span></a> (the War of the Austrian Succession drastically curtailed foreign travel, and Canaletto's tourist trade in Venice had dried up). For a time he was very successful, painting views of London and of various country houses. Subsequently, his work became increasingly lifeless and mannered, so much so that rumours were put about, probably by rivals, that he was not in fact the famous Canaletto but an impostor. In 1755 he returned to Venice and continued active for the remainder of his life. Legends of his having amassed a fortune in Venice are disproved by the official inventory of his estate on his death. Before this, Joseph Smith had sold the major part of his paintings to George III, thus bringing into the royal collection an unrivalled group of Canaletto's paintings and drawings. Canaletto was highly influential in Italy and elsewhere. His nephew Bernardo <a href=""entry://Bellotto, Bernardo""><span class=""links"">Bellotto </span></a> took his style to Central Europe and his followers in England included William <a href=""entry://Marlow, William""><span class=""links"">Marlow </span></a> and Samuel <a href=""entry://Scott, Samuel""><span class=""links"">Scott </span></a>."

In 1816 he was created Marchese d'Ischia by the Pope and he retired to Possagno, where he built a studio that is now a museum devoted to him. Canova was immensely influential and was renowned for his generosity to young sculptors. He went out of favour during the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> period, when his work seemed cold and static, but his reputation has greatly revived in the 20th cent.

It shows how Caracciolo, unlike so many of the <a href=""entry://Caravaggisti""><span class=""links"">Caravaggisti</span></a>, looked beyond the obvious trademarks of Caravaggio's style, emulating it in depth of feeling as well as in mastery of dramatic light and shade.

"Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da</b><div class=""content""><i>(1571&ndash;1610).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The most original and influential Italian painter of the 17th cent., named after his native town near Bergamo. He trained in Milan under the undistinguished Simone Peterzano and by 1592 had moved to Rome, the main centre of his activity. Two phases in his career can be distinguished there: an early experimental period (<i>c.</i>1592&ndash;9) and a mature period (1599&ndash;1606) in which he carried out several large commissions. The early works are usually fairly small, with half-length figures, a preponderance of still life, and a frankly homo-erotic character (<i>Young Bacchus</i>, Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1595). Subsequently his figures gained greater plasticity, and he painted in rich deep colours with strongly accentuated shadows (<i>The Supper at Emmaus</i>, NG, London, <i>c.</i>1600). The second Roman period began with a commission (probably gained through his first noteworthy patron, the hedonistic Cardinal Francesco Del Monte ) for the Contarelli Chapel in S. Luigi dei Francesi (<i>Calling of St Matthew</i> and <i>Martyrdom of St. Matthew</i>, 1599&ndash;1600), in which Caravaggio's extraordinary advance in mastery of construction and treatment of dramatic action was achieved only after great effort, as X-rays of the paintings make clear. The altarpiece of <i>St Matthew and the Angel</i> was rejected because it was thought to lack decorum, but it was bought by the Marchese Vincenzo <a href=""entry://Giustiniani""><span class=""links"">Giustiniani </span></a>, one of the most important patrons in Rome, who also paid for the replacement. (The first altarpiece was formerly in Berlin, but was destroyed in the Second World War; the replacement is still <i>in situ</i>. Both were painted in 1602.) Meanwhile Caravaggio had embarked on his second great public commission&mdash;two paintings for the Cerasi Chapel in Sta Maria del Popolo (<i>Crucifixion of St Peter</i> and <i>Conversion of St Paul</i>, 1600&ndash;1), which are astounding in the economy and force of the pictorial vision, seeing the old subjects in completely new ways. The Contarelli Chapel and Cerasi Chapel paintings changed the direction of Caravaggio's work, for thenceforth he devoted himself almost exclusively to large-scale religious pictures, among them the <i>Madonna de' Palafrenieri</i> (Borghese Gal., Rome, 1605) and <i>The Death of the Virgin</i> (Louvre, Paris, 1605&ndash;6). These two pictures were again refused on grounds of decorum or theological incorrectness. Despite this misunderstanding of his work, Caravaggio was not without powerful supporters and his rejected paintings found ready secular buyers.<br class=""nLine"" />Caravaggio's tempestuous character frequently caused scandals and in 1606 he fled Rome after killing a man in a brawl over a wager on a tennis match, spending the last four years of his life wandering from Naples (1606&ndash;7) to Malta (1607&ndash;8) and Sicily (1609), and back to Naples again (1609&ndash;10). He continued to paint large religious compositions in a new style shorn of all inessentials: little colour, thinly applied paint, the crowded drama and movement of the late Roman works replaced by a moving silence and contemplativeness. Remarkable among these is <i>The Beheading of St John the Baptist</i> (Valetta Cathedral, Malta, 1608), a work of the utmost tragic power. Caravaggio was not yet 40 when he died from malarial fever while returning to Rome in hope of a pardon, but his last works have all the ineffable qualities of the late works of an aged genius. In spite of his brief career and his fairly small output he made an enormous impact on painting throughout Europe. He had no pupils, but a legion of followers (the <a href=""entry://Caravaggisti""><span class=""links"">Caravaggisti</span></a>), and his work, together with that of the <a href=""entry://Carracci""><span class=""links"">Carracci</span></a>, revived Italian painting from the nebulous unreality of late 16th-cent. <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> art.<br class=""nLine"" />Caravaggio continued to be a famous name throughout the 17th cent., but he was regarded by many as an ‘evil genius’ (in the words of Vincenzo <a href=""entry://Carducho, Vincente""><span class=""links"">Carducho </span></a>, writing in 1633), whose influence on other artists was pernicious. Interest in him declined in the 18th cent. (he is not mentioned in <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds's</span></a>
<i>Discourses</i>), but revived in the mid 19th cent. By this time his rejection of ideal beauty could be seen to have the advantage of truth, although there were still those, like <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a>, who saw in him ‘perpetual seeking for and feeding upon horror and ugliness, and filthiness of sin’. Serious historical research on him began in the early years of the 20th cent., since when he has attracted an enormous amount of critical commentary and speculation, so much so that Ellis <a href=""entry://Waterhouse, Sir Ellis""><span class=""links"">Waterhouse </span></a> has written that ‘the innocent reader of art-historical literature could be forgiven for supposing that his place in the history of civilization lies somewhere in importance between Aristotle and Lenin.’"
"Caravaggisti","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Caravaggisti</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to painters who imitated the style of <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio</span></a> in the early 17th cent. Caravaggio's methods. particularly his dramatic use of <a href=""entry://chiaroscuro""><i><span class=""links"">chiaroscuro</i></span></a>, had extraordinary influence in Rome in the first decade of the 17th cent., on both Italian painters and artists from other countries, who flocked to what was then the artistic capital of Europe. His fame was already widespread by 1604, when Karel van <a href=""entry://Mander, Karel van""><span class=""links"">Mander </span></a>, in Haarlem, wrote of ‘Michelangelo da Caravaggio, who is doing extraordinary things in Rome’. The most prominent of the Italian Caravaggisti included Orazio <a href=""entry://Gentileschi, Orazio""><span class=""links"">Gentileschi </span></a>, one of the few followers to have close personal contact with the master, and Bartolommeo <a href=""entry://Manfredi, Bartolommeo""><span class=""links"">Manfredi </span></a>, who popularized tavern and guard room scenes, subjects that Caravaggio himself had not painted. In Naples, where Caravaggio worked intermittently between 1606 and 1610, <a href=""entry://Caracciolo, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Caracciolo </span></a>, Artemisia <a href=""entry://Gentileschi, Orazio""><span class=""links"">Gentileschi </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Ribera, José""><span class=""links"">Ribera </span></a>, a Spaniard by birth, ensured that the style took firm root. In Rome, Caravaggism went out of favour in the 1620s, but it persisted elsewhere in Italy, and in other parts of Europe, particularly in Sicily (which Caravaggio visited), Utrecht, and Lorraine, lingering into the 1650s in all three places. <a href=""entry://Baburen, Dirck van""><span class=""links"">Baburen</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Honthorst, Gerrit van""><span class=""links"">Honthorst</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Terbrugghen, Hendrick""><span class=""links"">Terbrugghen</span></a> were the three most important artists in making Utrecht the Dutch centre of Caravaggism, and in Lorraine Georges de <a href=""entry://La Tour, Georges de""><span class=""links"">La Tour </span></a> perfected perhaps the most personal and poetic interpretation of the style. Few major painters worked in a Caravaggesque style throughout their careers; some, such as Guido <a href=""entry://Reni, Guido""><span class=""links"">Reni </span></a>, had a brief flirtation with it, while others, such as Honthorst (who became a court portraitist), had a complete change of direction. Echoes of the Caravaggesque style can be found in the work of some of the giants of 17th-cent. art: <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez </span></a>."

In a sense this was an attack on <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez </span></a>, who had completely eclipsed Carducho at court.

<b>Caro, Sir Anthony</b><div class=""content""><i>(1924&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British sculptor, one of the most influential figures in post-war British art. After training as an engineer at Cambridge University and serving in the navy in the Second World War, he studied sculpture in London, then from 1951 to 1953 worked as part-time assistant to Henry <a href=""entry://Moore, Henry""><span class=""links"">Moore </span></a>. His early works were figures modelled in clay, but a radical change of direction came after he visited the USA and met David <a href=""entry://Smith, David""><span class=""links"">Smith </span></a> in 1959. In the following year he began making abstract metal sculpture, using standard industrial parts such as steel plates and lengths of aluminium tubing together with pieces of scrap, which he welded and bolted together and then generally painted a single rich colour. The colour helped to unify the various shapes and textures and often set the mood for the piece, as with the bright and optimistic red of <i>Early One Morning</i> (Tate Gallery, London, 1962). This, like many of Caro's sculptures, is large in scale and open and extended in composition; it rests directly on the ground, and Caro has been one of the leading figures in challenging the ‘pedestal’ tradition. Caro taught part-time at St Martin's School of Art in London 1953&ndash;79, and he had a major influence on several of the young sculptors who trained under him, initiating a new school of British abstract sculpture (see <a href=""entry://New Generation""><span class=""links"">NEW GENERATION</span></a>). In the 1970s his work became much more massive and rougher in texture, sometimes incorporating huge chunks of metal. In the 1980s he returned to more traditional materials and techniques and began making figurative (or semi-abstract) works in bronze, including (in the early 1990s) a series inspired by the Trojan War. His reputation is high in the USA as well as Britain, but he is not without detractors; the critic Peter Fuller described the work with which he became famous as ‘nothing if not of its time: it reflected the superficial, synthetic, urban, commercial American values which dominated the 1960s’."
"Carolingian art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Carolingian art</b>.<div class=""content"">The art and architecture of the reign of Charlemagne (800&ndash;814), the first Holy Roman Emperor, and of his successors until about 900. Charlemagne's reign was noteworthy for reforms in many fields; his guiding principle was a renewal of the values of the Roman Empire, and this was felt in the arts no less than in administrative, judicial, and religious matters. His capital was at Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle), which became the centre of a cultural revival following a bleak period for the arts in the Franco-German lands that formed the heart of his vast empire. Charlemagne recognized the value of the arts for the education of his subjects and was himself the principal initiator of the cultural revival. Little survives of Carolingian mural paintings or mosaics, but several manuscripts contemporary with Charlemagne are known, showing a classical, naturalistic figure style, but also at times a vivid expressiveness. There was no large-scale sculpture, but Carolingian ivory sculpture and metal-work (on book covers, for example) often reached a high level.

His few surviving works include historical and allegorical subjects in the manner of court ceremonies, scenes of magic and prediction, and massacres, as in <i>Massacres under the Triumvirate</i> (1566) in the Louvre, his only signed and dated painting. His style is characterized most obviously by extremely elongated, precious-looking figures set in open spaces that seem too large for them.

This is especially apparent in the first of the two great cycles of paintings that are his chief claim to fame&mdash;the <i>Scenes from the Life of St Ursula</i>, executed in the 1490s and now in the Accademia, Venice. Carpaccio's distinguishing characteristics&mdash;his taste for anecdote, and his eye for the crowded detail of the Venetian scene&mdash;found their happiest expression in these paintings, one of which, the <i>Miracle of the Cross</i>, looks forward to the 18th-cent. compositions of <a href=""entry://Canaletto ""><span class=""links"">Canaletto </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Guardi, Francesco""><span class=""links"">Guardi </span></a>.

His <i>Ugolino</i> (Musée d'Orsay, Paris, 1860&ndash;2) earned him the acclaim of the French colony in Rome, and upon his return to Paris in 1862 he won favour with the court, receiving many commissions for portrait busts. He also made several large sculpture groups, of which the most famous is <i>La Danse</i> (1869) for the façade of the Paris Opéra (the original is now in the Musée d'Orsay). This uninhibitedly dynamic work caused a sensation, was denounced as immoral, and had ink thrown over it. Partially because of such attacks on his work, he suffered from a persecution complex in his final years before his early death from cancer. Carpeaux was the outstanding French sculptor of his period and an influential figure.

In the early 1580s they opened a private teaching <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">academy</span></a>, which soon became a centre for progressive art. It was originally called the Accademia dei Desiderosi (‘Desiderosi’ meaning ‘desirous of fame and learning’), but later changed its name to Accademia degli Incamminati (Academy of the Progressives). In their teaching they laid special emphasis on drawing from the life (all three were outstanding graphic artists) and clear draughtsmanship became a quality particularly associated with artists of the Bolognese School, notably <a href=""entry://Domenichino ""><span class=""links"">Domenichino </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Reni, Guido""><span class=""links"">Reni </span></a>, two of the leading members of the following generation who trained with the Carracci.<br class=""nLine"" />They continued working in close relationship until 1595, when Annibale, who was by far the greatest artist of the family, was called to Rome by Cardinal Odoardo <a href=""entry://Farnese""><span class=""links"">Farnese </span></a> to carry out his masterpiece, the decoration of the Farnese Gallery in the cardinal's family palace. He first decorated a small room called the Camerino with stories of Hercules, and in 1597 undertook the ceiling of the larger gallery, where the theme was <i>The Loves of the Gods</i>, or, as <a href=""entry://Bellori, Giovanni Pietro""><span class=""links"">Bellori</span></a> described it, ‘human love governed by celestial love’. Although the ceiling is rich in the interplay of various illusionistic elements, it retains fundamentally the self-contained and unambiguous character of High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> decoration, drawing inspiration from <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo's</span></a> Sistine Ceiling and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael's</span></a> frescos in the Vatican Loggie and the Farnesina. The full untrammelled stream of <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> illusionism was still to come in the work of <a href=""entry://Cortona, Pietro da""><span class=""links"">Cortona</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Lanfranco, Giovanni""><span class=""links"">Lanfranco</span></a>, but Annibale's decoration was one of the foundations of their style. Throughout the 17th and 18th cents. the Farnese Ceiling was ranked alongside the Sistine Ceiling and Raphael's frescos in the Vatican Stanze as one of the supreme masterpieces of painting. It was enormously influential not only as a pattern book of heroic figure design, but also as a model of technical procedure; Annibale made hundreds of drawings for the ceiling, and until the age of <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a> such elaborate preparatory work became accepted as a fundamental part of composing any ambitious history painting. In this sense, Annibale exercised a more profound influence than his great contemporary <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio</span></a>, for the latter never worked in fresco, which was still regarded as the greatest test of a painter's ability and the most suitable vehicle for painting in the <a href=""entry://Grand Manner""><span class=""links"">Grand Manner</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />Annibale's other works in Rome also had great significance in the history of painting. Pictures such as <i>Domine, Quo Vadis</i>? (NG, London, <i>c.</i>1602) reveal a striking economy in figure composition and a force and precision of gesture that had a profound influence on <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a> and through him on the whole language of gesture in painting. He developed landscape painting along similar lines, and is regarded as the father of <a href=""entry://ideal""><span class=""links"">ideal</span></a> landscape, in which he was followed by Domenichino (his favourite pupil), <a href=""entry://Claude Gellée ""><span class=""links"">Claude</span></a>, and Poussin. <i>The Flight into Egypt</i> (Doria Gal., Rome, <i>c.</i>1604) is Annibale's masterpiece in this genre. In his last years Annibale was overcome by melancholia and gave up painting almost entirely after 1606. When he died he was buried according to his wishes near Raphael in the Pantheon. It is a measure of his achievement that artists as great and diverse as <a href=""entry://Bernini, Gianlorenzo""><span class=""links"">Bernini </span></a>, Poussin, and <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a> found so much to admire and praise in his work. Annibale's art also had a less formal side that comes out in his <a href=""entry://caricature""><span class=""links"">caricatures</span></a> (he is generally credited with inventing the form) and in his early <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> paintings, which are remarkable for their lively observation and free handling (<i>The Butcher's Shop</i>, Christ Church, Oxford).<br class=""nLine"" />Agostino assisted Annibale in the Farnese Gallery from 1597 to 1600, but he was important mainly as a teacher and engraver. His systematic anatomical studies were engraved after his death and were used for nearly two centuries as teaching aids. He spent the last two years in Parma, where he did his own ‘Farnese Ceiling’, decorating a ceiling in the Palazzo del Giardino with mythological scenes for Duke Ranuccio Farnese. It shows a meticulous but somewhat spiritless version of his brother's lively <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classicism</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />Ludovico left Bologna only for brief periods and directed the Carracci academy by himself after his cousins had gone to Rome. His work is uneven and highly personal. Painterly and expressive considerations always outweigh those of stability and calm classicism in his work, and at its best there is a passionate and poetic quality indicative of his preference for <a href=""entry://Tintoretto ""><span class=""links"">Tintoretto</span></a> and Jacopo <a href=""entry://Bassano, Jacopo""><span class=""links"">Bassano </span></a>. His most fruitful period was 1585&ndash;95, but near the end of his career he still produced remarkable paintings of an almost <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionist</span></a> force, such as the <i>Christ Crucified above Figures in Limbo</i> (Sta Francesca Romana, Ferrara, 1614).<br class=""nLine"" />The Carracci fell from grace in the 19th cent. along with all the other Bolognese painters, who were one of <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin's </span></a> pet hates and whom he considered (1847) had ‘no single virtue, no colour, no drawing, no character, no history, no thought’. They were saddled with the label <a href=""entry://eclectic""><span class=""links"">‘eclectic’</span></a> and thought to be ponderous and lacking in originality. Their full rehabilitation had to wait until the second half of the 20th cent. (the great Carracci exhibition held in Bologna in 1956 was a notable event), but Annibale has now regained his place as one of the giants of Italian painting.<br class=""nLine"" />Agostino's illegitimate son <i>Antonio</i> (1589?&ndash;1618) was the only offspring of the three Carracci. He had a considerable reputation as an artist in his day, but after his early death was virtually forgotten, and it is only recently that his work has been reconsidered."

It is now hard to appreciate why her work, which is highly accomplished but generally rather insipid, should have aroused such enthusiasm.

He joined the Futurists in 1909, and visits to Paris in 1911 and 1912 introduced a <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a> influence into his work. In his best-known painting <i>The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli</i> (MOMA, New York, 1911), for example, he combined the dynamism typical of Futurism with a sense of Cubist structural severity. In 1915 he met Giorgio de <a href=""entry://Chirico, Giorgio de""><span class=""links"">Chirico </span></a> and turned to Metaphysical painting, producing about twenty works with de Chirico's paraphernalia of posturing mannequins, half-open doors, mysteriously significant interiors, etc., though generally without his typically sinister feeling.

Cartoons were an essential part of the process of making stained glass, and it was perhaps from this art that painters borrowed the idea; they were used in painting certainly by the early 15th cent.

In 1308 Cavallini was in Naples serving the Angevin kings, and was probably responsible for the design and possibly some of the execution of a fresco cycle in Sta Maria Donnaregina.

His autobiography, written in a racy vernacular, has been famous since the 18th cent. (it was first published in 1728) for its vivid picture of a <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> craftsman proud of his skill and independence, boastful of his feats in art, love, and war, quarrelsome, superstitious, and devoted to the great tradition embodied in <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>. It has given him a wider reputation than could have come from his artistic work alone; but to modern eyes he also appears as one of the most important <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> sculptors, and his statue <i>Perseus</i> is one of the glories of Florentine art. His life can be roughly divided into three periods. From the first, spent mainly in Rome, nothing survives but some coins and medals and the impressions of two large seals. During the second (1540&ndash;5), which he spent in the service of Francis I of France (see <a href=""entry://Fontainebleau, School of""><span class=""links"">FONTAINEBLEAU, SCHOOL OF</span></a>), he created the famous salt-cellar of gold enriched with enamel (Kunsthistorisches Mus., Vienna), the most important piece of goldsmith's work that has survived from the Italian Renaissance. He also made for the king a large bronze <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a>, the <i>Nymph of Fontainebleau</i> (Louvre, Paris). The remainder of Cellini's life was passed in Florence in the service of Cosimo I de' <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici </span></a>, and it was only in this period that he took up large-scale sculpture in the round. The bronze <i>Perseus</i> (Loggia dei Lanzi, Florence, 1545&ndash;54) is reckoned his masterpiece. His other sculptures include the <i>Apollo and Hyacinth</i> and the <i>Narcissus</i> (both in the Bargello, Florence) and the <i>Crucifix</i> (Escorial, near Madrid), all in marble. His two portrait busts, <i>Bindo Altoviti</i> (Gardner Mus., Boston), and <i>Cosimo</i> I (Bargello), are in bronze. Their somewhat dry, niggly quality shows that the exquisite precision of handling of his goldsmith's work did not always transfer easily to a larger scale. Because of his fame, many pieces of metalwork have been attributed to him, but rarely on secure grounds."

"Chagall, Marc","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Chagall, Marc</b><div class=""content""><i>(1887&ndash;1985).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Russian-born painter and designer, active mainly in France.

After going to Berlin in 1914 for his first one-man show (at the <a href=""entry://Sturm, Der""><span class=""links"">Sturm</span></a> gallery) he visited Russia and had to remain because of the outbreak of war. After the Revolution in 1917 he was appointed Fine Arts Commissar for his home province of Vitebsk, where he founded and directed an art academy. <a href=""entry://Malevich, Kasimir""><span class=""links"">Malevich </span></a> was among the other teachers there, and after disagreements with him Chagall moved to Moscow in 1920 and there designed for the newly founded Jewish Theatre. He returned to Paris in 1923 at the invitation of Ambroise <a href=""entry://Vollard, Ambroise""><span class=""links"">Vollard </span></a>, who commissioned much work from him, including illustrations for Gogol's <i>Dead Souls</i> (1923) and other books. In 1941 he moved from occupied France to the USA, where he lived for the next seven years. He returned to Paris in 1948 and from 1950 lived at St-Paul-de-Vence near Nice, working to the end of his very long life&mdash;the last survivor of the generation of artists who had revolutionized painting in the years leading up to the First World War.<br class=""nLine"" />Chagall was prolific as a painter and also as a book illustrator and designer of stained glass (in which he did some of his most impressive late work) and of sets and costumes for the theatre and ballet. His work was dominated by two rich sources of imagery: memories of the Jewish life and folklore of his early years in Russia; and the Bible (he was born into a deeply religious family). He derived some of his spatial dislocations and prismatic colour effects from <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Orphism""><span class=""links"">Orphism</span></a>, but he created a highly distinctive style, remarkable for its sense of fairy-tale fantasy.

There is a museum devoted to Chagall's religious art in Nice. The work there does not always show him at his best, for he could be sentimental and overblown, but his finest paintings have won him an enduring reputation as one of the greatest masters of the School of <a href=""entry://Paris, School of""><span class=""links"">Paris</span></a>."
"chalk","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>chalk</b>.<div class=""content"">Drawing material made from various soft stones or earths. There are three main types; black chalk (made from stones such as carbonaceous shale); red chalk, also called sanguine (made from red ochre or other red earths); and white chalk (made from various limestones). Chalk drawings are known from prehistoric times, but the medium really came into its own in the late 15th cent., notably in the hands of <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, who made many drawings in red and black chalk. The terms ‘chalk’, ‘crayon’, and <a href=""entry://pastel""><span class=""links"">‘pastel’</span></a> are not always clearly distinguished from one another. Crayons, as the term is now generally understood, are sticks of colour made with an oily or waxy binding substance, and pastels are sticks of powdered pigment bound with gum. In other words, they are both manufactured products, whereas chalk needs only to be cut to a suitable shape and size to be usable."
"Chamberlain, John","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Chamberlain, John</b><div class=""content""><i>(1927&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American sculptor. His early sculpture, made largely from metal pipes, was influenced by that of David <a href=""entry://Smith, David""><span class=""links"">Smith </span></a>, but in 1957 he began introducing scrap metal parts from cars in his work and from 1959 he concentrated on sculpture made entirely from crushed automobile parts welded together. Usually he retains the original colours, and the expressive energy of his work, with its twisted planes and crumpled surfaces, has been compared to that <a href=""entry://Action painting""><span class=""links"">Action painting</span></a>. Many of his compositions are intended for wall hanging rather than to stand on the ground. An example is <i>Dolores James</i> (Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1962). Although he has continued with work of this type, which has been widely acclaimed since the early 1960s, Chamberlain has also experimented with other types of sculpture and other media. In 1966, for example, he started using urethane foam, as in <i>Koko-Nor II</i> (Tate Gallery, London, 1967). He has also done abstract paintings and made experimental films."
"Champaigne, Philippe de","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Champaigne, Philippe de</b><div class=""content""><i>(1602&ndash;74).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish-born painter who came to Paris with his master Jacques Fouquières (<i>c.</i>1580/90&ndash;1659) in 1621 and took French citizenship in 1629. He became the outstanding French portraitist of the 17th cent. and was patronized by Louis XIII, the Queen Mother (Marie de <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Médicis </span></a>), and Cardinal Richelieu . Two of his finest portraits of Richelieu (late 1630s) are in the National Gallery, London; they bring the personality of the cardinal vividly to life and show how Champaigne moderated the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> idiom of <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a> towards a classical simplicity in line with French artistic trends of the middle of the 17th cent. He was a friend of <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>, and Anthony <a href=""entry://Blunt, Anthony""><span class=""links"">Blunt </span></a> has written that ‘His portraits and his later religious works are as true a reflection of the rationalism of French thought as the classical compositions of Poussin in the 1640s.’ His style became even more severe after he was influenced by the Jansenists&mdash;a Catholic sect of great austerity&mdash;in the early 1640s. Some of his finest work was done for the Jansenist convent at Port-Royal, where his daughter became a nun: he commemorated her miraculous recovery from paralysis in his most celebrated work, the <a href=""entry://ex-voto""><i><span class=""links"">Ex-Voto</i></span></a> de 1662 (Louvre, Paris). His masterpiece in portraiture might well have been his self-portrait of 1668, which is lost, but survives in a copy by his nephew <i>Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne </i> (1631&ndash;81) in the Louvre and in a superb engraving (1676) by Gerard <a href=""entry://Edelinck, Gerard""><span class=""links"">Edelinck </span></a>."

<b>Chantrey, Sir Francis</b><div class=""content""><i>(1781&ndash;1841).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English sculptor. The son of a carpenter, he was apprenticed to a wood carver in Sheffield but left to come to London, <i>c.</i>1802, to study at the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> Schools. Until about 1804 his work included painted portraits, but after that date he confined himself to sculpture. His portrait bust of the Revd J. Horne-Took, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1811 (Fitzwilliam, Cambridge), brought him fame, and he succeeded <a href=""entry://Nollekens, Joseph""><span class=""links"">Nollekens</span></a> as the most successful sculptor of portrait busts in England. Once he was well established, Chantrey, like Nollekens, did little of the cutting of the marble himself. His enormous practice included statues and church monuments as well as busts; his monument to the Robinson children (1817) in Lichfield Cathedral and his bronze equestrian statue of George IV (1828) in Trafalgar Square are his best-known works in these fields. He became extremely wealthy, and besides being very generous during his life he left the bulk of his fortune of £150,000 to the Royal Academy, the interest to be used for the purchase of ‘works of Fine Art of the highest merit executed within the shores of Great Britain’. These are now housed in the <a href=""entry://Tate Gallery""><span class=""links"">Tate Gallery</span></a>."

He was the contemporary of <a href=""entry://Boucher, François""><span class=""links"">Boucher</span></a> and he taught <a href=""entry://Fragonard, Jean-Honoré""><span class=""links"">Fragonard</span></a>, but his work is a contrast to theirs in every way, representing the naturalistic tendency which persisted through the 18th cent. alongside the more fashionable <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a>. He was received into the Académie in 1728 on the strength of a still life (<i>The Rayfish</i>, Louvre, Paris), which drew forth the extravagant praises of <a href=""entry://Diderot, Denis""><span class=""links"">Diderot</span></a> for its realism, and he was Treasurer of the Académie for twenty years. His small canvases depicting modest scenes and objects from the everyday life of the middle classes to which he belonged were in the tradition of the Dutch <a href=""entry://cabinet painting""><span class=""links"">cabinet pictures</span></a>, which were having a great commercial success in France at the time. Chardin, however, developed a technique of his own, achieving great richness of tone by successive applications of the loaded brush and a subtle use of <a href=""entry://scumbling""><span class=""links"">scumbled</span></a> colour. He was praised for his verisimilitude of detail, but his work goes far beyond matter-of-fact realism and through its simplicity and directness of vision achieves a sense of deep seriousness, in spite of the humble objects he portrayed (<i>Pipe and Jug</i>, Louvre). His genre paintings, which usually contain only one or two figures, are likewise completely without sentimentality or affectation (<i>The Young Governess</i>, versions in the National Galleries of London and Washington). In his last years, when his sight was failing, he turned his hand to pastel portraits and in the 1775 Salon exhibited two self-portraits and a portrait of his wife (Louvre)."

His career is unusually well documented for a provincial artist of his date (he was active in Aix, Arles, and Avignon), but there are only two extant works that are certainly by him. These are the <i>Virgin of Mercy</i> (1452) in the Musée Condé at Chantilly, painted in collaboration with an obscure artist called Pierre Villatte, and the <i>Coronation of the Virgin</i> (1454) in the Musée de l'Hospice at Villeneuve-lès-Avignon. They are both highly impressive works, uniting Flemish and Italian influence and having something of the monumental character of the sculpture of Charonton's region. Indeed, they show Charonton to have been a painter of such commanding stature that there is an increasing tendency to attribute to him the celebrated <i>Avignon Pietà</i> (Louvre, Paris), the greatest French painting of the period (see <a href=""entry://Avignon, School of""><span class=""links"">AVIGNON, SCHOOL OF</span></a>)."

He was the most gifted pupil of <a href=""entry://Ingres, Jean-Auguste-Dominique""><span class=""links"">Ingres</span></a>, whose studio in Rome he entered when he was 11, but in the 1840s he conceived an admiration for <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a> and attempted, with considerable success, to combine Ingres's <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> linear grace with Delacroix's <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> colour. His chief work was the decoration of the Cour des Comptes in the Palais d'Orsay, Paris, with allegorical scenes of Peace and War (1844&ndash;8), but these were almost completely destroyed by fire. There are other examples of his decorative work, however, in various churches in Paris.

<b>Chirico, Giorgio de</b><div class=""content""><i>(1888&ndash;1978).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, sculptor, designer, and writer, the originator of <a href=""entry://Metaphysical painting""><span class=""links"">Metaphysical painting</span></a>. He was born in Greece, and trained in Athens, Florence, and Munich, where he was influenced by the <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolist</span></a> work of Böcklin and <a href=""entry://Klinger, Max""><span class=""links"">Klinger </span></a>, with their juxtaposition of the commonplace and the fantastic. In 1909 he moved to Italy (dividing his time between Florence, Milan, and Turin) and there painted his first ‘enigmatic’ pictures, which convey an atmosphere of strangeness and uneasiness through their empty spaces, illogical shadows, and unexpected perspectives. From 1911 to 1915 he lived in Paris, becoming friendly with many members of the avant-garde, including <a href=""entry://Apollinaire, Guillaume""><span class=""links"">Apollinaire</span></a> (who championed his work) and <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>. During this period he developed a more deliberate theory of ‘metaphysical insight’ into a reality behind ordinary things by neutralizing the things themselves of all their usual associations and setting them in new and mysterious relationships. In order to empty the objects of his paintings of their natural emotional significance he painted tailors' dummies as human beings (from 1914).<br class=""nLine"" />In 1915 de Chirico was conscripted into the Italian Army and sent to Ferrara. There he suffered a nervous breakdown, and in 1917 met <a href=""entry://Carrà, Carlo""><span class=""links"">Carrà </span></a> in the military hospital and converted him to his views, launching Metaphysical painting as a movement. It was short lived, virtually ending when de Chirico and Carrà quarrelled in 1919, but it was highly influential on <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>, and it was during the later 1920s, when Surrealism was becoming the most talked-about artistic phenomenon of the day, that de Chirico's international reputation was established. However, it was his early work that the Surrealists admired and they attacked him for adopting a more traditional style in the 1920s, when his output included some distinctive pictures featuring horses on unreal seashores with broken classical columns. In the 1920s and 1930s he spent much of his time in Paris (and in 1935&ndash;7 he lived in the USA) before settling permanently in Rome in 1944. By this time his paintings had become repetitive and obsessed with technical refinement. His other work included a number of small sculptures and set and costume designs for opera and ballet; his writings include a Surrealistic novel, <i>Hebdomeros</i> (1929), and two volumes of autobiography (1945 and 1960). In the catalogue of the exhibition ‘Italian Art in the 20th Century’ (Royal Academy, London, 1989) Wieland Schmied writes: ‘Giorgio de Chirico remains among the most controversial of all twentieth-century artists. There is no other figure of such seminal importance on whom the experts' opinions are so divided or their interpretations so widely divergent.’"

<b>Christo</b>
<i>(Christo Javacheff )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1935&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Bulgarian-born sculptor and experimental artist who settled in New York in 1964 and became an American citizen in 1973. After brief periods in Prague, Vienna (where he studied sculpture with <a href=""entry://Wotruba, Fritz""><span class=""links"">Wotruba</span></a>), and Geneva, he moved to Paris, where he lived from 1958 to 1964. Initially he earned his living there as a portrait painter, but soon after his arrival he invented ‘empaquetage’ (packaging), a form of expression he has made his own and for which he has become world-famous. It consists of wrapping objects in materials such as canvas or semitransparent plastic and dubbing the result art. He began with small objects such as paint tins from his studio (in this he had been anticipated by <a href=""entry://Ray, Man""><span class=""links"">Man Ray </span></a>), but they increased in size and ambitiousness through trees and motor cars to buildings and sections of landscape. He spends a great deal of time and effort negotiating permission to carry out such work and then (if negotiations are successful) in planning the operations, which can involve teams of professional rock-climbers as well as construction workers. He finances such massive enterprises through the sale of his smaller works. The buildings that he has succeeded in wrapping include the Pont Neuf in Paris (1985, after nine years of negotiations), and the Reichstag in Berlin (1995). Among the landscape projects he has carried out is Running Fence, something like a fabric equivalent of the Great Wall of China, undulating through 24 miles of Somona and Martin Counties, California (1976). Christo says of his work: ‘You can say it's about displacement. Basically even today I am a displaced person, and that is why I make art that does not last
Unlike steel, or stone, or wood, the fabric catches the physicality of the wind, the sun. They are refreshing. And then they are quickly gone.’"
"Christus, Petrus","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Christus, Petrus</b><div class=""content""><i>(d. 1472/73).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Netherlandish painter. He is first documented at Bruges in 1444, and he is thought by some authorities to have been the pupil of Jan van <a href=""entry://Eyck, Jan van""><span class=""links"">Eyck </span></a> and to have completed some of the works left unfinished by the master at his death in 1441 (e.g. <i>St Jerome</i>, Detroit Inst. of Arts). It is certainly true that he was overwhelmingly influenced by van Eyck, and his copies and variations of his work helped to spread the Eyckian style. Christus's work is more summary than van Eyck's, however, his figures sometimes rather doll-like and without van Eyck's feeling of inner life. The influence of Rogier van der <a href=""entry://Weyden, Rogier van der""><span class=""links"">Weyden </span></a> is also evident in Christus's work; the <i>Lamentation</i> (Musées. Royaux, Brussels) is clearly based on van der Weyden's great Prado <i>Deposition</i>, but the figures have completely lost their dramatic impact. Christus's most personal works are his portraits, notably <i>Edward Grimston</i> (Earl of Verulam Coll., on loan to NG, London, 1446) in which he abandons the dark backgrounds of van Eyck and van der Weyden and places his sitter in a clearly defined interior. His interest in representing space comes out also in his <i>Virgin and Child with Sts Jerome and Francis</i> (Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt, 1457), the earliest dated example in the north of the use of geometric <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a> with a single vanishing point."

<b>Churrigueresque</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to an extravagant style of architecture and ornament popular in Spain (and also Latin America) in the 18th cent. and sometimes used more loosely to refer to the <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> period as a whole in Spanish architecture. It is named after the Churriguera family of architects and sculptors, who were active mainly in Seville.

<b>Cibber, Caius Gabriel</b><div class=""content""><i>(1630&ndash;1700).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English sculptor of Danish birth.

His first important work was the large <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> (1674) on the base of the Monument erected in memory of the Great Fire of London (1666). Other works in London included the dramatic figures of <i>Raving</i> and <i>Melancholy Madness</i> (<i>c.</i>1675) for the gate of old Bedlam Hospital (now in the Bethlem Royal Hospital Museum, Beckenham). Much of his later career was taken up with decorative sculpture, notably for Sir Christopher Wren at Hampton Court and St Paul's Cathedral. With the exception of the figures of <i>Raving</i> and <i>Melancholy Madness</i>, which are powerful and original pieces, and the dignified and moving tomb of Thomas Sackville at Withyham, Sussex (1677), Cibber's work is usually competent but uninspired; it is of interest, however, in reflecting <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> influence (still unusual in England at this time) from Italy (where Cibber is said to have studied early in his career) and also from the Netherlands.

<b>Cimabue </b>
<i>(Cenni di Peppi )</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1240&ndash;1302?).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter. His nickname means ‘Ox-head’. He was a contemporary of Dante, who refers to him in <i>The Divine Comedy</i> (<i>Purg</i>. xi. 94&ndash;6) as an artist who was ‘believed to hold the field in painting’ only to be eclipsed by <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto's </span></a> fame. Ironically enough this passage, meant to illustrate the vanity of short-lived earthly glory, has become the basis for Cimabue's fame; for, embroidering on this reference, later writers made him into the discoverer and teacher of Giotto and regarded him as the first in the long line of great Italian painters. He was said to have worked in the ‘Greek’ (i.e. <a href=""entry://Byzantine art""><span class=""links"">Byzantine</span></a>) manner, but to have begun the movement towards greater realism which culminated in the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. Documentary evidence is insufficient to confirm or deny this estimate of Cimabue's art. The only work that can be proved to be by his hand is a <i>St John</i> forming part of a larger mosaic in Pisa Cathedral (1302), but tradition has tended to attribute to Cimabue many works of outstanding quality from the end of the 13th cent., such as the <i>Madonna of Sta Trinità</i> (Uffizi, Florence), a cycle of frescos in the Upper Church of S. Francesco in Assisi, and a majestic <i>Crucifix</i> in Sta Croce (badly damaged in the Florence flood of 1966). If these highly plausible attributions are correct, Cimabue was indeed the outstanding master of the generation before Giotto. The movement towards greater naturalism, however, may owe more to contemporary Roman painters and mosaicists (<a href=""entry://Cavallini, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Cavallini</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Torriti, Jacopo""><span class=""links"">Torriti</span></a>) than to him; he is documented in Rome in 1272 and could have known their work."

Subsequently he held many other public posts, including those of Chairman of the <a href=""entry://Arts Council of Great Britain""><span class=""links"">Arts Council</span></a> (1953&ndash;60) and of the Independent Television Authority (1954&ndash;7). He published more than twenty books, his forte being appreciation and interpretation rather than exact scholarship, although his monographs on <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo da Vinci</span></a> (1939) and <a href=""entry://Piero della Francesca ""><span class=""links"">Piero della Francesca </span></a> (1951), both of which have been issued in revised editions, still remain standard works. His other books include <i>The Gothic Revival</i> (1928), <i>Landscape into Art</i> (1949), and <i>The Nude</i> (1956). He regarded <i>The Nude</i> as ‘without question my best book, full of ideas and information, simplifying its complex subject without deformation, and in places eloquent’. A polished television performer as well as an elegant and stimulating writer, he did a great deal to popularize art history, most notably with his television series <i>Civilisation</i> (1969, also published then as a book), which was shown in over sixty countries. The part he played as a patron and collector (he inherited substantial wealth from his parents) is less well known, but was of considerable importance.

"classicism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>classicism</b>.<div class=""content"">Term that, with the related words ‘classic’ and ‘classical’, is used in various (and often confusing) ways in the history and criticism of the arts. In its broadest sense, classicism is used as the opposite of <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a>, characterizing art in which adherence to recognized aesthetic ideals is accorded greater importance than individuality of expression. The word often implies direct inspiration from <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> art, but this is not a necessary part of the concept, and according to context the word might be intended to convey little more than the idea of clarity of expression, or alternatively of conservatism. In the context of Greek art, the term ‘Classical’ (with a capital C) has a more precise meaning, referring to the period between the <a href=""entry://Archaic art""><span class=""links"">Archaic</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Hellenistic""><span class=""links"">Hellenistic</span></a> periods, when Greek culture is thought to have attained its greatest splendour. The term ‘classic’ is used to refer to the best or most representative example of its kind in any field or period. This is what <a href=""entry://Wölfflin, Heinrich""><span class=""links"">Wölfflin</span></a> meant when he gave the title <i>Classic Art</i> to his book on the Italian High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. Thus, in this sense, it would be legitimate, if wilfully confusing, to refer to <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a> as the classic Romantic artist. The three terms ‘classic’, ‘classical’, and ‘classicism’ are, then, often not used with discrimination or exactness, the conflation of historical term and value judgement reflecting the idea (dominant for centuries) that the art of the Greeks and Romans set a standard for all future achievement. To clear up (or perhaps add to) the confusion, the rather ungainly words ‘classicistic’ and ‘classicizing’ have also entered the lists&mdash;they convey the idea of dependence on ancient models but without any sense of qualitative judgement."
"Claude Gellée","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Claude Gellée </b><div class=""content""><i>(1604/5?&ndash;82).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, often called Le Lorrain (in France), or Claude Lorrain(e) (in the English-speaking world), after his place of birth, but usually referred to simply as Claude, a familiarity reflecting his enormous fame as the most celebrated of all exponents of <a href=""entry://ideal landscape""><span class=""links"">ideal landscape</span></a>. When about 12 years old he moved to Rome, where he is said to have entered the household of Agostino <a href=""entry://Tassi, Agostino""><span class=""links"">Tassi </span></a> as a pastry-cook (a favourite trade of Lorrainers), then become his studio assistant. Around 1620 he made a two-year visit to Naples, where he studied with the obscure German-born landscapist Goffredo Wals and was deeply impressed by the beauty of the Gulf of Naples; he used the coastline in his paintings to the end of his life. In 1625 he returned to Lorraine, and worked at Nancy with the court painter Claude Deruet (1588&ndash;1660), but in 1627 he was back in Rome, where except for local journeys he remained for the rest of his life.<br class=""nLine"" />In Tassi's decorative paintings he came into contact with the conventionalized late <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> style of landscape painting. The influence of the two leading exponents of the style, <a href=""entry://Bril, Paul""><span class=""links"">Bril</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Elsheimer, Adam""><span class=""links"">Elsheimer</span></a>, comes out in the lively paraphernalia of architectural fragments, figures, and animals that often animates the foreground of his early paintings (<i>The Mill</i>, Mus. of Fine Arts, Boston, 1631). But his profound sensitivity to the tonal values of light and atmosphere lent an unpremeditated classical harmony to his pictures which matured with the years. During the 1630s he became well known and successful, working for illustrious patrons, and as early as 1634 <a href=""entry://Bourdon, Sébastien""><span class=""links"">Bourdon</span></a> had thought it worthwhile to pass off a painting of his own as a work by Claude. To combat such forgeries Claude began to compile his <i>Liber Veritatis</i> (Book of Truth) in 1635&ndash;6; it contains drawings of virtually all his paintings made from that date, making his <i>œuvre</i> exceptionally well documented. It is now in the British Museum, which also has the greatest collection of Claude's drawings from nature, works that often show a freedom of brushwork that has led them to be compared with Chinese art. Claude was also an accomplished etcher, but not nearly as prolific as he was as a painter and draughtsman.<br class=""nLine"" />From 1640 to 1660 Claude developed steadily towards the mature style of the poetic landscapes on which his enormous reputation was built. His painting shed the affectations of Mannerism and became an expression of his deep feeling for the beauty of the Roman countryside with its rich associations of <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> grandeur. He used this landscape not to create a heroic vision of ancient Rome, as did his friend <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>, but to evoke a sense of the pastoral serenity of a Golden Age. The ostensible subjects of his pictures, taken frequently from the Bible, Virgil, Ovid, or medieval epics, are subordinate to the real theme, which was the mood of the landscape presented poetically in terms of light and colour. In his earlier paintings Claude, like Elsheimer, used light for the sake of dramatic effects; as his style matured he began to use it for its own sake, letting it play on forms and explore their texture. In the landscapes of the last two decades of his life everything was depicted in terms of light: the eye-level was raised and the view kept as open as possible so that the eye can roam at will over a spacious panorama to the distant horizon and beyond it into infinity. Forms melt and lose their material solidity and the figures become unnaturally elongated and insubstantial, as in <i>Ascanius and the Stag</i> (Ashmolean, Oxford, 1682), his last painting.<br class=""nLine"" />Claude has nowhere been more admired and more influential than in England. Not only were his works keenly sought after by late 17th- and 18th-cent. collectors, but they had great influence on such artists as <a href=""entry://Wilson, Richard""><span class=""links"">Wilson </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Turner, J. M. W.""><span class=""links"">Turner </span></a>. His name became virtually synonymous with the ideals of the <a href=""entry://Picturesque""><span class=""links"">Picturesque</span></a>, he inspired a revolution in English landscape gardening about the middle of the 18th cent., and much descriptive verse paid tribute to the ideal of beautiful natural scenery which derived from him."

Almost nothing is known for certain of his life and works. The more famous <i>Jean Clouet </i> (d. 1540/1) is thought to have been his son. He was celebrated in his lifetime, but no documented works survive. A handful of portraits, however, including <i>Man holding Petrarch's Works</i> (Royal Coll., Windsor), and a number of drawings (mainly in the Musée Condé, Chantilly) are attributed to him on fairly strong circumstantial evidence. The paintings belong to the school of Flemish <a href=""entry://naturalism""><span class=""links"">naturalism</span></a> that dominated French portraiture at this time, but the drawings are more personal and often of very high quality. They have often been compared to those of Clouet's contemporary Hans <a href=""entry://Holbein, Hans""><span class=""links"">Holbein </span></a> the Younger, with which they share a keenness of observation; whereas Holbein's drawings are overwhelmingly linear, however, Clouet's are subtly modelled in light and shade with a delicate system of <a href=""entry://hatching""><span class=""links"">hatching</span></a> that recalls <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, whose work he could well have known. Jean's son, <i>François</i> (<i>c.</i>1510&ndash;72), succeeded him as court painter in 1541. His work is somewhat better documented than his father's, but his career is still very obscure (they used the same nickname, ‘Janet’, which has caused much confusion, and one of the finest works attributed to him, the celebrated portrait of Francis I in the Louvre, showing the king in a lavish gold doublet, has also been given to Jean). François, too, was mainly a portraitist, his signed works including <i>Pierre Quthe</i> (Louvre, Paris, 1562), much more Italianate than any of his father's paintings, and <i>Lady in Her Bath</i> (NG, Washington, <i>c.</i>1570). This mysterious and captivating work has been traditionally identified as representing Diane de Poitiers, but it is more probably a likeness of Marie Touchet, mistress of Charles IX. A number of drawings, mostly in the Musée Condé, are also attributed to him."

"Coade stone","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Coade stone</b>.<div class=""content"">An artificial stone manufactured in London in the late 18th and early 19th cents., used for figure sculpture, monuments, architectural dressings, and decorative work. Essentially a type of clay, fired in a kiln at high temperature, it was named after Mrs Eleanor Coade (d. 1821), who set up in business in Lambeth in 1769. She claimed that it resisted frost and therefore retained sharpness of outline better than natural stone, and time has proved her right. It was mixed into a kind of paste and formed into the required shape with moulds, so popular designs could be more or less mass produced. The business was an immediate success; Robert Adam was one of the notable architects who used the material and several good sculptors, particularly John <a href=""entry://Bacon, John""><span class=""links"">Bacon </span></a> the Elder, worked for the firm. Monuments made of Coade stone exist in many English churches, and some garden sculpture remains.

He ran a large workshop and was regarded as one of the leading Antwerp painters of his day, but his work is fairly run-of-the-mill and he is generally more important for his publishing activities. Like his paintings, his books are saturated in Italian influence, and the translation of the architectural treatise of Sebastiano Serlio that he issued from 1539 played a large part in spreading <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> ideas in the Netherlands (it was from the Dutch edition, too, rather than from the Italian original, that the English translation of 1611 was made).

"Colquhoun, Robert","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Colquhoun, Robert</b><div class=""content""><i>(1914&ndash;62).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter, graphic artist, and designer. In 1933&ndash;8 he studied at Glasgow School of Art, where he became the inseparable companion of his fellow student Robert MacBryde (1913&ndash;66). They settled in London in 1941. During the war Colquhoun was an ambulance driver in the Civil Defence Corps by day and painted by night. Within a few years the studio of the Roberts (as they were generally known) at 77 Bedford Gardens, Campden Hill, had become a centre for a group of young artists and writers, among them Keith <a href=""entry://Vaughan, Keith""><span class=""links"">Vaughan </span></a>. Following a successful one-man show in 1943 Colquhoun developed a reputation as one of the outstanding British painters of his generation; his characteristic angular figure compositions owed something to <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, but had an expressive life of their own. After he and MacBryde were evicted from their studio in 1947, however, his fortunes began to decline and he died (of a heart attack) in relative obscurity. Apart from painting, both Colquhoun and MacBryde produced many lithographs and worked together on stage designs."

<b>Conceptual art</b>.<div class=""content"">Term embracing various forms of art in which the idea for a work is considered more important than the finished product, if any. The notion goes back to <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a>, but it was not until the 1960s that Conceptual art became a major international phenomenon (it first made an impact in Britain with the exhibition ‘When Attitudes Become Form’ at the <a href=""entry://Institute of Contemporary Arts""><span class=""links"">Institute of Contemporary Arts</span></a>, London, in 1969). It often overlaps with other avant-garde forms of expression (<a href=""entry://Body art""><span class=""links"">Body art</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Land art""><span class=""links"">Land art</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Minimal art""><span class=""links"">Minimal art</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Performance art""><span class=""links"">Performance art</span></a>, for example), and its manifestations have been very diverse. Photographs, texts, maps, diagrams, sound cassettes, video, etc., have been used as communication media, and most Conceptual artists deliberately render their productions visually uninteresting in order to divert attention to the ‘idea’ they express (see <a href=""entry://Kosuth, Joseph""><span class=""links"">KOSUTH</span></a>, for an example). Exponents and admirers of Conceptual art see it as posing questions about the nature of art and provocatively expanding its boundaries; to the general public and to many critics it usually seems pretentious and hollow. There are no readily apparent means for discriminating successful from unsuccessful, professional from amateurish, good from bad, examples of Conceptual art, and to many people the abbreviation ‘Con art’ that is sometimes used must seem remarkably apposite."

"Coninxloo, Gillis van","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Coninxloo, Gillis van</b><div class=""content""><i>(1544&ndash;1607).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The most important member of a large and prolific family of Flemish painters, many of whom are not clearly distinguishable personalities. He was born at Antwerp and in 1587 emigrated to Frankenthal, where he became a leader of a group of landscape painters established there. In 1595 he settled permanently in Amsterdam. Coninxloo's early landscapes are panoramic views of vast valleys and great mountain ranges populated by biblical or mythological personages. In later works, such as the majestic <i>Forest</i> (Kunsthistorisches Mus., Vienna), he narrows his field of vision and takes as his subject the mood evoked by luxuriant nature. His younger countrymen, Roelant <a href=""entry://Savery, Roelandt""><span class=""links"">Savery </span></a> and David <a href=""entry://Vinckboons, David""><span class=""links"">Vinckboons </span></a>, who had also come to Holland at about the same time, were influenced by Gillis's late works.

"Constable, John","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Constable, John</b><div class=""content""><i>(1776&ndash;1837).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, ranked with <a href=""entry://Turner, J. M. W.""><span class=""links"">Turner </span></a> as one of the greatest British landscape artists. Although he showed an early talent for art and began painting his native Suffolk scenery before he left school, his great originality matured slowly. He committed himself to a career as an artist only in 1799, when he joined the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> Schools, and it was not until 1829 that he was grudgingly made a full Academician, elected by a majority of only one vote. In 1816 he became financially secure on the death of his father and married Maria Bicknell after a seven-year courtship and in the face of strong opposition from her family. During the 1820s he began to win recognition: <i>The Hay Wain</i> (NG, London, 1821) won a gold medal at the Paris <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> of 1824 and Constable was admired by <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Bonington, Richard Parkes""><span class=""links"">Bonington </span></a> among others. His wife died in 1828, however, and the remaining years of his life were clouded by despondency.<br class=""nLine"" />After spending some years working in the <a href=""entry://Picturesque""><span class=""links"">Picturesque</span></a> tradition of landscape and the manner of <a href=""entry://Gainsborough, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Gainsborough </span></a>, Constable developed his own original treatment from the attempt to render scenery more directly and realistically, carrying on but modifying in an individual way the tradition inherited from <a href=""entry://Ruisdael, Jacob van""><span class=""links"">Ruisdael</span></a> and the Dutch 17th-cent. landscape painters. Just as his contemporary William Wordsworth rejected what he called the ‘poetic diction’ of his predecessors, so Constable turned away from the pictorial conventions of 18th-cent. landscape painters, who, he said, were always ‘running after pictures and seeking the truth at second hand’. Constable thought that ‘No two days are alike, nor even two hours; neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since the creation of the world’, and in a way that was then new he represented in paint the atmospheric effects of changing light in the open air, the movement of clouds across the sky, and his excited delight at these phenomena, stemming from a profound love of the country: ‘The sound of water escaping from mill dams, willows, old rotten planks, slimy posts and brick-work, I love such things. These scenes made me a painter.’ He never went abroad, and his finest works are of the places he knew and loved best, particularly Suffolk and Hampstead, where he lived from 1821. To render the shifting flicker of light and weather he abandoned fine traditional finish, catching the sunlight in blobs of pure white or yellow, and the drama of storms with a rapid brush. Henry <a href=""entry://Fuseli, Henry""><span class=""links"">Fuseli </span></a> was among the contemporaries who applauded the freshness of Constable's approach, for C. R. <a href=""entry://Leslie, Charles Robert""><span class=""links"">Leslie </span></a> records him as saying: ‘I like de landscapes of Constable; he is always picturesque, of a fine colour, and de lights always in de right places; but he makes me call for my great coat and umbrella.’<br class=""nLine"" />Constable worked extensively in the open air, drawing and sketching in oils, but his finished pictures were produced in the studio. For his most ambitious works&mdash;‘sixfooters’ as he called them&mdash;he followed the unusual technical procedure of making a full-size oil sketch, and in the 20th cent. there has been a tendency to praise these even more highly than the finished works because of their freedom and freshness of brushwork. (The full-size sketch for <i>The Hay Wain</i> is in the V&amp;A, London, which has the finest collection of Constable's work.) In England Constable had no real successor and the many imitators (who included his son <i>Lionel</i>, 1825&ndash;87) turned rather to the formal compositions than to the more direct sketches. In France, however, he was a major influence on <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> painters such as Delacroix, on the members of the <a href=""entry://Barbizon School""><span class=""links"">Barbizon School</span></a>, and ultimately on the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>."

<b>Cooper, Douglas</b><div class=""content""><i>(1911&ndash;84).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British art historian and collector. He lived in France for much of his life and was severely critical of the British for what he regarded as their failure to appreciate or patronize modern art. His main interest was <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, and in 1932 he decided to devote part of his inheritance to forming a collection of its four main protagonists&mdash;<a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Braque, Georges""><span class=""links"">Braque </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Gris, Juan""><span class=""links"">Gris </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Léger, Fernand""><span class=""links"">Léger </span></a>&mdash;in its greatest period, 1907&ndash;14. He later added works by other artists, but the Cubists remained the core. In the Second World War he worked in intelligence and helped to identify, protect, and repatriate works of art. Picasso was later a neighbour and visitor in southern France, but their friendship turned to hostility. Cooper, indeed, had a notoriously difficult temperament and enjoyed controversy; in the 1950s he became particularly well known for his attacks on the <a href=""entry://Tate Gallery""><span class=""links"">Tate Gallery</span></a> and its Director Sir John <a href=""entry://Rothenstein, Sir William""><span class=""links"">Rothenstein </span></a>.

Cooper was the greatest English miniaturist of the 17th cent. and he enjoyed a European reputation and the patronage of both Oliver Cromwell and Charles II. His portraits are almost always of the bust only, but within this limitation his range is remarkable: he presents each sitter with a force and individuality besides which the life-size portraits by contemporaries such as <a href=""entry://Lely, Sir Peter""><span class=""links"">Lely </span></a> appear doll-like, and his ambitious composition and <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> sense of design mark a complete breach with the tradition of <a href=""entry://Hilliard, Nicholas""><span class=""links"">Hilliard</span></a> and Hoskins.

Nothing is known of his life, and his work was completely forgotten for more than two centuries after his death. Only a handful of paintings by him survive, but they show him to have been one of the most individual still-life painters of his time.

"Copley, John Singleton","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Copley, John Singleton</b><div class=""content""><i>(1738&ndash;1815).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The greatest American painter of the 18th cent. He was the stepson of the engraver Peter Pelham (<i>c.</i>1695&ndash;1751), from whose large collection of engravings he gained a considerable knowledge of European art, but he was virtually self-taught as a painter. While still in his teens he had set up as a painter in his native Boston and by his early twenties he was painting portraits that, in their sense of life and character, completely outstripped anything previously produced by Colonial portraitists (<i>Colonel Epes Sargent</i>, NG, Washington, <i>c.</i>1760). Though he became extremely successful, Copley was diffident and self-doubtful by nature and came to see himself as an artist afflicted with provincialism, cut off from the great European tradition of painting. For a long while he hesitated to leave the security of Boston (where he earned ‘as much as if I were a <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> or a <a href=""entry://Correggio ""><span class=""links"">Correggio</span></a>’), even after his portrait of his half-brother Henry Pelham (<i>The Boy with a Squirrel</i>, Mus. of Fine Arts, Boston, 1765) had been highly praised by both <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a> and <a href=""entry://West, Benjamin""><span class=""links"">West </span></a> when it was exhibited in London in 1766. He finally left in 1774, when revolutionary activity was beginning to threaten his practice, and settled in London in 1775 after a study trip to Italy.<br class=""nLine"" />In England his style changed markedly, sacrificing the forthright vigour of his Colonial work for a more fashionable and ornate manner. He continued to paint fine portraits that were more than a match for the work of most of his contemporaries, but it is generally agreed that those he painted in America have much greater originality and conviction. In compensation for this decline as a portraitist, he was able to turn his hand to history painting, in which he had long been eager to make a success but for which the opportunities in America were severely limited. The first was <i>Brook Watson and the Shark</i> (NG, Washington, 1778; a copy Copley made for himself is in the Mus. of Fine Arts, Boston, and a smaller variant, 1782, is in the Detroit Institute of Arts). In this he followed the innovation of his countryman West in using modern dress, and went beyond him in depicting a subject not because it was of historical importance or moral significance, but merely because it was exciting. It was not until a generation later that the French <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantics</span></a> took up this revolutionary idea. His other history paintings took more conventional themes, mainly patriotic and military, such as <i>The Death of Major Peirson</i> (Tate, London, 1783). In such works Copley revealed a magnificent gift for depicting heroic action in multi-figure compositions that none of his British contemporaries could approach, and these paintings won him considerable acclaim. They also brought on him the wrath of the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> (of which Copley had become a full member in 1779) when they were shown privately with great success, for this constituted a rival attraction to the Academy's own exhibitions. Copley's success in England, however, was fairly short-lived and his work gradually went out of favour. His final years were marked by a sad decline. <a href=""entry://Morse, Samuel Finley Breese""><span class=""links"">Morse</span></a> visited him in 1811 and wrote: ‘His powers of mind have almost entirely left him; his late paintings are miserable; it is really a lamentable thing that a man should outlive his faculties.’ He died leaving debts that had to be paid off by his son and namesake, who became Baron Lyndhurst and was three times Lord Chancellor."

<b>Coppo di Marcovaldo </b><div class=""content""><i>(b. <span class=""italic"">c.</i>1225).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, one of the earliest about whom there is a body of documented knowledge. He served in the army of Florence and settled in Siena after his capture at the Battle of Montaperti (1260). In 1261 he painted the signed and dated <i>Madonna and Child Enthroned</i>
<i>(called the Madonna del Bordone)</i> for the Servite church at Siena, and in 1274 he and his son <i>Salerno</i> painted a Crucifix for Pistoia Cathedral; both paintings still remain in their original locations. On the basis of these documented works two other outstanding paintings are attributed to Coppo: a <i>Madonna and Child Enthroned</i> in Sta Maria dei Servi in Orvieto, and a Crucifix in the Pinacoteca at San Gimignano. He introduced new solidity and humanity to the <a href=""entry://Byzantine art""><span class=""links"">Byzantine</span></a> tradition, in the way, for example, that he represents the Virgin with her head inclined towards the Child, and with <a href=""entry://Guido da Siena ""><span class=""links"">Guido da Siena </span></a> he ranks as the founder of the Sienese School."

After training at the Düsseldorf Academy Cornelius moved to Italy in 1811 and joined the <a href=""entry://Nazarenes""><span class=""links"">Nazarenes</span></a> in Rome. In 1819 he was called to Munich by Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (later Ludwig I), for whom he worked extensively, notably on a series of frescos in the Ludwigskirche (1836&ndash;9), including a <i>Last Judgement</i> that is larger than <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo's</span></a> in the Sistine Chapel. When this work was not well received Cornelius left Munich to work for Frederick William IV of Prussia in Berlin. His major undertaking there was a commission for frescos in a mausoleum for the royal family. The project was officially cancelled after the revolution in 1848, but Cornelius continued to work on his drawings for it for the rest of his life. Cornelius's work is undoubtedly impressive, but rather self-conscious in its desire to revive the heroic pictorial language of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> and Michelangelo, and combine it with the didactic philosophy of German <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a>.

"Corot, Jean-Baptiste-Camille","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Corot, Jean-Baptiste-Camille</b><div class=""content""><i>(1796&ndash;1875).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter. At the age of 26 he abandoned a commercial career for art, and from the first showed a strong vocation for landscape painting. He lived in Paris, but travelled about France making sketches from nature and from these he composed in his studio. In addition to his journeys in France, he visited England, the Low Countries, Switzerland, and Italy three times (1825&ndash;8, 1834, and 1843). Throughout his life Corot found congenial the advice given to him by his teacher Achille-Etna <a href=""entry://Michallon, Achille-Etna""><span class=""links"">Michallon </span></a> ‘to reproduce as scrupulously as possible what I saw in front of me’. On the other hand he never felt entirely at home with the ideals of the <a href=""entry://Barbizon School""><span class=""links"">Barbizon School</span></a>, the members of which saw <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> idealization of the countryside as a form of escapism from urban banality, and he remained more faithful to the French <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> tradition than to the English or Dutch schools. Yet although he continued to make studied compositions after his sketches done direct from nature, he brought a new and personal poetry into the classical tradition of composed landscape and an unaffected naturalness which had hitherto been foreign to it. Though he represented nature realistically, he did not idealize the peasant or the labours of agriculture in the manner of <a href=""entry://Millet, Jean-François""><span class=""links"">Millet</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Courbet, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Courbet </span></a>, and he was uninvolved in ideological controversy.<br class=""nLine"" />From 1827 Corot exhibited regularly at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a>, but his greatest success there came with a rather different type of picture&mdash;more traditionally Romantic in its evocation of an Arcadian past, and painted in a misty soft-edged style that contrasts sharply with the luminous clarity of his more topographical work. Late in his career Corot also turned to figure painting and it is only fairly recently that this aspect of his work has emerged from neglect&mdash;his female nudes are often of high quality. It was, however, his directness of vision that was generally admired by the major landscape painters of the latter half of the century and influenced nearly all of them at some stage in their careers. His popularity was (and is) such that he is said to be the most forged of all painters (this in addition to an already prolific output). In his lifetime he was held in great esteem as a man as well as an artist, for he had a noble and generous nature; he supported Millet's widow, for example, and gave a cottage to the blind and impoverished <a href=""entry://Daumier, Honoré""><span class=""links"">Daumier</span></a>."
"Correggio","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Correggio </b>
<i>(Antonio Allegri)</i>.<div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1490&ndash;1534).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, named after the small town in Emilia where he was born. His career is poorly documented and his training has to be conjectured on stylistic grounds. Echoes of <a href=""entry://Mantegna, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Mantegna's </span></a> manner in many of his early paintings indicate that he may have studied that master's work in Mantua, and he was influenced in these works also by Lorenzo <a href=""entry://Costa, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Costa </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, adopting Costa's pearly Ferrrarese colouring and, in the St John of the <i>St Francis</i> altarpiece (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, 1514), his first documented work, Leonardo's characteristic gesture of the pointing finger. Later he developed a style of conscious elegance and allure with soft <a href=""entry://Sfumato""><i><span class=""links"">sfumato</i></span></a> and gestures of captivating charm. Correggio may well have visited Rome early in his career, although <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> maintains that he never went there and the obvious inspiration of the paintings of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> could be accounted for by drawings and prints that were known all over Italy. Although he worked mainly in provincial centres, he was one of the most sophisticated artists of his time, blending disparate sources into a potent synthesis.<br class=""nLine"" />He was probably in Parma, the scene of his greatest activity, by 1518. His first large-scale commission there was for the decoration of the abbess's room in the convent of S. Paolo. The theme of the decorations is Diana, goddess of chastity and the chase, and the vaulted ceiling uses Mantegna's idea of a leafy trellis framing <a href=""entry://putto""><span class=""links"">putti</span></a> and symbols of the hunt. The S. Paolo ceiling was followed by two dome paintings in which Correggio developed the <a href=""entry://illusionism""><span class=""links"">illusionist</span></a> conception&mdash;already used by Mantegna&mdash;of depicting a scene as though it were actually taking place in the sky above (see <a href=""entry://sotto in sù""><span class=""links"">SOTTO IN SU</span></a>). The first of these domes was commissioned for the church of S. Giovanni Evangelista in 1520. The twelve Apostles sit on clouds round the base, while Christ is shown in steep foreshortening ascending to heaven. In the commission six years later for an <i>Assumption of the Virgin</i> in the dome of Parma Cathedral he used the same principle, but on a much larger scale and with still more daring foreshortening. These works reveal Correggio as one of the boldest and most inventive artists of the High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> and they were highly influential on the development of <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> dome painting (one of his most important successors, <a href=""entry://Lanfranco, Giovanni""><span class=""links"">Lanfranco</span></a>, was a native of Parma). Other aspects of Correggio's work were even more forward-looking. His extraordinarily sensuous mythologies, notably the series on the <i>Loves of Jupiter</i> painted for Federigo <a href=""entry://Gonzaga""><span class=""links"">Gonzaga </span></a> in <i>c.</i>1530&ndash;3 (<i>Ganymede</i> and <i>Jupiter and Io</i> in the Kunsthistorisches Mus., Vienna; <i>Leda</i> in the Staatliche Mus., Berlin; <i>Danaë</i> in the Borghese Gal., Rome), foreshadow the paintings of <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> artists such as <a href=""entry://Boucher, François""><span class=""links"">Boucher</span></a>, and it was at this time that Correggio's reputation was at its height."

<b>Cortona, Pietro da</b>
<i>(Pietro Berrettini)</i><div class=""content""><i>(1596&ndash;1669).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, architect, decorator, and designer, second only to <a href=""entry://Bernini, Gianlorenzo""><span class=""links"">Bernini </span></a> as the most versatile genius of the full Roman <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> style. He was named after his birthplace in Tuscany and probably had some training with his father, a stonemason, before being apprenticed as a painter in Florence. In 1612 or 1613 he moved to Rome. His first major works were frescos in Sta Bibiana, Rome (1624&ndash;6), commissioned by Urban VIII (Maffeo <a href=""entry://Barberini""><span class=""links"">Barberini </span></a>), and the patronage of the Barberini family played a major part in his career. For their palace he painted his most famous work, the huge ceiling fresco, <i>Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power</i>. This was begun in 1633, but he interrupted the work in 1637 to go to Florence and paint two of four frescos commissioned by the Grand Duke of Tuscany for the <a href=""entry://Pitti Palace""><span class=""links"">Pitti Palace</span></a>. He returned to finish the Barberini ceiling in 1639. This, one of the key works in the development of Baroque painting, is a triumph of <a href=""entry://illusionism""><span class=""links"">illusionism</span></a>, for the centre of the ceiling appears open to the sky and the figures seen from below (<i><a href=""entry://sotto in sù""><span class=""links"">di sotto in su</i></a></span>) appear to come down into the room as well as soar out of it. It demonstrates Pietro's belief, which came out in a celebrated controversy with Andrea <a href=""entry://Sacchi, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Sacchi </span></a> in the Accademia di S. Luca, that a history painting could be compared with an epic and was entitled to use many figures; Sacchi, intent on <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> simplicity and unity, argued for using as few figures as possible. In 1640&ndash;7 Pietro was back in Florence to finish his decorations in the Pitti Palace, where he received a new commission for seven ceilings. These <i>Allegories of Virtues and Planets</i> have elaborate <a href=""entry://stucco""><span class=""links"">stucco</span></a> accompaniments uniting the painted ceilings with the framework of the rooms, and this form of decoration was widely influential, not only in Italy, but also in France. (Pietro turned down an invitation to visit Paris from Cardinal Mazarin, but his style was taken there by his best pupil, <a href=""entry://Romanelli, Giovanni Francesco""><span class=""links"">Romanelli</span></a>.) From 1647 until his death Pietro again worked in Rome, his major paintings from this period being an extensive series of frescos in Sta Maria in Vallicella (the Chiesa Nuova, 1647&ndash;65), in which, as in his Pitti decorations, paint and stucco are magnificently combined. Throughout his career he also painted easel pictures of religious and mythological subjects.<br class=""nLine"" />Pietro once wrote that architecture was merely a pastime for him, but he ranks among the greatest architects of his period. His masterpiece is the church of SS. Martina e Luca in Rome (1635&ndash;50), which was the first Baroque church designed and built as a complete unity. Although his architecture has all the vigour of his painting, there is less correspondence between the two fields than might be imagined. He never decorated any of his own churches, and indeed they were not designed with fresco decoration in mind. Pietro's great contemporary reputation sank in the next century with that of many other Baroque artists. In a famous passage in his <i>Dizionario delle belle arti</i> (1797), Francesco Milizia wrote: ‘Borromini in architecture, Bernini in sculpture, Pietro da Cortona in painting
represent a diseased taste&mdash;one that has infected a great number of artists.’"

The term derives from two craftsmen called Cosmas, whose names are inscribed on several works, but there were several families of ‘Cosmati’ workers and many individual craftsmen. Cosmati work was applied to church furnishings such as tombs and pulpits and was also used for architectural decoration. The style spread as far as England, for example in the tomb of Henry III in Westminster Abbey (<i>c.</i>1280), executed by imported Italian craftsmen."

His earliest pictures (including several narcissistic self-portraits) were in the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> tradition, but with three large canvases exhibited at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> of 1850 he established himself as the leader of the <a href=""entry://realism""><span class=""links"">Realist</span></a> school of painting: these are <i>The Burial at Ornans</i> (Musée d'Orsay, Paris), <i>The Peasants at Flagey</i> (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Besançon), and <i>The Stone Breakers</i> (formerly in Dresden, but destroyed in the Second World War). The huge burial scene in particular made an enormous impact; it was attacked in some quarters for its alleged crudity and deliberate ugliness, but also hailed for its powerful naturalism. Never before had a scene from everyday life been presented in such an epic manner and Courbet was cast in the role of a revolutionary socialist. He gladly accepted this role (although it is unlikely that he painted the picture with political intention) and he became a friend and follower of the anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, collaborating on his book <i>On Art and its Social Significance</i> (1863). Courbet's boldness and self-confidence are as evident in his technique as in his choice of subjects. He often used a palette knife to apply paint and his work shows an unprecedented relish for the physical substance of his materials.<br class=""nLine"" />His unconventionality and hatred of authority was expressed most forcefully in 1855, when, dissatisfied with the representation allotted to him at the Paris Universal Exhibition, he organized a pavilion for his own work, calling it ‘Le Réalisme’. Included in the works he showed here was his most celebrated work, <i>The Painter's Studio</i> (Musée d'Orsay, Paris, 1854&ndash;5). This huge (6-m. wide) canvas was subtitled by Courbet ‘a real allegory [a seeming contradiction in terms] summing up seven years in my artistic life’. He wrote a long (but not very clear) account of it, describing it as ‘the moral and physical history of my studio’ and saying it showed ‘all the people who serve my cause, sustain me in my ideal and support my activity’. In it he presents himself as the artist-hero, and in taking as his subject the activity of creating art he sounded a note that reverberated into the 20th cent. Interpretations of the picture have been many and varied, and it has recently been shown that it has covert but carefully thought out political content, attacking Napoleon III. After 1855 his work became less doctrinaire. His colours were less sombre and he often chose more obviously attractive subjects&mdash;landscapes from the Forest of Fontainebleau, the Jura, or the Mediterranean, seascapes with distant vistas, or comely and sensual nudes. After the deposition of Napoleon III, Courbet was active in the Paris Commune of 1871 and was appointed head of the arts commission. When the Commune fell he was imprisoned for his role in the destruction of the Vendôme Column, and he fled to Switzerland in 1873, being unable to pay the fine imposed on him (see <a href=""entry://Meissonier, Ernest""><span class=""links"">MEISSONIER</span></a>). He stayed there for the remaining four years of his life, painting mainly landscapes and portraits. Courbet did not form a school, but he had an enormous influence on 19th-cent. art because of his resounding rejection of the doctrine of idealization and concentration on the tangible reality of things. ‘Painting’, he said, ‘is an art of sight and should therefore concern itself with things seen; it should, therefore, abandon both the historical scenes of the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> school and poetic subjects from <a href=""entry://Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von""><span class=""links"">Goethe</span></a> and Shakespeare favoured by the Romantic school.’ When asked to include angels in a painting for a church he replied: ‘I have never seen angels. Show me an angel and I will paint one.’"

In 1923 he gave to the <a href=""entry://Tate Gallery""><span class=""links"">Tate Gallery</span></a> £50,000 for the purchase of works by French 19th-cent. painters, who were hardly represented in the gallery. Most of his own superb collection was presented to the University of London in 1932, a year after he had endowed the Courtauld Institute of Art, the first specialist centre in Britain for the study of art history. The co-founders of the Institute were Lord Lee of Fareham (1868&ndash;1947), a soldier and politician, who in 1921 had presented his country house&mdash;Chequers&mdash;to the nation to be the prime minister's country residence, and Sir Robert Witt (1872&ndash;1952), a lawyer who formed a library of reproductions of paintings and drawings that is now one of the cornerstones of the Institute's pre-eminence in art-historical studies. Both men left collections to the Courtauld Institute&mdash;Lee mainly of paintings, Witt of drawings and watercolours&mdash;and there have been several other important bequests, including that of the painter and critic Roger <a href=""entry://Fry, Roger""><span class=""links"">Fry </span></a>. The most recent of the major bequests, that of the Anglo-Austrian art historian Count Antoine Seilern (1901&ndash;78) in 1978, has raised an already outstanding collection to new heights. Seilern's bequest is varied, reflecting his own scholarly interests, but its chief glory is its superlative group of works by <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>. The Courtauld Institute was originally located in Courtauld's former house (a fine Robert Adam building) at 20 Portman Square, while the galleries occupied a building about a mile away next to the <a href=""entry://Warburg, Aby""><span class=""links"">Warburg</span></a> Institute in Woburn Square. In 1989&ndash;90, however, all the Institute's activities and collections were brought together under one roof at Somerset House in the Strand, fulfilling Samuel Courtauld's intention that students should work in intimate contact with original works of art."

<b>Cousin, Jean the Elder</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1490&ndash;1560/61).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, engraver, and designer, active in his native Sens and from about 1538 in Paris. He had a successful career as a painter and a designer of stained glass and tapestries, but very little surviving work can be securely attributed to him. The only certain documented works are three tapestries from a series on the life of St Mammès, which he contracted to design in 1543 (two are in Langres Cathedral, for which they were woven, the other in a private collection). The painting <i>Eva Prima Pandora</i> (Louvre, Paris), however, can also be confidently given to him, as the attribution goes back almost to his lifetime, and two windows in Sens Cathedral are also traditionally attributed to him. In 1560 he published a treatise on <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a>. The career of his son <i>Jean the Younger</i> (<i>c.</i>1522&ndash;<i>c.</i>1594), a painter and engraver, follows a similar pattern. He too worked in Sens and Paris and had a great contemporary reputation, but again little documented work survives. His most important painting is a <i>Last Judgement</i> (Louvre), but he is best known as a book illustrator; his <i>Livre de Fortune</i>, a book of <a href=""entry://emblem""><span class=""links"">emblem</span></a> drawings, was published in 1568, and he also illustrated editions of the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid (1570) and the <i>Fables</i> of Aesop (1582).

Whereas the central tradition of modern Scottish painting has been one of rich colouring and lush, free brushwork (see, for example, <a href=""entry://Scottish Colourists""><span class=""links"">SCOTTISH COLOURISTS</span></a>), Cowie worked in a strong, hard, predominantly linear style&mdash;highly disciplined rather than intuitive (he made many preparatory drawings and often worked on a picture for several years).

"Coypel","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Coypel</b>.<div class=""content"">Family of French painters of which <i>Noel</i> (1628&ndash;1707) was the head. He created a successful academic style on the example of <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Lebrun, Charles""><span class=""links"">Lebrun </span></a>, was much employed on the large decorative schemes of Louis XIV, notably at Versailles, and was director of the French Academy in Rome (1672&ndash;6) and then director of the Académie Royale in Paris (1695). His son <i>Antoine</i> (1661&ndash;1722) went to Rome as a child with his father and there is a strong Italian element in his style. This comes out particularly in his most famous work, the ceiling of the Chapel at Versailles (1708), which derived from <a href=""entry://Baciccio, Il""><span class=""links"">Baciccio's</span></a> ceiling in the Gesù in Rome. This and Coypel's decorations at the Palais Royal in Paris (1702, destroyed) rank as the two most completely <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> schemes found in French art of this period. The Versailles ceiling is more successful than much of Coypel's work, which often combines, in the words of Anthony <a href=""entry://Blunt, Anthony""><span class=""links"">Blunt </span></a>, ‘the bombast of the Baroque and the pedantry of the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> style without the virtues of either’. His half-brother <i>Noel-Nicolas</i> (1690&ndash;1734) painted with much more charm, mainly mythological subjects, but he seems to have had a rather timid personality and did not achieve the worldly success of the other members of the family. Indeed, he was the best painter of the family, but is the least famous. <a href=""entry://Chardin, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon""><span class=""links"">Chardin</span></a> was briefly his assistant. Antoine's son <i>Charles-Antoine</i> (1694&ndash;1752) was a much more forceful character than Noel-Nicolas and had a resoundingly successful career, largely due to his administrative capacity in the various official positions that he held. In 1747 he became director of the Académie Royale and chief painter to the king. He also was an accomplished writer of verse and plays as well as art criticism. As a painter he was versatile and prolific, but the weakest member of the family; his <i>Supper at Emmaus</i> (1746) in Saint-Merry, Paris, has been described by Sir Michael Levey as ‘pathetically inept’."

His style was more <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> than Girardon's and Coysevox overtook his rival in popularity towards the end of the 17th cent. as the king's taste turned away from the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a>. By 1679 Coysevox was working at Versailles, where he made numerous statues for the gardens and did much interior decoration, including a striking <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> of Louis XIV in the Salon de la Guerre. His originality, however, is seen mostly in his portrait busts, which show a naturalism of conception and an animation of expression that look forward to the <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a>. This is particularly so with his portraits of friends, but even his formal commissions can be remarkably lively.

"Cozens, Alexander","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Cozens, Alexander</b><div class=""content""><i>(1717&ndash;86).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English landscape draughtsman. He was born in Russia, the son of a shipbuilder employed by Peter the Great (it was rumoured that Peter was his real father) and did not settle in England until 1746. In 1785 or 1786 he published his famous treatise <i>A New Method of Assisting the Invention in Drawing Original Compositions of Landscape</i>, in which he explains his method of using accidental blots on the drawing paper to stimulate the imagination by suggesting landscape forms that could be developed into a finished work. Cozens mentions that ‘something of the same kind had been mentioned by <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a> da Vinci, in his Treatise on Painting’ and that reading the passage in question ‘tended to confirm my own opinion’. He quotes Leonardo as saying ‘If you look upon an old wall covered with dirt, or the odd appearance of some streaked stones, you may discover several things like landscapes, battles, clouds, uncommon atittudes, humorous faces, draperies &amp;c. Out of this confused mass of objects, the mind will be furnished with abundance of designs and subjects perfectly new.’ He worked almost exclusively in monochrome, and both his *‘<a href=""entry://blot drawing""><span class=""links"">blot drawings</span></a>’ and his more formal compositions use intense lights and darks with masterly effect to suggest the power and mystery of nature. Cozens was the first major English artist to devote himself entirely to landscape, and he spent much of his career as a fashionable teacher.<br class=""nLine"" />His son, <i>John Robert Cozens </i> (1752&ndash;97), was also a landscape painter. Most of his work derived from two continental journeys in 1776&ndash;9 and 1782&ndash;3, during which he visited Italy and Switzerland. On the first he was probably draughtsman to Richard Payne <a href=""entry://Knight, Richard Payne""><span class=""links"">Knight </span></a>, and on the second he was part of the entourage of William <a href=""entry://Beckford, William""><span class=""links"">Beckford </span></a> (a former pupil of his father). In 1793 he became insane and was cared for by Dr <a href=""entry://Monro, Dr Thomas""><span class=""links"">Monro </span></a>. Although his watercolours were based on sketches made on the spot, he by no means restricted himself to topographical exactitude and he often transposed landscape features in the interests of a more poetical composition. But he does not seem ever to have composed wholly from imagination, as his father did. His narrow but subtly gradated range of subdued colour is intensely evocative of the serene natural effects which appealed so strongly to his poetic melancholy. He was the most talented of the English landscape artists in the <a href=""entry://Picturesque""><span class=""links"">Picturesque</span></a> tradition and his work was admired and copied by <a href=""entry://Constable, John""><span class=""links"">Constable</span></a> (who called him ‘the greatest genius that ever touched landscape’), <a href=""entry://Girtin, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Girtin</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Turner, J.

He takes his name from the small town of Kronach in South Germany, where he was born, and very little is known of his life before about 1500&ndash;1, when he settled in Vienna and started working in the humanist circles associated with the newly founded university. His stay in Vienna was brief (he left in 1504), but in his period there he painted some of his finest and most original works. They include portraits, notably those of <i>Johannes Cuspinian</i>, a lecturer at the university, and his wife <i>Anna</i> (Reinhart Coll., Winterhur), and several religious works in which he shows a remarkable feeling for the beauty of landscape characteristic of the <a href=""entry://Danube School""><span class=""links"">Danube School</span></a>. The finest example of this manner is perhaps the <i>Rest on the Flight into Egypt</i> (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), which shows the Holy Family resting in the glade of a German pine forest. It was painted in 1504, just before Cranach went to Wittenberg as court painter to Frederick III (the Wise), Elector of Saxony.<br class=""nLine"" />Cranach remained in Wittenberg until 1550, when he followed John Frederick (the Unfortunate) into exile, in Augsburg. During his time in Wittenberg he became extremely wealthy and one of the city's most respected citizens, serving as burgomaster for several years. His paintings were eagerly sought by collectors, and his busy studio often produced numerous replicas of popular designs, particularly those in which he showed his skill at depicting female beauty&mdash;more than ten versions are known of his <i>Reclining Nymph</i>. He excelled at erotic nudes, which sometimes draw on Italian <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> models but are totally different in spirit, and he also had a penchant for pictures of coquettish women wearing large hats, sometimes shown as Judith or the goddesses in the <i>Judgement of Paris</i>. The most innovative works of his Wittenberg period, however, are probably his full-length portraits (<i>The Duke</i> and <i>Duchess of Saxony</i>, Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, 1514). Cranach continued with his religious work, but his woodcut designs (notably those for the first German edition of the New Testament in 1522) are generally more interesting than his paintings in this sphere. He also painted several portraits of Martin Luther. Despite his allegiance to the Protestant cause, he continued to work for Catholic patrons and was a very astute businessman. During the last years of his life Cranach was assisted by his son, <i>Lucas the Younger</i> (1515&ndash;86), who carried on the tradition of the workshop and imitated his father's style so successfully that it is often difficult to distinguish between their hands."

<b>Crespi, Giovanni Battista</b>
<i>(II Cerano)</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1575&ndash;1632).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, sculptor, engraver, architect, and writer. His nickname derived from his birthplace near Novaro, but he was active mainly in Milan, where he was one of the leading artists of his time. During the 1590s he was in Rome, where he was befriended by Cardinal Federico Borromeo (nephew of St Charles Borromeo ), who became his major patron after they returned to Milan together. Borromeo appointed him head of the painting section of the Accademia Ambrosiana, which he founded in 1620, and in 1629 put him in charge of the sculptural decoration of Milan Cathedral. Crespi's paintings, often mystical in feeling, are complex stylistically; there is a strong <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> current in his colouring and in the elegant posturing of his figures, but his work also shows a solidity and a feeling for realistic details that give it a place in the vanguard of the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a>."

They met by chance in 1847 and became firm friends when Cavalcaselle was later a political refugee in London; for a time they lived in the same house. Every detail of their books was discussed between them, but Crowe did all the actual writing because Cavalcaselle's English was inadequate. Their prodigious output included <i>The Early Flemish Painters</i> (1857), <i>A New History of Painting in Italy</i> (3 vols., 1864&ndash;8), <i>A History of Painting in North Italy</i> (2 vols., 1871), <i>Titian: His Life and Times</i> (2 vols., 1877) and Raphael: <i>His Life and Works</i> (2 vols., 1882).

"Cubism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Cubism</b>.<div class=""content"">Movement in painting (and to a lesser extent sculpture) developed by <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Braque, Georges""><span class=""links"">Braque </span></a> from about 1907 to 1914 and recognized as one of the great turning points in Western art. They worked so closely during this period&mdash;‘like mountaineers roped together’ in Braque's memorable phrase&mdash;that at times it is difficult to differentiate their hands. Cubism made a radical break from the idea of art as the imitation of nature that had dominated European painting and sculpture since the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, for Picasso and Braque aimed to depict objects as they are known rather than as they appear at a particular moment and place. To this end they broke down the subjects they represented into a multiplicity of facets, rather than showing them from a single, fixed viewpoint, so many different aspects of the same object could be seen simultaneously. The two most important influences on the emergence of Cubism were African sculpture and the later paintings of <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a>. Picasso and Braque's work up to 1912 is generally called ‘Analytical’ Cubism; in this phase of the movement forms were analysed into predominantly geometrical structures and colour was extremely subdued. In a second phase, known as ‘Synthetic’ Cubism, colour became much stronger and shapes more decorative, and elements such as stencilled lettering and pieces of newspaper were introduced into paintings. Juan <a href=""entry://Gris, Juan""><span class=""links"">Gris </span></a> was as important as Braque or Picasso in this phase of Cubism and Fernand <a href=""entry://Léger, Fernand""><span class=""links"">Léger </span></a> is often reckoned the fourth great painter of the movement. The First World War brought an end to the collaboration of Braque and Picasso, but their work was immensely influential. Cubism, as well as being one of the principal sources of abstract art, was infinitely adaptable, giving birth to numerous other movements, among them <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Orphism""><span class=""links"">Orphism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Purism""><span class=""links"">Purism</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Vorticism""><span class=""links"">Vorticism</span></a>, and to personal reinterpretations such as that of Stuart <a href=""entry://Davis, Stuart""><span class=""links"">Davis </span></a>. Because it was concerned with depicting ideas rather than observed reality it has been one of the foundations of 20th-cent. aesthetic attitudes. Most of the prominent Cubist painters were also distinguished as graphic artists, and major sculptors who worked in a Cubist idiom included <a href=""entry://Archipenko, Alexander""><span class=""links"">Archipenko</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Lipchitz, Jacques""><span class=""links"">Lipchitz</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Zadkine, Ossip""><span class=""links"">Zadkine </span></a> (as well as Picasso himself)."

A number of artists, most of whom specialized in particular subjects, were retained by the firm to draw the lithographs in black and white; afterwards the prints were coloured by hand on a production-line system (one assistant to each colour) and sold cheaply to the public by agents, print-sellers, and pedlars.

"Curry, John Steuart","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Curry, John Steuart</b><div class=""content""><i>(1897&ndash;1946).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter. He was born on a farm in Kansas, and never forgot his Midwestern roots.

"Cuyp","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Cuyp </b>.<div class=""content"">The name of a family of Dutch painters of Dordrecht, of which three members gained distinction. <i>Jacob Gerritsz </i> . <i>Cuyp</i> (1594&ndash;1651/2) was the son of a glass painter and a pupil of Abraham <a href=""entry://Bloemaert, Abraham""><span class=""links"">Bloemaert </span></a> at Utrecht. He is thought of today mainly as a portrait painter&mdash;his portraits of children are particularly fine&mdash;but in old biographies is lauded principally for his views of the countryside around Dordrecht. <i>Benjamin Gerritsz </i> . <i>Cuyp</i> (1612&ndash;52) was the half-brother of Jacob. He is noted principally for paintings of biblical and <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes which use <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandtesque</span></a> light and shadow effects. <i>Aelbert Cuyp </i> (1620&ndash;91) is the most famous member of the family and now one of the most celebrated of all landscape painters, although he also painted many other subjects. He was the son and probably the pupil of Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp. His early works also show the influence of Jan van <a href=""entry://Goyen, Jan van""><span class=""links"">Goyen </span></a>. Aelbert was born and died at Dordrecht, but he seems to have travelled along Holland's great rivers to the eastern part of the Netherlands, and he also painted views of Westphalia. A prodigious number of pictures are ascribed to him, but his <i>œuvre</i> poses many problems. He often signed his paintings but rarely dated them, and a satisfactory chronology has never been established. Although he had little influence outside Dordrecht, Cuyp had several imitators there, and some of the paintings formerly attributed to him are now given to Abraham Calraet (1642&ndash;1722), who signed himself ‘AC’ (the same initials as Cuyp). In 1658 Cuyp married a rich widow, and in the 1660s he seems to have virtually abandoned painting. He was almost forgotten for two generations after his death. Late 18th-cent. English collectors are credited with rediscovering his merits, and he is still much better represented in English collections, public and private, than in Dutch museums (eleven examples in the NG, London, for example). His finest works&mdash;typically river scenes and landscapes with placid, dignified-looking cows&mdash;show great serenity and masterly handling of glowing light (usually Cuyp favoured the effects of the early morning or evening sun). He approaches <a href=""entry://Claude Gellée ""><span class=""links"">Claude</span></a> more closely in spirit than any of his countrymen who travelled to Italy."

"Cézanne, Paul","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Cézanne, Paul</b><div class=""content""><i>(1839&ndash;1906).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, with <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin</span></a> and van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a> the greatest of the <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionists</span></a> and a key figure in the development of 20th-cent. art. He was born at Aix-en-Provence, son of a hat dealer who became a prosperous banker, and his financial security enabled him to survive the indifference to his work that lasted until the final decade of his life. His school-fellow Émile Zola introduced him to <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Courbet, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Courbet </span></a>, and persuaded him to take up the study of art in Paris. There at the <a href=""entry://académie""><span class=""links"">Académie</span></a> Suisse in 1861 he met Camille <a href=""entry://Pissarro, Camille""><span class=""links"">Pissarro </span></a>, and the following year he got to know <a href=""entry://Monet, Claude""><span class=""links"">Monet </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Bazille, Frédéric""><span class=""links"">Bazille </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Sisley, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Sisley </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir </span></a>. His painting at this time was in a vein of unrestrained and uncouth <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a>, with a predilection for themes of violence or eroticism (<i>The Murder</i>, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). It was completely different from his mature work and gave little hint of greatness to come. In 1869 he met Hortense Fiquet, a model and seamstress, who became his mistress and bore him a son, Paul, in 1872. Cézanne kept them a secret from his family&mdash;he was terrified of his domineering father&mdash;but eventually married Hortense in 1886, shortly before his father's death. From about 1870 Cézanne started painting directly from nature and began to impose a more disciplined restraint on his natural impetuosity. In 1872 he settled in Auvers-sur-Oise, near Pontoise, the home of Camille Pissarro, and entered upon a long and fruitful association with him (in the last year of his life he even described himself as a ‘pupil of Pissarro’). He exhibited with the *Impressionists in 1874 and again in 1877, but never identified himself with the Impressionist group or wholly adopted their aims and techniques (he was a touchy character and hid his insecurities by posing as a provincial boor, once refusing to shake hands with the elegant <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a> because he claimed he had not washed for days and did not wish to dirty the great man). Cézanne was less interested in the realistic representation of casual and fleeting impressions and the fugitive effects of light, devoting himself rather to the structural analysis of nature, looking forward in this respect to the <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionists</span></a>. His own aims are summarized in two of his sayings: that it was his ambition ‘to do <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a> again, from Nature’ and that he wanted to make of Impressionism ‘something solid and enduring, like the art of the museums’. He trod a solitary and difficult path towards his goal of an art which would combine the best of the French <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> tradition of structure with the best in contemporary naturalism, an art which appealed not superficially to the eye but to the mind.<br class=""nLine"" />After the death of his father in 1886 and his inheritance of the family estate (the Jas de Bouffan, which features in many of his paintings), Cézanne lived mainly in Aix. He devoted himself principally to certain favourite themes&mdash;portraits of his wife, still lifes, and above all the landscape of Provence, particularly the Monte Ste Victoire. His painstaking analysis of nature differed fundamentally from Monet's exercises in painting repeated views of subjects such as <i>Haystacks or Poplars</i>. Cézanne was interested in underlying structure, and his paintings rarely give any obvious indication of the time of day or even the season represented. His later paintings are generally more sparsely composed and open, permeated with a sense of air and light. The third dimension is created not through perspective or foreshortening but by extraordinarily subtle variations of tonality. He worked in comparative obscurity until he was given a one-man show by the dealer <a href=""entry://Vollard, Ambroise""><span class=""links"">Vollard </span></a> in 1895. From that time his painting began to excite younger artists and by the end of the century he was revered as the ‘Sage’ by many of the avant-garde; in 1904 the <a href=""entry://Salon d'Automne""><span class=""links"">Salon d'Automne</span></a> gave him a special exhibition. Since his death his reputation has increased and he has exercised an enormous influence on 20th-cent. art, most notably on the development of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>. His work was introduced to England with the Post-Impressionist exhibitions organized by Roger <a href=""entry://Fry, Roger""><span class=""links"">Fry </span></a> in 1910 and 1912, and in 1914 Clive <a href=""entry://Bell, Clive""><span class=""links"">Bell </span></a> wrote that: ‘He was the Christopher Columbus of a new continent of form.’ The belief that the picture surface has an integrity of its own irrespective of what it represents&mdash;a characteristic of so much modern painting&mdash;stems directly from him.<br class=""nLine"" />Although Cézanne was a laboriously slow worker&mdash;he is said to have had over 100 sittings for a portrait of Ambroise Vollard (Petit Palais, Paris, 1899) before abandoning it with the comment that he was not displeased with the shirt front&mdash;he left a substantial body of work (drawings and watercolours as well as oils). There are works in many major museums, with particularly fine collections in, for example, the Courtauld Institute Galleries, London, the Musée d'Orsay, Paris, and the Barnes Foundation, Merion, Pennsylvania. His studio in Aix is now a Cézanne museum."
"Dada","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Dada</b>.<div class=""content"">A movement in European art (with manifestations also in New York), <i>c.</i>1915&ndash;<i>c.</i>1922, characterized by a spirit of anarchic revolt against traditional values. It arose from a mood of disillusionment engendered by the First World War, to which some artists reacted with irony, cynicism, and nihilism. According to the most frequently cited of several accounts of how the name (French for ‘hobby-horse’) originated, it was chosen by inserting a penknife at random in the pages of a dictionary, thus symbolizing the anti-rational stance of the movement. Those involved in it emphasized the illogical and the absurd, and exaggerated the role of chance in artistic creation. They went to extremes in the use of buffoonery and provocative behaviour to shock and disrupt public complacency (for an example see <a href=""entry://Ernst, Max""><span class=""links"">ERNST </span></a>). Dada did not involve a specific artistic style or aesthetic. The methods and manifestos&mdash;particularly the techniques of outrage and provocation&mdash;owed much to <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a>, but the movement lacked the militant optimism of Futurism. In painting, the <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a> techniques of <a href=""entry://collage""><span class=""links"">collage</span></a> and <a href=""entry://montage""><i><span class=""links"">montage</i></span></a> were adopted, but the archetypal Data forms of expression were perhaps the nonsense poem and the <a href=""entry://ready-made""><span class=""links"">readymade</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />European Dada was founded in 1915 in Zurich in neutral Switzerland by a group of artists and writers including Hans <a href=""entry://Arp, Jean""><span class=""links"">Arp </span></a>, the German painter, sculptor, and film-maker Hans Richter (1888&ndash;1976), and the Romanian poet Tristan Tzara (1896&ndash;1963). By the end of the war Dada was spreading to Germany, and there were significant Dada activities in three German cities: Berlin, Cologne, and Hanover. In Berlin the movement had a strong political dimension, expressed particularly through the brilliant <a href=""entry://photomontage""><span class=""links"">photomontages</span></a> of Raoul Hausmann (1886&ndash;1971) and John <a href=""entry://Heartfield, John""><span class=""links"">Heartfield </span></a> and through the biting social satire of <a href=""entry://Dix, Otto""><span class=""links"">Dix</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Grosz, George""><span class=""links"">Grosz</span></a>; eventually it gave way to <a href=""entry://Neue Sachlichkeit""><span class=""links"">Neue Sachlichkeit</span></a>. In Cologne a brief Dada movement (1919&ndash;20) was centred on Max Ernst, who made witty and provocative use of collage, and on Arp, who moved there from Zurich when the war ended. In Hanover Kurt <a href=""entry://Schwitters, Kurt""><span class=""links"">Schwitters </span></a> was the only important Dada exponent but one of the most dedicated of all.<br class=""nLine"" />Dada in New York arose independently of the European movement and virtually simultaneously.

Duchamp was the most influential of all exponents of Dada and Picabia was the most vigorous in promoting its ideas, forming a link between the European and American movements. He founded his Dada periodical 391 in Barcelona and he introduced the movement to Paris in 1919.

Although most of his work before the murder had been fairly conventional, he had begun to paint fairy and fantasy subjects and in the asylums he developed these along highly imaginative lines; <i>The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke</i> (Tate, London, 1855&ndash;64) is probably the best known.

<b>Dalí, Salvador</b><div class=""content""><i>(1904&ndash;89).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Spanish painter, sculptor, graphic artist, and designer. After passing through phases of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Metaphysical painting""><span class=""links"">Metaphysical painting</span></a>, he turned to <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a> and in 1929 moved to Paris. His talent for self-publicity rapidly made him the most famous representative of the movement. Throughout his life he cultivated eccentricity and exhibitionism (one of his most famous acts was appearing in a diving suit at the opening of the London Surrealist exhibition in 1936), claiming that this was the source of his creative energy. He took over the Surrealist theory of <a href=""entry://automatism""><span class=""links"">automatism</span></a> but transformed it into a more positive method which he named ‘critical paranoia’. According to this theory one should cultivate genuine delusion as in clinical paranoia while remaining residually aware at the back of one's mind that the control of the reason and will has been deliberately suspended. He claimed that this method should be used not only in artistic and poetical creation but also in the affairs of daily life. His paintings of the 1930s, which include several of the established classics of Surrealism, employed a meticulous academic technique that was contradicted by the unreal ‘dream’ space he depicted and by the strangely hallucinatory character of his imagery. He described such pictures as ‘hand-painted dream photographs’ and had certain favourite and recurring images, such as the human figure with half-open drawers protruding from it, burning giraffes, and watches bent and flowing as if made of melting wax (<i>The Persistence of Memory</i>, MOMA, New York, 1931). In the late 1930s Dalí made several visits to Italy and adopted a more traditional style; this together with his political views (he was a supporter of General Franco) led <a href=""entry://Breton, André""><span class=""links"">Breton </span></a> to expel him from the Surrealist ranks. He moved to the USA in 1940 and remained there until 1948. During this time he devoted himself largely to self-publicity and making money (Breton coined the near anagram for his name ‘Avida Dollars’). From 1948 he lived mainly at Port Lligat in Spain, but he also spent much time in Paris and New York. Among his late paintings the best known are probably those on religious themes (<i>The Crucifixion of St John of the Cross</i>, Glasgow Art Gallery, 1951), although sexual subjects and pictures centring on his wife Gala were also continuing preoccupations. In old age he became one of the world's most famous recluses, generating rumours and occasional scandals to the end.<br class=""nLine"" />Apart from painting, Dalí's output included sculpture, book illustration, jewellery design, and work for the theatre. In collaboration with the director Luis Buñuel he also made the first Surrealist films&mdash;<i>Un chien andalou</i> (1929) and <i>L'Age d'or</i> (1930)&mdash;and he contributed a dream sequence to Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Spellbound</i> (1945). He also wrote a novel, <i>Hidden Faces</i> (1944), and several volumes of flamboyant autobiography. Although he is undoubtedly one of the most famous artists of the 20th cent., his status is controversial; many critics consider that he did little if anything of consequence after his classic Surrealist works of the 1930s. There is a museum devoted to Dalí's work in Figueras, his home town in Spain, and there are two in the USA&mdash;in Cleveland, Ohio, and St Petersburg, Florida."

In about 1536 he moved to Rome, where he became a friend of <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> and one of his most gifted and individual followers. Michelangelo helped to gain him commissions and (as with <a href=""entry://Sebastiano del Piombo ""><span class=""links"">Sebastiano del Piombo </span></a>) supplied him with drawings to work from, but Daniele's finest picture owes little to the direct influence of the master. This is his fresco of the <i>Deposition</i> (commissioned 1541) in the Cappella Orsini in SS. Trinità dei Monti, a powerful and moving work, based compositionally on <a href=""entry://Rosso, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Rosso Fiorentino's </span></a> famous painting of the same subject in Volterra, but with an eloquent richness of its own.

Daniele was present at Michelangelo's deathbed and his most famous work of sculpture is a bronze bust of him based on the death mask (casts are in the Casa Buonarroti, Florence, the Louvre, and elsewhere). Ironically, in view of his devotion to the master, Daniele is perhaps best remembered for painting draperies over the nude figures in Michelangelo's <i>Last Judgement</i>, a concession to Counter-Reformation ideals that earned him the nickname ‘II Bragghettone’ (the breeches-maker)."

<b>Daumier, Honoré</b><div class=""content""><i>(1808&ndash;79).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French <a href=""entry://caricature""><span class=""links"">caricaturist</span></a>, painter, and sculptor. In his lifetime he was known chiefly as a political and social satirist, but since his death recognition of his qualities as a painter has grown. In 1830, after learning the still fairly new process of <a href=""entry://lithography""><span class=""links"">lithography</span></a>, he began to contribute political cartoons to the anti-government weekly <i>Caricature</i>. He was an ardent Republican and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment in 1832 for his attacks on Louis-Philippe, whom he represented as ‘Gargantua swallowing bags of gold extorted from the people’. On the suppression of political satire in 1835 he began to work for <i>Charivari</i> and turned to satire of social life, but at the time of the 1848 revolution he returned to political subjects. He is said to have made more than 4,000 lithographs, wishing each time that the one he had just made could be his last. In the last years of his life he was almost blind and was saved from destitution by <a href=""entry://Corot, Jean-Baptiste-Camille""><span class=""links"">Corot </span></a>. Daumier's paintings were probably done for the most part fairly late in his career. Although he was accepted four times by the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a>, he never exhibited his paintings otherwise and they remained practically unknown up to the time of an exhibition held at <a href=""entry://Durand-Ruel, Paul""><span class=""links"">Durand-Ruel's</span></a> gallery in 1878, the year before his death. The paintings are in the main a documentation of contemporary life and manners with satirical overtones, although he also did a number featuring Don Quixote as a larger-than-life hero. His technique was remarkably broad and free. As a sculptor he specialized in caricature heads and figures, and these too are in a very spontaneous style. In particular he created the memorable figure of ‘Ratapoil’ (meaning ‘skinned rat’), who embodied the sinister agents of the government of Louis Philippe. (A similar political type in his graphic art was ‘Robert Macaire’, who personified the unscrupulous profiteer and swindler.)<br class=""nLine"" />In the directness of his vision and the lack of sentimentality with which he depicts current social life Daumier belongs to the <a href=""entry://realism""><span class=""links"">Realist school</span></a> of which <a href=""entry://Courbet, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Courbet </span></a> was the chief representative. As a caricaturist he stands head and shoulders above all others of the 19th cent. He had the gift of expressing the whole character of a man through physiognomy, and the essence of his satire lay in his power to interpret mental folly in terms of physical absurdity. Although he never made a commercial success of his art, he was appreciated by the discriminating and numbered among his friends and admirers <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a>, Corot, <a href=""entry://Forain, Jean-Louis""><span class=""links"">Forain </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Baudelaire, Charles""><span class=""links"">Baudelaire </span></a>. <a href=""entry://Degas, Edgar""><span class=""links"">Degas </span></a> was among the artists who collected his works."

At this time the economic importance of Bruges was declining, but it still maintained its prestige as a centre of art and David played an important role in the flourishing export trade in paintings that it developed in the first quarter of the 16th cent. His work&mdash;extremely accomplished, but conservative and usually rather bland&mdash;was very popular and his stately compositions were copied again and again. Among his followers were <a href=""entry://Ysenbrandt ""><span class=""links"">Ysenbrandt</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Benson, Ambrosius""><span class=""links"">Benson</span></a>, who carried on his tradition until the middle of the 16th cent.

He had his first training with <a href=""entry://Boucher, François""><span class=""links"">Boucher </span></a>, a distant relative, but Boucher realized that their temperaments were opposed and sent David to <a href=""entry://Vien, Joseph-Marie""><span class=""links"">Vien </span></a>. David went to Italy with the latter in 1776, Vien having been appointed director of the French Academy at Rome, David having won the <a href=""entry://Prix de Rome""><span class=""links"">Prix de Rome</span></a>. In Italy David was able to indulge his bent for the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> and came into contact with the initiators of the new classical revival, including Gavin <a href=""entry://Hamilton, Gavin""><span class=""links"">Hamilton </span></a>. In 1780 he returned to Paris, and in the 1780s his position was firmly established as the embodiment of the social and moral reaction from the frivolity of the <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a>. His uncompromising subordination of colour to drawing and his economy of statement were in keeping with the new severity of taste. His themes gave expression to the new cult of the civic virtues of stoical self-sacrifice, devotion to duty, honesty, and austerity. Seldom have paintings so completely typified the sentiment of an age as David's <i>The Oath of the Horatii</i> (Louvre, Paris, 1784), <i>Brutus and his Dead Sons</i> (Louvre, 1789), and <i>The Death of Socrates</i> (Met. Mus., New York, 1787). They were received with acclamation by critics and public alike. <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a> compared the <i>Socrates</i> with <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo's</span></a> Sistine Ceiling and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael's</span></a> Stanze, and after ten visits to the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> described it as ‘in every sense perfect’.<br class=""nLine"" />David was in active sympathy with the Revolution; he served on various committees and voted for the execution of Louis XVI. His position was unchallenged as the painter of the Revolution. His three paintings of ‘martyrs of the Revolution’, though conceived as portraits, raised portraiture into the domain of universal tragedy. They were: <i>The Death of Lepeletier</i> (now known only from an engraving), <i>The Death of Marat</i> (Musées Royaux, Brussels, 1793), and <i>The Death of Bara</i> (Musée Calvet, Avignon, unfinished). After the fall of his friend Robespierre (1794), however, he was imprisoned, but was released on the plea of his wife, who had previously divorced him because of his Revolutionary sympathies (she was a royalist). They were remarried in 1796, and David's <i>Intervention of the Sabine Women</i> (Louvre, 1794&ndash;9), begun while he was in prison, is said to have been painted to honour her, its theme being one of love prevailing over conflict. It was also interpreted at the time, however, as a plea for conciliation in the civil strife that France suffered after the Revolution and it was the work that re-established David's fortunes and brought him to the attention of Napoleon, who appointed him his official painter.<br class=""nLine"" />David became an ardent supporter of Napoleon and retained under him the dominant social and artistic position which he had previously held. Between 1802 and 1807 he painted a series of pictures glorifying the exploits of the Emperor, among them the enormous <i>Coronation of Napoleon</i> (Louvre, 1805&ndash;7). These works show a change both in technique and in feeling from the earlier Republican works. The cold colours and severe composition of the heroic paintings gave place to a new feeling for pageantry which had something in common with <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic painting</span></a>, although he always remained opposed to the Romantic school. With the fall of Napoleon, David went into exile in Brussels, and his work weakened as the possibility of exerting a moral and social influence receded.

After this he began experimenting with a variety of modern idioms and in the 1920s he achieved a sophisticated grasp of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, but it was only after spending a year in Paris in 1928&ndash;9 that he forged a distinctive style. Using natural forms, particularly forms suggesting the characteristic environment of American life, he rearranged them into flat poster-like patterns with precise outlines and sharply contrasting colours (<i>House and Street</i>, Whitney Mus., New York, 1931). In this way he became the only major artist to treat the subject-matter of the <a href=""entry://American Scene painting""><span class=""links"">American Scene painters</span></a>&mdash;extraordinarily popular at the time&mdash;in avant-garde terms; he was both distinctly American and distinctively modern&mdash;a rare combination that won him wide admiration. Later he went over to more purely abstract patterns, into which he often introduced lettering, suggestions of advertisements, posters, etc. (<i>Owh! in San Pao</i>, Whitney Mus., 1951). The zest and dynamism of such works reflect his interest in jazz. However abstract his work became he always claimed that every image he used had its source in observed reality: ‘I paint what I see in America, in other words I paint the American Scene.’ Davis was one of the outstanding American painters of the 20th cent. and an important link between the pioneering avant-garde artists of the Armory Show generation and the triumphant New York art scene of the post-war years.

He went to America as a stowaway in 1926 and the following year settled in New York. His early work was conservative, but in 1929 he met Arshile <a href=""entry://Gorky, Arshile""><span class=""links"">Gorky </span></a>, who became one of his closest friends and introduced him to avant-garde circles. During the 1930s and 1940s he experimented vigorously and by the time of his first one-man show in 1948 (at the Egan Gallery, New York) he was painting in an extremely energetic abstract style (often in black and white) close to that of Jackson <a href=""entry://Pollock, Jackson""><span class=""links"">Pollock </span></a>. The exhibition established his reputation (although prosperity was still some years away) and after it he was generally regarded as sharing with Pollock the unofficial leadership of the Abstract Expressionist group. Unlike Pollock, de Kooning usually retained some suggestion of figuration in his work, and in 1953 he caused a sensation when his <i>Women</i> series (<i>Women nos I&ndash;VI</i>) was exhibited at his third one-man show, at the Sidney <a href=""entry://Janis, Sidney""><span class=""links"">Janis</span></a> gallery. <i>Woman I</i> (MOMA, New York, 1950&ndash;2), with its grotesque leer and frenzied brushwork, shocked the public and dismayed those critics who believed in a rigorously abstract art. One of these was Clement <a href=""entry://Greenberg, Clement""><span class=""links"">Greenberg</span></a>, but New York's other most influential critic of avant-garde art&mdash;Harold <a href=""entry://Rosenberg, Harold""><span class=""links"">Rosenberg </span></a>&mdash;supported de Kooning . <i>Woman I</i> became one of the most reproduced paintings in the USA and de Kooning was enormously influential on young painters at this time. By the end of the 1950s, however, he was beginning to be regarded as an elder statesman whose best days as a creative force were past. From the 1960s he had honours heaped on him. His paintings continued to mix abstract and semifigurative work and in 1969 he began making sculpture&mdash;figures modelled in clay and later cast in bronze. He continued working well into his eighties, until he was incapacitated by Alzheimer's disease.<br class=""nLine"" />His wife, <i>Elaine de Kooning </i> (1918&ndash;89), was also a painter, notably of <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionist</span></a> portraits, and a writer on art.

He also recognized the value of genius, imagination, and ‘enthusiasm’ against the excessive domination of formalized rule.

<b>Degas, Edgar</b><div class=""content""><i>(1834&ndash;1917).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, graphic artist, and sculptor. He was the son of a wealthy art-loving banker (the family name was originally de Gas, but Degas adopted the less pretentious form) and was initially trained for the law. In 1855, however, he entered the École des <a href=""entry://Beaux-Arts, École Nationale Supérieure des""><span class=""links"">Beaux-Arts</span></a> and studied under Louis Lamothe (1822&ndash;69), a pupil and admirer of <a href=""entry://Ingres, Jean-Auguste-Dominique""><span class=""links"">Ingres</span></a>, who laid the foundation of Degas's superb draughtsmanship. His real artistic education, however, was gained through assiduous study of the Old Masters, and between 1854 and 1859 he spent much of his time in Italy. Most of his early works were portraits or history paintings on classical themes (<i>Young Spartans</i>, NG, London). In 1861 Degas met <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet</span></a> while copying a <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez </span></a> in the Louvre and was introduced by him to the circle of the young <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>. During the next few years he abandoned historical pictures and turned to contemporary subjects, with a special predilection for racing scenes, ballet, theatre, circus, rehearsals, café scenes, and laundresses. Degas exhibited in seven out of the eight Impressionist exhibitions and is regarded as one of the prominent members of the Impressionist School. He was, however, Impressionist only in certain restricted aspects of his work and like Manet (who also came from an upper-middle-class background) stood somewhat aloof from the rest of the group. He had little interest in landscape and therefore did not share the Impressionist concern for rendering the effects of changing light and atmosphere. He was more interested in draughtsmanship than most of the others and&mdash;apart from Manet&mdash;he alone had a thoroughly academic background. As with the other Impressionists, he liked to give the suggestion of accidental, spontaneous, and unplanned scenes, and Degas's pictures often cut off figures in the manner of a badly executed snapshot or used unfamiliar viewpoints. Like them he was influenced by the new techniques of photography and by Japanese colour prints (see <a href=""entry://Ukiyo-e""><i><span class=""links"">UKIYO-E</i></span></a>) and he was interested in conveying the impression of movement. But he did not paint out of doors or directly from nature. The appearance of spontaneity and accidental effects was an appearance only; in reality his pictures were carefully composed. ‘Even when working from nature, one has to compose’, he said, and ‘No art was ever less spontaneous than mine’.<br class=""nLine"" />Degas always worked much in <a href=""entry://pastel""><span class=""links"">pastel</span></a> and when his sight began to fail in the 1880s his preference for this medium increased. His colours grew stronger and his compositions more simplified. He was a restless experimenter, mixing tempera and pastel, for example, and using a technique called <i>peinture à l'essence</i>, in which pigment from which the oil has been removed is thinned with turpentine to promote rapid drying. From 1880 Degas also modelled in wax, but he exhibited only one sculpture in his lifetime, the famous <i>Little Fourteen-year-old Dancer</i> (1881) dressed in a real tutu (it was cast in bronze after his death; one cast is in the Tate, London). During the 1890s, as his fears of failing sight increased, he devoted more time to modelling, doing mostly horses in action, women at their toilet, or nude dancers in characteristic postures. These also were cast after his death. For the last twenty years of his life Degas was virtually blind and lived a reclusive life. He was a formidable personality and his complete devotion to his art made him seem cold and aloof. His genius compelled universal respect among other artists, however; <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir</span></a> ranked him above <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a> as a sculptor, and in 1883 Camille <a href=""entry://Pissarro, Camille""><span class=""links"">Pissarro </span></a> wrote that he was ‘certainly the greatest artist of our epoch’. He was the first of the Impressionist group to achieve recognition and his reputation as one of the giants of 19th-cent. art has endured undiminished."
"degenerate art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>degenerate art</b>.<div class=""content"">A term coined in Germany in the 1930s to discredit all contemporary art that did not correspond to the ideology of the Nazi party. Adolf Hitler and Alfred Rosenberg (the chief theoretical spokesman of Nazism) linked art with political doctrines and racial theories, attacking modern art as ‘political and cultural anarchy’. Nazi-approved art was thoroughly traditional in concept and technique and took as its subject-matter themes (often militaristic) that glorified Hitler and his ideals of Aryan supremacy. Hitler made his first speech against ‘degenerate art’ (in German <i>entartete Kunst</i>) at Nuremberg in 1934, and a series of exhibitions designed to ridicule modern art culminated in an infamous show (also called Entartete Kunst) that opened in Munich in 1937 and then went on tour round Germany. The works on display were confiscated from German museums and were mocked by being shown alongside pictures done by inmates of lunatic asylums. Among the artists included were some of the giants of modern art&mdash;<a href=""entry://Beckmann, Max""><span class=""links"">Beckmann </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Dix, Otto""><span class=""links"">Dix </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Grosz, George""><span class=""links"">Grosz </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Kandinsky, Wassily""><span class=""links"">Kandinsky </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Mondrian, Piet""><span class=""links"">Mondrian </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>, for example. As a propaganda exercise the exhibition was a huge success, more than two million people visiting it in Munich alone. German artists whose work was declared ‘degenerate’ were forbidden to exhibit or even to work, and people who sympathized with modern art were deprived of their posts in museums and teaching posts. Some of the confiscated works were sold at auction, Nazi officials helped themselves to others, and the ‘unsaleable stock’ is said to have been burnt in Berlin."

<b>Delacroix, Eugène</b><div class=""content""><i>(1798&ndash;1863).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The greatest French painter of the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> movement. He was the son of a politician, Charles Delacroix, but there is some evidence to indicate that his real father was the diplomat Talleyrand, a friend of the family. His mother, Victoire Oeben, came of a family of notable craftsmen and designers. In 1816 Delacroix entered the studio of Pierre <a href=""entry://Guérin, Pierre-Narcisse""><span class=""links"">Guérin </span></a>, who had earlier taught <a href=""entry://Géricault, Théodore""><span class=""links"">Géricault</span></a>. His basic artistic education was obtained, however, by copying Old Masters at the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a>, where he delighted in <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a> and the Venetian School. He met <a href=""entry://Bonington, Richard Parkes""><span class=""links"">Bonington </span></a> in the Louvre and was introduced by him to English <a href=""entry://watercolour""><span class=""links"">watercolour</span></a> painting. <a href=""entry://Constable, John""><span class=""links"">Constable's</span></a>
<i>Hay Wain</i>, exhibited in the 1824 <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a>, also made a great impression on him and in 1825 he spent some months in England, admiring in particular <a href=""entry://Gainsborough, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Gainsborough </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Lawrence, Sir Thomas""><span class=""links"">Lawrence </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Etty, William""><span class=""links"">Etty </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Wilkie, Sir David""><span class=""links"">Wilkie </span></a>. In the Salon of 1822 he had his first public success with <i>The Barque of Dante</i> (Louvre, Paris). It was bought by the State (with Talleyrand perhaps pulling strings in the background), as was <i>The Massacre at Chios</i> (Louvre) two years later, ensuring the success of his career. <a href=""entry://Gros, Antoine-Jean""><span class=""links"">Gros</span></a> called this painting ‘the massacre of painting’, but <a href=""entry://Baudelaire, Charles""><span class=""links"">Baudelaire </span></a> wrote that it was ‘a terrifying hymn in honour of doom and irremediable suffering’. In 1832 Delacroix visited Morocco in the entourage of the Comte de Mornay and there acquired a fund of rich and exotic visual imagery which he exploited to the full in his later work (<i>Sultan of Morocco</i>, Musée, Toulouse, 1845). From the late 1830s his style and technique underwent a change. In place of luminous glazes and contrasted values he began to use a personal technique of vibrating adjacent tones and <a href=""entry://divisionism""><span class=""links"">divisionist</span></a> colour effects in a manner of which <a href=""entry://Watteau, Jean-Antoine""><span class=""links"">Watteau </span></a> had been a master, making colour enter into the structure of the picture to an extent which had not previously been attempted. In spite of being hailed as the leader of the Romantic movement, his predilection for exotic and emotionally charged subject-matter, and his open enmity with <a href=""entry://Ingres, Jean-Auguste-Dominique""><span class=""links"">Ingres </span></a>, Delacroix always claimed allegiance to the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical tradition</span></a>, and for his large works followed the traditional course of making numerous preparatory drawings. In his later career he became one of the most distinguished monumental mural painters in the history of French art. His public commissions included decorations in several major buildings in Paris: Palais Bourbon (Salon du roi, 1833&ndash;7; Library, 1838&ndash;47); the Library of the Luxembourg Palace (1841&ndash;6); and three paintings in the Chapelle des Anges of S. Sulpice (1853&ndash;61). In the last of these, his <i>Jacob and the Angel</i> and <i>Heliodorus Expelled from the Temple</i> are among the maturest expressions of his decorative richness of colour and grandiose structural integration. Baudelaire said of him that he was the only artist who ‘in our faithless generation conceived religious pictures’ and van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a> wrote, ‘only <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt</span></a> and Delacroix could paint the face of Christ.’<br class=""nLine"" />Delacroix's output was enormous. After his death his executors found more than 9,000 paintings, pastels, and drawings in his studio and he prided himself on the speed at which he worked, declaring ‘If you are not skilful enough to sketch a man falling out of a window during the time it takes him to get from the fifth storey to the ground, then you will never be able to produce monumental work.’ Among great painters he was also one of the finest writers on art. He was a voluminous letter writer and kept a journal from 1822 to 1824 and again from 1847 until his death&mdash;a marvellously rich source of information and opinion on his life and times. His influence, particularly through his use of colour, was prodigious, inspiring <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Seurat, Georges""><span class=""links"">Seurat</span></a>, and van Gogh among others.

<b>Delaunay, Robert</b><div class=""content""><i>(1885&ndash;1941).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, who from about 1906 devoted most of his career to experiments with the abstract qualities of colour. He began his researches from the <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionist</span></a> theories of <a href=""entry://Seurat, Georges""><span class=""links"">Seurat</span></a>, but instead of using the <a href=""entry://pointillism""><span class=""links"">pointillist technique</span></a> he investigated the interaction of large areas of juxtaposed and contrasting colour. He was particularly interested in the interconnections between colour and movement. By 1910 he was making an individual contribution to <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, notably with his series of paintings of the Eiffel Tower, which combine fragmented forms with vibrant colour. <a href=""entry://Apollinaire, Guillaume""><span class=""links"">Apollinaire</span></a> gave the name <a href=""entry://Orphism""><span class=""links"">Orphism</span></a> to Delaunay's work, which by 1912 had moved on to become completely abstract, as in his lyrically beautiful <i>Circular Forms</i> series (an example is in the Kunsthaus in Zurich). In 1913 Delaunay exhibited at the galleries of Der <a href=""entry://Sturm, Der""><span class=""links"">Sturm</span></a> in Berlin, and his work was a major influence on German <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionists</span></a> such as <a href=""entry://Klee, Paul""><span class=""links"">Klee </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Macke, August""><span class=""links"">Macke </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Marc, Franz""><span class=""links"">Marc </span></a>. It also powerfully affected the <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurists</span></a> in Italy and the American <a href=""entry://Synchromism""><span class=""links"">Synchromists</span></a>. Delaunay was notoriously competitive and fully aware of the importance of his work; at about this time he drew up a list of all the artists, however minor, he thought he had influenced. The period of his greatest achievements was, however, fairly short-lived; he lived in Spain and Portugal during the First World War and after his return to Paris in 1920 his work lost its inspirational quality and became rather repetitive. His home became a meeting place for <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada</span></a> artists, but he continued with work related to colour theories."

<b>Delvaux, Paul</b><div class=""content""><i>(1897&ndash;1994).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Belgian painter. After working in <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionist</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionist manners</span></a>, he discovered <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a> in 1934 and became an instant convert, destroying much of his earlier work. He was never formally a member of the movement, and was not in sympathy with its political aims, but he became regarded as one of the foremost upholders of its tradition. Most of his paintings show nude or semi-nude women in incongruous settings. The women are always of the same type&mdash;beautiful, statuesque, unattainable dream figures, lost in thought or reverie or even in a state of suspended animation. These dream beauties are often placed in elaborate architectural settings, reflecting both <a href=""entry://Chirico, Giorgio de""><span class=""links"">de Chirico's </span></a> strange perspectives and Delvaux's interest in the buildings of ancient Rome (he visited Italy in 1938 and 1939). Sometimes he included skeletons in his pictures (influenced by <a href=""entry://Ensor, James""><span class=""links"">Ensor </span></a>) and trains were another recurrent motif. A large retrospective of Delvaux's work was held at the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, in 1944, and this marked the beginning of his international reputation."
"Demuth, Charles","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Demuth, Charles</b><div class=""content""><i>(1883&ndash;1935).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter and illustrator. He made visits to Europe in 1904, 1907&ndash;8, and 1912&ndash;14, staying mainly in Paris, and during the last of these visits he became seriously interested in avant-garde art, particularly <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>. Its influence was felt in his paintings of architectural subjects from about 1916 and he became one of the leading exponents of <a href=""entry://Precisionism""><span class=""links"">Precisionism</span></a>. His most personal paintings are what he called ‘poster portraits’ (pictures composed of words and objects associated with the person ‘represented’) The most famous example is <i>I Saw The Figure Five in Gold</i> (Met. Mus., New York, 1928), a tribute to the poet William Carlos Williams and named after one of his poems. Demuth was lame from childhood and in the last decade of his life was debilitated by diabetes. Often he worked on a small scale in watercolour, rather than in more physically demanding media. The fastidious taste and concentrated energy of his work are suggested by his comment: ‘John <a href=""entry://Marin, John""><span class=""links"">Marin </span></a> [another great American watercolourist] and I drew our inspiration from the same source, French modernism. He brought his up in buckets and spilt much along the way. I dipped mine out with a teaspoon, but I never spilled a drop.’"

<b>Denis, Maurice</b><div class=""content""><i>(1870&ndash;1943).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, designer, and writer on art theory. Early in his career he was a <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolist</span></a> and a member of the <a href=""entry://Nabis""><span class=""links"">Nabis</span></a>. In his article <i>Definition of Neo-Traditionalism</i> (1890), he made a famous pronouncement on art, which has often been regarded as the key to contemporary aesthetics of painting: ‘Remember that a picture&mdash;before being a war horse or a nude woman or an anecdote&mdash;is essentially a flat surface covered with colours assembled in a certain order.’ His early work did indeed put great emphasis on flat patterning, but he was also very much concerned with subject-matter, for he was a devout Catholic and set himself to revive religious painting. In 1917 he did frescos for the church of St Paul in Geneva, and he also designed stained glass and church furnishings. His writings on art are for the most part collected in <i>Théories</i> (1912) and <i>Nouvelles Théories</i> (1922). In 1939 he published a history of religious art."
"Derain, André","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Derain, André</b><div class=""content""><i>(1880&ndash;1954).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, sculptor, graphic artist, and theatrical designer. In the first two decades of the 20th cent. he was near the centre of avant-garde developments in Paris: he was one of the creators of <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauvism</span></a>, an early adherent of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, and one of the first to ‘discover’ <a href=""entry://primitive""><span class=""links"">primitive</span></a> art. However, his later works, mainly landscapes, portraits, still lifes, and nudes, were increasingly based on the Old Masters. He also produced numerous book illustrations and designed for the stage, notably for <a href=""entry://Diaghilev, Sergei""><span class=""links"">Diaghilev's </span></a>
<i>Ballets Russes</i>. Although his historical significance is undeniable, there is disagreement about his standing as an artist. John Canaday (<i>Mainstreams of Modern Art</i>, 1959) writes: ‘His detractors think of him as a parasite on both the past and the present, but
some critics award Derain unique status as the only twentieth-century painter to achieve an individual compound of the great tradition of French culture as a whole with the spirit of his own time
This opinion is particularly held in France&mdash;where, of course, it is most legitimate.’"
"Desiderio da Settignano","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Desiderio da Settignano </b><div class=""content""><i>(1428/31&ndash;64).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine sculptor. Like most of his contemporaries he formed his style on <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello's </span></a> work of the 1430s. He learnt from Donatello the practice of carving in very low <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a>, and the lively, thick-set figures of children on the <i>Singing Gallery</i> made by Donatello for Florence Cathedral (1433&ndash;9) provided models for Desiderio's own reliefs of the <i>Madonna and Child</i>. Desiderio's artistic personality, however, was more delicate than Donatello's, and for refinement of handling he is unsurpassed by any Italian sculptor of his period. His only important public work was the tomb of the Florentine humanist and statesman Gregorio Marsuppini in Sta Croce (after 1453). This is architecturally dependent on the tomb of Leonardo Bruni by Bernardino <a href=""entry://Rossellino, Bernardo""><span class=""links"">Rossellino </span></a> (probably Desiderio's teacher), executed for the same church about ten years earlier, but is sculpturally richer and more animated. His sensitive modelling is best exemplified in his portrait busts of women, good examples of which are in Florence (Bargello) and Washington (NG)."

<b>Despiau, Charles</b><div class=""content""><i>(1874&ndash;1946).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French sculptor, one of <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin's </span></a> assistants from 1907 to 1914. After this he turned from his master's intense, vigorous style to a more static, generalized manner which had affinities with that of <a href=""entry://Maillol, Aristide""><span class=""links"">Maillol </span></a>. His best-known works are his portrait busts, with their intimate delineation of character (<i>Head of Madame Derain</i>, Philips Collection, Washington, 1922). He also made several monuments. In the 1920s and 1930s his reputation stood very high in France, but at the end of his life he was ostracized because of his friendship with the Nazi sculptor Arno Breker (1900&ndash;91); they had known each other since before the war and in 1942 Despiau attended an exhibition of the German's work in occupied Paris."

<b>Desportes, Alexandre-François</b><div class=""content""><i>(1661&ndash;1743).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter of dogs, game, and emblems of the chase. In his early career he worked much as a portraitist, notably in 1695&ndash;6 at the court of Jan Sobieski (John III) in Poland, but on his return to France he took up hunting subjects and won the patronage of Louis XIV and Louis XV. He achieved considerable celebrity (he was well received on a visit to England in 1712) and in his field was rivalled only by <a href=""entry://Oudry, Jean-Baptiste""><span class=""links"">Oudry </span></a>. Although he continued the lavish Flemish tradition exemplified by <a href=""entry://Snyders, Frans""><span class=""links"">Snyders </span></a>, Desportes was among the first artists of the 18th cent. to make landscape studies from nature for his backgrounds, and because of this he was considered eccentric.

Deutsch was one of the outstanding Swiss artists of his period, but much of his energy was expended in other activities. He fought as a mercenary in Italy and took an active part in the political and religious affairs of Berne as a passionate supporter of the Reformation, writing satires against the Pope, whom he equated with Antichrist. His paintings are related to <a href=""entry://Baldung Grien, Hans""><span class=""links"">Baldung Grien </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Grünewald, Mathis""><span class=""links"">Grünewald </span></a> in their love of the grotesque (<i>The Temptation of St Anthony</i>, Kunstmuseum, Berne, 1520).

In 1849 he ‘discovered’ Elizabeth Siddal, the archetypal Pre-Raphaelite model and Rossetti's future wife. Deverell was noted for his good looks and charm and Elizabeth was probably in love with him before he died aged 26 from Bright's disease. In his brief career he gave promise of becoming perhaps the most painterly of the Pre-Raphaelite followers (<i>A Pet</i>, Tate Gallery, London, 1853)."
"Devis, Arthur","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Devis, Arthur</b><div class=""content""><i>(1711&ndash;87).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, the best-known member of a family of artists. He was one of the first specialists in the small <a href=""entry://conversation piece""><span class=""links"">conversation piece</span></a> and also painted single portraits of similar scale. The sitters are usually in repose, often somewhat artificially posed, and the Devis type of portrait group was animated in the next generation by <a href=""entry://Zoffany, Johann""><span class=""links"">Zoffany </span></a>. Devis was a minor figure in his day and virtually forgotten until the 1930s, but since then his work has attained considerable popularity because of the doll-like charm of his figures and the delicate detail of his settings. It has also become of interest to social historians, as most of his clients were from the newly prosperous middle class. A small representative collection of his work is in the Art Gallery at Preston, his native town. He worked both in London and in Lancashire. <i>Anthony</i> (1729&ndash;1816), his half-brother, was a landscape painter. Arthur's son, <i>Arthur William </i> (1763&ndash;1822), spent the years 1785&ndash;95 in India, where he painted portraits and a series of pictures representing the arts, manufactures, and agriculture of Bengal (two examples are in the Ashmolean, Oxford), which were engraved. He lived in London from 1795, working mainly as a portraitist, but also painting <i>The Death of Nelson</i> (Nat. Maritime Mus., London, <i>c.</i>1806). Another son, <i>Thomas Anthony </i> (1757&ndash;1810), painted undistinguished portraits and <a href=""entry://fancy picture""><span class=""links"">fancy pictures</span></a>.

<b>Diaghilev, Sergei</b><div class=""content""><i>(1872&ndash;1929).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Russian impresario, famous above all as the founder of the <i>Ballets Russes</i>, through which he exerted great influence on the visual arts as well as on dancing and music. From 1890 to 1896 he studied law in St Petersburg, where he became part of a circle of musicians, painters, and writers including Léon <a href=""entry://Bakst, Léon""><span class=""links"">Bakst </span></a> and Alexander <a href=""entry://Benois, Alexandre""><span class=""links"">Benois </span></a>. In 1899 he founded the magazine <i><a href=""entry://World of Art""><span class=""links"">World of Art</i></a></span>, with the object of interchanging artistic ideas with Western Europe. When it ceased publication in 1904 he concentrated for a while on organizing exhibitions, including one of Russian painting at the 1905 <a href=""entry://Salon d'Automne""><span class=""links"">Salon d'Automne</span></a> in Paris&mdash;the most comprehensive to have been seen in the West up to that time. In 1907 he organized a series of concerts of Russian music in Paris, and in 1909 he brought a ballet company for the first time (this is usually described as the <i>Ballets Russes</i>, but the name was first used in 1911). The company was a sensational success, as much for the exotic designs of Bakst as for the music and choreography (the dancers included Nijinsky and Pavlova). For the next two decades, until his death in 1929, Diaghilev toured Europe and America with his ballet (he never returned to Russia after the 1917 Revolution and Paris was the main centre of his operations). He was often on the verge of bankruptcy, but he had a remarkable flair for spotting young talent and for integrating various interests and people, enabling him to bring together as his collaborators some of the foremost artistic personalities of his time; the painters who designed sets and costumes for him included <a href=""entry://Braque, Georges""><span class=""links"">Braque </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Chirico, Giorgio de""><span class=""links"">de Chirico </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Derain, André""><span class=""links"">Derain </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>."

His style is distinct from that of his Barbizon colleagues, however, for his work lacks the sense of quiet communion with nature that was a characteristic feature of the school and his brushwork is heavy and restless (his detractors call it turgid). He never lost the Romantic leanings of his youth, and continued to paint mythological pictures (typically featuring nymphs) throughout his career. He was helpful to the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir</span></a> stated that his meeting with Diaz led him to lighten his palette."

<b>Dickinson, Edwin</b><div class=""content""><i>(1891&ndash;1978).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter. He often treated enigmatic or disquieting subject-matter and he has been described as ‘perhaps the first American artist about whom some knowledge of dream theory is essential for decoding his works’ (Matthew Baigell, <i>A Concise History of American Painting and Sculpture</i>, 1984). His personal symbolism is seen at its most disturbing and provocative in his self-portraits, in which he sometimes depicted himself as dead. He is best known, however, for large compositions such as <i>The Fossil Hunters</i> (Whitney Museum, New York, 1926&ndash;8). Dickinson often worked on his big pictures for a number of years and said that they were never ‘really finished’. He has been called a <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealist</span></a> and also seen as a sophisticated culmination of the 19th-cent. <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> tradition."

Notable precursors of divisionism were <a href=""entry://Watteau, Jean-Antoine""><span class=""links"">Watteau </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a>. It was also employed empirically by the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>, but it was not developed systematically and scientifically until <a href=""entry://Seurat, Georges""><span class=""links"">Seurat</span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionists</span></a>. Seurat (in common with other contemporaries) spoke of an ‘optical mixture’, but (contrary to what is usually stated) the dots do not really fuse in the viewer's eye to make different colours, for they remain visible as dots. Rather, they seem to vibrate, creating something of the shimmering effect experienced in strong sunlight. The effect is noted in Ogden Rood's <i>Modern Chromatics</i> (1879), a treatise on colour theory well known to Seurat. Camille <a href=""entry://Pissarro, Camille""><span class=""links"">Pissarro </span></a>, who was closely associated with Seurat at this time, said that the optimum viewing distance for a picture painted by the divisionist method was three times the diagonal measurement. The terms divisionism and <a href=""entry://pointillism""><span class=""links"">pointillism</span></a> are not always clearly differentiated, but whereas divisionism refers mainly to the underlying theory, pointillism describes the actual painting technique associated with Seurat and his followers. ‘Divisionism’ (usually with a capital ‘D’) was also the name of an Italian movement, a version of <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionism</span></a>, that flourished in the last decade of the 19th cent. and the first decade of the 20th cent. It was one of the sources of <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a>."

<b>Dix, Otto</b><div class=""content""><i>(1891&ndash;1969).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German painter and printmaker.

H. Hamilton (<i>Painting and Sculpture in Europe</i>, 1880&ndash;1940, 1967) as ‘perhaps the most powerful as well as the most unpleasant anti-war statements in modern art’. Another favourite theme was prostitution and he was a brilliantly incisive portraitist (<i>Sylvia von Harden</i>, Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, 1926). In 1927 he was appointed a teacher at the Dresden Academy, but his anti-military stance drew the wrath of the Nazi regime and he was dismissed from his academic posts in 1933 and his work declared <a href=""entry://degenerate art""><span class=""links"">degenerate</span></a>. He went to live quietly in the country near Lake Constance and painted traditional landscapes, yet he still aroused suspicion; in 1939 he was arrested on a charge of complicity in a plot on Hitler's life, but was soon released. He was conscripted into the <i>Volkssturm</i> (Home Guard) in 1945 and was a prisoner in France 1945&ndash;6; he then returned to Lake Constance. His work after the war lost much of the strength of his great Neue Sachlichkeit period and much of it was inspired by religious mysticism."

His work reveals the broad artistic education he gained on his travels in Europe, and his rich textures and colours, show, in particular, a debt to the <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> of Chaïm <a href=""entry://Soutine, Chaïm""><span class=""links"">Soutine </span></a>. In 1943/4 he won the Archibald Prize for portraiture, awarded annually by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, with a portrait of his fellow-artist, Joshua Smith. The award, which was contested in the courts by two of the unsuccessful competitors on the grounds that it was not a portrait but a caricature, created a <i>cause célèbre</i> for modernism in Australia and Dobell (who won the case) became a household name. In 1949 and again in 1950 he visited the highlands of New Guinea, and as a result of this experience his work became broader in execution and more decorative. Dobell was unique among Australian artists in combining successfully a mastery of <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> tradition (particularly in portraiture) with a profound insight into the character and values of 20th-cent.

"Dobson, Frank","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Dobson, Frank</b><div class=""content""><i>(1886&ndash;1963).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British sculptor. His early work consisted mainly of paintings, the few surviving examples showing how impressed he was by the <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionist</span></a> exhibitions organized by Roger <a href=""entry://Fry, Roger""><span class=""links"">Fry </span></a>. After the First World War (when he was on active service with the Artists' Rifles), he turned increasingly to sculpture, and in the 1920s and 1930s gained an outstanding reputation: in 1925 Roger Fry described his work as ‘true sculpture and pure sculpture
almost the first time that such a thing has been even attempted in England’. He worked in both metal and stone (he was one of the earliest to revive direct carving) and his sophisticated stylizations made him one of the pioneers of modern British sculpture. The monumental dignity of his work was in the classical tradition of <a href=""entry://Maillol, Aristide""><span class=""links"">Maillol </span></a>, and like him Dobson found the female nude the most satisfactory subject for three-dimensional composition, as in <i>Cornucopia</i> (University of Hull, 1925&ndash;7), described by Clive <a href=""entry://Bell, Clive""><span class=""links"">Bell </span></a> as ‘the finest piece of sculpture by an Englishman since&mdash;I don't know when’. He was also outstanding as a portrait sculptor, as witness his head of Sir Osbert Sitwell in polished brass (Tate, London, 1923). His craftsmanship was superb and he played an important role as a liberal-minded and kind-hearted teacher at the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a>, where he was Professor of Sculpture, 1946&ndash;53. With the rise of a younger generation led by Henry <a href=""entry://Moore, Henry""><span class=""links"">Moore </span></a>, however, Dobson's prestige as an artist dropped and he was regarded as ‘dated’; the memorial exhibition of his work organized by the Arts Council in 1966 was not well received. Since then he has again been recognized as one of the outstanding figures in 20th-cent. British sculpture."

<b>Dobson, William</b><div class=""content""><i>(1611&ndash;46).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English portrait painter. He is regarded as the most accomplished English painter before <a href=""entry://Hogarth, William""><span class=""links"">Hogarth </span></a>, and was described by John Aubrey in his <i>Brief Lives</i> (<i>c.</i>1690) as ‘the most excellent painter that England hath yet bred’. Some sixty paintings by him are known, all from the years 1642&ndash;6, when he was painter to the wartime court at Oxford. He is thought to have returned to London after the surrender of Oxford in 1646. Said to have been ‘somewhat loose and irregular in his way of living’, he was thrown into prison for debt, and his early death followed shortly after his release. His style is superficially similar to van <a href=""entry://Dyck, Sir Anthony van""><span class=""links"">Dyck's </span></a>, but his colouring is richer and his paint texture rougher, very much in the Venetian tradition. He also had an uncompromisingly direct way of presenting character (as in his most celebrated work&mdash;<i>Endymion Porter</i>, Tate, London) that is considered quintessentially English. Various paintings by Dobson other than portraits are mentioned by early writers, but only two survive: <i>The Executioner with the Baptist's Head</i> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool); and an allegory, <i>The Civil Wars of France</i> (Rousham House, Oxfordshire)."

In 1917 he founded the association of artists called De <a href=""entry://Stijl, De""><span class=""links"">Stijl</span></a> and the periodical of the same name, and for the remainder of his life the propagation of the ideas of the group and its austerely geometrical style was his dominant interest.

In 1930 he moved to Paris and built himself a studio at Meudon that became a new focus of the De Stijl movement.

<b>Domenichino </b>
<i>(Domenico Zampieri )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1581&ndash;1641).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Bolognese painter. He was Annibale <a href=""entry://Carracci""><span class=""links"">Carracci's </span></a> favourite pupil and one of the most important upholders of the tradition of Bolognese <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classicism</span></a>. After studying with <a href=""entry://Calvaert, Denys""><span class=""links"">Calvaert</span></a> and Ludovico Carracci he went to Rome (1602) and joined the colony of artists working under Annibale Carracci at the Palazzo <i><a href=""entry://Farnese""><span class=""links"">Farnese</i></a></span>. His only undisputed work there is the <i>Maiden with the Unicorn</i>, a charming, gentle fresco over the entrance of the Gallery. By the second decade of the century he was established as Rome's leading painter and had a succession of major decorative commissions, among them scenes from the life of St Cecilia in S. Luigi dei Francesi (1613&ndash;14). The dignified frieze-like composition of the figures reflects his study of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael's</span></a> tapestries, and in turn influenced <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>. The frescos in the pendentives and apse of S. Andrea della Valle (1624&ndash;8), his chief work of the 1620s, show a move away from this strict classicism towards an ampler <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> style; but compared with his rival <a href=""entry://Lanfranco, Giovanni""><span class=""links"">Lanfranco </span></a> (who at this time was overtaking him in popularity) Domenichino never abandoned the principles of clear, firm drawing for the sake of more painterly effects. In 1631 Domenichino moved to Naples, and in his ceiling frescos of the S. Gennaro chapel in the cathedral he made even greater concessions to the fashionable Baroque. He met with considerable hostility in Naples from jealous local artists and was forced to flee precipitately in 1634. He later returned, but died before completing his work in the cathedral.<br class=""nLine"" />Domenichino was important in fields other than monumental fresco decoration, particularly as an exponent of <a href=""entry://ideal landscape""><span class=""links"">ideal landscape</span></a>, in which he formed the link between Annibale Carracci and <a href=""entry://Claude Gellée ""><span class=""links"">Claude</span></a> (four of his landscapes are in the Louvre). He was one of the finest draughtsmen of his generation (the Royal Library at Windsor Castle has a superb collection of his drawings) and also an excellent portraitist (<i>Monsignor Agucchi</i>, City Art Gallery, York, <i>c.</i>1610). In the 18th cent. his reputation was enormous&mdash;his <i>Last Communion of St Jerome</i> (Vatican, 1614) was generally regarded as one of the greatest pictures ever painted&mdash;but he fell from grace in the 19th cent. along with other Bolognese painters under the scathing attacks of <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a>."
"Domenico Veneziano","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Domenico Veneziano </b><div class=""content""><i>(d. 1461).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter.

Although this is incorrect, it seems to be true that he was responsible for introducing a new interest in colour and texture to a tradition in which draughtsmanship normally ruled supreme. His fresco cycle <i>Scenes from the Life of the Virgin</i> (1439&ndash;45) in S. Egidio, Florence, on which <a href=""entry://Piero della Francesca ""><span class=""links"">Piero della Francesca </span></a> was one of his assistants, has disappeared, and only two fully authenticated works have survived.

"Donatello","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Donatello </b>
<i>(Donato di Niccolo )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1386?&ndash;1466).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine sculptor. He was the greatest European sculptor of the 15th cent. and one of a remarkable group of artists&mdash;including his friends <a href=""entry://Alberti, Leon Battista""><span class=""links"">Alberti </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Brunelleschi, Filippo""><span class=""links"">Brunelleschi </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a>&mdash;who created the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> style in Florence. Between 1404 and 1407 he was working as an assistant to <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti </span></a>, but he developed a style that was radically different to his master's <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> elegance. He was unconcerned with the surface polish or linear grace so typical of Ghiberti, and excelled rather in emotional force. His revolutionary conception of sculpture is exemplified in the great series of standing figures in niches which he made for Or San Michele and Florence Cathedral. The series began with the <i>St Mark</i> of 1411&ndash;13 (Or San Michele), included the celebrated <i>St George</i> (<i>c.</i>1415&ndash;17), now in the Bargello, Florence, and culminated in the so-called <i>Zuccone</i> (‘bald-pate’) in the Cathedral Museum (probably completed in 1436, although because various figures of prophets, of which this is one, are not identified unambiguously in the documents, some authorities think it was carved in 1423&ndash;5). <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> conveys the brilliance of Donatello's characterization in his description of the <i>St George</i>: ‘The head exhibits the beauty of youth, its spirit and valour in arms, a proud and terrifying life-likeness, and a marvellous sense of movement within the stone.’ With this acute psychological insight went a technique of daring originality that shows how concerned Donatello was with the optical effects of his works. He carefully took into consideration the position from which they would be viewed, adjusting the proportions of a figure when it would be seen from below, for example, and carving with almost brutal power and boldness when it was positioned to be seen at a distance. On the other hand, his relief of <i>St George and the Dragon</i> (Or San Michele, 1417), done for the base of his <i>St George</i> statue, is executed with great delicacy in the technique Donatello invented called <i>rilievo schiacciato</i> (<a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> so low it is like ‘drawing in stone’); situated on the north side of the building, the relief is seen in a soft, diffused light, so the subtlety of the carving can be appreciated.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1430&ndash;2 Donatello visited Rome, probably with Brunelleschi, and the impact of <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> art can be seen most clearly in his famous <i>Cantoria</i> (singing gallery) for Florence Cathedral (now Cathedral Mus., 1433&ndash;9), which makes a lavish show of freely interpreted classical motifs. The bronze statue of David (Bargello), which is credited with being the first free-standing nude statue since antiquity, is also sometimes seen as a response to Donatello's visit to Rome and assigned to the 1430s, but some scholars date it much later. The subject as well as the date is controversial, for it has been proposed that it represents <i>Mercury with the Head of Argus</i> rather than David . From 1443 to 1453 Donatello was based in Padua, his reason for moving there presumably being the commission to execute the Gattamelata monument in the Piazza del Santo&mdash;the first life-size equestrian statue since antiquity. His other major work in Padua was the High Altar of the church of S. Antonio (the Santo), which features free-standing figures and reliefs that are not now in their original positions.<br class=""nLine"" />From 1454 until his death Donatello was based mainly in Florence, although he also worked in Siena on an abortive project for a set of bronze doors for the Cathedral. In his late work he gave more prominence to the emotional intensity that was already such a feature of his style. The most important works from his final years are <i>Judith and Holofernes</i> in the Piazza della Signoria, a harrowing and emaciated <i>Mary Magdalene</i> in wood (Baptistry), and two pulpits with bronze reliefs in S. Lorenzo, which were unfinished at his death. These sublime late works show how freely Donatello exploited the expressive possibilities of distortion, and in them he created what has been called ‘the first style of old age in the history of art’. His work had enormous influence, on painters as well as sculptors, and his true spiritual heir was <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>."

He painted numerous subjects, but is best known for domestic interiors. They usually contain only a few figures framed by a window or by the drapery of a curtain, and surrounded by books, musical instruments, or household paraphernalia, all minutely depicted. He is at his best in scenes lit by artificial light. With Jan <a href=""entry://Steen, Jan""><span class=""links"">Steen </span></a>, Dou was among the founders of the Guild of St Luke at Leiden in 1648.

In the 1940s he experimented with a more geometric type of abstraction (<i>That Red One</i>, William H. Lane Foundation, Leominster, Mass., 1944).

<b>Drysdale, Sir Russell</b><div class=""content""><i>(1912&ndash;81).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Australian painter. He was born in England of a family that had long associations with Australia and he spent several years of his childhood there. The family settled in Melbourne in 1923 and in the late 1930s Drysdale gave up farming to study art. After moving to Sydney in 1940, he devoted himself fulltime to painting and his work became well known throughout Australia during the 1940s. It revived in a new fashion the tradition of hardship, tragedy, and melancholy associated with the Australian bush that had been obscured by the much more optimistic interpretation developed by the city-based painters of the <a href=""entry://Heidelberg School""><span class=""links"">Heidelberg School</span></a> during the 1890s. In 1949 Kenneth <a href=""entry://Clark, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Clark </span></a>, on a visit to Sydney, encouraged Drysdale to exhibit in London and late in 1950 he held an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries. It is to this exhibition that the beginning of a new interest in Australian art in London, which reached a peak in the early 1960s, may be traced. During the 1950s Drysdale travelled widely throughout Australia, drawing and painting the life of the interior. The plight of the Australian Aborigines in contact with white settlement became an important and continuing theme in such paintings as <i>Mullaloonah Tank</i> (Art Gal. of South Australia, Adelaide, 1953). During the early 1960s he experienced periods of depression accentuated by the death of his son and his wife. From that time he continued to broaden and develop the themes and methods with which he began in the 1940s."

He studied painting as a young man but was engaged mainly in the wine trade until 1942 when he took up art seriously again, his first exhibition coming in 1945. He made a cult of <a href=""entry://Art Brut""><span class=""links"">Art Brut</span></a> (‘raw art’), the products of psychotics or wholly untrained persons, and of graffiti, preferring untrained spontaneity to professional skill. His own work is aggressively reminiscent of such ‘popular’ art, often featuring subjects drawn from the street life of Paris (<i>Man with a Hod</i>, Tate Gallery, London, 1956). Frequently he incorporated materials such as sand and plaster into his paintings, and he also produced large sculptural works made from junk materials. His work initially provoked outrage, and he stands out as the pioneer and chief representative of the tendency in contemporary art to depreciate traditional artistic materials and methods and, as he himself said in 1957, to ‘bring all disparaged values into the limelight’. Opinions about his work have differed widely, but he has undoubtedly been highly influential, foreshadowing many of the trends of the 1960s and beyond by discrediting all conventional artistic standards."
"Duccio di Buoninsegna","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Duccio di Buoninsegna</b><div class=""content""><i>(active 1278&ndash;1318/19).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The most famous painter of the Sienese School. Little is known of his life: records of several commissions survive and he is known to have been fined on several occasions for various minor offences (one perhaps involving sorcery), but only one fully documented work by him survives. This is the famous <i><a href=""entry://Maestà""><span class=""links"">Maestá</i></a></span> commissioned by Siena Cathedral in 1308 and completed in 1311. Today most of this elaborate double-sided altarpiece is in the cathedral museum, but several of the <a href=""entry://predella""><span class=""links"">predella</span></a> panels are scattered outside Italy&mdash;in London (NG), Washington (NG), and elsewhere. It has been described by John White (<i>Art and Architecture in Italy: 1250&ndash;1400</i>, 1966) as ‘probably the most important panel ever painted in Italy. It is certainly among the most beautiful. Compressed within the compass of an altarpiece is the equivalent of an entire programme for the fresco painting of a church.’ The whole of the front of the main panel is occupied by a scene of the Virgin and Child in majesty surrounded by angels and saints, and corresponding to this on the back are twenty-six scenes from Christ's Passion. Originally there were subsidiary scenes from Christ's life above and below the main panel. The whole work is of a superb standard of craftsmanship, and the exquisite colouring and supple draughtsmanship create effects of great beauty. Although Duccio drew much on <a href=""entry://Byzantine art""><span class=""links"">Byzantine</span></a> tradition, he introduced a new warmth of human feeling that gives him a role in Sienese painting comparable to that of <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto </span></a> in Florentine painting. He recreates the biblical stories with great vividness, and as no one else before him he succeeds in making the setting of a scene&mdash;a room or a hillside&mdash;a dramatic constituent of the action, so that figures and surroundings are intimately bound up together. The other main work attributed to Duccio is the large <i>Rucellai Madonna</i> (Uffizi, Florence), which is probably the picture documented as having been painted by him for Sta Maria Novella, Florence, in 1285. Several other smaller panels can be attributed to him or his workshop with a fair degree of confidence, but there is no evidence that he ever worked in fresco. His influence in Siena was enormous (<a href=""entry://Simone Martini ""><span class=""links"">Simone Martini </span></a> was his greatest disciple) and reached as far as France, notably in the work of <a href=""entry://Pucelle, Jehan""><span class=""links"">Pucelle </span></a>. It is possible that he visited France: a ‘Duche de Siene’ is documented in Paris in 1296 and 1297."
"Duchamp, Marcel","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Duchamp, Marcel</b><div class=""content""><i>(1887&ndash;1968).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French-born artist and art theorist who became an American citizen in 1955, the brother of Raymond <a href=""entry://Duchamp-Villon, Raymond""><span class=""links"">Duchamp-Villon </span></a> and Jacques <a href=""entry://Villon, Jacques""><span class=""links"">Villon </span></a>. Although Duchamp produced few works (most of them are now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art), he is regarded as one of the most potent figures in 20th-cent. art because of the originality and fertility of his ideas. He sprang to notoriety with <i>Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2</i> (Philadelphia), combining the principles of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a>, which was the most discussed (and vilified) work at the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a> in 1913. In the same year he invented the <a href=""entry://ready-made""><span class=""links"">ready-made</span></a> with a bicycle wheel mounted on a kitchen stool, and from this time he virtually abandoned painting and other conventional media. From 1915 to 1923 he lived mainly in New York, where he was a leader of the <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada</span></a> movement. His works of this period include other ready-mades, notably <i>Bottle Rack</i> (1914) and <i>Fountain</i> (a urinal signed R. Mutt, 1917). Another of his celebrated provocative gestures was adding a moustache and beard and an obscene inscription to a reproduction of the <i>Mona Lisa</i> (1919). So far as it is possible to derive a theoretical basis from the incoherences of Dadaism, the concept of the ready-made seems to derive from Duchamp's conviction that life is meaningless absurdity and from his repudiation of all the values of art. Duchamp's major work of this period was a construction on glass entitled <i>The Bride stripped bare by her Bachelors</i>, even, also known as <i>The Large Glass</i> (Philadelphia, 1915&ndash;23; a facsimile by Richard <a href=""entry://Hamilton, Richard""><span class=""links"">Hamilton </span></a> is in the Tate, London, 1965&ndash;6). This is his most esoteric work and to many people is an incomprehensible joke. After leaving <i>The Large Glass</i> ‘definitively unfinished’ Duchamp virtually abandoned art for chess. He was a good enough player to represent France in four chess Olympiads and his obsession for the game intensified as he grew older. Of his marriage in 1927 his friend <a href=""entry://Man Ray ""><span class=""links"">Man Ray </span></a> wrote: ‘Duchamp spent most of the one week they lived together studying chess problems, and his bride, in desperate retaliation, got up one night when he was asleep and glued the chess pieces to the board. They were divorced three months later.’ He lived mainly in Paris from 1923 to 1942 and then for the rest of his life mainly in New York. After his death it was discovered that he had worked in secret for twenty years on <i>Etant Donnés</i> (Given that
), a large mixed-media construction; it is now in Philadelphia. Duchamp became a legend in his own lifetime. He was a man of enormous charm, with a keen sense of irony, and by his character as much as his works he did more than anyone else to change the concept of art in the 20th cent. He tried, unsuccessfully as he himself recognized, to destroy the mystique of taste, and in 1962 said: ‘When I discovered ready-mades I thought to discourage aesthetics
I threw the bottle rack and the urinal in their faces and now they admire them for their aesthetic beauty.’ Nevertheless, he revolutionized thinking about art."

<b>Duchamp-Villon, Raymond</b><div class=""content""><i>(1876&ndash;1918).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French sculptor, the brother of Jacques <a href=""entry://Villon, Jacques""><span class=""links"">Villon </span></a> and Marcel <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a>. After studying medicine he took up sculpture in 1898. From 1905 to 1913 he exhibited at the <a href=""entry://Salon d'Automne""><span class=""links"">Salon d'Automne</span></a> with works of expressive naturalism which at first differed little from those of others who were seeking a way to escape from the influence of <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a>. From about 1910, however, he came under the influence of the <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a> group and by 1914 he was recognized as pre-eminent among the small number of Cubist sculptors. His most celebrated work is <i>The Horse</i> (casts in Tate, London, MOMA, New York, and elsewhere, 1914), which completed his move towards abstraction. This has been called by G. H. Hamilton (<i>Painting and Sculpture in Europe</i> 1880&ndash;1940, 1967) ‘the most powerful piece of sculpture produced by any strictly Cubist artist’, and has been compared with the work of the <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurists</span></a>, particularly that of <a href=""entry://Boccioni, Umberto""><span class=""links"">Boccioni </span></a>, who had met Duchamp-Villon in 1913. In the success with which it expresses the taut energy of muscular movement in static forms it certainly achieves at least one of the things at which the Futurists were aiming in their attempts to represent ‘the dynamics of movement’. Duchamp-Villon served with the French army in the First World War and died from blood-poisoning after contracting typhoid fever."

It is characterized by rapid calligraphic drawing on backgrounds of bright colours thinly washed on a white ground, and was well suited to the glittering scenes of luxury and pleasure he favoured. He was a well-established figure by the mid 1920s and the accessibility and <i>joie de vivre</i> of his work helped to popularize modern art. In 1910 he made friends with the fashion designer Paul Poiret, who interested him in textile design, and he worked as a designer for both Poiret and Bianchini Férier, a silk manufacturer of Lyons, exerting a considerable influence on the world of fashion. He also made numerous book illustrations, notably for <a href=""entry://Apollinaire, Guillaume""><span class=""links"">Apollinaire's</span></a>

<b>Duquesnoy, François</b><div class=""content""><i>(1594&ndash;1643).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish sculptor, active mainly in Rome, where he settled in 1618. He was a friend of <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>, sharing a house with him for a time, and became a leading figure in circles devoted to classical art. Alongside <a href=""entry://Algardi, Alessandro""><span class=""links"">Algardi </span></a> he came to be recognized as the outstanding sculptor in Rome after the great <a href=""entry://Bernini, Gianlorenzo""><span class=""links"">Bernini </span></a> (who employed him on the decoration of the <a href=""entry://baldachin""><span class=""links"">Baldacchino</span></a> in St Peter's in 1627&ndash;8), and as with Algardi, his style was much more restrained and less <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> than Bernini's. Duquesnoy's two major works are the statues of <i>Sta Susanna</i> (Sta Maria di Loreto, 1629&ndash;33) and <i>St Andrew</i> (St Peter's, 1629&ndash;40). He also produced many small bronzes that spread his fame. Duquesnoy was particularly renowned for his handling of <a href=""entry://putto""><span class=""links"">putti</span></a>, and it is curious that someone who so unaffectedly depicted the beauty and charm of children seems to have been mentally unstable; he was a chronic procrastinator and the diarist John Evelyn, visiting Rome in 1644, said that he ‘died mad’ because his <i>St Andrew</i> ‘was placed in a bad light’. Duquesnoy's father and brother were sculptors; <i>Jerome I</i> (before 1570&ndash;1641) and <i>Jerome II</i> (1602&ndash;54). His father is remembered mainly for the famous <i>Manneken-pis</i> fountain (1619) behind the town hall in Brussels. His brother worked with François in Rome and took a somewhat diluted Baroque style back to Flanders with him. The tomb of Bishop Anton Trest in Ghent Cathedral (<i>c.</i>1640&ndash;54) is considered his finest work. He is perhaps best remembered, however, for his sticky end; he was executed by strangulation in Ghent for committing sodomy in a church."

This played a major role in building up some of the great American collections of Impressionists.

In 1886 he entered the firm of his father, Sir <i>Joseph Duveen </i> (1843&ndash;1908), and with his enormous energy and great gift for salesmanship expanded it into the largest firm of art dealers in the world, operating on an unprecedented scale. He employed Bernard <a href=""entry://Berenson, Bernard""><span class=""links"">Berenson </span></a> to give his seal of authenticity to the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> paintings he sold and he was the main agent in forming the collections of such fabulously wealthy Americans as <a href=""entry://Frick, Henry Clay""><span class=""links"">Frick </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Kress, Samuel H.""><span class=""links"">Kress </span></a>, and Andrew <a href=""entry://Mellon, Andrew W.""><span class=""links"">Mellon </span></a>.

"Duvet, Jean","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Duvet, Jean</b><div class=""content""><i>(1485&ndash;1561/70).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French engraver and goldsmith, sometimes called the Master of the Unicorn from his series of engravings (probably from the 1540s) on the medieval theme of the hunting of the unicorn. Little is known of his life (he lived mainly in his native Langres and in Dijon), but the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> influence in his early work strongly suggests that he spent some time in Italy. His most famous work, a set of twenty-four engravings illustrating the <i>Apocalypse</i>, published at Lyons in 1561, is, however, completely different in style. They borrow many features from <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer's</span></a> series on the <i>Apocalypse</i>, but are a world apart in spirit, for Duvet treats the subject with a visionary intensity and expressive freedom that seems to anticipate <a href=""entry://Blake, William""><span class=""links"">Blake</span></a> (who may well have known Duvet's work). His work reflects the disturbed religious conditions which prevailed in Langres and is in complete contrast to the mannered elegance of the School of <a href=""entry://Fontainebleau, School of""><span class=""links"">Fontainebleau</span></a>, then the dominant force in French art."

"Dyce, William","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Dyce, William</b><div class=""content""><i>(1806&ndash;64).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Scottish painter, designer, and art educationalist. He made several visits to Italy and was deeply impressed by Renaissance painting, notably that of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>, and stimulated by the problem of fresco in relation to its architectural setting. He also came into contact with the <a href=""entry://Nazarenes""><span class=""links"">Nazarenes</span></a>, whose Christian primitivism he tried to acclimatize in Scotland. Dyce was widely talented; he was an accomplished musician and wrote a prizewinning paper on electromagnetism, but for some time he was successful mainly as a rather conventional portraitist and it was not until after 1840 that he was able to devote himself to more ambitious work, producing decorative schemes for the Houses of Parliament, several churches, and the royal residences Buckingham Palace and Osborne on the Isle of Wight (he was a favourite of Prince Albert ). His importance extended beyond his own work, for ‘there was no major [artistic] undertaking in mid nineteenth-century Britain in which he did not play either an executive or advisory role’ (David and Francina Irwin, <i>Scottish Painters at Home and Abroad</i>, 1975). He was commissioned by the Council of the newly founded Government School of Design, which included <a href=""entry://Eastlake, Sir Charles Lock""><span class=""links"">Eastlake</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Chantrey, Sir Francis""><span class=""links"">Chantrey</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Callcott, Sir Augustus Wall""><span class=""links"">Callcott </span></a>, to investigate state schools in France, Prussia, and Bavaria, and was appointed Director in 1840 on his return. His ideas on design were much respected, and although he had little influence on manufacturers, his training of teachers was important. As a painter he was versatile, for as well as portraits and history pictures he painted works as varied as the delightfully sentimental <i>Titian's First Essay in Colour</i> (Aberdeen Art Gallery, 1856&ndash;7) and <i>Pegwell Bay, Kent</i> (Tate, London, 1859&ndash;60), one of the most remarkable of all Victorian landscapes. His bright colours and naturalistic detail formed a bridge between the Nazarenes and the <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelites</span></a>, but his design is usually stronger and his highmindedness more convincing than in the works of either."
"Dyck, Sir Anthony van","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Dyck, Sir Anthony van</b><div class=""content""><i>(1599&ndash;1641).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Apart from <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>, the greatest Flemish painter of the 17th cent. In 1609 he began his apprenticeship with Hendrick van <a href=""entry://Balen, Hendrick van""><span class=""links"">Balen </span></a> in his native Antwerp and he was exceptionally precocious: on his earliest dated painting (<i>An Elderly Man</i>, Musées Royaux, Brussels, 1613) he has proudly inscribed his own age (14) as well as that of the sitter. Although he did not become a master in the painters' guild until 1618, there is evidence that he was working independently for some years before this, even though this was forbidden by guild regulations. Probably soon after graduating he entered Rubens's workshop. Strictly speaking he should not be called Rubens's pupil, as he was an accomplished painter when he went to work for him. Nevertheless the two years or so he spent with Rubens were decisive and Rubens's influence on him is unmistakable, although van Dyck's style was always less energetic and more highly strung. In 1620 van Dyck went to London, where he spent a few months in the service of James I, then in 1621 to Italy, where he stayed until 1627, toning down the Flemish robustness of his early pictures to create the refined and elegant style which remained characteristic of his work for the rest of his life. He travelled a good deal in Italy, but worked mainly in Genoa, where he painted a series of grand portraits of the nobility in which he established a distinctive aristocratic type, with proud mien and slender figure. A superb example is the full-length <i>Marchesa Elena Grimaldi</i> (NG, Washington, 1623), of which Sir David Piper wrote (<i>Van Dyck</i>, 1968): ‘this is how one imagines any feminine aristocrat worthy of her rank must feel herself essentially to be, yet did not know it till van Dyck showed her&mdash;aloof and formally regal, but endowed with an elegance and grace that are infinitely seductive’.<br class=""nLine"" />After leaving Italy, van Dyck worked mainly in Antwerp for the next few years, 1628&ndash;32. From 1632 until his death he lived in England&mdash;except for visits to the Continent&mdash;as painter to Charles I, from whom he received a knighthood. Perhaps the strongest evidence of his power as a portraitist is the fact that today we see Charles and his court through van Dyck's eyes. Many of his portraits of the king and his family are still in the royal collection; among the others the most famous is probably the huge equestrian portrait of Charles (<i>c.</i>1637) in the National Gallery, London. It is customary to accuse van Dyck of invariably flattering his sitters, but not all his patrons would have agreed. When the Countess of Sussex saw the portrait (now lost) van Dyck painted of her she felt ‘very ill-favourede’ and ‘quite out of love with myself, the face is so bige and so fate that it pleases me not at all. It lokes lyke on of the windes puffinge&mdash;but truly I think tis lyke the originale.’ Van Dyck's influence on English portraiture has been profound and lasting: <a href=""entry://Gainsborough, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Gainsborough </span></a>, in particular, revered him, but he was an inspiration to many others until the early 20th cent., when society portraiture ceased to be a major form of artistic expression. He also painted religious and mythological subjects, however, and a surprising facet of his activity is revealed by his landscapes in watercolour (BM, London). His <i>Iconography</i> (1645) is a series of etchings or engravings of his famous contemporaries. Van Dyck etched some of the plates himself, and many more were engraved after his drawings and oil sketches."
"Dying Gaul","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Dying Gaul</b>.<div class=""content"">Marble statue in the Capitoline Museum, Rome, showing a wounded warrior supporting himself wearily on one arm. First recorded in Rome in 1623, it soon became one of the most celebrated and copied of <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> works. It is a Roman copy of a Greek work in the <a href=""entry://Pergamene School""><span class=""links"">Pergamene</span></a> style of the late 3rd cent. BC. The statue is sometimes called the ‘Dying Gladiator’, but this is a misnomer as the hairstyle and accessories are scrupulously Gallic. It was among the works removed from Italy by Napoleon and was in Paris from 1798 to 1815. Unlike many once famous antique statues, the <i>Dying Gaul</i> is still an admired work, particularly for its sense of pathos."
"Dürer, Albrecht","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Dürer, Albrecht</b><div class=""content""><i>(1471&ndash;1528).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German graphic artist and painter, the greatest figure of <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> art in northern Europe. Son of a goldsmith, Albrecht Dürer the Elder, and godson of Anthony Koberger, one of Germany's foremost printers and publishers, he attended a Latin school where he met the humanist and poet Willibald Pirckheimer, who was to become his lifelong friend and correspondent, and then was apprenticed when 15 years old to the leading painter and book illustrator in his native Nuremberg, Michael <a href=""entry://Wolgemut, Michael""><span class=""links"">Wolgemut </span></a>. These four men exercised a powerful influence on Dürer's genius and determined to some degree his artistic career. Albrecht the Elder must not only have instilled into him the devotion to exact and meticulous detail that is the mark of a goldsmith's work, but also taught him the rudiments of drawing, as is borne out by the young boy's self-portrait (Albertina, Vienna, 1484), modelled on one by his father (also Albertina). From Wolgemut, whose influence was mainly technical, he learned the painter's trade and the craft of <a href=""entry://woodcut""><span class=""links"">woodcut</span></a>. Through Koberger he had access to the world of books and learning, and Pirckheimer directed these interests towards Italy and the new humanism. From the beginning Dürer's world reached well beyond the confines of the normal medieval workshop.<br class=""nLine"" />After completing his apprenticeship Dürer set out in 1490 on the usual bachelor's journey. He went to the Upper Rhine in search of Germany's leading painter and engraver Martin <a href=""entry://Schongauer, Martin""><span class=""links"">Schongauer </span></a>, who, however, had just died when Dürer reached Colmar in 1492, and he worked for a while as a book illustrator in Basle and Strasburg. After his return to Nuremberg and his marriage (1494) he went on a short visit to north Italy and then set up a workshop in his native town. Though also active as a painter&mdash;the self-portrait of 1500 and the <i>Paumgärtner Altar</i> of 1504 (both Alte Pinakothek, Munich) being the most important early works&mdash;he was for years preoccupied with woodcuts and engravings, among which the large series of the <i>Apocalypse</i> (1498), the <i>Great Passion</i> (1510), and the <i>Life of the Virgin</i> (1510) take first place. In spite of the traditional subject-matter, they are revolutionary in approach, size, and subtlety of technique. They are alive with dramatic tension and a pathos which is not only the result of his close study of <a href=""entry://Mantegna, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Mantegna's </span></a> engravings but also an expression of his participation in the spiritual life of his day.<br class=""nLine"" />At the same time he began to be occupied by the Renaissance problems of <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a>, of <a href=""entry://ideal""><span class=""links"">ideal</span></a> beauty, of proportion and harmony. In 1505&ndash;7 he made another visit to Venice, returning with a system of human proportions which he must have met with in circles close to <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>. His great admiration for Giovanni <a href=""entry://Bellini""><span class=""links"">Bellini </span></a> enhanced his sense of colour and the <i>Feast of the Rosegarlands</i> (NG, Prague, 1506), done in Venice, was meant to compete with the best Venetian painting. Most of his landscape watercolours also belong to this period. They are unique in several ways: as personal records, in their choice of medium and subject, but most of all since they seem to have been made for sheer pleasure and not&mdash;as was usual with sketches in those days&mdash;with larger works in view.<br class=""nLine"" />By now Dürer was a well-established artist. Commissions for large altar-paintings came not only from his home town of Nuremberg (<i>The Adoration of the Trinity</i>, Kunsthistorisches Mus., Vienna, 1511), but from further afield, and after <i>c.</i>1512 his most important patron was the emperor Maximilian. For him Dürer designed an enormous triumphal arch laden with history and allegory, and a triumphal procession, executed in woodcut by members of Dürer's workshop and others. At the same time his creative spirit found outlets entirely of his own choosing in such celebrated engravings as <i>The Knight, Death, and the Devil</i> (1513), <i>St Jerome in his Study</i> (1514), and the brooding and enigmatic allegory of the <i>Melencolia I</i> (1514). In these works he achieved a mastery of <a href=""entry://line engraving""><span class=""links"">line engraving</span></a> that has never been surpassed, rivalling the richness and textures of painting. During these years he also experimented with a new technique, <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etching</span></a>, and found in it the means to convey, in an <i>Agony in the Garden</i> (1515), his troubled religious feelings. There is other evidence to tell us how deeply Dürer felt during the years of the Reformation and we know from one of his own letters that liberation and consolation came to him finally through Luther's writings.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1520&ndash;1 a journey to the court of the emperor Charles V to ask for a renewal of his pension took him to the Netherlands, where he was fêted as the acknowledged leader of his profession. The day-to-day diary that Dürer kept on this tour, together with his drawings showing the people and places he saw, is the first record of its kind in the history of art. After his return to Nuremberg Dürer was busy with portraits and with the designs for yet another <i>Passion</i> series, but his main task was the two panels with the <i>Four Apostles</i> (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) which he presented to his native town in 1526, an action without precedent. Here Dürer summed up his life's work: the study of the ideal human figure and the expression of a deeply felt religious message.<br class=""nLine"" />It was only natural that a man of Dürer's cast of mind should pursue theoretical studies throughout his life, and that among them&mdash;according to his own testimony&mdash;proportion should take first place, other things being attempted only ‘if God should give me time’. The <i>Underweyssung der Messung</i> (Treatise on Measurement) (1525) was published by Dürer himself, but the <i>Vier Bücher von menschlicher Proportion</i> (Four Books on Human Proportion) (1528) was published posthumously. When Dürer died in 1528, though he was widely known as a painter, his real fame rested on his graphic work, which was used in the north and south very much as pattern-books had been. Erasmus called him ‘the <a href=""entry://Apelles""><span class=""links"">Apelles</span></a> of black lines’, the highest praise that a student of the ancients could give to any artist."
"Eakins, Thomas","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Eakins, Thomas</b><div class=""content""><i>(1844&ndash;1916).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, active for most of his life in his native city of Philadelphia. Eakins is regarded by most critics as the outstanding American painter of the 19th cent. and by many as the greatest his country has yet produced. In 1866&ndash;70 he was in Europe. He studied in Paris with <a href=""entry://Gérôme, Jean-Léon""><span class=""links"">Gérôme</span></a>, but learnt most from the Spanish painters <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Ribera, José""><span class=""links"">Ribera </span></a>, absorbing a precise and uncompromising sense for actuality which he applied to portraiture and <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> pictures of the life of his native city (boating and bathing were favourite themes). He began teaching at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1876 and was attacked for his radical ideas, particularly his insistence on working from nude models. In 1886 he was forced to resign after allowing a mixed class to draw from a completely nude male model. Eakins's quest for realism led him to study anatomy and make full use of <a href=""entry://Muybridge, Eadweard""><span class=""links"">Muybridge's </span></a> photographic researches, but the scientific bent in his work is of less importance than his honesty and depth of characterization. His portraits are often compared with Rembrandt's because of their dramatic play of sombre lighting and sense of inner truth. The most famous of his paintings is <i>The Gross Clinic</i> (Jefferson Medical Coll., Philadelphia, 1875), which aroused controversy because of its unsparing depiction of surgery, an experience that was repeated with <i>The Agnew Clinic</i> (Univ. of Pennsylvania, 1889). Because of financial support from his father, Eakins could continue on his chosen course despite public abuse, but much of his later career was spent working in bitter isolation. It was only near the end of his life that he achieved recognition as a great master, and in the first two decades of the 20th cent. his desire to ‘peer deeper into the heart of American life’ was reflected in the work of the <a href=""entry://Ash-can School""><span class=""links"">Ash-can School</span></a> and other realist painters. As well as being a painter and photographer, Eakins also made a few sculptures. His wife, <i>Susan Hannah Macdowell Eakins </i> (1851&ndash;1938), whom he married in 1884, was also a painter and photographer, as well as an accomplished pianist."

<b>Eardley, Joan</b><div class=""content""><i>(1921&ndash;63).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter, born in Sussex but considered Scottish (her mother was Scottish and she lived in Scotland from 1940). One of her teachers was James <a href=""entry://Cowie, James""><span class=""links"">Cowie </span></a>; he perhaps helped to shape her preference for subjects drawn from everyday experience, but her approach was more earthy and sensuous than his. She divided her time between Glasgow (where she painted <a href=""entry://Kitchen Sink School""><span class=""links"">kitchen sink</span></a> subjects) and the fishing village of Catterline, about 20 miles south of Aberdeen on the north-east coast. Her favourite subjects in her later years were the village and the sea, especially in stormy weather (she is said to have set off from her Glasgow home as soon as she heard reports of gales). The freely painted, often bleak and desolate works that resulted are among the most powerful and individual landscapes in 20th-cent. British art. After her early death from breast cancer her ashes were scattered on the beach at Catterline. Her work is well represented in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh."
"Earl, Ralph","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Earl, Ralph</b><div class=""content""><i>(1751&ndash;1801).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, active in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont, and also in England (1778&ndash;85), when his loyalty to the British put his life in danger in his homeland. He painted landscapes and battle scenes of the Revolution, but was primarily a portraitist. Although his style became softer and more sophisticated after studying with <a href=""entry://West, Benjamin""><span class=""links"">West</span></a> in London, his work generally has a sincerity and freshness of vision that makes him one of the finest American artists of the 18th cent. His presentation of character is extremely forthright and his portraits convey the immense pride his New England sitters took in their possessions. Earl's personal life was a disaster. He was imprisoned for debt and died an alcoholic after deserting both of his wives in turn. Other members of his family were artists, notably his brother <i>James</i> (1761&ndash;96) and his son <i>Ralph E. W. Earl </i> (<i>c.</i>1785&ndash;1838), who is remembered mainly for his portraits of President Andrew Jackson, whose niece he had married."

The studio easel, a 19th-cent. invention, is a heavy piece of furniture which runs on castors or wheels, and served to impress the clients of portrait painters. Oil painters need an easel which will support the canvas almost vertically or tip it slightly forward to prevent reflection from the wet paint, whereas the watercolourist must be able to lay his paper nearly flat so that the wet paint will not run down.

<b>Eastlake, Sir Charles Lock</b><div class=""content""><i>(1793&ndash;1865).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, art historian, and administrator. He studied under <a href=""entry://Haydon, Benjamin Robert""><span class=""links"">Haydon</span></a> and early became famous with his <i>Napoleon on board the Bellerophon</i> (Earl of Roseberry Coll., 1815), made from sketches when he witnessed Napoleon on board ship (in Eastlake's native Plymouth) <i>en route</i> to exile in St Helena . Using the proceeds from the sale of this work he lived in Rome 1816&ndash;30, and there painted picturesque scenes of the Roman Campagna, often peopled by <i>banditti</i>, that became very popular in England. After his return to England, however, he turned increasingly to administration and achieved a remarkable record as a public servant. Most notably he was President of the Royal Academy from 1850 and Director of the National Gallery (the first holder of this post) from 1855 until his death. Among his writings, <i>Materials for a History of Oil Painting</i> (1847) was a pioneer work. His informed purchases of early Italian paintings for the National Gallery were largely responsible for its outstanding representation in this area. His wife, <i>Elizabeth</i>, <i>née</i> Rigby (1809&ndash;93), was in her own right a figure in the literary-artistic world of the day. She wrote several books on art and also translated Gustav <a href=""entry://Waagen, Gustav Friedrich""><span class=""links"">Waagen's </span></a>
<i>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</i>. Eastlake's nephew, <i>Charles Lock Eastlake </i> (1836&ndash;1906), was Keeper of the National Gallery, 1878&ndash;98, and published several works on art and decoration, the best known of which was <i>Hints on Household Taste</i> (1868), in which he advocated quality of materials and workmanship. It was highly influential in England and even more so in America, although so-called ‘Eastlake furniture’ often has little to do with his ideas."

<b>eclectic</b>, <i>eclecticism</i>.<div class=""content"">Terms in criticism for a person or style which conflates features borrowed from various sources.

After <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> had praised <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> for his skill in selecting the best from the art of his predecessors, it became commonplace to use the same formula in eulogies of other artists.

As Denis <a href=""entry://Mahon, Sir Denis""><span class=""links"">Mahon </span></a> has said: ‘Annibale Carracci, the greatest member of the family and one of the founders of 17th-cent. painting, was

It came into being when the National Academy of Design rejected work by Luks, Sloan, and Glackens, whereupon Henri, the dominant personality in the group, in protest withdrew his own pictures from the exhibition of 1907. Arthur B. Davies was then asked to organize an independent exhibition at the Macbeth Gallery in New York. This exhibition, which took place in February 1908 and was the only occasion on which The Eight exhibited together, was subsequently shown by the Pennsylvania Academy and circulated to eight other museums over a period of a year. The members of the group were not unified stylistically, but they mainly painted contemporary urban life.

<b>Elgin Marbles</b>.<div class=""content"">A collection of Greek sculpture from the Acropolis in Athens acquired by the British diplomat Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin (1766&ndash;1841), in 1801&ndash;3, when he was Ambassador to the Sultan of Turkey, who at this time ruled Greece. The collection consisted mainly of sculptures from the Parthenon (most of what had survived), but included other pieces, notably a <a href=""entry://caryatid""><span class=""links"">caryatid</span></a> from the Erechtheum. They were shipped to Britain over a period of several years and in 1816 they were sold to the nation and installed in the <a href=""entry://British Museum""><span class=""links"">British Museum</span></a>. Elgin was paid £35,000, which was only about half the total they had cost him. By their exhibition in London original Greek sculpture of the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">Classical age</span></a> first became generally accessible in modern times; until then people had been familiar only with Roman and late <a href=""entry://Hellenistic""><span class=""links"">Hellenistic</span></a> copies. Their first impact was enormous: <a href=""entry://Flaxman, John""><span class=""links"">Flaxman</span></a> was bowled over, declaring that compared with the figure of Theseus (now usually identified as Dionysus or Herakles) from the Parthenon the <i><a href=""entry://Apollo Belvedere""><span class=""links"">Apollo Belvedere</i></a></span> was ‘a dancing master’, and <a href=""entry://Haydon, Benjamin Robert""><span class=""links"">Haydon </span></a> wrote ‘I consider it truly the greatest blessing that ever happened to this country their being brought here.’ Earlier, when asked to restore them, <a href=""entry://Canova, Antonio""><span class=""links"">Canova </span></a> said ‘it would be a sacrilege in him or any man to presume to touch them with a chisel.’ Many other artists voiced similar opinions, although certain connoisseurs, led by Richard Payne <a href=""entry://Knight, Richard Payne""><span class=""links"">Knight </span></a>, were unenthusiastic or even disparaging. ‘You have lost your labour, my Lord Elgin’, said Payne Knight . ‘Your marbles are overrated: they are not Greek: they are Roman of the time of Hadrian.’ Although the supporters of the marbles won the day and the sculptures have come to be universally recognized as one of the summits of ancient art, they have continued to be the subject of controversy on another count&mdash;that of the morality or legality of their removal when Greece was under the dominion of a foreign power. Byron wrote of them as ‘poor plunder from a bleeding land’ (<i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i>, Canto ii, 1812), and a campaign to have them restored to Greece is strongly active today.

"Elsheimer, Adam","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Elsheimer, Adam</b><div class=""content""><i>(1578&ndash;1610).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German painter, etcher, and draughtsman, active mainly in Italy. Although he died young and his output was small he played a key role in the development of 17th-cent. landscape painting. He was born in Frankfurt, where he absorbed the <a href=""entry://Coninxloo, Gillis van""><span class=""links"">Coninxloo</span></a> tradition, and moved to Italy in 1598. In Venice he worked with his countryman <a href=""entry://Rottenhammer, Hans""><span class=""links"">Rottenhammer</span></a>, then settled in Rome in 1600. His early <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> style gave way to a more direct manner in which he showed great sensitivity to effects of light; his nocturnal scenes are particularly original, bringing out the best in his lyrical temperament, and he is credited with being the first artist to represent the constellations of the night sky accurately (<i>The Flight into Egypt</i>, Alte Pinakothek, Munich, 1609). He painted a few pictures in which figures predominate, but generally they are fused into a harmonious unity with their landscape settings. They are invariably on a small scale and on copper (the only exception is a self-portrait in the Uffizi, Florence, of doubtful attribution), but although exquisitely executed they have a grandeur out of all proportion to their size. Elsheimer achieved fame during his lifetime and there are numerous contemporary copies of his works. His paintings were engraved by his pupil and patron, the Dutch amateur artist Count Hendrick Goudt (1573&ndash;1648), and Elsheimer himself made a number of etchings. In spite of his popularity he was personally unsuccessful and died in poverty. <a href=""entry://Sandrart, Joachim von""><span class=""links"">Sandrart</span></a> says he suffered from melancholia and was often unable to work; apparently he was imprisoned for debt. <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a> was a friend of Elsheimer and after his death lamented his ‘sin of sloth, by which he has deprived the world of the most beautiful things’; he also wrote ‘I have never seen his equal in the realm of small figures, of landscapes, and of so many other subjects’. Both Rubens (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kassel ) and <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a> (NG, Dublin) made paintings of <i>The Flight into Egypt</i> inspired by Elsheimer's masterpiece, and his influence is apparent in the work of many other 17th-cent. artists."
"emblem","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>emblem</b>.<div class=""content"">A visual image carrying a symbolic meaning and often accompanied by texts to explain this meaning. In its most typical form the emblem consisted of a picture, a motto, and an explanatory verse called an epigram. For example, one of the most famous emblems depicted a dolphin and an anchor with the motto <i>Festina Lente</i> (‘Make haste slowly’), to symbolize the idea that maturity is achieved by a combination of the speed and energy of the dolphin and the steadiness and gravity of the anchor. The aim of the emblem therefore was to give symbolic expression to a moral adage. Printed collections of emblems (‘emblem books’) enjoyed a great vogue in the 16th and 17th cents. and were often used as sources of pictorial imagery. In particular, Cesare Ripa's <i>Iconologia</i> (1593, first illustrated edition, 1603) became the standard handbook on <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">iconography</span></a> for artists."
"emulsion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

<b>encarnado</b><div class=""content"">(Spanish: ‘flesh-coloured’). Term applied in Spanish art to the painting of the flesh parts of wooden sculptures in more or less naturalistic colours. The term ‘estofado’ (literally ‘quilted’) is applied to the painting of draperies. In the 16th cent. the paint of both flesh and draperies was given a glossy finish, but in the 17th cent. a matt finish was adopted for greater realism. Such work was sometimes done by distinguished painters as well as by specialist craftsmen&mdash;<i>encarnadores</i> and <i>estofadores</i>.

Encaustic painting was the commonest technique in the early centuries of the Christian era but fell into disuse in the 8th or 9th cent. Since then various attempts have been made to revive it (e.g. by Julius <a href=""entry://Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Julius""><span class=""links"">Schnorr von Carolsfeld </span></a>, who painted several scenes in encaustic in the Residenz at Munich in 1831).

<b>Ensor, James</b><div class=""content""><i>(1860&ndash;1949).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Belgian painter and printmaker. One of the most original artists of his time, Ensor was one of the formative influences on <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> and was claimed by the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealists</span></a> as a forerunner, but his work defies classification within any school or group. He was born at Ostend, where his parents (his father was English) kept a souvenir shop, and apart from his training in Brussels rarely left his home town. His early works were mainly bourgeois interiors painted in a thick and vigorous technique. When several were rejected by the Salon in Brussels in 1883, Ensor joined the progressive group Les <a href=""entry://Vingt, Les""><span class=""links"">Vingt</span></a>. During the 1880s his subject-matter changed and he began to introduce the fantastic and macabre elements which are chiefly associated with his name. He made much use of carnival masks, grotesque figures, skeletons, and bizarre and monstrous imaginings with a gruesome and ironic humour reminiscent of <a href=""entry://Bosch, Hieronymus""><span class=""links"">Bosch </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Bruegel, Pieter""><span class=""links"">Bruegel </span></a>. The interest in masks probably originated in his parents' shop, but he was also one of the first European artists who appreciated African masks. His paintings, and even more his graphic work, took on a didactic or satirical flavour involving social or religious criticism and his most famous work, the huge <i>Entry of Christ into Brussels</i> (Getty Museum, Malibu, 1888), provoked such an outburst of criticism among his associates that he was expelled from Les Vingt. After this Ensor became a recluse and his outlook became misanthropic. His work changed little after about 1900, when he was content to repeat his favourite themes. In 1929 he was created a baron when his <i>Entry of Christ into Brussels</i> was first exhibited in public. There is an Ensor museum in Ostend."

<b>Epstein, Sir Jacob</b><div class=""content""><i>(1880&ndash;1959).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American-born sculptor (and occasional painter and illustrator) who settled in England in 1905 and became a British citizen in 1911. Before then, in 1902&ndash;5, he had studied in Paris and visits to the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a> aroused an interest in ancient and <a href=""entry://primitive""><span class=""links"">primitive</span></a> sculpture that lasted all his life and powerfully affected his work. His first important commission was executed in 1907&ndash;8: eighteen over life-size figures for the façade of the British Medical Association's headquarters in the Strand. The nude figures aroused a furore of abuse on the grounds of alleged obscenity and were destroyed in 1937 when the building was bought by the government of Southern Rhodesia. Such verbal attacks and acts of vandalism were to become a feature of Epstein's career. The next scandal came with his tomb of Oscar Wilde (Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris, 1912), a magnificently bold and original piece featuring a hovering angel inspired by Assyrian sculpture, which was banned as indecent until a bronze plaque had been fixed over the angel's sexual organs.

While he was in Paris working on the tomb Epstein met <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Modigliani, Amedeo""><span class=""links"">Modigliani </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Brancusi, Constantin""><span class=""links"">Brancusi </span></a> and was influenced by their formal simplifications. Back in England he associated with Wyndham <a href=""entry://Lewis, Wyndham""><span class=""links"">Lewis </span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Vorticism""><span class=""links"">Vorticists</span></a>, and in <i>The Rock Drill</i> (Tate, London, 1913&ndash;14), a robot-like figure that was originally shown aggressively mounted on an enormous drill, he created his most radical work; he said it symbolized ‘the terrible Frankenstein's monster we have made ourselves into’. Epstein's later work was generally much less audacious than this, but his public sculptures were still attacked with monotonous regularity, their expressive use of distortion being offensive to conservative critics even when they were immune to charges of indecency. <i>Rima</i>, a memorial to the naturalist W. H. Hudson in Hyde Park (1922), and the enormous bronze group of <i>St Michael and the Devil</i> (1958) at Coventry Cathedral are two of his most famous later works. From the 1920s Epstein devoted himself more and more to bronze portrait busts, and these&mdash;unlike his monumental works&mdash;have always had an appreciative audience. Many of the great figures of the time sat for him and he portrayed them with psychological insight and great mastery of expressive surfaces, carrying on the tradition of <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a>."

<b>Ernst, Max</b><div class=""content""><i>(1891&ndash;1976).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German-born painter, printmaker, collagist, and sculptor who became a French citizen in 1958, one of the major figures of <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada</span></a> and especially of <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>. He studied philosophy and psychology at Bonn University, but he became fascinated by the art of psychotics (he visited the insane as part of his studies) and neglected academic work for painting. After serving in the First World War he became with <a href=""entry://Arp, Jean""><span class=""links"">Arp </span></a> (his lifelong friend) the leader of the Dada movement in Cologne. In 1920 he organized one of Dada's most famous exhibitions in the conservatory of a restaurant there. Visitors entered through the lavatories and axes were provided so they could smash the exhibits if they felt so inclined. In 1922 he settled in Paris, bringing Dada techniques of <a href=""entry://collage""><span class=""links"">collage</span></a> and <a href=""entry://photomontage""><span class=""links"">photomontage</span></a> with him, and he joined the Surrealist movement on its formation in 1924. Even before then, however, he had painted works such as <i>The Elephant Celebes</i> (Tate, London, 1921) that are regarded as Surrealist masterpieces. The irrational and whimsical imagery seen here, in part inspired by childhood memories, occurs also in his highly individual collages. In them he manipulated banal engravings so that the contrast between the archaic appearance of the engraving and the startling novelty he created from it made an impact of strangeness and unreality. In this vein he produced ‘collage novels’, the best known of which is <i>Une Semaine de Bonté</i> (1934). His work was always imaginative and experimental and he was a pioneering exponent of <a href=""entry://frottage""><i><span class=""links"">frottage</i></span></a>. In the 1930s sculpture also began to occupy a prominent place in his work. In 1938 he broke with the Surrealist movement, but this did not affect his work stylistically. He was interned for a short while after the German invasion of France and in 1941 went to New York, remaining in America until 1953 (apart from a visit to France in 1949). While in the USA he collaborated with <a href=""entry://Breton, André""><span class=""links"">Breton </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a> in the periodical <i>VVV</i>. He settled permanently in France in 1953 and in his late years acquired many honours. His painting of this time became more lyrical and abstract.<br class=""nLine"" />Ernst was married four times. His third (very brief) marriage was to Peggy <a href=""entry://Guggenheim, Solomon R.""><span class=""links"">Guggenheim </span></a>; his fourth wife (married 1946) was Dorothea Tanning (1910&ndash; ), one of the outstanding American Surrealist painters. In the late 1930s he lived in Paris with the British-born (later Mexican) Surrealist painter and writer Leonora Carrington (1917&ndash; ). His son <i>Jimmy Ernst </i> (1920&ndash;84) was also a painter."

His prints (mainly woodcuts and lithographs) make sophisticated uses of visual illusion, exploiting ambiguity between figure and ground, and between flat pattern and apparent three-dimensional recession. From <i>c.</i>1944 his work took on a <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealist</span></a> flavour as he made brilliant play with optical illusion to represent, for example, staircases that appear to lead both up and down in the same direction. Mathematical concepts played a key role in many of these prints and they have been of considerable interest to mathematicians. He has also had a strong appeal to the general public, particularly since the 1960s, when some young people felt that his work complemented the ‘mind-expanding’ experiences obtained through taking hallucinogenic drugs."
"Escorial","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Escorial</b>.<div class=""content"">A small village about 50km. north-west of Madrid that gives its name to the palace and monastery built there by Philip II, containing one of the great treasure houses of Spanish art. Begun in 1563 by Juan Bautista de Toledo and finished in 1584 by Juan de Herrera, the huge complex of buildings in constructed entirely of granite and is overpoweringly austere. It comprises a royal palace and mausoleum combined with a Hieronymite monastery, college, and church. The plan is a large rectangle, roughly 160 m. × 200 m., and the layout has been compared to a gridiron, the attribute of St Lawrence, to whom the monastery was dedicated in acknowledgement of Philip II's victory over the French at St Quentin on St Lawrence's day, 1557. Philip II tried unsuccessfully to persuade <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a> to come to Spain to paint altarpieces for the Escorial; and El <a href=""entry://Greco, El""><span class=""links"">Greco </span></a> was rejected after his <i>St Maurice</i> had failed to obtain royal approval (1580). The Italian <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerists</span></a> Pellegrino <a href=""entry://Tibaldi, Pellegrino""><span class=""links"">Tibaldi </span></a> and Luca <a href=""entry://Cambiaso, Luca""><span class=""links"">Cambiaso</span></a> painted a number of altarpieces and large fresco decorations in the church, cloister, and library.

A school of painting was thus established at the Escorial, in which younger artists such as <a href=""entry://Ribalta, Francisco""><span class=""links"">Ribalta </span></a> were trained. The principal sculptors employed by Philip II included Leone and Pompeo <a href=""entry://Leoni, Leone""><span class=""links"">Leoni </span></a>. In 1688 Claudio <a href=""entry://Coello, Claudio""><span class=""links"">Coello </span></a> completed the sacristy altarpiece and a few years later Luca <a href=""entry://Giordano, Luca""><span class=""links"">Giordano </span></a> painted the vaults of the church and the cloister staircase.

"etching","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>etching</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to a method of engraving in which the design is bitten into the plate with acid, and also to the print so produced. The design is drawn on a metal (usually copper) plate that has been coated with a waxy, acid-resistant substance. Where the waxy coating is scratched through with the etching needle the bare metal is exposed, and when the plate is placed in a bath of acid the acid bites only the lines so exposed. The depth to which the lines are bitten (and hence the darkness with which they will print) depends on how long the plate is immersed in the acid, and it is possible to achieve subtle variations of tone by ‘stopping out’ part of the design (covering it with a protective varnish) while other parts are bitten more deeply. Etching was developed in the early 16th cent. as a shortcut to engraving metal, but it soon became an independent art form, and it reached exalted heights in the hands of <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a>, the greatest of all etchers. Etching is a much more spontaneous technique than <a href=""entry://line engraving""><span class=""links"">line engraving</span></a>, as it is possible to draw on the waxy ground with virtually the same fluency as with pen or pencil. By the early 19th cent. etching was used mainly for commercial illustration, but from the 1860s to the First World War there was a great renewal of interest in it as a medium for original expression, especially in Britain. <a href=""entry://Whistler, James Abbott McNeill""><span class=""links"">Whistler </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Sickert, Walter Richard""><span class=""links"">Sickert </span></a> were leading lights of this movement, which is called the Etching Revival.

His paintings are often of mythological or historical subjects, sometimes on an ambitious scale, but he also made life studies in the RA Schools throughout his career, and these are now probably his most admired works. Etty was poor for much of his life and his pictures were often attacked for their alleged indecency, <i>The Times</i> considering them ‘entirely too luscious for the public eye’. However, by the time of his death he was a celebrated figure and his works had begun to fetch high prices. He summed up his attitude to his favourite subject thus: ‘Finding God's most glorious work to be Woman, that all human beauty had been concentrated in her, I dedicated myself to painting&mdash;not the Draper's or Milliner's work&mdash;but God's most glorious work, more finely than ever had been done.’ His draughtmanship is often criticized, but it is generally agreed that he attained a glowing voluptuousness in the painting of flesh that few British artists have approached. The best collection of Etty's work is in the City Art Gallery, York."

"Expressionism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Expressionism</b>.<div class=""content"">A term used in the history and criticism of the arts to denote the use of distortion and exaggeration for emotional effect. It is used in several different ways and can be applied to various art forms, but is chiefly associated with the visual arts. In its broadest sense it can be used of any art that raises subjective feeling above objective observation, reflecting the state of mind of the artist rather than images that conform to what we see in the external world. The paintings of <a href=""entry://Grünewald, Mathis""><span class=""links"">Grünewald </span></a> and El <a href=""entry://Greco, El""><span class=""links"">Greco </span></a>, who conveyed intense religious emotion through distorted, unnaturalistic forms, are outstanding examples of expressionism in this sense (when used in this way the word is usually spelled with a small ‘e’). In a narrower sense, the word Expressionism is applied to a broad trend in modern European art that traces its origin to van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a>, who used colour and line emotionally ‘to express
man's terrible passions’. Among the great artists who represent Expressionism in this sense are <a href=""entry://Ensor, James""><span class=""links"">Ensor</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Munch, Edvard""><span class=""links"">Munch</span></a>. In its narrowest sense, the term Expressionism is applied to one aspect of the trend just described&mdash;a movement that was the dominant force in German art from about 1905 to about 1930. The <a href=""entry://Brücke, Die""><span class=""links"">Brücke</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Blaue Reiter, Der""><span class=""links"">Blaue Reiter</span></a> groups represent the high point of German Expressionism, and led, in the case of <a href=""entry://Kandinsky, Wassily""><span class=""links"">Kandinsky </span></a>, for example, to abstraction. Expressionism represented a rebellion against the naturalism of 19th-cent. art, and its insistence on the supreme importance of the artist's personal feelings has been one of the foundations of aesthetic attitudes in the 20th cent."
"Eyck, Jan van","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Eyck, Jan van</b><div class=""content""><i>(d. 1441).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The most celebrated painter of the Early Netherlandish School. Within a short time of his death he had a reputation on both sides of the Alps as a painter of great stature and importance, and although he is no longer credited with being the ‘inventor’ of <a href=""entry://oil paint""><span class=""links"">oil painting</span></a>, as was long maintained, his fame has continued undimmed to the present day. Nothing is known of his training and he is first recorded in 1422, entering the service of the Count of Holland, John of Bavaria, in The Hague. In 1425 John died and later in the same year van Eyck moved to Lille when he was appointed court painter and ‘varlet de chambre’ (equerry) to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, a post he held until his death. Evidently he was highly esteemed by the Duke and he travelled on secret diplomatic missions to Spain and Portugal for him. About 1430 Jan moved from Lille to Bruges, where he lived until his death. In spite of the documentation on his life, which for a painter of his period is fairly rich, his <i>œuvre</i> presents many problems, especially in the reconstruction of his early career, for all his dated paintings come from the last 10 years of his life. The central problem of his career&mdash;and one of the most discussed in the history of art&mdash;concerns the work that has always been the basis of his resounding fame, the great altarpiece of the <i>Adoration of the Lamb</i> (completed 1432) in Ghent Cathedral. An inscription on the frame states that it was begun by ‘the painter Hubert van Eyck, than whom none was greater’, and completed by ‘Jan, second in art’. Jan's brother <i>Hubert</i> (died 1426?) is such an obscure figure that some scholars have even denied his existence, and there is certainly no obvious division into the work of two hands in the altarpiece. Thus, Jan's contribution to the central masterpiece of Early Netherlandish painting is uncertain. <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a> called the Ghent Altarpiece ‘a stupendous painting’ and the comment is appropriate both to the majesty and <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">iconographical</span></a> richness of the huge <a href=""entry://polyptych""><span class=""links"">polyptych</span></a>, and also to its breathaking technical mastery. Jan brought the new technique of oil painting to a sudden peak and his ability to depict minute detail and to create glowing effects of colour has never been surpassed. Apart from the Ghent Altarpiece, about two dozen other paintings are reasonably attributed to him. They are all either religious works or portraits, although he is known to have painted pictures of other subjects (including a nude woman at her bath), which are now lost. Outstanding among the surviving works are the famous double portrait <i>Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife</i> (NG, London, 1434) and two paintings of the Virgin and Child with <a href=""entry://donor""><span class=""links"">donors</span></a>&mdash;<i>The Madonna of Chancellor Rolin</i> (Louvre, Paris, <i>c.</i>1435) and <i>The Madonna with Canon van der Paele</i> (Groeningemuseum, Bruges, 1436). The Louvre painting, with large figures in the foregound set against a distant panoramic landscape, shows Jan's all-embracing vision of the natural world and his mastery of light and space, as well as detail and texture&mdash;in Erwin <a href=""entry://Panofsky, Erwin""><span class=""links"">Panofsky's </span></a> words, ‘his eye was at one and the same time a microscope and a telescope’. The <i>Man in a Red Turban</i> (NG, London, 1433) is generally considered to be a self-portrait. As a portrait painter Jan was preoccupied with the realities and textures of the human face, and in this as in his inanimate interiors he recorded the subtleties of appearances rather than commenting on them as did his great contemporary Rogier van der <a href=""entry://Weyden, Rogier van der""><span class=""links"">Weyden </span></a>. His portraits do, however, convey a sense of inner life and are not simply coldly objective records. Jan stands with the <a href=""entry://Master of Flémalle""><span class=""links"">Master of Flémalle</span></a> as the founder of the Early Netherlandish School and his technique became the accepted model for his successors. His closest follower and chief successor in Bruges was Petrus <a href=""entry://Christus, Petrus""><span class=""links"">Christus </span></a>, but his influence was wide (it is seen, for example, in the work of Luis <a href=""entry://Dalmau, Luis""><span class=""links"">Dalmau </span></a> in Spain) and profound. In the Netherlands itself, however, the more emotional work of Rogier van der Weyden came to have even more influence and the very perfection of Jan's work must have made him the most daunting of models."
"Fabritius, Carel","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Fabritius, Carel</b><div class=""content""><i>(1622&ndash;54).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter. He was <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt's </span></a> most gifted pupil and a painter of outstanding originality and distinction, but he died tragically young in the explosion of the Delft gunpowder magazine, leaving only a tiny body of work (much may have perished in the disaster). In his youth he worked as a carpenter (the name Fabritius was once thought to have derived from this profession, but it is now known that his father had used it) and he was probably in Rembrandt's studio in the early 1640s. He settled in Delft in about 1650. Although only about a dozen paintings by him are known, they show great variety. His earliest surviving works (<i>The Raising of Lazarus</i>, National Mus., Warsaw, <i>c.</i>1645) are strongly influenced by Rembrandt, but he broke free from his master and developed a personal style marked by an exquisite feeling for cool colour harmonies and (even though he often worked on a small scale) unerring handling of a loaded brush (<i>The Goldfinch</i>, Mauritshuis, The Hague, 1654). These qualities, together with an interest in <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a>, occur in the work of <a href=""entry://Vermeer, Jan""><span class=""links"">Vermeer</span></a>, the greatest of Delft painters, and Fabritius certainly influenced him, although it is not likely (as is sometimes maintained) that he was his master, this distinction perhaps belonging to <a href=""entry://Bramer, Leonaert""><span class=""links"">Bramer </span></a>. Carel's brother <i>Barent</i> (1624&ndash;73) was also a painter, but of much lesser quality. He also may have studied with Rembrandt ; he mainly painted portraits and religious works."

Falconet was perhaps the most quintessentially <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> of all French sculptors, his forté being gently erotic figures such as the celebrated <i>Bather</i> (1757) in the Louvre. Like many other of his works, this was reproduced in porcelain by the Sèvres factory, of which he was Director from 1757 to 1766, a position that he gained through the influence of his patron Mme de Pompadour. Falconet had other sides to his talent, however, and his masterpiece&mdash;the equestrian statue of Peter the Great in St Petersburg&mdash;is in a completely different vein. He went to Russia in 1766, recommended to Catherine II by <a href=""entry://Diderot, Denis""><span class=""links"">Diderot</span></a>, and left in 1778, the statue being unveiled in 1782. The huge horse is represented with its forelegs raised and unsupported&mdash;a daring technical feat&mdash;and the heroic vigour of the statue gives it a place among the greatest examples of the type. Falconet suffered a stroke in 1783 and thereafter produced no more sculpture, devoting himself to writing. A six-volume edition of his writings had already appeared in 1781 and in 1761 he had published his best-known literary work, <i>Réflexions sur la sculpture</i>. In this he was one of the first to argue that the modern artists were superior to those of the ancient world (it is significant that unlike most of his distinguished contemporaries he never saw the need to visit Italy)."

He studied in Düsseldorf, Antwerp, and Paris (with <a href=""entry://Couture, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Couture</span></a>), then lived in Italy from 1855 to 1873. His father was a professor of classical archaeology (he had written a book on the <i><a href=""entry://Apollo Belvedere""><span class=""links"">Apollo Belvedere</i></a></span>) and the son grew up in an atmosphere saturated with the high-minded ideals of humanistic philosophy. He wished to become the founder of a new school which was to combine noble, didactic, and idealistic subjects with a style derived from the <a href=""entry://Grand Manner""><span class=""links"">Grand Manner</span></a> of Venetian 16th-cent. painting. His subjects are usually taken from Greek antiquity&mdash;in the case of his most celebrated painting, from one of Plato's Dialogues (<i>The Symposium,</i> Kunsthalle, Hamburg, 1869). Feuerbach's fervent desire to preach a philosophy through pictorial means was usually a source of weakness rather than strength, and his best works are now generally considered to be his portraits of his model and mistress Nanna Risi, which have a statuesque beauty lacking in his more elaborate paintings; she also posed for subject pictures such as <i>Iphigenia</i> (Hessisches Landesmuseum, Darmstadt, 1862). Feuerbach went to Vienna in 1873 to become Professor of History Painting at the Academy, but he returned to Italy in 1876 after criticism of his ceiling of <i>The Fall of the Titans</i> for the Academy. Throughout his life he complained that he was being misunderstood and not receiving the recognition due to a very great artist. It is this element of self-pity which makes his book <i>Ein Vermächtnis</i> (A Testament) one of the most pathetic and repellent autobiographies ever written. It was posthumously published in 1882."

The founder, the 7th Viscount Fitzwilliam (1745&ndash;1816), bequeathed to the University a typical gentleman's collection of the 18th cent., which included Italian High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> paintings, and the best collection of <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a> etchings then in England.

It opened to the public in 1848. Among the bequests to the museum the most noteworthy after the founder's was that of Charles Brinsley Marlay (1831&ndash;1912), which enriched all departments. Sir Sydney Cockerell (1867&ndash;1962) has been the most remarkable director of the museum (1908&ndash;37). According to <i>The Dictionary of National Biography</i>, he ‘transformed a dreary and ill-hung provincial gallery into one which set a new standard of excellence which was to influence museums all over the world. This he achieved by the skilful and uncrowded display of pictures against suitable backgrounds, and by the introduction of fine pieces of furniture, Persian rugs, and flowers provided and arranged by lady admirers, fired by his enthusiasm.’ In Cockerell's own words, ‘I found it a pig stye, I turned it into a palace.’ The museum's collections are now extremely wideranging; the areas of greatest richness include Italian painting and Greek coins."

The designs he produced for Wedgwood not only strengthened his interest in <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> art but also developed the innate sensitivity to line that was his greatest gift. At the same time he gradually built up a practice as a sculptor. In 1787 he went to Rome to direct the Wedgwood studio and stayed for seven years. While there he drew his illustrations, much influenced by Greek vase painting, to the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>, engraved and published in Rome in 1793, followed by illustrations to Aeschylus (1795) and Dante (1802). These engravings, which are of exceptional purity of outline, were republished in several editions, and won him international fame. His later illustrations to Hesiod (1817) were engraved by Blake . He returned to England in 1794 with a well-established reputation and immediately became a busy sculptor. His monument to the poet William Collins (Chichester Cathedral, 1795) and the more important one to Lord Mansfield (Westminster Abbey, 1795&ndash;1801) were commissioned while he was in Rome. His enormous practice as a maker of monuments included large groups with free-standing figures (<i>Lord Nelson</i>, St Paul's Cathedral, 1809), but his most characteristic work appears in simpler and smaller monuments, sometimes cut in low <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a>. In these his great gift for linear design was given full play. Flaxman was appointed the first Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy in 1810 and his reputation among Neoclassical sculptors was exceeded only by those of <a href=""entry://Canova, Antonio""><span class=""links"">Canova </span></a> and possibly <a href=""entry://Thorvaldsen ""><span class=""links"">Thorvaldsen </span></a>.

"Fontainebleau, School of","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Fontainebleau, School of</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to artists working in a style associated with the French court at Fontainebleau in the 16th cent. The palace at Fontainebleau was the most brilliant expression of the ambition of Francis I (reigned 1515&ndash;47) to glorify the French crown by emulating the lavish patronage of the great humanist princes of Italy. As France lacked an indigenous tradition of mural painting adequate to his grandiose conceptions, he brought in Italian masters to lead the work, which was carried out between 1528 and 1558. The two most important Italians to work at Fontainebleau were <a href=""entry://Rosso, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Rosso </span></a>, who came to France in 1531, and <a href=""entry://Primaticcio, Francesco""><span class=""links"">Primaticcio </span></a>, who followed in 1532. The Italian masters succeeded in adapting their own styles to the courtly ideals of the French taste and were assisted by French and Flemish artists. From the combination was born a distinctive style of <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerism</span></a>, a composite of sensuality and decorative flair, of boudoir voluptuousness and etiolated elegance. Many engravings were made of the work at Fontainebleau and the union of <a href=""entry://stucco""><span class=""links"">stucco</span></a> ornament with mural painting introduced an original feature which had wide influence. Much of the stucco-work was in high <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a>, but Rosso also developed a distinctive motif known as strapwork, in which the stucco is formed into shapes resembling leather or parchment that has been rolled and cut into decorative patterns; this became a particularly popular form of ornament in England and the Low Countries. Primaticcio's distinctive figure style&mdash;characterized by long limbs, small heads, and sharp, elegant profiles&mdash;became virtually canonical in French art until the end of the 16th cent. Other Italian artists who worked at Fontainebleau included Niccolò dell' <a href=""entry://Abbate, Niccolò dell'""><span class=""links"">Abbate </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Cellini, Benvenuto""><span class=""links"">Cellini </span></a>, but much of the work associated with the school is by unknown hands, although often of high quality, such as the celebrated painting of <i>Diana the Huntress</i> (<i>c.</i>1550) in the Louvre. The mythological subject matter, elongated elegance, idyllic landscape setting, and air of sophisticated artificiality in this work are wholly typical of the School, the influence of which left few French artists of the time untouched. After the hiatus caused by the Wars of Religion (1562&ndash;98) the decorative painting of royal palaces was revived under the patronage of Henry IV (reigned 1589&ndash;1610). The name <i>Second School of Fontainebleau</i> is usually given to the artists who carried out this work for Henry IV, notably Ambroise Dubois (1542/3&ndash;1614), Toussaint Dubreuil (1561&ndash;1602), and Martin Fréminet (1567&ndash;1619). Their work was accomplished, but without the inventive brilliance of the best work of the First School."

"Fouquet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Fouquet </b>
<i>(or Foucquet ), Jean</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1420&ndash;<i>c.</i>1481).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> The outstanding French painter of the 15th cent. He was born at Tours and is known to have been in Rome between 1443, and 1447, when he painted a portrait, now lost, of Pope Eugenius IV. Much has been made of this Italian journey, the influence of which can be detected in the <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a> effects and classical architecture of his subsequent works, but the strongly sculptural character of his painting, which was deeply rooted in his native tradition, did not succumb to Italian influence. On his return from Italy Fouquet entered the service of the French court. His first patron was Étienne Chevalier, the royal secretary and lord treasurer, for whom he produced a <a href=""entry://Book of Hours""><span class=""links"">Book of Hours</span></a> (1450&ndash;60), now dismembered but mainly in the Musée Condé at Chantilly, and who appears in the <i>Diptych of Melun</i> (<i>c.</i>1450), now divided between Antwerp (Musée Royal) and Berlin (Staatliche Museen). The Virgin in this work, at Antwerp, is rumoured to be a portrait of Agnes Sorel, Charles VII's mistress, whom Chevalier had also loved. It was not until 1475 that Fouquet became Royal Painter (to Louis XI), but in the previous year he was asked to prepare designs for the king's tomb, and he must have been the leading court artist for many years. Whether he worked on <a href=""entry://miniature""><span class=""links"">miniatures</span></a> or on a larger scale in panel paintings, Fouquet's art had the same clarity and dignity, his figures being modelled in broad planes defined by lines of magnificent purity. His sculptural sense of form went with a cool and detached temperament, and in his finest works the combination creates a deeply impressive gravity."
"Fragonard, Jean-Honoré","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Fragonard, Jean-Honoré</b><div class=""content""><i>(1732&ndash;1806).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter whose scenes of frivolity and gallantry are among the most complete embodiments of the <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> spirit. He was a pupil of <a href=""entry://Chardin, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon""><span class=""links"">Chardin </span></a> for a short while and also of <a href=""entry://Boucher, François""><span class=""links"">Boucher </span></a>, before winning the <a href=""entry://Prix de Rome""><span class=""links"">Prix de Rome</span></a> in 1752. From 1756 to 1761 he was in Italy, where he eschewed the work of the approved masters of the High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, but formed a particular admiration for <a href=""entry://Tiepolo, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Tiepolo </span></a>. He travelled and drew landscapes with Hubert <a href=""entry://Robert, Hubert""><span class=""links"">Robert </span></a> and responded with especial sensitivity to the gardens of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli, memories of which occur in paintings throughout his career. In 1765 he became a member of the <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">Academy</span></a> with his historical picture in the <a href=""entry://Grand Manner""><span class=""links"">Grand Manner</span></a>
<i>Coroesus Sacrificing himself to Save Callirhoe</i> (Louvre, Paris). He soon abandoned this idiom, however, for the erotic canvases by which he is chiefly known (<i>The Swing</i>, Wallace Coll., London, <i>c.</i>1766). After his marriage in 1769 he also painted children and family scenes. He stopped exhibiting at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> in 1767 and almost all his work was done for private patrons. Among them was Mme du Barry, Louis XV's most beautiful mistress, for whom he painted the works that are often regarded as his masterpieces&mdash;the four canvases representing <i>The Progress of Love</i> (Frick Coll., New York, 1771&ndash;3). These, however, were returned by Mme du Barry and it seems that taste was already turning against Fragonard's lighthearted style. He tried unsuccessfully to adapt himself to the new <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> vogue, but in spite of the admiration and support of <a href=""entry://David, Jacques-Louis""><span class=""links"">David </span></a> he was ruined by the Revolution and died in poverty. Fragonard was a prolific painter, but he rarely dated his works and it is not easy to chart his stylistic development. Alongside those of Boucher, his paintings seem to sum up an era. His delicate colouring, witty characterization, and spontaneous brushwork ensured that even his most erotic subjects are never vulgar, and his finest work has an irresistible verve and joyfulness."

His son <i>Meredith</i> (1894&ndash;1984) was a painter, primarily of portraits. He gave up painting in 1945 because his sight was failing and was almost entirely forgotten until an exhibition of his work was held at the Tate Gallery in 1982, revealing him as an artist of great distinction. His work is beautifully finished, with an almost hypnotic clarity (the images seem almost palpable yet at the same time strangely remote), and he excelled in conveying the intellectual qualities of his sitters.

As a sculptor, his major works are four bronze angels (1489&ndash;97) on the high altar of Siena Cathedral. Francesco was widely travelled, and the latter part of his career was spent mainly as an architect and engineer, particularly a specialist in fortifications. He is also said to have exploded the first mine.

He has visited Japan several times, and the thin texture of his paint, his drip and splash technique, and his asymmetrical balance of colour against powerful voids (he often left areas of canvas blank) have led critics to speak of influences from Japanese traditions of contemplative art. In 1961 Francis returned to his native California, settling first at Santa Barbara and then in Santa Monica. From the mid-1960s the feeling of oriental simplicity in his painting increased, bringing his work into closer affinity with <a href=""entry://Minimal art""><span class=""links"">Minimal art</span></a>.

His early works were frequently life-lize; the late ones were small, usually done on copper, and crowded with exotic figures and accessories. Frans II frequently adopted his father's subjects and style, but his range was wider. He painted landscapes and <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes as well as historical pictures, and was also one of the first artists to use the interior of a picture gallery as a subject, giving faithful miniature reproductions of the works in the collection.

In her early work she was influenced by Jackson <a href=""entry://Pollock, Jackson""><span class=""links"">Pollock </span></a> and she developed his drip technique by pouring and running very thin paint on the canvas like washes of watercolour. She first used this method in <i>Mountains and Sea</i> (artist's collection, on loan to NG, Washington, 1952), which is regarded as one of the seminal works of post-war American painting. It particularly impressed Morris <a href=""entry://Louis, Morris""><span class=""links"">Louis </span></a> and Kenneth <a href=""entry://Noland, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Noland </span></a> when they saw it in 1953. In 1962 Frankenthaler switched from oil to acrylic paint, which allowed her to achieve more richly saturated colour. Her limpid veils of colour float on the surface of the canvas, but they often evoke suggestions of landscape. Since 1960 Frankenthaler has also made aquatints, lithographs, and woodcuts; in 1964 she began to work in ceramics; and in 1972 she made her first sculpture.

"fresco","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fresco</b>.<div class=""content"">A method of wall-painting in which pure powdered <a href=""entry://pigment""><span class=""links"">pigments</span></a> mixed in water are applied to wet plaster freshly laid on the wall (the word ‘fresco’ is Italian for ‘fresh’). The paint fuses with the plaster, making the picture an integral part of the wall.

<a href=""entry://secco""><i><span class=""links"">secco</i></span></a> or simply <i>secco</i>. <i>Buon fresco</i> is exceptionally permanent in dry climates, but if damp penetrates the wall, the plaster is liable to crumble and the paint with it. Consequently the art has been practised chiefly in dry countries, particularly in Italy (though not in Venice), and seldom in northern Europe. The technique is of great antiquity, going back to Greek times, and it is also found outside Europe, for example in China and India. <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto</span></a> was the first really great master of fresco, and thereafter many of the leading Italian masters produced works in the medium.

He was born in Berlin, a grandson of Sigmund Freud, came to England with his parents in 1931, and acquired British nationality in 1939. His earliest love was drawing, and he began to work full time as an artist after being invalided out of the Merchant Navy in 1942. In 1951 his <i>Interior at Paddington</i> (Walker Art Gal., Liverpool) won a prize at the Festival of Britain, and since then he has built up a formidable reputation as one of the most powerful contemporary figurative painters. Portraits and nudes are his specialities, often observed in arresting close-up. He prefers to paint people he knows well: ‘If you don't know them, it can only be like a travel book.’ His early work was meticulously detailed, so he has sometimes been described as a *‘<a href=""entry://realism""><span class=""links"">Realist</span></a>’ (or rather absurdly as a <a href=""entry://Superrealism""><span class=""links"">Superrealist</span></a>), but the subjectivity and intensity of his work has always set him apart from the sober tradition characteristic of most British figurative art since the Second World War.

He was intensely introspective and often melancholic (although his marriage at the age of 44 brought him much happiness), and he relied on deep contemplation to summon up mentally the images he was to put on canvas. ‘Close your bodily eye, so that you may see your picture first with your spiritual eye’, he wrote, ‘then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react on others from the outside inwards.’ Friedrich began with topographical drawings in pencil and sepia wash and did not take up oil painting until 1807. One of his first works in the new medium. <i>The Cross in the Mountains</i> (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden, 1808), caused great controversy because it was painted as an altarpiece, and to use a landscape in this unprecedented way was considered sacrilege by some critics. His choice of subjects often broke new ground and he discovered aspects of nature so far unseen: an infinite stretch of sea or mountains, snow-covered or fog-bound plains seen in the strange light of sunrise, dusk, or moonlight. He seldom uses obvious religious imagery, but his landscapes convey a sense of haunting spirituality. Friedrich had a severe stroke in 1835 and returned to his small sepias. He was virtually forgotten at the time of his death and his immediate influence was confined to members of his circle in Dresden, notably G. F. <a href=""entry://Kersting, Georg Friedrich""><span class=""links"">Kersting </span></a>, who sometimes painted the figures in Friedrich's work. It was only at the end of the 19th cent., with the rise of <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolism</span></a>, that his greatness began to be recognized. Most of his work is still in Germany; <i>Winter Landscape</i>, acquired by the National Gallery, London, in 1988, is the first Friedrich oil to enter a British public collection."

He took a first-class degree in natural sciences at Cambridge in 1888, but was already more interested in art, and in the 1890s he built up a reputation as a writer and lecturer (and a much more modest one as a painter). His success as a public speaker depended partly on his mellifluous voice; George Bernard Shaw said it was one of only two he knew that were worth listening to for its own sake&mdash;the other was that of the actor Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson . He was Curator of Paintings at the <a href=""entry://Metropolitan Museum of Art""><span class=""links"">Metropolitan Museum of Art</span></a>, New York, 1906&ndash;10, but in the year he took up this appointment he ‘discovered’ <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a> and turned his attention away from the Italian Old Masters, with whom he had established his scholarly reputation, to become his period's most eloquent champion of modern French painting. After returning to London in 1910 he organized two exhibitions of <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionist</span></a> painting at the Grafton Galleries (1910 and 1912) that are regarded as milestones in the history of British taste. They attracted an enormous amount of publicity, most of it unfavourable, and many people thought that Fry was a charlatan or possibly even insane. Certain young artists were immensely impressed by the exhibitions, however, and Fry became an influential figure among them. They included Vanessa <a href=""entry://Bell, Vanessa""><span class=""links"">Bell </span></a> and Duncan <a href=""entry://Grant, Duncan""><span class=""links"">Grant </span></a>, both of whom worked for the <a href=""entry://Omega Workshops""><span class=""links"">Omega Workshops</span></a>, which Fry founded in 1913.

Kenneth <a href=""entry://Clark, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Clark </span></a> called him ‘incomparably the greatest influence on taste since <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a>’ and said: ‘In so far as taste can be changed by one man, it was changed by Roger Fry .’ His books include monographs on <a href=""entry://Bellini""><span class=""links"">Bellini </span></a> (1899), Cézanne (1927), and <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a> (1930), an edition of <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds's</span></a>

<b>Fuseli, Henry</b>
<i>(Johann Heinrich Füssli )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1741&ndash;1825).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Swiss-born painter, draughtsman, and writer on art, active mainly in England, where he was one of the outstanding figures of the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> movement. He was the son of a portrait painter, <i>Johann Caspar Füssli </i> (1707&ndash;82), but he originally trained as a priest; he took holy orders in 1761, but never practised. In 1765 he came to London at the suggestion of the British Ambassador in Berlin, who had been impressed by his drawings. <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a> encouraged him to take up painting, and he spent the years 1770&ndash;8 in Italy, engrossed in the study of <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, whose elevated style he sought to emulate for the rest of his life. On his return he exhibited highly imaginative works such as <i>The Nightmare</i> (Detroit Institute of Arts, 1781), the picture that secured his reputation when it was shown at the Royal Academy in 1782 (there is another version in the Goethe-museum, Frankfurt). An unforgettable image of a woman in the throes of a violently erotic dream, this painting shows how far ahead of his time Fuseli was in exploring the murky areas of the psyche where sex and fear meet. His fascination with the horrifying and fantastic also comes out in many of his literary subjects, which formed a major part of his output; he painted several works for <a href=""entry://Boydell, John""><span class=""links"">Boydell's </span></a> Shakespeare Gallery, and in 1799 he followed this example by opening a Milton Gallery in Pall Mall with an exhibition of forty-seven of his own paintings.

His work can be clumsy and overblown, but at its best has something of the imaginative intensity of his friend <a href=""entry://Blake, William""><span class=""links"">Blake </span></a>, who described Fuseli as ‘The only man that e'er I knew / who did not make me almost spew’.

<b>Futurism</b>.<div class=""content"">Italian avant-grade art movement founded in 1909 by the poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti .

The aim of the movement, which was outlined in various manifestoes, was to break with the past and its academic culture and to celebrate modern technology, dynamism, and power. The rendering of motion was one of the key concerns of Futurist painters, and their work at times approached abstraction. As an organized movement Futurism did not last much beyond the death of Boccioni&mdash;its greatest figure&mdash;in 1916 or the end of the First World War, but it had wide influence, notably in Russia, where there was a Russian Futurist movement (which included <a href=""entry://Goncharova, Natalia""><span class=""links"">Goncharova </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Larionov, Mikhail""><span class=""links"">Larionov </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Malevich, Kasimir""><span class=""links"">Malevich </span></a>), and also in England, on Vorticism and <a href=""entry://Nevinson, C.

<b>Gabo, Naum</b>
<i>(Naum Neemia Pevsner )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1890&ndash;1977).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Russian-born sculptor who became an American citizen in 1952, the most influential exponent of <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivism</span></a>. He was the younger brother of Antoine <a href=""entry://Pevsner, Antoine""><span class=""links"">Pevsner </span></a>, and adopted the name Gabo in 1915 to avoid confusion between the two. After studying medicine, natural sciences, and engineering in Munich, he was introduced to avant-garde art when he visited his brother in Paris in 1913 and 1914, and in 1915 he began to make geometrical constructions in Oslo, where they had gone during the First World War. In 1917 the brothers returned to Russia and in 1920 they issued their <i>Realistic Manifesto</i>, which set forth the basic principles of Constructivism. When it became clear that official policy favoured the regimentation of artistic activity in the direction of socially useful work (as exemplified by <a href=""entry://Tatlin, Vladimir""><span class=""links"">Tatlin</span></a>), rather than the pure abstract art conceived by Gabo, the latter left Russia for Berlin in 1922 and spent the next ten years there in contact with the artists of the <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a> and the De <a href=""entry://Stijl, De""><span class=""links"">Stijl</span></a> group. In 1932 he moved to Paris and was active in the <a href=""entry://Abstraction-Création""><span class=""links"">Abstraction-Création</span></a> association until 1935, when he went to England, living first in London (where in 1937 he was co-editor of the Constructivist review <i><a href=""entry://Circle""><span class=""links"">Circle</i></a></span>) and then from 1939 in Cornwall (see <a href=""entry://St Ives School""><span class=""links"">ST IVES SCHOOL</span></a>). In 1946 Gabo moved to the USA, settling at Middlebury, Connecticut, in 1953. In the last three decades of his life he received many prestigious awards and carried out numerous public commissions in Europe and America. He often worked on themes over a long period; his <i>Torsion Fountain</i> outside St Thomas's Hospital in London, for example, was erected in 1975, but is a development from models he was making in the 1920s. (Small models are a feature of his work; there are numerous examples in the Tate Gallery, which has an outstanding collection of Gabo material.) Gabo never trained as an artist, but came to art by way of his studies of engineering and physical science, and was one of the first artists to embody in his work modern concepts of the nature of space. He was one of the earliest to experiment with <a href=""entry://Kinetic art""><span class=""links"">Kinetic</span></a> sculpture and to make extensive use of semi-transparent materials for a type of abstract sculpture that incorporates space as a positive element rather than displacing or enclosing it. He was throughout his life an advocate of the Constructivist idea not merely as an artistic movement but as the ideology of a lifestyle."
"Gaddi, Taddeo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gaddi, Taddeo</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1300&ndash;<i>c.</i>1366).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter, the son of a painter and mosaicist <i>Gaddo Gaddi </i> (<i>c.</i>1250&ndash;1327/30?). According to Cennino <a href=""entry://Cennini, Cennino""><span class=""links"">Cennini </span></a>, Taddeo was <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto's </span></a> godson and worked with him for twenty-four years. In 1347 he headed a list of the best living painters compiled for the purpose of choosing a master to paint a new high altarpiece for Pistoia Cathedral. His best-known works were painted for Sta Croce, Florence: notably the frescos devoted to the <i>Life of the Virgin</i> in the Baroncelli Chapel (finished 1338), and the panels illustrating the <i>Life of Christ</i> (<i>c.</i>1330), originally meant for the doors of a sacristy cupboard and now scattered among museums in Florence (Accademia), Munich (Alte Pinakothek), and Berlin (Staatliche Museen). Many other panels are attributed to him and he must have had a flourishing workshop. Although transmitting the tradition of Giotto, his style is less heroic and more anecdotal. Gaddi's son <i>Agnolo</i> (active 1369&ndash;96) continued the Giotto tradition but modified it still further in the direction of decorative elegance. He is particularly notable for his cool pale colours, which influenced the refined late <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> art of artists of the next generation such as <a href=""entry://Lorenzo Monaco""><span class=""links"">Lorenzo Monaco </span></a>. Agnolo's works include frescos on <i>The Story of the Cross</i> in the chancel of Sta Croce (after 1374) and on <i>The Story of the Virgin and her Girdle</i> in the Chapel of the Holy Girdle in Prato Cathedral (1392&ndash;5).

"Gainsborough, Thomas","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gainsborough, Thomas</b><div class=""content""><i>(1727&ndash;88).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter of portraits, landscapes, and <a href=""entry://fancy picture""><span class=""links"">fancy pictures</span></a>, one of the most individual geniuses in British art. He was born at Sudbury, Suffolk, and went to London in about 1740, probably studying with the French engraver <a href=""entry://Gravelot, Hubert-François""><span class=""links"">Gravelot </span></a>. He returned to Sudbury in 1748 and in 1752 he set up as a portrait painter at Ipswich. His work at this time consisted mainly of heads and half-lengths, but he also painted some small portrait groups in landscape settings which are the most lyrical of all English <a href=""entry://conversation piece""><span class=""links"">conversation pieces</span></a> (<i>Heneage Lloyd and his Sister</i>, Fitzwilliam, Cambridge). His patrons were the merchants of the town and the neighbouring squires, but when in 1759 he moved to Bath his new sitters were members of Society, and he developed a free and elegant mode of painting seen at its most characteristic in full-length portraits (<i>Mary, Countess Howe</i>, Kenwood House, London, <i>c.</i>1763&ndash;4). In 1768 he was elected a foundation member of the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a>, and in 1774 he moved permanently to London. Here he further developed the personal style he had evolved at Bath, working with light and rapid brush-strokes and delicate and evanescent colours. He became a favourite painter of the Royal Family, even though his rival <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a> was appointed King's Principal Painter. Gainsborough sometimes said that while portraiture was his profession landscape painting was his pleasure, and he continued to paint landscapes long after he had left a country neighbourhood. He produced many landscape drawings, some in pencil, some in charcoal and chalk, and he occasionally made drawings which he varnished. He also, in later years, painted fancy pictures of pastoral subjects (<i>Peasant Girl Gathering Sticks</i>, Manchester City Art Gal., 1782). Gainsborough's style had diverse sources. His early works show the influence of French engraving and of Dutch landscape painting; at Bath his change of portrait style owed much to a close study of van <a href=""entry://Dyck, Sir Anthony van""><span class=""links"">Dyck </span></a> (his admiration is most clear in <i>The Blue Boy</i>, Huntingdon Art Gal., San Marino, 1770); and in his later landscapes (<i>The Watering Place</i>, NG, London, 1777) he is sometimes influenced by <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>. But he was an independent and original genius, able to assimilate to his own ends what he learnt from others, and he relied always mainly on his own resources. With the exception of his nephew Gainsborough <a href=""entry://Dupont, Gainsborough""><span class=""links"">Dupont </span></a>, he had no assistants and unlike most of his contemporaries he never employed a drapery painter. He was in many ways the antithesis of Reynolds. Whereas Reynolds was sober-minded and the complete professional, Gainsborough (even though his output was prodigious) was much more easy-going and often overdue with his commissions, writing that ‘painting and punctuality mix like oil and vinegar’. Although he was an entertaining letter-writer, Gainsborough, unlike Reynolds, had no interest in literary or historical themes, his great passion outside painting being music (his friend William Jackson the composer wrote that he ‘avoided the company of literary men, who were his aversion
he detested reading’). Gainsborough and Reynolds had great mutual respect, however; Gainsborough asked for Reynolds to visit him on his deathbed, and Reynolds paid posthumous tribute to his rival in his Fourteenth <i>Discourse</i>. Recognizing the fluid brilliance of his brushwork, Reynolds praised ‘his manner of forming all the parts of a picture together’, and wrote of ‘all those odd scratches and marks’ that ‘by a kind of magic, at a certain distance
seem to drop into their proper places’."

A major figure in the <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolist</span></a> movements, Gallen-Kallela travelled widely and was well known outside Finland, particularly in Germany (he had a joint exhibition with <a href=""entry://Munch, Edvard""><span class=""links"">Munch</span></a> in Berlin in 1895 and exhibited with Die <a href=""entry://Brücke, Die""><span class=""links"">Brücke</span></a> in Dresden in 1910). He was deeply patriotic (he volunteered to fight in the War of Independence against Russia in 1918, even though he was in his fifties) and he was inspired mainly by the landscape and folklore of his country, above all by the Finnish national epic <i>Kalevala</i> (‘Land of Heroes’). His early work was in the 19th-cent. naturalistic tradition, but in the 1890s he developed a flatter, more stylized manner, well-suited to the depiction of heroic myth, with bold simplifications of form, strong outlines, and vivid&mdash;sometimes rather garish&mdash;colours. Apart from easel paintings, Gallen-Kallela's work included book illustrations (notably for an edition of <i>Kalevala</i>, 1922) and he did a number of murals for public buildings (including the Finnish National Museum, Helsinki, 1928). His designs for stained glass, fabrics, and jewellery gave an important stimulus to the development of Finnish crafts. He is regarded not only as his country's greatest painter, but also as the chief figure in the creation of a national art. His former house in Helsinki is now a museum dedicated to his work."

She married into a prominent Boston family and spent most of her life in that city, where she patronized numerous artistic causes (including the Boston Symphony Orchestra) and dazzled and occasionally scandalized polite society (she had love affairs and attended boxing matches).

The portrait shows off her celebrated figure (she wears her pearls round her waist rather than her neck) and was considered rather shocking&mdash;in the spirit of Sargent's earlier <i>Madame X</i> (it was rumoured that he and Mrs Gardner were lovers). Her husband, the financier Jack Gardner, died in 1898, and the following year she began building Fenway Court in Boston as both a home and a museum. The building, completed in 1902, is modelled on a Venetian Renaissance palace and incorporates various architectural fragments that she bought on her numerous trips to Europe. She supervised the construction with immense care, acting virtually as site foreman. In her will she left the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum to Boston as a public institution with the proviso that the collection should be maintained exactly as she had arranged it. The British art historian Sir Philip Hendy, who published a catalogue of the Gardner Museum in 1931, described it as ‘probably the finest collection of its compact size in the world’. In addition to paintings, sculpture, drawings, and prints, it contains objects of many other types, including furniture, textiles, ceramics, glassware, manuscripts, and books."

In 1910 he took up sculpture in Paris without formal training, and in the same year he met Sophie Brzeska, a Polish woman 20 years his senior, with whom he lived from that time, both of them adopting the hyphenated name. In 1911 they moved to London, which Gaudier had visited briefly in 1906 and 1908, and lived for a while in extreme poverty. He became a friend of Wyndham <a href=""entry://Lewis, Wyndham""><span class=""links"">Lewis </span></a> and other leading literary and artistic figures, and his work was shown in avant-garde exhibitions, such as the <a href=""entry://Vorticism""><span class=""links"">Vorticist</span></a> exhibition of 1915. In 1914 he enlisted in the French army and was killed in action the following year, aged 23. Gaudier developed with astonishing rapidity from a modelling style based upon <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a> towards a highly personal manner of carving in which shapes are radically simplified in a manner recalling <a href=""entry://Brancusi, Constantin""><span class=""links"">Brancusi </span></a> (<i>Red Stone Dancer</i>, Tate, London, 1913). In England, only <a href=""entry://Epstein, Sir Jacob""><span class=""links"">Epstein </span></a> was producing sculpture as stylistically advanced as Gaudier-Brzeska at this time.

In addition to his sculptures he left behind some splendid animal drawings."
"Gauguin, Paul","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gauguin, Paul</b><div class=""content""><i>(1848&ndash;1903).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionist</span></a> painter, sculptor, and printmaker, born in Paris of a journalist from Orleans and a Peruvian Creole mother. He spent his childhood in Lima, joined the merchant marine in 1865, and from 1872 worked successfully as a stockbroker. In the early 1870s he became a spare-time artist and in 1874 he met <a href=""entry://Pissarro, Camille""><span class=""links"">Pissarro </span></a> and saw the First <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> Exhibition. At about the same time he began to make a collection of Impressionist pictures. He had a landscape accepted by the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> in 1876 and his work was shown in the Fifth to Eighth (and last) Impressionist Exhibitions. In 1883 he gave up his employment to become a full-time artist, but had little success and sold his collection to support himself and his family. After the last Impressionist Exhibition in 1886 he moved to Brittany, abandoning his family, and until 1890 he spent much of his time at <a href=""entry://Pont-Aven, School of""><span class=""links"">Pont-Aven</span></a>, where he became the pivot of a group of artists who were attracted by his picturesque personality and new ideas in aesthetics. The most important work he produced there was <i>The Vision After the Sermon</i>, also known as <i>Jacob Wrestling with the Angel</i> (NG, Edinburgh, 1888), in which he broke away completely from the Impressionist style, using areas of pure, flat colour for expressive and symbolic purposes. In 1887&ndash;8 he went to Panama and Martinique, and in 1888 he spent a short time at Arles with van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a>, a visit which ended in a disastrous quarrel as van Gogh suffered one of his first attacks of madness. <br class=""nLine"" />Gauguin had had a taste for colourful, exotic places since his childhood in Peru and in 1891 he left France for Tahiti. In the book <i>Noa Noa</i>, which he wrote about his life there, he said: ‘I have escaped everything that is artificial and conventional. Here I enter into Truth, become one with nature. After the disease of civilization life in this new world is a return to health,’ His theory and practice of art reflected these attitudes. He was one of the first to find visual inspiration in the arts of ancient or primitive peoples, and reacted vigorously against the naturalism of the Impressionists and the scientific preoccupations of the <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionists</span></a>. As well as using colour unnaturalistically for its decorative or emotional effect he reintroduced emphatic outlines forming rhythmic patterns suggestive of Japanese colour prints (see <a href=""entry://Ukiyo-e""><i><span class=""links"">UKIYO-E</i></span></a>) or the technique of stained glass. Gauguin also did woodcuts in which the black and white areas formed rhythmical, almost abstract, patterns and the tool marks were incorporated as integral parts of the design. Along with those of Edvard <a href=""entry://Munch, Edvard""><span class=""links"">Munch </span></a>, these prints played an important part in the 20th-cent. revival of the art of woodcut&mdash;one of the salient features of modern graphic art. His other work included carving and pottery. In Tahiti Gauguin endeavoured to ‘go native’ and despite the constant pressure of poverty he painted his finest pictures there. His colours became more resonant, his drawing more grandly simplified, and his expression of the mysteries of life more profound. In 1893, however, poverty and ill-health forced him to return to France, but he had a financial windfall when an uncle died and he was back in Tahiti in 1895. At the end of 1897 he painted his largest and most famous picture, the allegory of life <i>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going To?</i> (Mus. of Fine Arts, Boston), before attempting suicide (although he had deserted his family he had been devastated that year by the news of the death of his favourite daughter). In September 1901 he settled at Dominica in the Marquesas Islands, where he died two years later. Until his death he worked continuously in the face of poverty, illness (he had syphilis), and lack of recognition. During his time in the South Seas he was often unable to obtain proper materials and was forced to spread his colours thinly on coarse sacking, but from these limitations he forged a style of rough vigour wholly appropriate to the boldness of his vision. <br class=""nLine"" />At the time of his death few would have agreed with Gauguin's self-assessment: ‘I am a great artist and I know it. It is because I am that I have endured such suffering.’ His reputation was firmly established, however, when 227 of his works were shown at the <a href=""entry://Salon d'Automne""><span class=""links"">Salon d'Automne</span></a> in Paris in 1906, and his influence has been enormous. The <a href=""entry://Nabis""><span class=""links"">Nabis</span></a> were formed under his inspiration, he was a leading figure of the <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolist</span></a> movement and one of the sources for <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauvism</span></a>. Later, he has been one of the major influences on the general non-naturalistic trend of 20th-cent. art. Because of the romantic appeal of his life and personality, particularly his willingness to sacrifice everything for his art, Gauguin has been with van Gogh the most common subject for popular and fictional biography, including the novel <i>The Moon and Sixpence</i> (1919) by Somerset Maugham, and the opera (1957) of the same title by John L. Gardner ."

His name means ‘Little Gerard of the Brethren of St John’, after the Order in Haarlem of which he was a lay-brother. For the monastery church of the Brethren he painted his only documented work, a <a href=""entry://triptych""><span class=""links"">triptych</span></a> of <i>The Crucifixion</i>, of which two large panels (originally two sides of a wing) survive (Kunsthistorisches Mus., Vienna): the <i>Lamentation of Christ</i> and the <i>Burning of the Bones of St John the Baptist</i>. Certain features of these paintings&mdash;particularly the slender, doll-like figures with smooth, rather egg-like heads&mdash;are highly distinctive, and a small <i>œuvre</i> of about fifteen paintings has been attributed to Geertgen on stylistic grounds. Unlike the Vienna panels, most of the other pictures given to him are fairly small. They include such remarkably beautiful works as <i>The Nativity</i> (NG, London), a radiant nocturnal scene, and <i>St John the Baptist in the Wilderness</i> (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), which shows an exquistite feeling for nature. The vein of tender melancholy that pervades Geertgen's work, the beguilingly innocent charm of his figures, and his sensitivity to light are perhaps the salient qualities that make him one of the most irresistibly attractive artists of the Early Netherlandish School."

<b>Gentile da Fabriano </b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1370&ndash;1427).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter named after his birthplace, Fabriano in the Marches. He carried out important commissions in several major Italian art centres and was recognized as one of the foremost artists of his day, but most of the work on which his great contemporary reputation was based has been destroyed. It included frescos in the Doges’ Palace in Venice (1408) and for St John Lateran in Rome (1427). In between he worked in Florence, Siena, and Orvieto. His major surviving work is the celebrated altarpiece of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (Uffizi, Florence, 1423), painted for the church of Sta Trinità in Florence, which places him alongside <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti</span></a> as one of the greatest exponents of the <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a> style in Italy.

<b>Gentileschi, Orazio</b>
<i>(Orazio Lomi )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1563&ndash;1639).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter. He was born in Pisa, but in about 1576 he settled in Rome. After working in a <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> style he became one of the closest and most gifted of <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio's </span></a> followers. He was one of the few <a href=""entry://Caravaggisti""><span class=""links"">Caravaggisti</span></a> who was a friend of the master, and in 1603 he and Caravaggio and two other artists were sued for libel by Giovanni <a href=""entry://Baglione, Giovanni""><span class=""links"">Baglione </span></a>. Gentileschi's work does not have the power and uncompromising naturalism of Caravaggio, tending rather towards the lyrical and refined. His graceful figures are stately and clearly disposed, with sharp-edged drapery&mdash;qualities recalling his Tuscan heritage. In 1621 he moved to Genoa, where he stayed until 1623; while there he painted an <i>Annunciation</i> (Galleria Sabauda, Turin) that is often considered his masterpiece. After working for Marie de <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Médicis </span></a> in Paris, he settled in England in 1626 and became court painter to Charles I. He was held in great esteem in England and remained until his death. His travels were a factor in spreading the Caravaggesque manner, but by the end of his career he had long abandoned heavy <a href=""entry://chiaroscuro""><i><span class=""links"">chiaroscuro</i></span></a> in favour of light colours. His major works in England were a series of ceiling paintings commissioned by Charles I for the Queen's House at Greenwich, now in Marlborough House, London (probably after 1635). His daughter <i>Artemisia Gentileschi </i> (1593&ndash;1652/3) was one of the greatest of Caravaggesque painters and a formidable personality. She was precociously gifted, built up a European reputation, and lived a life of independence rare for a woman of the time. Born in Rome, she worked mainly there and in Florence until she settled in Naples in 1630 (she also visited her father in England in 1638&ndash;40). Artemisia's powerful style&mdash;totally different to that of her father&mdash;is seen at its most characteristic in paintings of <i>Judith and Holofernes</i>, a subject she made her own (one of the finest examples is in the Uffizi, Florence). Her predilection for the bloodthirsty theme has been related to events in her own life. At the age of 19 she was allegedly raped by Agostino <a href=""entry://Tassi, Agostino""><span class=""links"">Tassi </span></a> (who was eventually acquitted of the charge) and was tortured during the legal proceedings; thus the fierce intensity with which she depicted a woman decapitating a man has been seen as pictorial ‘revenge’ for her sufferings."

His work is extraordinarily vivid and unconventional, capturing an intense feeling of inner life, as in the celebrated bust of a man in Strasburg (Musée de l'Œuvre, Notre-Dame), which is usually considered to be a self-portrait.

After the First World War he spent a good deal of time in the South of France for the sake of his delicate health (he had tuberculosis). Gertler was influenced by <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionism</span></a>, but his style was highly individual, with strong elements of Eastern European folk art. His favourite subjects included female portraits, still lifes, and nudes, such as the earthy and voluptuous <i>The Queen of Sheba</i> (1922) in the Tate Gallery, London, painted in his characteristic feverishly hot colours. The Tate also has his only piece of sculpture, <i>Acrobats</i> (1917), and the painting that is perhaps his best-known work, <i>Merry-Go-Round</i> (1916); in this powerful image&mdash;probably a satire on militarism&mdash;figures spin on fair-ground horses in a mad, futile whirl. Gertler had many admirers, including distinguished figures in the literary world; D. H. Lawrence made him the model for the sculptor Loerke in <i>Women in Love</i> (1920). The word ‘genius’ was frequently applied to him, and he was seen by many as the acceptable face of modernism. However, he began to lose popularity in the early 1930s when he adopted a more avant-garde style characterized by a flatter sense of space and a greater emphasis on surface pattern. He had always been subject to fits of depression, and after the failure of an exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery, London, in 1939, he committed suicide."

Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California, was opened in 1954, and in 1974 a new museum, housed in a re-creation of a Roman villa, was opened nearby. One of the archetypes of the eccentric, parsimonious millionaire, Getty lived in England from the 1950s and never saw his museum. On his death it became the most richly endowed museum in the world, and has become famous for its spectacular purchases (see <a href=""entry://Lysippus""><span class=""links"">LYSIPPUS</span></a>), which have aroused fears that it would monopolize the world market for masterpieces. The J. Paul Getty Trust, founded in 1953 ‘for the diffusion of artistic and general knowledge’, administers various bodies, including the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities (founded 1983) in Santa Monica, California (a centre for advanced research with a large library of photographs and books), and a Grant Program, which assists, for example, with the publication of scholarly works. <i>J. Paul Getty Jr.</i> (1932&ndash; ), one of Getty's five sons by his five wives, lives in England and has been a princely benefactor to British art institutions; most notably he gave £50,000,000 to the National Gallery, London, in 1985."

Marcus the Younger was probably the leading society portraitist in London at the peak of his career (his popularity declined after about 1615), but it is not easy to disentangle his work from that of some of his contemporaries.

"Ghiberti, Lorenzo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ghiberti, Lorenzo</b><div class=""content""><i>(1378&ndash;1455)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. Florentine sculptor, goldsmith, and designer. He came to prominence in 1401 when he competed successfully (defeating <a href=""entry://Brunelleschi, Filippo""><span class=""links"">Brunelleschi </span></a>, Jacopo della <a href=""entry://Quercia, Jacopo della""><span class=""links"">Quercia </span></a>, and others) for a commission, offered by the merchant guild, to make a pair of gilded bronze doors for the Baptistery of Florence. His competition <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> of <i>The Sacrifice of Isaac</i> is in the Bargello, Florence. Work on the doors lasted until 1424 and in 1425 he was asked to make a second pair for the same building, which occupied him until 1452. These two commissions necessitated the formation of a large workshop in which some of the outstanding Florentine artists of the period, including <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Masolino da Panicalec ""><span class=""links"">Masolino</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Uccello, Paolo""><span class=""links"">Uccello</span></a>, received at least part of their training. Ghiberti also served on the committee in charge of the architectural works of Florence Cathedral, designed stained-glass windows, goldsmiths’ work, and reliquaries, and made several life-size bronze statues. He was also a writer and left a large incomplete manuscript under the title of <i>Commentarii</i>. Apart from a survey of ancient art based on <a href=""entry://Pliny the Elder""><span class=""links"">Pliny</span></a> and notes on the science of optics, this manuscript contains valuable records of Italian painters and sculptors of the trecento, and also Ghiberti's autobiography, the first by an artist that has survived. The same interest in the new humanist ideals that is reflected in Ghiberti's writings also prompted him to collect <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> sculptures. Despite this prominent place which Ghiberti occupies in the classical revival, his style was deeply rooted in the tradition of <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> craftsmanship. Not only was his first pair of Baptistery doors closely modelled on the pattern of Andrea <a href=""entry://Pisano, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Pisano's </span></a> earlier doors, but its twenty episodes from the Life of Christ and its eight saints reflect the <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a> style with its emphasis on graceful lines, lyrical sentiment, and minute attention to landscape detail. While these traits survive in Ghiberti's second pair of doors, they are here subordinated to the new principles of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. The doors are divided into ten large panels in which episodes from the Old Testament are represented on carefully constructed <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a> stages. As most of these reliefs were planned and laid out by 1437, they must rank among the most ‘advanced’ works of Florentine art, particularly in the mastery of composition within a spatial framework. The fame of these doors has always stood high. <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo's</span></a> dictum, recorded by <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>, that they were worthy to form the Gates of Paradise secured their prestige even in times less sympathetic to <a href=""entry://quattrocento""><span class=""links"">quattrocento</span></a> art."

<b>Ghirlandaio, Domenico</b><div class=""content""><i>(1449&ndash;94).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter. He trained with <a href=""entry://Baldovinetti, Alesso""><span class=""links"">Baldovinetti</span></a> and possibly with <a href=""entry://Verrocchio, Andrea del""><span class=""links"">Verrocchio</span></a>. His style was solid, prosaic, and rather old-fashioned (especially when compared with that of his great contemporary <a href=""entry://Botticelli, Sandro""><span class=""links"">Botticelli</span></a>), but he was an excellent craftsman and good businessman and had one of the most prosperous workshops in Florence. In this he was assisted by his two younger brothers, <i>Benedetto</i> (1458&ndash;97) and <i>Davide</i> (1452&ndash;1525). His largest undertaking was the fresco cycle in the choir of Sta Maria Novella, Florence, illustrating <i>Scenes from the Lives of the Virgin and St John the Baptist</i> (1486&ndash;90). This was commissioned by Giovanni Tornabuoni, a partner in the <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici</span></a> bank, and Ghirlandaio depicts the sacred story as if it had taken place in the home of a wealthy Florentine burgher. It is this talent for portraying the life and manners of his time (he often included portraits in his religious works) that has made Ghirlandaio popular with many visitors to Florence. But he also had considerable skill in the management of complex compositions and a certain grandeur of conception that sometimes hints at the High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. Ghirlandaio worked on frescos in Pisa, San Gimignano, and Rome (in the Sistine Chapel) as well as in Florence, and his studio produced numerous altarpieces. He also painted portraits, the finest of which is <i>Old Man and his Grandson</i> (Louvre, Paris); this depicts the grandfather's diseased features with ruthless realism, but has a remarkable air of tenderness. Ghirlandaio's son and pupil <i>Ridolfo</i> (1483&ndash;1561) was a friend of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> and a portrait painter of some distinction. Domenico's most famous pupil, however, was <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>."
"Giacometti, Alberto","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Giacometti, Alberto</b><div class=""content""><i>(1901&ndash;66).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Swiss sculptor and painter, active mainly in Paris. He was the son of Giovanni Giacometti (1868&ndash;1933), a painter influenced by <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionism</span></a>. After short periods at the École des Arts et Métiers, Geneva, and in Italy, he went to Paris and there worked under <a href=""entry://Bourdelle, Émile-Antoine""><span class=""links"">Bourdelle</span></a> from 1922 to 1925. He abandoned naturalistic sculpture in 1925, however, and went through a period of restless experimentation. From 1930 to 1935 he participated in the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealist</span></a> movement, developing a highly individual attenuated manner and open-cage construction exemplified in <i>The Palace at 4 a.m.</i> (MOMA, New York, 1933). Giacometti abandoned Surrealism in 1935, however, and began to work again from the model. In 1941&ndash;5 he lived in Geneva, but then returned to Paris, and his most characteristic style emerged in 1947, featuring ‘transparent constructions’ of human figures, sometimes disposed in groups, notable for their emaciated, extremely elongated, and nervous character (<i>Man Pointing</i>, Tate, London, 1947). His isolated figures often have a suggestion of existentialist tragedy, and he was indeed a friend of the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, who wrote on Giacometti's work, notably the introduction to the catalogue of his exhibition at the Pierre Matisse Gallery, New York, in 1948. It was this exhibition that established Giacometti's post-war reputation, and his work soon had widespread influence, which can be seen, for example, in many of the entries for the <i>Unknown Political Prisoner</i> competition of 1953 (see <a href=""entry://Butler, Reg""><span class=""links"">BUTLER, REG</span></a>). He impressed many people not only through the quality of his work, but also by his force of personality, integrity, and devotion to his work. Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre's companion, wrote: ‘Success, fame, money&mdash;Giacometti was indifferent to them all.’ He is generally considered one of the outstandingly original sculptors of the 20th cent., and from the late 1950s his reputation as a painter began to increase. Most of his paintings and drawings are portraits of his family and friends; his brother Diego, who was a skilled technician and a life-long assistant, was a favourite model and the subject of dozens of sculptures, paintings, and drawings. Their cousin <i>Augusto Giacometti </i> (1877&ndash;1947) was a painter, one of the first to produce pure abstracts."
"Giambologna","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Giambologna </b>
<i>(Giovanni Bologna or Jean Boulogne )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1529&ndash;1608).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish-born Italian sculptor. He was the greatest sculptor of the age of <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerism</span></a> and for about two centuries after his death his reputation was second only to that of <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>. In about 1550 he went to Italy to study and spent 2 years in Rome. On the way back he stopped in Florence and was based there for the rest of his life. The work that made his name, however, was for Bologna&mdash;the <i>Fountain of Neptune</i> (1563&ndash;6), with its impressive nude figure of Neptune which he had designed for a similar fountain in Florence (<a href=""entry://Ammanati, Bartolommeo""><span class=""links"">Ammanati</span></a> defeated him in the competition). Even before working on the fountain in Bologna, however, Giambologna had begun in Florence the first of a series of celebrated marble groups that in their mastery of complex twisting poses mark one of the high-points of Mannerist art: <i>Samson Slaying a Philistine</i> (V&amp;A, London, <i>c.</i>1561&ndash;2); <i>Florence Triumphant over Pisa</i> (Bargello, Florence, completed 1575); <i>The Rape of a Sabine</i> (Loggia dei Lanzi, Florence, 1581&ndash;2); <i>Hercules and the Centaur</i> (Loggia dei Lanzi, Florence, 1594&ndash;1600). Giambologna worked extensively for the <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici</span></a> and his monument to Duke Cosimo I (1587&ndash;95) was the first equestrian statue made in Florence and an immensely influential design, becoming the pattern for similar statues all over Europe (for example that of Charles I by Hubert <a href=""entry://Le Sueur, Hubert""><span class=""links"">Le Sueur </span></a> at Charing Cross in London). Giambologna's similar statue to Henry IV of France, formerly on the Pont Neuf in Paris, has been destroyed. It was for the Medici that he made his largest work&mdash;the colossal (about 10m. high) figure of the mountain god <i>Appennino</i> (1577&ndash;81) in the gardens of the family's villa at Pratolino. Constructed of brick and stone, the god crouches above a pool and seems to have emerged from the earth, fusing brilliantly with the landscape. Giambologna was as happy working on a small scale as in a monumental vein. His small bronze statuettes were enormously popular (they continued to be reproduced almost continuously until the 20th cent.) and being portable helped to give his style European currency. Many of his preliminary models also survive (uniquely for an Italian sculptor of his period), giving insight into his creative processes. The best collection is in the Victoria and Albert Museum."
"Gibbings, Robert","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

"Gibbons, Grinling","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gibbons, Grinling</b><div class=""content""><i>(1648&ndash;1721).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Anglo-Dutch wood-carver and sculptor, born in Rotterdam, the son of an Englishman who had business interests there (his mother was probably Dutch). He settled in England <i>c.</i>1667 and was ‘discovered’ by John Evelyn (see <i>Diary</i>, 18 Jan., 1671). Evelyn introduced him to King Charles II and to Sir Christopher Wren, who employed him on decorations at Hampton Court and St Paul's Cathedral. In 1714 he was made Master Carver to King George I. Gibbons was unsurpassed in his day for naturalistic decorative carving of fruits, flowers, and shells, strung together in garlands and festoons, with small animals, cherubs’ heads, etc. Because of his fame an enormous amount of work has been attributed to him, but he lived in a great age of English craftsmanship and much of the carving that is connected with his name was done by artists influenced by his style. Apart from his work for Wren, his documented commissions include outstanding ensembles at Burghley House, Lincolnshire, and Petworth House, Sussex. His virtuosity in wood was not equalled in marble or bronze, and George <a href=""entry://Vertue, George""><span class=""links"">Vertue </span></a> said of him: ‘He was a most excellent carver in wood, he was neither well skill'd or practized in Marble or Brass for which works he employd the best artists he coud procure.’ About 1684 he took as partner Artus <a href=""entry://Quellin ""><span class=""links"">Quellin III</span></a>, who is thought to have been responsible for some of the figure sculpture for which Gibbons was officially credited."

Although they gave up such ‘living sculpture performances’ in 1977, they still see themselves as living sculptures, considering their whole lifestyle a work of art. Since the early 1970s their work has consisted mainly of photopieces&mdash;large and garish arrangements of photographs, usually in black and white and fiery red, and often violent or homoerotic in content, with scatological titles. The images are often drawn from the street life of the East End of London in which they live. Gilbert &amp; George have become the most famous British avant-garde artists of their generation. Their work has been shown world-wide and has attracted an enormous amount of commentary. In 1986 they won the <a href=""entry://Turner Prize""><span class=""links"">Turner Prize</span></a>.

"Gilbert, Sir Alfred","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gilbert, Sir Alfred</b><div class=""content""><i>(1854&ndash;1934).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British sculptor and metal worker.

He returned to England in 1884 and worked on several major projects, the best known of which is his Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus (1887&ndash;93). The celebrated figure of <i>Eros</i> that surmounts the fountain is cast in aluminium, one of the earliest examples of the use of this metal in sculpture. Its light weight allowed Gilbert to achieve a much more delicately poised pose than if he had been restricted to the traditional medium of bronze. Although Gilbert was hard-working, respected, and sought-after, he was unworldly and a hopeless businessman; his refusal to delegate work or compromise his standards meant that he took on more work than he could handle and he sometimes lost money on commissions. In 1901 he became bankrupt, and in 1909 he moved into self-imposed exile in Bruges. However, in 1926 he returned to England at the request of King George V to complete his masterpiece, the tomb of the Duke of Clarence in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, which he had begun in 1892. The sinuous and labyrinthine detailing, crafted with consummate skill, reveals Gilbert as one of the major practitioners of <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a>, although he himself was disparaging about the style. Gilbert's reputation suffered after his death because he was so clearly outside the mainstream of 20th-cent. art, but he is now regarded as the greatest English sculptor of his generation."

He began to earn his living as a letter cutter in 1903 and carved his first figure piece in 1910. In 1913 he became a convert to Roman Catholicism and was commissioned to make the <i>Stations of the Cross</i> at Westminster Cathedral, fourteen <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> carvings which he carried out in 1914&ndash;18. These and the <i>Prospero and Ariel</i> group on Broadcasting House (1929&ndash;31) are his best-known sculptures. Gill was one of the chief protagonists in the movement for the revival of direct carving, and his work usually has an impressive simplicity of conception; he wrote that his ‘inability to draw naturalistically was, instead of a drawback, no less than my salvation. It compelled me
to concentrate upon something other than the superficial delights of fleshly appearance
to consider the significance of things.’ He tried to revive a religious attitude towards art and craftsmanship, and in life, as in his work and writing, he was a vigorous advocate of a romanticized medievalism. His unconventional behaviour was well known in his own time, but the most bizarre and unpleasant aspects of his life were not revealed until the publication of Fiona MacCarthy's biography in 1989: he had incestuous relationships with two of his sisters and two of his daughters and sexual congress with a dog. Gill was a major figure in the revival of book design and typography. He illustrated many books, and his ‘Perpetua’ and ‘Gill Sans-Serif’ typefaces are among the classics of 20th-cent. typography. His books include <i>Christianity and Art</i> (1927), <i>Art</i> (1934), and <i>Autobiography</i> (1940)."

He painted with thick, regular brushstrokes and firm outlines, creating a heavily textured surface and a feeling of great solidity. Once he had established his distinctive style (by about 1911) it changed little and he became one of the main upholders of the Camden Town tradition after the First World War (ironically, unlike other members of the group, he never actually lived in Camden Town).

"Giorgione","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Giorgione </b>
<i>(Giorgio Barbarelli or Giorgio da Castelfranco )</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1477&ndash;1510).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Venetian painter. Almost nothing is known of his life and only a handful of paintings can be confidently attributed to him, but he holds a momentous place in the history of art. He had achieved legendary status soon after his early death (probably from plague) and through succeeding centuries he has continued to excite the imagination in a way that few other painters can match. The extraordinary discrepancy between his enormous fame and the tiny scale of his <i>œuvre</i> is explained by the fact that he initiated a new conception of painting. He was one of the earliest artists to specialize in <a href=""entry://cabinet painting""><span class=""links"">cabinet</span></a> pictures for private collectors rather than works for public or ecclesiastical patrons, and he was the first painter who subordinated subject-matter to the evocation of mood&mdash;it is clear that his contemporaries sometimes did not know what was represented in his pictures. <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>, who says that Giorgione earned his nickname&mdash;meaning ‘Big George’&mdash;‘because of his physical appearance and his moral and intellectual stature’, ranked him alongside <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a> as one of the founders of ‘modern’ painting. <br class=""nLine"" />Giorgione was born in Castelfranco, about 30 km. north-west of Venice, and according to Vasari he trained with Giovanni <a href=""entry://Bellini""><span class=""links"">Bellini </span></a> (although it has also been suggested that <a href=""entry://Carpaccio, Vittore""><span class=""links"">Carpaccio</span></a> may have been his teacher). He had two important public commissions in Venice: in 1507&ndash;8 he worked on a canvas (now lost without trace) for the audience chamber of the Doges' Palace; and in 1508 (assisted by <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a>) he painted frescos on the exterior of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi (the German warehouse), now known only through engravings and ruinous fragments. Apart from this, the only contemporary documentation on any of his surviving paintings is an inscription on the back of a female portrait known as <i>Laura</i> (Kunsthistorisches Mus., Vienna), which says it was painted by ‘Master Zorzi da Castelfranco’ in 1506; it also records that Giorgione was a colleague of Vincenzo <a href=""entry://Catena, Vincenzo""><span class=""links"">Catena </span></a>, a partnership about which nothing else is known. The main document for reconstructing Giorgione's <i>œuvre</i> is the notebook of the Venetian collector and connoisseur Marcantonio Michiel, written between 1525 and 1543. Michiel, who is a scrupulous and reliable source, mentions a number of paintings by Giorgione, four or five of which can be plausibly identified with extant works: <i>The Tempest</i> (Accademia, Venice), <i>The Three Philosophers</i> (Kunsthistorisches Mus.), <i>Sleeping Venus</i> (Gemälde-galerie, Dresden), <i>Boy with an Arrow</i> (a copy?, Kunsthistorisches Mus.), and (an oblique and less explicit reference than the others) <i>Christ Carrying the Cross</i> (S. Rocco, Venice). He says <i>The Three Philosophers</i> was finished by <a href=""entry://Sebastiano del Piombo ""><span class=""links"">Sebastiano del Piombo </span></a> and the <i>Sleeping Venus</i> (the work that founded the tradition of the reclining female nude) was finished by Titian . The problem of attribution was, then, complicated from the start by the fact that some of Giorgione's paintings were completed after his death by other hands, and confusion soon arose; in the first edition of his <i>Lives</i> (1550) Vasari attributed the S. Rocco painting to Giorgione, but in the second edition (1568) he gave it in one place to Giorgione and in another to Titian, even though ‘many people believed it was by Giorgione’. Distinguishing between the work of Giorgione and the young Titian continues to be one of the knottiest problems in connoisseurship, the celebrated <i>Concert Champêtre</i> in the Louvre being the picture most hotly disputed between them. <br class=""nLine"" />Among the other paintings given to Giorgione are the <i>Castelfranco Madonna</i>, in the cathedral of his home town (first mentioned by <a href=""entry://Ridolfi, Carlo""><span class=""links"">Ridolfi</span></a> in 1648 and accepted by almost all critics), and several male portraits, including a self-portrait in the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich Museum in Brunswick (perhaps a copy). Giorgione is said to have been handsome and amorous, and he initiated a type of dreamily romantic portrait that became immensely popular in Venice. The powerful influence that his work exerted in the generation after his death (even the venerable Bellini succumbed to it) is one of the main factors in making the construction of a catalogue of his work so difficult, for there are scores of paintings of the period, particularly pastoral landscapes, that can be described as Giorgionesque, and many are of high quality. The problems of <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">iconography</span></a> that Giorgione's paintings present are sometimes every bit as difficult as those of attribution. The most famous instance is <i>The Tempest</i>. Michiel saw it in 1530 and described it as a ‘little landscape with the tempest with the gipsy and soldier’, so he evidently did not know what subject, if any, was represented. X-rays have shown that Giorgione radically altered the figures in a way that suggests he was here indulging his imagination rather than illustrating a particular theme, although many ingenious attempts have been made to unravel a subject. This development of the ‘landscape of mood’ was, indeed, his great contribution to the history of art&mdash;an innovation of great originality and influence. Apart from the artists already mentioned, <a href=""entry://Palma Vecchio ""><span class=""links"">Palma Vecchio </span></a> and Dosso <a href=""entry://Dossi, Dosso""><span class=""links"">Dossi </span></a> were among the outstanding contemporaries who fell under the Giorgionesque spell, and among later artists <a href=""entry://Watteau, Jean-Antoine""><span class=""links"">Watteau </span></a> was his most sensitive heir."

"Giotto di Bondone","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Giotto di Bondone </b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1267&ndash;1337).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter and architect. Giotto is regarded as the founder of the central tradition of Western painting because his work broke free from the stylizations of <a href=""entry://Byzantine art""><span class=""links"">Byzantine art</span></a>, introducing new ideals of naturalism and creating a convincing sense of pictorial space. His momentous achievement was recognized by his contemporaries (Dante praised him in a famous passage of <i>The Divine Comedy</i>, where he said he had surpassed his master <a href=""entry://Cimabue ""><span class=""links"">Cimabue</span></a>), and in about 1400 Cennino <a href=""entry://Cennini, Cennino""><span class=""links"">Cennini </span></a> wrote ‘Giotto translated the art of painting from Greek to Latin.’ In spite of his fame and the demand for his services, no surviving painting is documented as being by him. His work, indeed, poses some formidable problems of attribution, but it is universally agreed that the fresco cycle in the Arena Chapel at Padua is by Giotto, and it forms the starting-point for any consideration of his work. The Arena Chapel (so-called because it occupies the site of a Roman arena) was built by Enrico Scrovegni in expiation for the sins of his father, a notorious usurer mentioned by Dante . It was begun in 1303 and Giotto's frescos are usually dated <i>c.</i>1305&ndash;6. They run right round the interior of the building; the west wall is covered with a <i>Last Judgement</i>, there is an <i>Annunciation</i> over the chancel arch, and the main wall areas have three tiers of paintings representing scenes from the life of the Virgin and her parents, St Anne and St Joachim, and events from the Passion of Christ. Below these scenes are figures personifying Virtues and Vices, painted to simulate stone <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">reliefs</span></a>&mdash;the first <a href=""entry://grisaille""><span class=""links"">grisailles</span></a>. The figures in the main narrative scenes are about half life-size, but in reproduction they usually look bigger because Giotto's conception is so grand and powerful. His figures have a completely new sense of three-dimensionality and physical presence, and in portraying the sacred events he creates a feeling of moral weight rather than divine splendour. He seems to base the representations upon personal experience, and no artist has surpassed his ability to go straight to the heart of a story and express its essence with gestures and expressions of unerring conviction. <br class=""nLine"" />The other major fresco cycle associated with Giotto's name is that on the Life of St Francis in the Upper Church of S. Francesco at Assisi. Whether Giotto painted this is not only the central problem facing scholars of his work, but also one of the most controversial issues in the history of art. The St Francis frescos are clearly the work of an artist of great stature (their intimate and humane portrayals have done much to determine posterity's mental image of the saint), but the stylistic differences between these works and the Arena Chapel frescos seem to many critics so pronounced that they cannot accept a common authorship. Attempts to attribute other frescos at Assisi to Giotto have met with no less controversy (see also <a href=""entry://Master of the St Francis Cycle""><span class=""links"">MASTER OF THE ST FRANCIS LEGEND</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Master of St Cecilia""><span class=""links"">MASTER OF ST CECILIA</span></a>). There is a fair measure of agreement about the frescos associated with Giotto in Sta Croce in Florence. He probably painted in four chapels there, and work survives in the Bardi and Peruzzi chapels, probably dating from the 1320s. The frescos are in very uneven condition (they were whitewashed in the 18th cent.), but some of those in the Bardi Chapel on the life of St Francis remain deeply impressive. Nothing survives of Giotto's work done for Robert of Anjou in Naples, and the huge mosaic of the Ship of the Church (the <i>Navicella</i>) that he designed for Old St Peter's in Rome has been so thoroughly altered that it tells us nothing about his style. In Rome he would have seen the work of Pietro <a href=""entry://Cavallini, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Cavallini </span></a>, which was as important an influence on him as that of his master Cimabue. <br class=""nLine"" />Several panel paintings bear Giotto's signature, but it is generally agreed that the signature is a trademark showing that the works came from Giotto's shop rather than an indication of his personal workmanship. Similarly, the Stefaneschi Altarpiece (Vatican Mus.) is connected with Giotto in a credible early source, but it is now regarded as having only tenuous links with him. On the other hand, the <i>Ognissanti Madonna</i> (Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1305&ndash;10) is neither signed nor firmly documented, but is a work of such grandeur and humanity that it is universally accepted as Giotto's. Among the other panels attributed to him, the finest is the Crucifix in Sta Maria Novella, Florence. On account of his great fame as a painter, Giotto was appointed architect to Florence Cathedral in 1334; he began the celebrated campanile, but his design was altered after his death. In the generation ofter his death he had an overwhelming influence on Florentine painting; it declined with the growth of <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a>, but his work was later an inspiration to <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a>, and even to <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>.

One of his best-known portraits, <i>Mademoiselle Lange as Diana</i> (Minneapolis Institute of Arts, 1799), caused a scandal because of its satirical sexual allusions.

"Gislebertus","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gislebertus</b><div class=""content""><i>(active first half of 12th cent.).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French <a href=""entry://Romanesque""><span class=""links"">Romanesque</span></a> sculptor. He was one of the great geniuses of medieval art, but his name has survived only because he carved his signature&mdash;<i>Gislebertus hoc fecit</i>&mdash;beneath the feet of the central figure of Christ in the tympanum of the west doorway of Autun Cathedral in Burgundy. The unusually prominent position of his signature suggests that his greatness was appreciated in his own time. The tympanum represents the Last Judgement; it is a huge work (over 6 m. wide at the base) and a masterpiece of expressionistic carving, conveying with awesome power both the horror of the damned and the serenity of the elect. Most of the rest of the sculptural decoration of the cathedral can be confidently attributed to Gislebertus. It includes a carving of Eve, one of the few surviving fragments of the north doorway (now in the Musée Rolin, Autun), a large-scale reclining nude without parallel in medieval art, and the decoration of 60 or so capitals. These display his great fecundity of imagination and range of feeling. It is highly probable that Gislebertus was trained in the workshop that was responsible for the decoration of the abbey of Cluny, the most influential of all Romanesque monasteries, and that he worked at the nearby cathedral at Vézelay before going to Autun. He was already a mature artist when he started at Autun, where he worked <i>c.</i>1125&ndash;35, and his style changed little while he was there. His influence was felt in the sculpture of various Burgundian churches, and many of his ideas had a long-term effect on the development of French <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> sculpture."

About 1515 he was working on Raphael's Stanza dell’ Incendio in the Vatican and after the master's death in 1520 Giulio became his main artistic executor, completing a number of his unfinished works, including the <i>Transfiguration</i> (Vatican) and the decorations of the Villa Madama. His independent works of this time include the <i>Holy Family</i> in Sta Maria dell’ Anima, Rome. He also designed some pornographic prints that caused such a scandal that their engraver Marcantonio <a href=""entry://Raimondi, Marcantonio""><span class=""links"">Raimondi </span></a> was imprisoned (their notoriety was sustained by the sonnets that the poet Pietro Aretino wrote inspired by them soon after their publication). Giulio had moved to Mantua in 1524 and escaped Raimondi's fate. He remained there for the rest of his life and dominated the artistic affairs of the <a href=""entry://Gonzaga""><span class=""links"">Gonzaga</span></a> court. The great monument to his genius is the Palazzo del Tè, begun in 1526 for Federico Gonzaga . This was one of the first Mannerist buildings, deliberately flouting the canons of classical architecture as examplified by <a href=""entry://Bramante, Donato""><span class=""links"">Bramante</span></a> in order to shock and surprise the spectator. The same tendency is continued in Giulio's fresco decoration in the palace, especially in the Sala dei Giganti, where the whole room is painted from floor to ceiling to give an overall illusionistic effect, and the spectator feels himself overwhelmed by the rocks and thunderbolts hurled down on the rebellious Titans who attempted to storm Olympus. Giulio painted several other frescos in the Palazzo del Tè and in the Sala di Troia of the Ducal Palace at Mantua which testify to his classical learning and exuberant invention. His muscular style owed much to <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> as well as to Raphael, but was less daunting than that of either and proved widely influential. Indeed, he became one of the most famous painters of his day and has the distinction of being the only artist mentioned by Shakespeare ; he called him ‘that rare Italian master Julio Romano’, but mistakenly imagined him a sculptor (<i>The Winter's Tale</i>, v. ii)."

"Goes, Hugo van der","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Goes, Hugo van der</b><div class=""content""><i>(d. 1482).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The greatest Netherlandish painter of the second half of the 15th cent. Nothing is known of his life before 1467, when he became a master in the painters’ guild at Ghent. He had numerous commissions from the town of Ghent for work of a temporary nature such as processional banners, and in 1475 he became dean of the painters’ guild. In the same year he entered a priory near Brussels as a lay-brother, but he continued to paint and also to travel. In 1481 he suffered a mental breakdown (he had a tendency to acute depression) and although he recovered, died the following year. An account of his illness by Gaspar Ofhuys, a monk at the priory, survives; Ofhuys was evidently jealous of Hugo and his description has been called by Erwin <a href=""entry://Panofsky, Erwin""><span class=""links"">Panofsky </span></a> ‘a masterpiece of clinical accuracy and sanctimonious malice’. No paintings by Hugo are signed and his only securely documented work is his masterpiece, a large <a href=""entry://triptych""><span class=""links"">triptych</span></a> of the Nativity known as the <i>Portinari Altarpiece</i> (Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1475&ndash;6). This was commissioned by Tommaso Portinari, the representative of the House of <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici </span></a> in Bruges, for the church of the Hospital of Sta Maria Nuova in Florence, and it exercised a strong influence on Italian painters with its masterful handling of the oil technique. There is a great variety of surface ornament and detail, but this is combined with lucid organization of the figure groups and a convincing sense of spatial depth. As remarkable as Hugo's skill in reconciling grandeur of conception with keen observation is his psychological penetration in the depiction of individual figures, notably the awestruck shepherds. The other works attributed to Hugo include two large panels probably designed as organ shutters (Royal coll., on loan to NG of Scotland). His last work is generally thought to be the <i>Death of the Virgin</i> (Groeningemuseum, Bruges), a painting of remarkable tension and poignancy that seems a fitting swan-song for such a tormented personality."
"Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von</b><div class=""content""><i>(1749&ndash;1832).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German writer, scientist, and amateur artist, one of the giants of European literature and one of the major figures of the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> movement. Throughout his life he devoted much time to the study of painting and was a prolific draughtsman. Although his talent as an artist was modest, his writings on art were very influential in the upsurge of Romantic ideas in Germany. Identifying art with ‘nature’, Goethe held that great art must simulate and carry on the blind creative force in nature. He also advocated the typically Romantic view that art should concentrate on what is individually ‘characteristic’ rather than the generic type. In 1786&ndash;8 he visited Italy, where he came into contact with German artists such as <a href=""entry://Tischbein""><span class=""links"">Tischbein</span></a> in Rome, and his taste changed to an appreciation of the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classicism</span></a> of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. Identifying art with ‘style’, he now maintained that beauty is symbolic expression of the inner laws of nature, and that this expression had been supremely achieved by the art of antiquity. His writings on art included a book on theory of colour (<i>Zur Farbenlehre</i>, 1810, English translation 1840), in which he purported to refute the <i>Optics</i> of Newton, and a translation into German of <a href=""entry://Cellini, Benvenuto""><span class=""links"">Cellini's </span></a>

"Gogh, Vincent van","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gogh, Vincent van</b><div class=""content""><i>(1853&ndash;90).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter and draughtsman, with <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin </span></a> the greatest of <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionist</span></a> artists. His uncle was a partner in the international firm of picture dealers Goupil and Co. and in 1869 van Gogh went to work in the branch at The Hague. In 1873 he was sent to the London branch and fell unsuccessfully in love with the daughter of his landlady. This was the first of several disastrous attempts to find happiness with a woman, and his unrequited passion affected him so badly that he was dismissed from his job. He returned to England in 1876 as an unpaid assistant at a school, and his experience of urban squalor awakened a religious zeal and a longing to serve his fellow men. His father was a Protestant pastor, and van Gogh first trained for the ministry, but he abandoned his studies in 1878 and went to work as a lay preacher among the impoverished miners of the grim Borinage district in Belgium. In his zeal he gave away his own worldly goods to the poor and was dismissed for his literal interpretation of Christ's teaching. He remained in the Borinage, suffering acute poverty and a spiritual crisis, until 1880, when he found that art was his vocation and the means by which he could bring consolation to humanity. From this time he worked at his new ‘mission’ with single-minded intensity, and although he often suffered from extreme poverty and undernourishment, his output in the ten remaining years of his life was prodigious: about 800 paintings and a similar number of drawings. The spontaneous, irrational side of his character has often been stressed, but he was a cultivated and well-read man, who in spite of his speed of work thought deeply about his paintings and planned them carefully. <br class=""nLine"" />From 1881 to 1885 van Gogh lived in the Netherlands, sometimes with his parents, sometimes in lodgings, supported by his devoted brother Theo, who regularly sent him money from his own small salary. In keeping with his humanitarian outlook he painted peasants and workers, the most famous picture from this period being <i>The Potato Eaters</i> (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, 1885). Of this he wrote to Theo: ‘I have tried to emphasize that those people, eating their potatoes in the lamp-light have dug the earth with those very hands they put in the dish, and so it speaks of manual labour, and how they have honestly earned their food.’ In 1885 van Gogh moved to Antwerp on the advice of Antoine <a href=""entry://Mauve, Antoine""><span class=""links"">Mauve </span></a> (a cousin by marriage), and studied for some months at the Academy there. Academic instruction had little to offer such an individualist, however, and in February 1886 he moved to Paris, where he met <a href=""entry://Pissarro, Camille""><span class=""links"">Pissarro </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Degas, Edgar""><span class=""links"">Degas </span></a>, Gauguin, <a href=""entry://Seurat, Georges""><span class=""links"">Seurat </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri de""><span class=""links"">Toulouse-Lautrec </span></a>. At this time his painting underwent a violent metamorphosis under the combined influence of <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a> and Japanese woodcuts (see <a href=""entry://Ukiyo-e""><i><span class=""links"">UKIYO-E</i></span></a>), losing its moralistic flavour. Van Gogh became obsessed by the symbolic and expressive values of colours and began to use them for this purpose rather than, as did the Impressionists, for the reproduction of visual appearances, atmosphere, and light. ‘Instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have before my eyes,’ he wrote, ‘I use colour more arbitrarily so as to express myself more forcibly.’ Of his <i>Night Café</i> (Yale Univ. Art Gal., 1888), he said: ‘I have tried to express with red and green the terrible passions of human nature.’ For a time he was influenced by Seurat's delicate <a href=""entry://pointillism""><span class=""links"">pointillist</span></a> manner, but he abandoned this for broad, vigorous, and swirling brush-strokes. <br class=""nLine"" />In February 1888 van Gogh settled at Arles, where he painted more than 200 canvases in 15 months. During this time he lived in poverty and suffered recurrent nervous crises with hallucinations and depression. He became enthusiastic for the idea of founding an artists’ co-operative at Arles and towards the end of the year he was joined by Gauguin . But as a result of a quarrel between them van Gogh suffered the crisis in which occurred the famous incident when he cut off his left ear (or part of it), an event commemorated in his <i>Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear</i> (Courtauld Inst., London). In May 1889 he went at his own request into an asylum at St Rémy, near Arles, but during the year he spent there continued a frenzied production of tumultuous pictures such as <i>Starry Night</i> (MOMA, New York). He did 150 paintings besides drawings in the course of this year. In 1889 Theo married and in May 1890 van Gogh moved to Auvers-sur-Oise to be near him, lodging with the patron and connoisseur Dr Paul Gachet . There followed another tremendous burst of strenous activity and during the last 70 days of his life he painted 70 canvases. But his spiritual anguish and depression became more acute and on 29 July 1890 he died from the results of a self-inflicted bullet wound. He sold only one painting during his lifetime (<i>Red Vineyard at Arles</i>, Pushkin Mus., Moscow), and was little known to the art world at the time of his death, but his fame grew rapidly thereafter. His influence on <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauvism</span></a>, and early abstraction was enormous, and it can be seen in many other aspects of 20th-cent. art. His stormy and dramatic life and his unswerving devotion to his ideals have made him one of the great cultural heroes of modern times, providing the most auspicious material for the 20th-cent. vogue in romanticized psychological biography."

"Gombrich, Sir Ernst","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gombrich, Sir Ernst</b><div class=""content""><i>(1909&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Austrian-born British art historian.

He has also been <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> Professor at both Oxford and Cambridge. His scholarly work, which shows a remarkable ability to combine great breadth of learning with lucidity and wit, has been devoted largely to the theory of art, the psychology of pictorical representation, and Renaissance symbolism, and has won him a position of the highest esteem in his profession. His writings bear witness to his interest in psychology and scientific method and have helped to break down barriers between art history and other disciplines. Gombrich's best-known book, however, is a popular work, <i>The Story of Art</i>, which was first published in 1950 and has ever since held its place as the most congenial introduction to the history of art. It reached its 16th English edition in 1995 and has been translated into 20 languages. Among his other books the best known is probably <i>Art and Illusion</i> (1960 and subsequent editions). This highly influential work deals with conventions of representation and examines how styles change and develop, challenging many orthodox views and received opinions about visual perception. In <i>Thinkers of the Twentieth Century</i> (ed. Elizabeth Devine, <i>et al.</i>, 1983) J. M. Massing wrote: ‘For his scholarly method, his theoretical approach and his defence of cultural values, Gombrich will be remembered as one of the leading art historians of this century. Through his study of the psychology of perception, he is also one of the very few to have widened our understanding of the visible world.’"

He initially supported himself mainly by making metal-work and jewellery, and it was not until the late 1920s, when he was already 50, that he devoted himself whole heartedly to sculpture and turned to welded metal as a material. His best-known work, <i>Montserrat</i> (Stedelijk Mus., Amsterdam, 1937), is a fairly naturalistic piece, showing a woman with a child in her arms, and commemorates the suffering of the people of Spain in the civil war (Montserrat is Spain's holy mountain). More usually, however, his sculptures are semi-abstract, as in his series of <i>Cactus People</i>, formidable pieces with some of Picasso's savage humour. González’ work had great influence, notably on Picasso, to whom he taught the techniques of iron sculpture, and on a generation of British and American artists exemplified by Reg <a href=""entry://Butler, Reg""><span class=""links"">Butler </span></a> and David <a href=""entry://Smith, David""><span class=""links"">Smith </span></a>."

<b>Gore, Spencer</b><div class=""content""><i>(1878&ndash;1914).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter of landscapes, music-hall scenes, interiors, and occasional still lifes. He was the son of Spencer Walter Gore, who won the first Wimbledon tennis championship in 1877, and nephew of Charles Gore, Bishop of Oxford. In 1896&ndash;9 he studied at the <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School, where he was a particular friend of Harold <a href=""entry://Gilman, Harold""><span class=""links"">Gilman </span></a>. In 1904 he visited <a href=""entry://Sickert, Walter Richard""><span class=""links"">Sickert </span></a> in Dieppe; this marked the beginning of his close acquaintance with recent French painting (he returned to France in 1905 and 1906), and his enthusiasm helped to decide Sickert to return to Britain. For the rest of his short career Gore was part of Sickert's circle, becoming a founder member successively of the <a href=""entry://Allied Artists' Association""><span class=""links"">Allied Artists’Association</span></a> in 1908, the <a href=""entry://Camden Town Group""><span class=""links"">Camden Town Group</span></a> (of which he was first President) in 1911, and the <a href=""entry://London Group""><span class=""links"">London Group</span></a> in 1913.

<a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionist</span></a> exhibitions (Gore's own work was included in the second in 1912) and his later pictures show vivid use of flat, bright colour and boldly simplified forms. He died of pneumonia aged 35 and was much lamented by his many friends in the art world. Sickert said Gore was ‘probably the man I love and admire most of any I have known’, and his obituary in the <i>Morning Post</i> remarked that ‘his personal character was so exceptional as to give him a unique influence in the artistic affairs of London in the last dozen years.’ His son <i>Frederick Gore </i> (1913&ndash; ) is also a painter."
"Gorky, Arshile","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gorky, Arshile</b>
<i>(Vosdanig Manoog Adoian )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1904&ndash;48).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, born in Turkish Armenia, who formed a link between European <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a> and American <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a>. He emigrated to the USA in 1920 and adopted the pseudonym Arshile Gorky, the first part of the name being derived from the Greek hero Achilles, the second part (Russian for ‘the bitter one’) from the Russian writer Maxim Gorky, to whom the painter sometimes claimed he was related (evidently not realizing that the writer's name, too, was a pseudonym). In 1925 he settled in New York, where he first studied and then taught at the Grand Central School of Art. Gorky took a romantic view of his vocation and is said to have hired a Hungarian violinist to play during his classes to encourage his students to put emotion into their work. He was among the first to recognize the importance of the abstract work of Stuart <a href=""entry://Davis, Stuart""><span class=""links"">Davis </span></a>, and owed a debt to <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>, seen both in his haunting <i>The Artist and his Mother</i> (Whitney Mus., New York, <i>c.</i>1926&ndash;9) and in the <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a> abstractions which he did at this period. Gorky was never at home with geometrical abstraction, however, and preferred to adapt Cubist techniques to his own more painterly and expressive purposes. He came into his own when he became a friend of the circle of European immigrant Surrealists who during the early years of the 1940s lived in New York. Under this influence he worked out a style of abstraction using <a href=""entry://biomorphic""><span class=""links"">biomorphic</span></a> forms akin to those of <a href=""entry://Miró, Joan""><span class=""links"">Miró </span></a>. At the peak of his powers, however, Gorky suffered a tragic series of misfortunes. In 1946 a fire in his Connecticut studio destroyed a large proportion of his recent work. In the same year he was operated on for cancer. In 1948 he broke his neck in a motor-car accident and, when his wife left him soon after, he hanged himself. Gorky has been called both the last of the great Surrealists and the first of the Abstract Expressionists, and his work in the 1940s was a potent factor underlying the emergence of a specifically American school of abstract art."

In 1503 he was registered in the Guild Master's list at Antwerp and in 1508&ndash;9 he visited Rome in the service of Philip Bastard of Burgundy, an ambassador to the Vatican. His work before his Italian journey is in the tradition of Hugo van der <a href=""entry://Goes, Hugo van der""><span class=""links"">Goes </span></a> and Gerard <a href=""entry://David, Gerard""><span class=""links"">David </span></a>, whose influences can be seen in the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (NG, London). On his return to Antwerp, however, his work was transformed by the experience of Italy, although the motifs he learned there were never thoroughly digested and co-existed with Flemish figures and details. <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> acclaimed him for being the first ‘to bring the true method of representing nude figures and mythologies from Italy to the Netherlands’, but in, for example, <i>Neptune and Amphitrite</i> (Staatliche Museen, Berlin, 1516), his first dated work, the life-size figures are in fact closer to <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a> than to any Italian contemporary, and they are set in a curious, totally misunderstood classical temple. Gossaert was highly thought of by his contemporaries. His commissions took him to various towns in the Netherlands, his patrons included the Royal House of Denmark, and his work was widely influential. However, to modern eyes there seems justice in Dürer's assessment of him as better in execution than in invention (‘nit so gut im Haupstreichen als im Gemäl’).

The Gothic style is still characterized chiefly in terms of architecture&mdash;in particular by the use of pointed arches, flying buttresses, and elaborate tracery. By extension, however, the term ‘Gothic’ is applied to the ornament, sculpture, and painting of the period in which Gothic architecture was built; it has less precise meaning in these contexts, although a swaying elegance is often considered typical of Gothic figures, which are generally much more naturalistic and less remote than those of the Romanesque period."

Some of his landscapes of the late 1930s were influenced by <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>, and from the early 1940s this tendency was enhanced by contact with expatriate European Surrealists and by an interest in Freudian psychology. His personal style began to emerge in 1941 and from then until the end of his life he worked on three main series: <i>Pictographs</i> (1941&ndash;51), <i>Imaginary Landscapes</i> (1951&ndash;7, and again in the mid 1960s), and <i>Bursts</i> (1957&ndash;74). The <i>Pictographs</i> use a loose grid-or compartment-like arrangement with schematic shapes or symbols suggesting some mythic face; the <i>Imaginary Landscapes</i> feature a zone of astral shapes against a foreground of heavy <a href=""entry://Gestural painting""><span class=""links"">gestural</span></a> strokes; and the <i>Bursts</i>, becoming still freer, suggest solar orbs and astral bodies hovering above violently coloured terrestrial explosions.

<b>Goujon, Jean</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1510&ndash;68).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> French sculptor. He ranks second only to Germain <a href=""entry://Pilon, Germain""><span class=""links"">Pilon </span></a> as the greatest French sculptor of the 16th cent. and he created a distinctive <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> style as sophisticated as the finest works of painting and decoration of the contemporary School of <a href=""entry://Fontainebleau, School of""><span class=""links"">Fontainebleau</span></a>. Nothing is known of his early life and he is first recorded in 1540 as the carver of the fine columns supporting the organ loft in the church of S. Maclou at Rouen. The pure <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classicism</span></a> of these columns has caused some critics to assume that he had first-hand knowledge of Italian art. He had moved to Paris by 1544, when he was working on the screen of S. Germain-l'Auxerrois, in collaboration with the architect Pierre Lescot. Low-<a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> panels (now in the Louvre) from this screen show that Goujon had evolved a style of extreme grace and delicacy, owing something to the influence of Benvenuto <a href=""entry://Cellini, Benvenuto""><span class=""links"">Cellini </span></a>. The style is seen at its most mature in his decorations (now in the Louvre) for the <i>Fontaine des Innocents</i>, Paris (1547&ndash;9). The six relief panels of nymphs from the fountain, with their exquisitely carved rippling draperies, are generally considered his masterpieces. Goujon's most extensive undertaking was on the sculptural decoration of the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a>; he worked there from 1549 to 1562 in collaboration with Lescot, mainly on decorative panels forming part of the architectural scheme. Unfortunately all Goujon's work there has been heavily restored, including the famous <a href=""entry://caryatid""><span class=""links"">caryatids</span></a> (1550&ndash;1) in the Salle des Caryatides. Using caryatids on a monumental scale was a novelty, perhaps inspired by his reading of Vitruvius (he made illustrations for the first French edition of his treatise in 1547). There is no indication of any work executed after 1562 and it is possible that Goujon left France because of religious persecution and died in Bologna (the documentation is ambiguous)."

"Goya, Francisco de","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Goya, Francisco de</b><div class=""content""><i>(1746&ndash;1828).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Spanish painter and graphic artist. He was the most powerful and original European artist of his time, but his genius was slow in maturing and he was well into his thirties before he began producing work that set him apart from his contemporaries. Born at Fuendetodos in Aragon, the son of a gilder, he served his apprenticeship at Saragossa, then appears to have worked at Madrid for the court painter Francisco <a href=""entry://Bayeu y Subías, Francisco""><span class=""links"">Bayeu </span></a>. In about 1770 he went to Italy but he was back in Saragossa the next year. In 1773 he married Bayeu's sister, and by 1775 had settled at Madrid. Bayeu secured him employment making <a href=""entry://cartoon""><span class=""links"">cartoons</span></a> for the royal tapestry factory, and this took up most of his working time from 1775 to 1792. He made sixty-three cartoons (Prado, Madrid), the largest more than 6 m. wide. The subjects range from idyllic scenes to realistic incidents of everyday life, conceived throughout in a gay and romantic spirit and executed with <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> decorative charm. During these years Goya also found time for portraits and religious works, and his status grew. He was elected to the Academy of San Fernando in 1780 and became assistant director of painting in 1785. In 1789 he was nominated a court painter to the new king, Charles IV. A more important turning-point in his career than any of these appointments, however, was the mysterious and traumatic illness he experienced in 1792. It left him stone deaf, and while convalescing in 1793 he painted a series of small pictures of ‘fantasy and invention’ in order, as he said, ‘to occupy an imagination mortified by the contemplation of my sufferings’. This marks the beginning of his preoccupation with the morbid, bizarre, and menacing that was to be such a feature of his mature work. It was given vivid expression in the first of his great series of engravings, <i>Los Caprichos</i> (Caprices), issued in 1799. The set (executed <i>c.</i>1793&ndash;8) consists of eighty-two plates in <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etching</span></a> reinforced with <a href=""entry://aquatint""><span class=""links"">aquatint</span></a>, and their humour is constantly overshadowed by an element of nightmare. Technically revealing the influence of <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt</span></a>, they feature savagely satirical attacks on social customs and abuses of the Church, with elements of the macabre in scenes of witchcraft and diabolism. <br class=""nLine"" />In 1795 Goya succeeded Bayeu as director of painting at the Academy of San Fernando and in 1799 he was appointed First Court Painter, producing his most famous portrait group, the <i>Family of Charles IV</i> (Prado), in the following year. The weaknesses of the royal family are revealed with unsparing realism, though evidently without deliberate satirical intent. Goya's early portraits had followed the manner of <a href=""entry://Mengs, Anton Raffael""><span class=""links"">Mengs </span></a>, but stimulated by the study of <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez's</span></a> paintings in the royal collection he had developed a much more natural, lively, and personal style, showing increasing mastery of pose and expression, heightened by dramatic contrasts of light and shade. From about the same date as the royal group portrait are the celebrated pair of paintings the <i>Clothed Maja and Naked Maja</i> (Prado), whose erotic nature led Goya to be summoned before the Inquisition. Popular legend has it that they represent the Duchess of Alba, the beautiful widow whose relationship with Goya caused scandal in Madrid. Goya retained his appointment of court painter under Joseph Buonaparte during the French occupation of Spain (1808&ndash;14), but his activity as a painter of court and society decreased, and he was torn between his welcome for the regime as a liberal and his abhorrence as a patriot against foreign military rule. After the restoration of Ferdinand VII in 1814 Goya was exonerated from the charge of having ‘accepted employment from the usurper’ by claiming he had not worn the medal awarded him by the French, and he painted for the king the two famous scenes of the bloody uprising of the citizens of Madrid against the occupying forces&mdash;<i>The Second of May</i>, 1808 and <i>The Third of May</i>, 1808 (Prado). Equally dramatic, and even more savage and macabre, are the sixty-five etchings <i>Los Desastres de la Guerra</i> (The Disasters of War, 1810&ndash;14)&mdash;nightmare scenes, depicting atrocities committed by both French and Spanish. <br class=""nLine"" />Goya virtually retired from public life after 1815, working for himself and friends. He kept the title of court painter but was superseded in royal favour by Vicente <a href=""entry://López y Portaña, Vicente""><span class=""links"">López </span></a>. Towards the end of 1819 he fell seriously ill for the second time (a remarkable self-portrait in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts shows him with the doctor who nursed him). He had just bought a country house in the outskirts of Madrid, the Quinta del Sordo (House of the Deaf Man); and it was here after his recovery in 1820 that he executed fourteen large murals, sometimes known as the <i>Black Paintings</i>, now in the Prado. Painted almost entirely in blacks, greys, and browns, they depict horrific scenes, such as <i>Saturn Devouring One of His Sons</i>, executed with an almost ferocious intensity and freedom of handling. In 1824 Goya obtained permission from Ferdinand VII to leave the country for reasons of health and settled at Bordeaux. He made two brief visits to Spain, on the first of which (1826) he officially resigned as court painter. In these last years he took up the new medium of <a href=""entry://lithography""><span class=""links"">lithography</span></a> (in his series the <i>Bulls of Bordeaux</i>), while his paintings illustrate his progress towards a style which foreshadowed that of the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>. <br class=""nLine"" />Goya completed some 500 oil paintings and murals, about 300 etchings and lithographs, and many hundreds of drawings. He was exceptionally versatile and his work expresses a very wide range of emotion. His technical freedom and originality likewise are remarkable&mdash;his frescos in San Antonio de la Florida in Madrid (1798), for example, were evidently executed with sponges. In his own day he was chiefly celebrated for his portraits, of which he painted more than 200; but his fame now rests equally on his other work."
"Goyen, Jan van","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Goyen, Jan van</b><div class=""content""><i>(1596&ndash;1656).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter, one of the foremost pioneers of realistic landscape painting in the Netherlands. His earliest works are heavily indebted to his master Esaias van de <a href=""entry://Velde, Esaias van de""><span class=""links"">Velde </span></a>, but he then created a distinctive type of monochrome landscape in browns and greys with touches of vivid blue or red to catch the eye; gnarled oaks; wide plains, usually seen from a height; low horizons and clouded skies. He was one of the first painters to capture the quality of the light and air in a scene and to suggest the movement of clouds. Most of his paintings seem to be based on drawings made as he travelled about the countryside, and he evidently used the same drawings again and again because the same motifs recur repeatedly in his works. His finest work has a sense of poetic calm as well as great freshness and luminosity of atmosphere. Van Goyen worked in his native Leiden, Haarlem, and The Hague, where he died. He was hugely prolific and had many pupils and imitators. With Salomon van <a href=""entry://Ruysdael, Salomon van""><span class=""links"">Ruysdael </span></a>, whose paintings are often virtually indistinguishable from his, he was the outstanding master of the ‘tonal’ phase of Dutch landscape painting, when the depiction of atmosphere was the artist's prime concern."

The frescos were badly damaged by bombing in the Second World War.

<b>Grand Manner</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to the lofty and rhetorical manner of <a href=""entry://history painting""><span class=""links"">history painting</span></a> that in academic theory was considered appropriate to the most serious and elevated subjects. The classic exposition of its doctrines is found in <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds's</span></a> Third and Fourth <i>Discourses</i> (1770 and 1771), where he asserts that ‘the <i>gusto grande</i> of the Italians, the <i>beau idéal</i> of the French, and the <i>great style, genius</i>, and <i>taste</i> among the English, are but different appellations of the same thing’. Cecil Gould (<i>An Introduction to Italian Renaissance Painting</i>, 1957) rightly points out that ‘the Grand Manner is an attitude rather than a style’ and goes on to give a lucid account of some of its characteristics. ‘The general aim is to transcend Nature
The Subject itself must be on an elevated and elevating plane

<b>Greco, El</b><div class=""content""><i>(1541&ndash;1614).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Cretan-born painter, sculptor, and architect who settled in Spain and is regarded as the first great genius of the Spanish School. He was known as El Greco (the Greek), but his real name was Domenikos Theotocopoulos ; and it was thus that he signed his paintings throughout his life, always in Greek characters, and sometimes followed by <i>Kres</i> (Cretan). Little is known of his youth, and only a few works survive by him in the <a href=""entry://Byzantine art""><span class=""links"">Byzantine</span></a> tradition of <a href=""entry://icon""><span class=""links"">icon</span></a> painting, notably the <i>Dormition of the Virgin</i> discovered in 1983 (Church of the Koimesis tis Theotokou, Syros). In 1566 he is referred to in a Cretan document as a master painter; soon afterwards he went to Venice (Crete was then a Venetian possession), then in 1570 moved to Rome. The <a href=""entry://miniature""><span class=""links"">miniaturist</span></a> Giulio <a href=""entry://Clovio, Giulio""><span class=""links"">Clovio </span></a>, whom he met there, described him as a pupil of <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a>, but of all the Venetian painters <a href=""entry://Tintoretto ""><span class=""links"">Tintoretto</span></a> influenced him most, and <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo's</span></a> impact on his development was also important. <br class=""nLine"" />Among the surviving works of his Italian period are two paintings of the <i>Purification of the Temple</i> (Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and NG, Washington), a much-repeated theme, and the portrait of Giulio Clovio (Museo di Capodimonte, Naples). By 1577 he was at Toledo, where he remained until his death, and it was there that he matured his characteristic style in which figures elongated into flame-like forms and usually painted in cold, eerie, bluish colours express intense religious feeling. The commission that took him to Toledo&mdash;the high altarpiece of the church of S. Domingo el Antiguo&mdash;was gained through Diego de Castilla, Dean of Canons at Toledo Cathedral, whom El Greco had met in Rome. The central part of the altarpiece, a 4-m. high canvas of <i>The Assumption of the Virgin</i> (Art Inst. of Chicago, 1577), was easily his biggest work to date, but he carried off the dynamic composition triumphantly. A succession of great altarpieces followed throughout his career, the two most famous being <i>El Espolio</i> (Christ Stripped of His Garments) (Toledo Cathedral, 1577&ndash;9) and <i>The Burial of Count Orgaz</i> (S. Tomé, Toledo, 1586&ndash;8). These two mighty works convey the awesomeness of great spiritual events with a sense of mystic rapture, and in his late work El Greco went even further in freeing his figures from earth-bound restrictions: <i>The Adoration of the Shepherds</i> (Prado, Madrid, 1612&ndash;14), painted for his own tomb, is a prime example. <br class=""nLine"" />El Greco excelled also as a portraitist, mainly of ecclesiastics (<i>Felix Paravicino</i>, Boston Mus., 1609) or gentlemen, although one of his most beautiful works is a portrait of a lady (Pollock House, Glasgow, <i>c.</i>1577&ndash;80), traditionally identified as a likeness of Jeronima de las Cuevas, his common-law wife. He also painted two views of Toledo (Met. Mus., New York, and Museo del Greco, Toledo), both late works, and a mythological painting, <i>Laocoön</i> (NG, Washington, <i>c.</i>1610), that is unique in his <i>œuvre</i>. The unusual choice of subject is perhaps explained by the local tradition that Toledo had been founded by descendants of the Trojans. El Greco also designed complete altar compositions, working as architect and sculptor as well as painter, for instance at the Hospital de la Caridad, Illescas (1603). <a href=""entry://Pacheco, Francisco""><span class=""links"">Pacheco</span></a>, who visited El Greco in 1611, refers to him as a writer on painting, sculpture, and architecture. He had a proud temperament, conceiving of himself as an artist&mdash;philosopher rather than a craftsman, and had a lavish lifestyle, although he had little success in securing the royal patronage he desired and seems to have had some financial difficulties near the end of his life. His workshop turned out a great many replicas of his paintings, but his work was so personal that his influence was slight, his only followers of note being his son <i>Jorge Manuel Theotocopouli </i> and Luis <a href=""entry://Tristán, Luis""><span class=""links"">Tristán </span></a>. Interest in his art revived at the end of the 19th cent. and with the development of <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> in the 20th cent. he came into his own. The strangeness of his art has inspired various theories, for example that he was mad or suffered from astigmatism, but his rapturous paintings make complete sense as an expression of the religious fervour of his adopted country."

Although he regarded aesthetic judgements as autonomous, he also believed that history possessed order and purpose (the result of early contacts with Marxism) and this allowed him to endow his ‘disinterested aesthetic’ verdicts on art with a claim for historical certainty.

He is sometimes said to be the first professional American sculptor and his major work, the colossal marble figure of George Washington (1833&ndash;41), was the first important state commission given to an American sculptor. It was originally intended for the rotunda of the Capitol in Washington, but is now in the Smithsonian Institution.

He also wished to succeed as a history painter, but his <i>Septimius Severus Reproaching Caracalla</i> (Louvre, 1769) was rejected by the Salon, causing him acute embarrassment. Much of Greuze's later work consisted of titillating pictures of young girls, which contain thinly veiled sexual allusions under their surface appearance of mawkish innocence; <i>The Broken Pitcher</i> (Louvre), for example, alludes to loss of virginity. With the swing of taste towards <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a> his work went out of fashion and he sank into obscurity at the Revolution in 1789. At the very end of his career he received a commission to paint a portrait of Napoleon (Versailles, 1804&ndash;5), but he died in poverty.

In 1913&ndash;14 he developed a personal version of Synthetic Cubism, in which <a href=""entry://papier collé""><i><span class=""links"">papier collé</i></span></a> played an important part. He said that he conceived of his paintings as ‘flat, coloured architecture’ and his methods of visual analysis were more systematic than those of Picasso and Braque .

In this last period of his life his style became more painterly (<i>Violin and Fruit Dish</i>, Tate Gallery, London, 1924).

He followed Napoleon on his campaigns, and his huge paintings such as <i>The Battle of Eylau</i> (Louvre, Paris, 1808) are among the most stirring images of the Napoleonic era. Compared to the contemporary war scenes of <a href=""entry://Goya, Francisco de""><span class=""links"">Goya</span></a>, they are glamorous lies, but they are painted with such dramatic skill and panache that they cannot but be admired on their own terms. When David went into exile after the fall of Napoleon, Gros took over his studio, and tried to work in the more consciously Neoclassical style. He never again approached the quality of his Napoleonic pictures, however (although he painted excellent portraits), and haunted by a sense of failure he drowned himself in the Seine. Gros is regarded as one of the leading figures in the development of <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a>; the colour and drama of his work influenced <a href=""entry://Géricault, Théodore""><span class=""links"">Géricault</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix</span></a>, and his pupil <a href=""entry://Bonington, Richard Parkes""><span class=""links"">Bonington </span></a> amongst others."

"Grosz, George","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Grosz, George</b><div class=""content""><i>(1893&ndash;1959).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German-born painter and draughtsman who became an American citizen in 1938. He began as a <a href=""entry://caricature""><span class=""links"">caricaturist</span></a> with a strong feeling for social satire and through his drawings he expressed his disgust at the depravity of the Prussian military caste. During the First World War he twice served in the German army and each time was discharged as being unfit for service. In 1917, with <a href=""entry://Heartfield, John""><span class=""links"">Heartfield</span></a>, he Anglicized his name (he was born Georg Groß) as a protest against the hatred being whipped up against the enemy. The most famous of the satirical anti-war illustrations he made at this time is the drawing <i>Fit for Active Service</i> (MOMA, New York, 1918), in which a fat, complacent doctor pronounces a skeleton fit for duty. From 1917 to 1920 he was prominent among the Berlin <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada</span></a> group and during the 1920s, while still working on Dadaist <a href=""entry://montage""><span class=""links"">montages</span></a>, he became, with <a href=""entry://Dix, Otto""><span class=""links"">Dix</span></a>, the leading exponent of the <a href=""entry://Neue Sachlichkeit""><span class=""links"">Neue Sachlichkeit</span></a>. His collections of drawings <i>The Face of the Ruling Class</i> (1921) and <i>Ecce Homo</i> (1927) earned him an international reputation. In these and in his paintings he ruthlessly denounced a decaying society in which gluttony and depraved sensuality are placed beside poverty and disease; prostitutes and profiteers were frequently among his cast of characters. Grosz was prosecuted several times for obscenity and blasphemy, and in 1933, despairing at the political situation in Germany, he moved to America to take up the offer of a teaching post at the <a href=""entry://Art Students League of New York""><span class=""links"">Art Students League of New York</span></a>. In America his satirical manner was largely abandoned for more romantic landscapes and still lifes with from time to time apocalyptic visions of a nightmare future. Although he won several honours in the last decade of his life, he regarded himself as a failure because he was unable to win recognition as a serious painter rather than a brilliant satirist, and he painted several self-portraits showing how isolated and depressed he was in his adopted country (<i>The Wanderer</i>, Memorial Art Gallery, the University of Rochester, New York, 1943). He returned to Berlin in 1959, saying ‘my American dream turned out to be a soap bubble’, and died there shortly after his arrival following a fall down a flight of stairs."

<b>Gruber, Francis</b><div class=""content""><i>(1912&ndash;48).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter. His early work was often of visionary subjects, but from about 1933 he began to paint mainly from the model in the studio; he also did still lifes, views through windows, and from 1937 landscapes painted out of doors.

"Grünewald, Mathis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Grünewald, Mathis</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1470/80&ndash;1528).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> German painter, the greatest of <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer's</span></a> contemporaries. His real name was Mathis Gothardt or Neithardt, but this was not discovered until the 1920s; ‘Grünewald’ is an error of <a href=""entry://Sandrart, Joachim von""><span class=""links"">Sandrart</span></a>, who published the first biography of the artist in his <i>Teutsche Akademie</i> (1675), but it is now hallowed by usage. The obscurity into which he fell reflects the isolation and individuality of his work; he had no known pupils and (unlike most of his German contemporaries) he did not make woodcuts or engravings, which would have spread his name. He was successful for most of his career, working as court painter to two successive archbishops of Mainz, but his reputation did not survive, and in 1597, when the emperor Rudolf II tried to buy his masterpiece, the Isenheim Altarpiece, the name of the painter had already been forgotten. The first documentary reference to him (or what appears to be him) is of 1501, when a ‘Master Mathis’ is recorded working in Seligenstadt, a little town near Frankfurt and within the diocese of the Archbishop of Mainz, Uriel von Gemmingen, for whom Grünewald began working in about 1508. Von Gemmingen died in 1514 and Grünewald was employed by his successor Albrecht von Brandenburg (who was also Archbishop of Magdeburg) from 1516 to 1526. Grünewald was employed as a hydraulic engineer and supervisor of architectural works as well as a painter, and in 1520 he accompanied Albrecht to Aix-la-Chapelle for the coronation of emperor Charles V, an occasion on which he met Dürer. The little that is recorded of his personal life comes from Sandrart, who says he was melancholy and withdrawn and made an unhappy marriage late in life. There is no documentary confirmation of his marriage, but he is known to have had an adopted son called Andreas Neithardt, whose surname the painter sometimes used for himself in documents relating to the boy, thus creating one of the sources of confusion about the painter's identity. <br class=""nLine"" />Grünewald's work forms a complete contrast to that of Dürer. Whereas Dürer&mdash;an intellectual imbued with <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> ideas&mdash;had limitless curiosity about the visual world, Grünewald concentrated exclusively on religious themes, and in particular the Crucifixion, a subject he was to make his own. His most famous treatment of it is the central panel of his masterpiece, the altarpiece for the hospital church of the Anthonite Abbey at Isenheim in Alsace, completed in about 1515 and now in the Musée d'Unterlinden, Colmar. The hospital at Isenheim cared particularly for plague victims, and the concentration on Christ's appalling physical agonies, his body gruesomely mangled and torn, was designed to bolster the faith of the sick by reminding them that he too had suffered horribly before triumphing over death. In the <i>Resurrection</i>, Christ displays his nail and lance wounds, but the lacerations that cover his body in the <i>Crucifixion</i> have disappeared, affirming that the patients at the hospital could be cleansed of their diseases and sins. The altarpiece is marked by extreme emotional intensity, brought about by expressive distortion and by colouring of an extraordinary incandescent beauty. Grünewald was familiar with Renaissance ideas of <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a>, but spiritually he belongs to the late medieval world. His other work includes Crucifixions in Basle (Öffentliche Kunstsammlung), Karlsruhe (Staatliche Kunsthalle), and Washington (NG), and several drawings survive. <br class=""nLine"" />The end of Grünewald's career was marked by a decline in his fortunes. He had Protesant sympathies, and following the Peasants’ War in 1525, in which Archbishop Albrecht narrowly escaped death, he was dismissed from his court post. He moved to Frankfurt, where he made a meagre living at a variety of jobs, including selling artists’ colours and a curative balm, the latter presumably something he had learnt about at Isenheim. In 1527 he became convinced his life was in danger and fled to Halle, where he died of plague the following year. His effects included ‘much Lutheran trash’. Grünewald's influence can be seen in the paintings of contemporaries such as <a href=""entry://Grien, Hans Baldung""><span class=""links"">Baldung Grien </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Ratgeb, Jörg""><span class=""links"">Ratgeb</span></a>, but it was not until the advent of <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> in the early 20th cent. that his work started to arouse widespread interest and he began his rise to his present pinnacle of esteem as one of the most awe-inspiring artists of his, or any other, time."
"Guardi, Francesco","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Guardi, Francesco</b><div class=""content""><i>(1712&ndash;93).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Venetian painter, the best-known member of a family of artists. He is now famous for his views of Venice, indeed next to <a href=""entry://Canaletto ""><span class=""links"">Canaletto </span></a> he is the most celebrated view-painter (see <a href=""entry://veduta""><i><span class=""links"">VEDUTA</i></span></a>) of the 18th cent., but he produced work on a great variety of subjects and seems to have concentrated on views only after the death of his brother Gianantonio (1699&ndash;1760). Until then Francesco's personality was largely submerged in the family studio, of which Gianantonio was head and which handled commissions of every kind. Francesco's career was unsuccessful in worldly terms; he was still working for other artists when he was over 40, he never attracted the attention of foreign visitors in the way Canaletto did, and he died in poverty. Recognition of his genius came in the wake of <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a>, when his vibrant and rapidly painted views were seen as having qualities of spontaneity, bravura, and atmosphere lacking in Canaletto's sharply defined and deliberate works. Francesco was enormously prolific and his work is in many public collections in Italy, Britain, and elsewhere. The major problem in Guardi studies concerns the authorship of paintings representing <i>The Story of Tobit</i> that decorate the organ loft of S. Raffaele in Venice. Critical opinion is sharply divided as to whether these brilliant works, painted with brushwork of breathtaking freedom, are by Francesco or Gianantonio (there is dispute also over the dating), but if they are indeed by the latter, he too must rank as a major figure. Giambattista <a href=""entry://Tiepolo, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Tiepolo </span></a> was married to the sister of the Guardi brothers, and it was possibly through his influence that Gianantonio became a founder member of the Venetian Academy in 1756.

"Guercino, Il","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Guercino, Il</b>
<i>(Giovanni Francesco Barbieri )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1591&ndash;1666).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> One of the outstanding Italian painters of the 17th cent., known as Il Guercino (‘Squinting One’) on account of an eye defect. He was born at Cento near Ferrara and his early work drew on a variety of north Italian sources, notably Lodovico <a href=""entry://Carracci""><span class=""links"">Carracci </span></a> and Venetian painting, to create a highly individual style characterized by dramatic and capricious lighting, strong colour, and broad, vigorous brushwork. In 1621 Guercino was summoned to Rome by the Bolognese pope Gregory XV and among other commissions painted the celebrated ceiling fresco of <i>Aurora</i> in the Casino of the Villa Ludovisi for Gregory's nephew. This exuberant work, with its illusionistic architectural framework designed by Agostino <a href=""entry://Tassi, Agostino""><span class=""links"">Tassi </span></a>, is much more <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> in style than Guido <a href=""entry://Reni, Guido""><span class=""links"">Reni's </span></a> treatment of the subject of a decade earlier. Guercino returned to Cento in 1623 on the death of the pope, but his short stay in Rome introduced a more classical feeling to his work. This trend became more pronounced when he moved to Bologna in 1642 to take over the studio of Reni, who died in that year. For the next quarter of a century, until his own death, he was Bologna's leading painter, and his late works can be remarkably similar to Reni's, calm and light in colouring, with little of the lively movement of his early style (<i>St Luke Displaying a Painting of the Virgin</i>, Nelson-Atkins Mus., Kansas City, 1652). Guercino was one of the most brilliant draughtsmen of his age; the finest collection of his drawings is in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle."

<b>Guggenheim, Solomon R.</b><div class=""content""><i>(1861&ndash;1949).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American industrialist, collector, and philanthropist, a member of a famous family of financiers whose fortunes were based on the mining and smelting of metals. Like other members of his family, he devoted much of his vast wealth to philanthropy and in 1937 he founded the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation ‘for the promotion and encouragement of art and education in art’. In 1943 he commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design a museum in New York City to house his collection, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum was opened in 1959, a decade after the founder's death. It is renowned not only for the outstanding collection of late 19th-cent. and 20th-cent. art it contains, but also for the radical nature of the architecture, which marks a complete departure from traditional museum design; the exhibition space is a continuous spiral ramp, six ‘storeys’ high, encircling an open central space. It is architecturally exhilarating, but its suitability for displaying paintings and sculptures has been much questioned. Guggenheim's niece, <i>Peggy Guggenheim </i> (1898&ndash;1979), was a noted patron, collector, and dealer, who played an important role in promoting avant-garde art, in particular by helping to introduce <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a> to the USA and by furthering the career of many leading <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionists</span></a>.

<b>Guido da Siena </b>.<div class=""content"">Sienese painter active during the 13th cent. Nothing is known of his life, and his only certain work is a <i>Madonna and Child</i> in Siena Town Hall. The picture bears the date 1221, but this has been the subject of much controversy as stylistically the painting seems to belong about half a century later. It has been suggested that the inscription may have some commemorative purpose, the significance of which is now lost, rather than being a record of the date of execution. Although the painting is majestic in effect and follows <a href=""entry://Byzantine art""><span class=""links"">Byzantine</span></a> conventions of <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">iconography</span></a>, the figures are more natural in posture, to some extent relaxing the stiff linear patterns which had been conventional in central Italian painting up to that time. The throne too is set in a deeper picture space, which adds to the realism of the figures. On the basis of this picture a number of other panels, most of which are in the Siena Pinacoteca, have been assigned to Guido or his school.

After leaving New York he switched from mural to easel painting, and during the 1940s his work changed in another fundamental way, moving from social and political subjects to abstraction; by 1950 (when, after travels in Europe, he settled in New York again) he had eliminated all figurative elements from his work. His most characteristic paintings feature luminous patches of overlapping colours delicately brushed in the central area of a canvas of light background (<i>Dial</i>, Whitney Museum, New York, 1956). This manner of his has been described as ‘Abstract Impressionism’ and he was associated with the more lyrical wing of <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a>&mdash;he was the only member of the group who had already had a successful career as a figurative painter.

He studied in Paris with Carle <a href=""entry://Vernet""><span class=""links"">Vernet </span></a> and Pierre <a href=""entry://Guérin, Pierre-Narcisse""><span class=""links"">Guérin </span></a>, but was influenced more by making copies of the Old Masters at the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a>, developing in particular a passion for <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>.

On his return to Paris he exhibited the picture for which he is most famous, <i>The Raft of the Medusa</i> (Louvre, Paris, 1819), which although it was awarded a medal at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a>, created a furore both on account of its realistic treatment of a horrific event and because of its political implications (it depicts the ordeal of the survivors of the shipwreck of the <i>Medusa</i> in 1816, a disaster ascribed by some to government incompetence). The picture, which was remarkably original in treating a contemporary event with epic grandeur, also had a <i>succès de scandale</i> in England, where Géricault spent the years 1820&ndash;2. He painted jockeys and horse races (<i>Derby at Epson</i>, Louvre, 1821) and was one of the first to introduce English painting to the notice of French artists (he was particularly enthusiastic about <a href=""entry://Constable, John""><span class=""links"">Constable</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Bonington, Richard Parkes""><span class=""links"">Bonington</span></a>). Géricault was a passionate horseman and his death at the age of 33 was brought on by a riding accident. In his temperament and lifestyle as well as his work he ranks (like Byron, for example) as an archetypal Romantic artist. His tempestuous career lasted little more than a decade and in that time he displayed a meteoric and many-sided genius. His love of stirring action, his sense of swirling movement, his energetic handling of paint, and his taste for the macabre were all to become features of Romanticism. He was, at the same time forward-looking in his realism: he made studies from corpses and severed limbs for <i>The Raft of the Medusa</i> and painted an extraordinary series of portraits of mental patients in the clinic of his friend Dr Georget, one of the pioneers of humane treatment for the insane (<i>A Kleptomaniac</i>, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Ghent, <i>c.</i>1822&ndash;3).

"Hals, Frans","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hals, Frans</b><div class=""content""><i>(1582/3&ndash;1666).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter. He was born in Antwerp, the son of Flemish parents who moved to Holland after the city fell to the Spaniards in 1585. His parents had settled in Haarlem by 1591 and he spent his long life there. He was twice married, had at least ten children, and was constantly in financial trouble. <a href=""entry://Houbraken, Arnold""><span class=""links"">Houbraken</span></a> says he was ‘filled to the gills every evening’, but there is no real foundation for the popular image of him as a drunken wife-beater. His second wife, however, was more than once in trouble for brawling. During his last years he was destitute and the municipal authorities of Haarlem awarded him a small annual stipend four years before his death. <br class=""nLine"" />Hals was the first great artist of the 17th-cent. Dutch school and is regarded as one of the most brilliant of all portraitists. Almost all his works are portraits and even those that are not (some <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes, and an occasional religious picture) are portrait-like in character. He is said to have been taught in Haarlem by Karel van <a href=""entry://Mander, Karel van""><span class=""links"">Mander </span></a>, but there is no discernible influence from him in Hals's early works, which are not numerous or well documented. The earliest extant picture is the fragment of a portrait <i>Jacobus Zaffius</i> (Hals Mus., Haarlem, 1611), and upon the basis of stylistic evidence one or two paintings can be dated a year or so earlier. Nothing he did before 1616 suggested that he would shatter well-established traditions with his life-size group portrait <i>The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company</i> (Hals Mus.) painted during that year. There is no precedent in either his own work or that of his predecessors for the vigorous composition and characterization of this picture, which has become a symbol of the strength and healthy optimism of the men who established the new Dutch Republic. It demonstrates to the full his remarkable ability&mdash;his greatest gift as a portraitist&mdash;to capture a sense of fleeting movement and expression and thereby convey a compelling feeling of vivacity. <br class=""nLine"" />From 1616 onwards there is no shortage of dated or documented works and his artistic development is clear. He was at the height of his popularity in the 1620s and 1630s. During these decades he made five large group portraits of civic guards; one (finished by Pieter <a href=""entry://Codde, Pieter""><span class=""links"">Codde </span></a>) is in the Rijksmuseum and the others are in the Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem, the only place where one can get a comprehensive view of his range and power. In the 1630s his compositions became simpler and monochromatic effects took the place of the bright colours of the earlier paintings (<i>Lucas de Clercq</i> and <i>Feyntje van Steenkiste</i>, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 1635). The group portrait of the <i>Regents of the St Elizabeth Hospital</i> (Hals Mus., 1641) sets the key for the sober restraint of the late period, when his pictures became darker and his brush-strokes more economical. The culmination of this phase&mdash;indeed of his entire career&mdash;are his group portraits of the <i>Regents</i> and the <i>Regentesses of the Old Men's Alms House</i> (Hals Mus., <i>c.</i>1664), which rank among the most moving portraits ever painted. By this time Hals was using in his commissioned portraits the bold brushwork and the <a href=""entry://alla prima.""><i><span class=""links"">alla prima</i></span></a> technique which early in his career he reserved for genre pictures. No drawings by him are known and he presumably worked straight on to the canvas. <br class=""nLine"" />Hals had two painter brothers and five painter sons, but the only artist of substance among them was his brother <i>Dirk</i> (1591&ndash;1656), who painted charming small interior scenes. Apart from his sons, Hals taught numerous pupils, including (with varying degrees of certainty) Judith <a href=""entry://Leyster, Judith""><span class=""links"">Leyster </span></a>, Jan Miense <a href=""entry://Molenaer, Jan Miense""><span class=""links"">Molenaer </span></a>, Adriaen van <a href=""entry://Ostade, Adriaen van""><span class=""links"">Ostade </span></a>, Adriaen <a href=""entry://Brouwer, Adriaen""><span class=""links"">Brouwer </span></a>, and Philips <a href=""entry://Wouwerman ""><span class=""links"">Wouwerman </span></a>. His reputation did not long outlive him, however, and with rare exceptions&mdash;<a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a> was one of them&mdash;few critics before 1850 praised him. It was only in the second half of the 19th cent. that there was a renewed appreciation of his genius. The spontaneity of his work appealed to the generation of the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>, and from about 1870 to about 1920 he was one of the most popular of the Old Masters, becoming a model for society portraitists. Lord Hertford's purchase of his most famous work. <i>The Laughing Cavalier</i> (Wallace Coll., London, 1624), for the then enormous sum of 51,00 francs in 1865, was a milestone in the revival of his fortunes, and the buoyant confidence of his paintings later made him a particular favourite with the new generation of fabulously rich American collectors&mdash;self-made men-who were beginning to dominate the picture market. This explains why so many works by him are in American collections."

<b>happening</b>.<div class=""content"">A form of entertainment, often carefully planned but usually including some degree of spontaneity, in which an artist performs or directs an event combining elements of theatre and the visual arts. The term was coined by Allan <a href=""entry://Kaprow, Allan""><span class=""links"">Kaprow </span></a> in 1959 and has been used to cover a diversity of contrived artistic phenomena.

It had close affinities with theatrical and <a href=""entry://Performance art""><span class=""links"">Performance art</span></a>, and it was not restricted like the environment to the confines of a gallery or some other site.

In 1912, help from <a href=""entry://Stieglitz, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Stieglitz</span></a> (who had given him his first one-man exhibition in 1909), enabled him to travel to Europe, but finding <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a> Paris little to his taste he went to Munich and Berlin, where the <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> of <a href=""entry://Kandinsky, Wassily""><span class=""links"">Kandinsky </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Jawlensky, Alexei von""><span class=""links"">Jawlensky</span></a> proved more congenial, and he exhibited with the <a href=""entry://Blaue Reiter, Der""><span class=""links"">Blaue Reiter</span></a> in Berlin in 1913. Later that year he returned to America and exhibited at the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a>. From 1914 to 1916 he was again in Europe, visiting London, Paris, Berlin, and Munich. During these years he painted in an abstract manner with Expressionist overtones, as in the famous <i>Painting No. 5</i> (Whitney Mus., New York, 1914&ndash;15), a picture painted in rich Expressionist colours and incorporating military emblems and decorations of wartime Germany. Instead of continuing on this path, however, on his return to the USA in 1916, he began to paint near-*<a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivist</span></a> abstracts in clear pastel hues. In 1917 he abandoned abstraction and from 1918 to 1920 did dramatic pastels of the New Mexico landscape, upon which in the early 1920s he based equally dramatic though more formalized oils. In the 1920s and early 1930s he led a wandering, unsettled life, visiting France, Italy, Germany, and New Mexico. He settled in Maine in 1934 and his late works consisted mainly of rugged mountain and coastal scenes. Hartley was a lonely, reclusive, rather haunted character whose work reveals on intense feeling for the beauty of nature."

In 1935 he fled from Germany and settled in Paris. During the war he served in the French Foreign Legion and was seriously wounded. After the war he returned to Paris, and developed a highly original and vibrant style of abstract painting in which thick black lines and blotches predominate in a manner superficially analogous to calligraphic scribbling.

His life was a story of bombastic frustration and intransigent opposition to the establishment (particularly the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a>), fighting continuously for personal recognition and arguing for the social purpose of art. As a painter, however, his talents fell far short of his ambitions, his multi-figure compositions degenerating into turgid melodrama. His great monument, rather, is the massive collection of autobiographical writings he left behind him (various editions have been published), which gives fascinating insights into the contemporary artistic scene and paints a vividly detailed picture of his disturbed mind and tragicomical life. He was closely linked with the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> movement in literature, particularly with William Wordsworth, who wrote a sonnet to him, and with John Keats, doing portraits of both of them (NPG, London), and but for his lack of talent he would exemplify all the traits traditionally ascribed to the Romantic concept of genius. In true Romantic fashion his death came by suicide."

<b>Hayman, Francis</b><div class=""content""><i>(1707/8&ndash;76).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter and book illustrator. He was the most versatile British artist of his period, painting portraits, subjects from literature and the theatre (notably Shakespeare), and scenes of rural folklore; he also had the reputation of being ‘unquestionably the best historical painter in the kingdom before the arrival of <a href=""entry://Cipriani, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Cipriani</span></a>’ (Edward Edwards, <i>Anecdotes of Painters

<b>Hayter, S. W.</b>

He spent most of his life in Paris, where in 1927 he founded an experimental workshop for the graphic arts&mdash;Atelier 17&mdash;that played a central role in the 20th-cent. revival of the print as an independent art form. (The name was adopted in 1933 when Hayter moved his establishment from its original home to 17 rue Campagne-Premiène.) In 1940&ndash;50 he lived in New York, taking Atelier 17 with him. Hayter was a chemist by training and had an unrivalled knowledge of the technicalities of printmaking, on which he wrote two major books, <i>New Ways of Gravure</i> (1949) and <i>About Prints</i> (1962). Although his historical importance has long been acknowledged (probably no modern British artist has been so influential internationally), it is only recently that his own work has won him belated recognition as one of the outstanding graphic artists of his time. His prints are varied in technique and style, but most characteristically are influenced by the abstract vein of <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a> and are notable for their experiments with texture and colour."

On the death of <a href=""entry://Wilkie, Sir David""><span class=""links"">Wilkie </span></a> in 1841 he was made ‘principal painter in ordinary to the queen’. He is known chiefly for his royal portraits and his huge groups (<i>House of Commons</i>, NPG, London, 1833), unexciting in their handling, but composed with dexterity and accomplished grandiloquence. In spite of his royal favour he was never a member of the Royal Academy, seemingly because, after an unfortunate early marriage, he lived with a woman who was not his wife."
"Hazlitt, William","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hazlitt, William</b><div class=""content""><i>(1778&ndash;1830).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English essayist.

Although he studied painting and did some portraits (one of Charles Lamb, 1804, is in the National Portrait Gallery, London), he lived mainly by journalism, publishing essays in various radical journals. Hazlitt was a <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> critic in placing much more importance on the role of genius in artistic creation than on rules or theories. Thus he admired Reynold's paintings, but attacked his ideas. A significant characteristic of Hazlitt's writing is that (unlike most previous art criticism) it was written for the general reader rather than for the connoisseur or practising artist."

During the early 1950s he was a significant figure in promoting abstract art&mdash;by organizing collective exhibitions at his London studio (at 22 Fitzroy Street) in 1951, 1952, and 1953, and by writing a short popular book on the subject, <i>Abstract Painting: Its Origin and Meaning</i> (1953), which begins with the sentence: ‘There seems to be little understanding of the values of abstract painting and consequently no general appreciation of its qualities.’ The exhibitions helped to inspire Lawrence <a href=""entry://Alloway, Lawrence""><span class=""links"">Alloway's </span></a> book <i>Nine Abstract Artists</i> (1954).

"Heckel, Erich","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Heckel, Erich</b><div class=""content""><i>(1883&ndash;1970).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German painter and graphic artist, one of the founders of Die <a href=""entry://Brücke, Die""><span class=""links"">Brücke</span></a>. His work was somewhat more lyrical than that of the other members of Die Brücke and he showed a special concern for depicting sickness and inner anguish. His landscapes, too, sometimes displayed a decorative quality which was foreign to most German <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a>. In 1911 he settled in Berlin with <a href=""entry://Kirchner, Ernst Ludwig""><span class=""links"">Kirchner</span></a> and other members of Die Brücke.

But his image of humanity became even more pessimistic, with harshly angular distortions, anguished expressions, and rigid, distracted gestures. In the First World War Heckel served as a medical orderly in Flanders and came into contact there with <a href=""entry://Ensor, James""><span class=""links"">Ensor </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Beckmann, Max""><span class=""links"">Beckmann </span></a>, by whom he was again influenced. His landscapes became more sombre in colour, expressing the agony of war through conflict of the elements, and the melancholic and tragic mood of his work was enhanced. After 1920 his style became more conventional, losing its verve and intensity. His work was declared <a href=""entry://degenerate art""><span class=""links"">degenerate</span></a> by the Nazis in 1937. In 1944 his Berlin studio was destroyed by fire and he retired to Hemmenhofen on Lake Constance. From 1949 to 1955 he taught at the Karlsruhe Academy."

In 1636 he moved to Antwerp, became a citizen of that city in 1637, and spent most of his very productive life there. The paintings he did in Flanders are the ones for which he is most renowned and are very different in spirit from his earlier works: splendid flower pieces and large compositions of exquisitely laid tables which breathe all the opulent exuberance of Flemish <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> painting. His work formed a link between the Dutch and Flemish still-life traditions and he is claimed by both schools.

His principal training was with Jan van <a href=""entry://Scorel, Jan van""><span class=""links"">Scorel </span></a> in Utrecht, <i>c.</i>1527&ndash;9. Although Heemskerck was only three years younger than Scorel and was a mature man when he entered his studio (he had already studied with two other teachers), the experience left a distinctive mark on him. In some pictures, particularly the portraits, experts still have difficulty differentiating their hands. As a rule, however, Heemskerck's paintings are more crowded and nervous than Scorel's balanced and harmonious compositions. Equally important for Heemskerck's development was a visit to Italy (1532&ndash;5), where he was overwhelmed by <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>. When he returned to the Netherlands he emulated Michelangelo by painting large works packed with muscle-bound figures in vigorous movement (<i>Christ Crowned with Thorns</i>, Hals Museum, Haarlem). During his stay in Rome Heemskerck made drawings of ancient and modern buildings and sculpture; they are valuable historical documents as well as sensitive impressions of the marvels of Rome. His interest in antiquity also comes out in his self-portrait of 1533 (Fitzwilliam, Cambridge), in which he shows the Colosseum in the background. Heemskerck was one of the leading Netherlandish painters of the 16th cent. and his work was much engraved and highly influential."

It had affinities with <a href=""entry://Hard Edge painting""><span class=""links"">Hard-Edge painting</span></a>, but Held's work was distinguished by his use of very heavily textured paint. He often worked on a huge scale, giving his paintings an extremely forceful physical impact. In 1967 he began making black-and-white paintings, using white linear structures on a black ground or black lines on a white ground to create overlapping and interlocking box-like forms that demonstrate his interest in Renaissance perspective. In the 1980s he reintroduced colour with a vengeance, as in his 55-feet-long mural <i>Mantegna's Edge</i> (Southland Center, Dallas, 1983), a work of tremendous high-keyed vigour."

Hellenistic art is more varied in inspiration than that of the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">Classical</span></a> age which preceded it, and the sculpture of the period is often remarkable for its technical bravura and overt display of emotion, as in the celebrated <i><a href=""entry://Laocoön""><span class=""links"">Laocoön</i></a></span>, the most famous of Hellenistic works of art.

The essence of his teaching was that art should grow from life, not from theories. He said that he wanted his own paintings to be ‘as clear and as simple and sincere as is humanly possible’, and he was a powerful force in turning young American painters away from academism to look at the rich subject-matter provided by modern urban life, ‘regarded by many of his contemporaries as the most influential single force affecting the development of American art in the generation preceding the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a> of 1913’ (William Innes Homer, <i>Robert Henri and His Circle</i>, 1969). Henri was open-minded about the new developments seen at the Armory Show but he was not interested in experiment for experiment's sake and his own painting was little affected by it. His early work had been <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a>, but in the 1890s he adopted a darker palette, with rapid slashing brushwork geared to creating a sense of vitality and immediacy. From 1909 his work became more colourful again. Apart from scenes of urban life, he painted many portraits, and also landscapes and seascapes (which have been rather neglected). He made frequent visits to Europe and found inspiration there for figure studies of picturesque characters&mdash;Irish peasants, gypsies, and so on. His paintings are dashing but rather superfical and they are generally regarded as much less important than his teaching and crusading. Henri wrote numerous articles on art and in 1923 published <i>The Art Spirit</i>, a collection of his letters, lectures, and aphorisms, in which art is seen as an expression of love for life."
"Hepworth, Dame Barbara","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hepworth, Dame Barbara</b><div class=""content""><i>(1903&ndash;75).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English sculptor, one of the most important figures in the development of abstract art in Britain. She trained at Leeds School of Art, where she became a friend of Henry <a href=""entry://Moore, Henry""><span class=""links"">Moore </span></a>, and at the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a>. Her early sculptures were quasi-naturalistic and had much in common with Moore's work (<i>Doves</i>, Manchester City Art Gal., 1927), but she already showed a tendency to submerge detail in simple forms, and by the early 1930s her work was entirely abstract. She worked both in wood and stone, and she described an important aspect of her early career as being ‘the excitement of discovering the nature of carving’&mdash;this at a time when there was a general antagonism to ‘direct carving’. In this, too, she was united with Moore, but her work, unlike his, is not representational in origin but conceived as abstract forms. Yet she consistently professed a <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> attitude of emotional affinity with nature, speaking of carving both as a ‘biological necessity’ and as an ‘extension of the telluric forces which mould the landscape’. From 1925 to 1931 Hepworth was married to the sculptor John Skeaping (1901&ndash;80). In 1931 she met Ben <a href=""entry://Nicholson, Ben""><span class=""links"">Nicholson </span></a>, who became her second husband a year later, and through him she became aware of contemporary European developments. They joined <a href=""entry://Abstraction-Création""><span class=""links"">Abstraction-Création</span></a> in 1933, and <a href=""entry://Unit One""><span class=""links"">Unit One</span></a> in the same year. During the 1930s Hepworth, Nicholson, and Moore worked in close harmony and became recognized as the nucleus of the abstract movement in England. In 1939 Hepworth moved to St Ives in Cornwall with Nicholson and lived there for the rest of her life (see <a href=""entry://St Ives School""><span class=""links"">ST IVES SCHOOL</span></a>). During the late 1930s and 1940s she began to concentrate on the counterplay between mass and space in sculpture. In 1931 in <i>Pierced Form</i> (destroyed in the war) she first introduced into England the use of the ‘hole’, and she now developed this with great subtlety, making play with the relationship between the outside and inside of a figure, the two surfaces sometimes being linked with threaded string, as in <i>Pelagos</i> (Tate, London, 1946). <i>Pelagos</i> also shows her sensitive use of painted surface to contrast with the natural grain of the wood. In all her work she displayed a deep understanding of the quality of her materials and superb standards of craftsmanship. By the 1950s she was one of the most internationally famous of sculptors and she received many honours and prestigious public commissions, among them the memorial to Dag Hammerskjold&mdash;<i>Single Form</i>&mdash;at the United Nations in New York (1963). She now worked more in bronze, especially for large pieces, but she always retained a special feeling for direct carving. Hepworth died tragically in a fire at her studio in St Ives. The studio is now a museum dedicated to her work."

He established his reputation with <i>The Last Muster&mdash;Sunday at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea</i> (Lady Lever Art Gal., Port Sunlight, 1875), a work appealing to the public taste for patriotic sentiment, and then became a successful and prolific portrait painter. His best-known works today, however, are his scenes of social concern, which were then still something of a novelty in English art (<i>On Strike</i>, Royal Academy, London, 1891). Herkomer was a versatile artist and a man of many parts. He founded and directed a school of art at Bushey, Hertfordshire, 1883&ndash;1904, was <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> Professor of Fine Art at Oxford, 1885&ndash;94, and published several books.

<b>Hermitage</b>, St Petersburg.<div class=""content"">The largest public museum and art gallery in Russia and one of the most important in the world. It takes its name from a pleasure pavilion adjoining the Winter Palace, built to the order of Catherine the Great in 1764&ndash;7 (the ‘Little Hermitage’) for the display of her treasures. In 1787 it was incorporated in a new building (the Old Hermitage). Catherine was one of the most voracious collectors of all time and at her death in 1796 the imperial collections were estimated to total nearly 4,000 pictures. From 1802 pictures by Russian artists began to be added to the imperial collections. In 1837 the Winter Palace was ravaged by fire and the New Hermitage was built by the German architect Leo von Klenze, 1840&ndash;9. It was opened to the public by Nicholas I in 1852. In the following year the Czar sold over 1,200 pictures, but the collection continued to grow, doubling the number of its pictures between 1910 and 1932 despite extensive sales by the Soviets (after the Russian Revolution in 1917 the imperial collections came into public ownership). The representation of Western painting is rich in virtually every period and school, but perhaps most notably in 17th-cent. Dutch painting (the largest collection in the world) and in French painting of the late 19th and early 20th cents (almost all the great figures of <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionism</span></a> are well represented). Many of the French paintings come from the collections of two Moscow businessmen who were among the outstanding collectors and patrons of their time: Ivan Morozov (1871&ndash;1921) and Sergei Shchukin (1851&ndash;1936). They commissioned new works as well as buying through dealers. <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a> was a particular favourite of both men, and Shchukin's interest also extended to <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>.

About 1638 Herrera moved to Madrid, where he died.

He returned to Spain after his father's death and was appointed <a href=""entry://Murillo, Bartolomé Esteban""><span class=""links"">Murillo's </span></a> deputy at the Academy of Seville when it was founded in 1660. Soon afterwards he moved to Madrid, where he was appointed Painter to the King (Charles II) in 1672 and Master of the Royal Works in 1677. His greatest achievement was the design (subsequently modified) of the church of El Pilar at Saragossa, begun in 1681. His work as a painter, airy and colourful, owed much to the example of Murillo."

He painted some landscapes and still lifes, but is celebrated as one of the greatest of all townscape painters. His views of towns are done with loving attention to detail, but the harmonious colours and sunny light of his elegantly composed pictures prevent the precise way he rendered foliage, bricks, and architectural detail from appearing dull or dry.

His most characteristic works were nude figures&mdash;timeless and rather austere, in the high-minded tradition of Greek art. He is now, however, better known for his treatise <i>Das Problem der Form in der bildenden Kunst</i> (1893) than for his highly accomplished but rather bland sculpture. The book went through many editions (an English translation, <i>The Problem of Form in Painting and Sculpture</i>, was published in 1907) and its credo of ‘pure form’ was influential in promoting a move against surface naturalism in sculpture."
"Hilliard, Nicholas","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

He was the son of an Exeter goldsmith and trained as a jeweller. In about 1570 he was appointed Court Miniaturist and Goldsmith by Elizabeth I, and he also worked for James I, but after the turn of the century his position as the leading miniaturist in the country was challenged by his former pupil Isaac <a href=""entry://Oliver, Isaac""><span class=""links"">Oliver </span></a>. These two were head and shoulders above their contemporaries and dominated the <a href=""entry://limner""><span class=""links"">limning</span></a> of their era. Hilliard's reputation extended to France, which he visited <i>c.</i>1577&ndash;8. In his treatise <i>The Arte of Limning</i> (written in about 1600 but not published until 1912) Hilliard declared himself as a follower of <a href=""entry://Holbein, Hans""><span class=""links"">Holbein's </span></a> manner of limning. In particular he avoided the use of shadow for modelling and in his treatise he records that this was in agreement with Queen Elizabeth's taste&mdash;‘for the lyne without shadows showeth all to good jugment, but the shadowe without lyne showeth nothing’. But whereas for Holbein a miniature was always a painting reduced to a small scale, Hilliard developed in the miniature an intimacy and subtlety peculiar to that art. He combined his unerring use of line with a jeweller's exquisiteness in detail, an engraver's elegance in calligraphy, and a unique realization of the individuality of each sitter. His miniatures are often freighted with enigmatic inscription and intrusive allegory (e.g. a hand reaching from a cloud); yet this literary burden usually manages to heighten the vividness with which the sitter's face is impressed. Apart from the Queen herself, many other of the great Elizabethans sat for him, including Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Sir Philip Sidney . The finest collection of his miniatures is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. He is known also to have worked on a large scale and among the paintings attributed to him are portraits of Elizabeth I in the National Portrait Gallery, London, and the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. In spite of his success, Hilliard had considerable financial problems and in 1617 was briefly imprisoned for debt. His son <i>Lawrence</i> (1582&ndash;after 1640) was also a miniaturist."

In 1942&ndash;5 he was a prisoner of war. In Paris Hilton had absorbed a strong feeling for the sensuous qualities of paint, and in the 1950s he became one of the leading British abstract painters, using interlocking coloured shapes. From the mid-1950s he introduced a shallow sense of pictorial space into his work, and no longer eschewed figural elements. In the 1960s he did a series of exuberant, jokey, female nudes that are among his best-known works (<i>Oi yoi yoi</i>, Tate, London, 1963). Their sense of good humour is also present in the colourful gouaches he did in the last two-and-a-half years of his life, belying the ill health that by this time kept him bed-ridden."

He created a highly distinctive style on the borderline between abstraction and figuration in which broad, fluid areas of vibrant colour, typically on a canvas of wide format, evoke but do not represent the forms of the English countryside that were his main inspiration. From 1940, after being bombed in London, he lived in Sussex. By this time his characteristic manner was fully developed and subsequently his work altered little, apart from the fact that his palette changed from naturalistic browns and greens to much more vivid colours such as bright yellows and purples. Contrary to what often happens when an artist remains constant in one style over a period of decades, Hitchens's work did not become stereotyped or banal. Hitchens also painted flowers and figures, and did several large murals, for example at the University of Sussex (1963)."

In 1668 he became a wine gauger with the Amsterdam customs and excise, and thereafter seems to have painted only in his spare time. However, his most famous work, <i>The Avenue at Middelharnis</i> (NG, London), dates from 1689.

"Hockney, David","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hockney, David</b><div class=""content""><i>(1937&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter, draughtsman, printmaker, photographer, and designer, active mainly in the USA. After a brilliant prize-winning career as a student at the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a>, Hockney had achieved considerable success by the time he was in his mid-twenties, and he has since consolidated his position as by far the best-known and most critically acclaimed British artist of his generation. His phenomenal success has been based not only on the flair and versatility of his work, but also on his colourful personality, which has made him a recognizable figure even to people not particularly interested in art. In 1961 he emerged as one of the leaders of British <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a> at the <a href=""entry://Young Contemporaries""><span class=""links"">Young Contemporaries</span></a> exhibition. Hockney himself disliked the label ‘Pop’, but his work of this time makes many references to popular culture (notably in the use of graffiti-like lettering) and is often jokey in mood. His first retrospective exhibition came as early as 1970, at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (it subsequently toured to Hanover, Rotterdam, and Belgrade). By this time he was painting in a weightier, more traditionally representational manner, in which he did a series of large double-portraits of friends, including the well-known <i>Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy</i> (Tate Gallery, London, 1970&ndash;1). These portraits are notable for their airy feeling of space and light and the subtle flattening and simplification of forms, as well as for the sense of stylish living they capture. Hockney often paints the people and places he knows best (his art is frequently autobiographical) and has memorably celebrated his romance with Los Angeles (he first visited the city in 1963 and settled there permanently in 1976), particularly in his many paintings featuring swimming pools (<i>A Bigger Splash</i>, Tate Gallery, London, 1967). In these works he skilfully exploited the qualities of the new <a href=""entry://acrylic""><span class=""links"">acrylic</span></a> paint. Hockney has also been outstanding as a graphic artist. His work in this field includes etched illustrations to Cavafy's <i>Poems</i> (1967) and <i>Six Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm</i> (1969), as well as many individual prints, often on homoerotic themes. In the 1970s he came to the fore as a stage designer, notably with his set and costume designs for Stravinsky's <i>The Rake's Progress</i> and Mozart's <i>The Magic Flute</i>, produced at Glyndebourne in 1975 and 1978 respectively. The broader style demanded by stage design has been reflected in his subsequent easel paintings. In the 1980s he experimented a good deal with photography, producing, for example, photographic collages and&mdash;since 1986&mdash;prints created on a photocopier. Hockney is a perceptive commentator on art and has published two substantial books on his own work: <i>David Hockney by David Hockney</i> (1976) and <i>That's the Way I See It</i> (1993)."

She was the daughter of <i>William Matthew Hodgkins </i> (1833&ndash;98), an amateur painter who had emigrated from England in 1859 and took a lead in the artistic life of Dunedin. Her father taught her watercolour painting, but she did not begin to paint in oils until 1915.

<b>Hodler, Ferdinand</b><div class=""content""><i>(1853&ndash;1918).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Swiss painter, active mainly in Geneva. He ranks alongside <a href=""entry://Böcklin, Arnold""><span class=""links"">Böcklin</span></a> as the outstanding Swiss artist of the 19th cent., but his early work (till 1890) was rather unimaginatively naturalistic, and his landcapes were hardly more than rather ambitious colour postcards for tourists. But with his <i>Night</i> (Kunstmuseum, Berne) of 1890 began a sudden change of style. From then on Hodler's canvases were filled with monumental and simplified flat figures, composed into a rhythmic and repetitive pattern of lines, forms, and colours&mdash;a method which the artist himself called ‘Parallelism’. Contacts with the Rosicrucians (he exhibited at the first <a href=""entry://Salon de la Rose + Croix""><span class=""links"">Salon de la Rose + Croix</span></a> in Paris in 1892) and possibly knowledge of the aims of Maurice <a href=""entry://Denis, Maurice""><span class=""links"">Denis </span></a> gave a markedly <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolist</span></a> flavour to his art (<i>The Disappointed</i>, Kunstmuseum, 1892). He applied the same principles to <a href=""entry://history painting""><span class=""links"">history painting</span></a> (<i>The Return from Marignano</i>, Kunsthaus, Zurich 1896&ndash;1900) and to his Swiss landscapes. Holder became immensely popular in the German-speaking world and ranks among the harbingers of <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a>."
"Hofmann, Hans","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hofmann, Hans</b><div class=""content""><i>(1880&ndash;1966).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German-born painter and teacher who became an American citizen in 1941. From 1904 to 1914 he lived in Paris, where he knew many of the leading figures of <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauvism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Orphism""><span class=""links"">Orphism</span></a>. In 1915 he founded his own art school in Munich and taught there successfully until 1932, when he emigrated to the USA (following visits in 1930 and 1931 during which he taught at the University of California, Berkeley). He founded the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts in New York in 1934 (followed the next year by a summer school at Provincetown, Massachusetts) and became a teacher of great influence on the minority group of American artists who practised abstract painting during the 1930s. Hofmann continued teaching until 1958, when he closed his schools so that he could concentrate on his own painting. This was to counter opinions that he was merely an academic figure and a symbol of the avant-garde rather than a creative artist. In the course of his career he experimented with many styles, and was a pioneer of the technique of dribbling and pouring paint that was later particularly associated with Jackson <a href=""entry://Pollock, Jackson""><span class=""links"">Pollock </span></a>. His later works, in contrast, feature rectangular blocks of fairly solid colour against a more broken background. He gave a large collection of his pictures to the University of California, Berkeley. As a painter and teacher Hofmann was an important influence on the development of <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a>.

"Hogarth, William","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hogarth, William</b><div class=""content""><i>(1697&ndash;1764).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter and engraver. He trained as an engraver in the <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> tradition, and by 1720 was established in London independently as an engraver on copper of billheads and book illustrations. In his spare time he studied painting, first at the <a href=""entry://St Martin's Lane Academy""><span class=""links"">St Martin's Lane Academy</span></a> and later under Sir James <a href=""entry://Thornhill, Sir James""><span class=""links"">Thornhill </span></a>, whose daughter he married in 1729. By this time he had begun to make a name with small <a href=""entry://conversation piece""><span class=""links"">conversation pieces</span></a>, and about 1730 he set up as a portrait painter. At about the same time he invented and popularized the use of a sequence of anecdotal pictures ‘similar to representations on the stage’ to point a moral and satirize social abuses. <i>A Harlot's Progress</i> (6 scenes, <i>c.</i>1731; destroyed by fire) was followed by <i>A Rake's Progress</i> (8 scenes, Sir John Soane's Mus., London, <i>c.</i>1735), and <i>Marriage à la Mode</i> (6 scenes, NG, London, <i>c.</i>1743), which each portray the punishment of vice in a somewhat lurid melodrama. Each series was painted with a view to being engraved, and the engravings had a wide sale and were popular with all classes. They were much pirated and Hogarth's campaigning against the profiteers led to the Copyright Act of 1735. ‘I have endeavoured’, he wrote, ‘to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer: my picture is my stage, and men and women my players.’ Hogarth, however, was much more than a preacher in paint. His satire was directed as much at pedantry and affectation as at immorality, and he saw himself to some extent as a defender of native common sense against a fashion for French and Italian mannerisms. In spite of his rabid xenophobia, Hogarth made some attempts to show he could paint in the Italian <a href=""entry://Grand Manner""><span class=""links"">Grand Manner</span></a> (<i>Sigismunda</i>, Tate, London, 1759). These, however, are generally considered his weakest works, and apart from his modern morality subjects he excelled mainly in portraiture. <i>Captain Coram</i> (Coram Foundation, London, 1740), which he regarded as his highest achievement in portraiture, shows that he could paint a portrait in the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> manner with complete confidence and without artificiality. However, he could not flatter or compromise and had not the disposition for a successful portraitist. From 1735 to 1755 he ran an academy in St Martin's Lane (independent of the one at which he had studied), and this became the main forerunner of the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a>. In 1753 he published <i>The Analysis of Beauty</i>, a treatise on aesthetic theory which he wrote with the conviction that the views of a practising artist should carry greater weight than the theories of the connoisseur or dilettante. <br class=""nLine"" />Hogarth was far and away the most important British artist of his generation. He was equally outstanding as a painter and engraver and by the force of his pugnacious personality as well as by the quality and originality of his work he freed British art from its domination by foreign artists. Because so much of his work has a ‘literary’ element, his qualities as a painter have often been overlooked, but his more informal pictures in particular show that his brushwork could live up to his inventive genius. The vigour and spontaneity of <i>The Shrimp Girl</i> (NG, London, <i>c.</i>1740), for example, have made it deservedly one of the most popular British paintings of the 18th cent."
"Holanda","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Holanda </b>
<i>(or Hollanda ), Francisco de</i><div class=""content""><i>(1517&ndash;84).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Portuguese draughtsman, <a href=""entry://miniature""><span class=""links"">miniaturist</span></a>, and writer on art, the son of a Netherlandish miniaturist, <i>Antonio de Holanda </i>, who spent part of his career in Lisbon. Francisco grew up in Portugal. In 1538&ndash;9 he visited Rome and produced a volume of drawings (now in the Escorial, near Madrid) which contains interesting portraits and drawings of Roman antiquities that are an important source of information about 16th-cent. collecting and archaeology. Although he became Court Painter in Lisbon, his influence in propagating the Italianate style in Portugal was exercised mainly through his writings. In 1548 he completed a manuscript entitled <i>Da Pintura Antigua</i> (Of Ancient Painting), which was not published until 1890&ndash;6. It contains four dialogues (Eng. trans., 1928) in which Holanda purportedly discusses theories of art with <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, the miniaturist Giulio <a href=""entry://Clovio, Giulio""><span class=""links"">Clovio </span></a>, and others. As an appendage Holanda completed in 1549 ten dialogues entitled <i>Do tirar polo natural</i> (On Drawing from Nature)."
"Holbein, Hans","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Holbein, Hans</b><div class=""content""><i>(1497/8&ndash;1543).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German painter and designer, chiefly celebrated as one of the greatest of all portraitists. He trained in his native Augsburg with his father, <i>Hans Holbein the Elder</i> (<i>c.</i>1465&ndash;1524)&mdash;another son, <i>Ambrosius</i> (1494&ndash;<i>c.</i>1519), was also a painter&mdash;and in about 1514 moved to Basle. There he quickly found employment as a designer for printers, and in 1516 he painted portraits of Burgomaster Meyer and his wife (Öffentliche Kunstsammlung, Basle). From 1517 to 1519 he was working in Lucerne, assisting his father on the decoration of a house for the von Hertenstein family (now destroyed). It is possible that during this time he crossed the Alps to Lombardy, for on his return to Basle, where he was to remain until 1526, his style was less harsh, his modelling softer, and his composition more monumental. The harrowing <i>Christ in the Tomb</i> (Öffentliche Kunstsammlung, 1521 or 1522), for example, has a power of expression combined with a mastery of <a href=""entry://chiaroscuro""><i><span class=""links"">chiaroscuro</i></span></a> that almost rivals <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>. <br class=""nLine"" />He was now the leading painter in Basle, and gained an important commission for decorating the Town Hall with scenes of <i>Justice</i> taken from classical history. Apart from fragments in the Öffentliche Kunstsammlung, Basle, these are lost, but are known from copies. He also continued to work for printers, producing between 1523 and 1526 his best-known work in this field, the series on the <i>Dance of Death.</i> Since these reflected the new critical outlook of the Reformation, they were not published until 1538 in Lyons, when they enjoyed enormous popularity, running into many editions. His most notable portraits in these years are those of Erasmus (Louvre, Paris; Earl of Radnor Coll., Longford Castle, Wiltshire; and Öffentliche Kunstsammlung, Basle; all <i>c.</i>1523). In them, perhaps by the sitter's wish, he used for the first time the formula of the scholar in his study, first devised by Quentin <a href=""entry://Massys ""><span class=""links"">Massys </span></a>, also for a portrait of Erasmus. A visit to France in 1524 gave Holbein further knowledge of <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> painting, especially through the works of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> in the royal collection, and the effect may be seen in the <i>Madonna of Burgomaster Meyer</i> (Schlossmuseum, Darmstadt, 1526). Mother and Child alike have an ideal beauty which is quite unGerman, though the <a href=""entry://donor""><span class=""links"">donor</span></a> portraits have a splendid naturalism. <br class=""nLine"" />The disturbances of the Reformation meant a decline of patronage in Basle, and in 1526, armed with an introduction from Erasmus to Sir Thomas More, Holbein sought work in England. His great group portrait of the More family (lost, but later copies in the NPG, London, and Nostell Priory, West Yorkshire) is a landmark in European art, for no previous artist had produced a group portrait of full-length figures in their own home. A number of single portraits date from this visit, but Holbein obtained no commissions for subject pictures and returned home in 1528. Basle, however, had changed. Religious pictures were banned and there was much religious strife. Holbein accepted the Reformed religion, continued his work at the Town Hall, and made many designs for stained glass. In 1532, leaving his family, he returned to England. More was now out of favour and Holbein found new patrons in the German Steelyard Merchants, for whom he painted several portraits and did decorative work. <br class=""nLine"" />Through the Steelyards he probably met Thomas Cromwell (portrait, Frick Coll., New York, 1532&ndash;3), who may have obtained for him the commission for his famous double portrait <i>The Ambassadors</i> (NG, London, 1533), and almost certainly helped him to gain royal patronage. By 1536 he was working for Henry VIII, and in the next year undertook his most famous English work, the wall-painting in Whitehall Palace of Henry VIII with his father and mother and his third wife, Jane Seymour. Though the picture perished in 1698, part of the <a href=""entry://cartoon""><span class=""links"">cartoon</span></a> survives (NPG, London) and the formidable figure of the King standing four-square and staring at the spectator is well known through copies. The only portrait of the King indisputably from Holbein's hand is a bust-length picture in the Thyssen collection in Madrid, a type of which numerous replicas exist. The King also sent Holbein abroad to paint prospective brides&mdash;<i>Anne of Cleves</i> (Louvre, 1539), <i>Christina, Duchess of Milan</i> (NG, London, 1538). Numerous other members of the court are portrayed in paintings and in drawings, a marvellous collection of which is in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. Many designs for decoration survive from Holbein's last years, when he also turned to <a href=""entry://miniature""><span class=""links"">miniature</span></a> painting, to which his exquisitely detailed craftsmanship was eminently suited. Holbein's portraits were much copied, but none of his followers in England approached the penetration of his characterization or the virtuosity of his technique. Only in miniature painting did he have a worthy successor in <a href=""entry://Hilliard, Nicholas""><span class=""links"">Hilliard </span></a>."

"Homer, Winslow","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Homer, Winslow</b><div class=""content""><i>(1836&ndash;1910).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American landscape, marine, and <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> painter. He came to painting from illustration (chiefly for <i>Harper's Weekly</i>) and <i>Prisoners from the Front</i> (Met. Mus., New York, 1866), one of his first important oils, has a quality of vivid, unromanticized reportage. He aspired to naturalistic recording and expressed his attitude in the words: ‘When I have selected the thing carefully, I paint it exactly as it appears.’ In 1867 Homer visited Paris; he was influenced by <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet's </span></a> broad tonal contrasts, but he explored the rendering of light and colour in a direction other than that of the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>&mdash;instead of dissolving outline into light and atmosphere, he sought luminosity within a firm construction of clear outline and broad planes of light and dark (<i>Long Branch, New Jersey</i>, Mus. of Fine Arts, Boston, 1869). The sea was Homer's favourite subject, and after living near Tynemouth on the rugged coast of north-east England in 1881&ndash;2 he settled at Prout's Neck on the Maine coast, where he lived in isolation. His pictures of the Maine coast, which represent the power and solitude of the sea and the contest of man with the forces of nature, are his best-known works. Homer was an artist of considerable originality who, through a bold, vivid, and personal naturalism, created an imaginative vision of nature that has come to be accepted as a reflection of American pioneering spirit. He used watercolour with the force and authority of oil (<i>Inside the Bar, Tynemouth</i>, Met. Mus., 1883)."

He is now remembered mainly for one painting. <i>The Conjurer</i> (NG, Dublin, 1775), in which he satirized <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds's</span></a> practice of borrowing poses from the Old Masters. The picture was accepted at the RA, but was withdrawn after Angelica <a href=""entry://Kauffmann, Angelica""><span class=""links"">Kauffmann </span></a> (whose name had been linked romantically with Reynolds's) objected that a nude figure in the background was meant to represent her. (Hone painted out the nude figures, but they can be seen in his sketch for the picture in the Tate Gallery.) In protest at the removal of his painting Hone exhibited it in a one-man show in St Martin's Lane, the first of its kind recorded in Britain. Hone's sons, <i>Horace</i> (1754&ndash;1825) and <i>Camillus</i> (1759&ndash;1836), were also painters, as was a brother, <i>Samuel</i> (born 1726). Camillus was the subject of some of his father's best portraits. <br class=""nLine"" /><i>Evie Hone </i> (1894&ndash;1955), a descendant of Nathaniel, was one of the outstanding stained-glass designers of the 20th cent.

"Honthorst, Gerrit van","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Honthorst, Gerrit van</b><div class=""content""><i>(1590&ndash;1656).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter of biblical, mythological, and <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes, and of portraits. In Utrecht, his birthplace, Honthorst was a pupil of <a href=""entry://Bloemaert, Abraham""><span class=""links"">Bloemaert </span></a>, but his style was formed by a long stay in Italy (<i>c.</i>1610&ndash;20) and upon his return to the Netherlands he became, along with <a href=""entry://Baburen, Dirck van""><span class=""links"">Baburen </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Terbrugghen, Hendrick""><span class=""links"">Terbrugghen </span></a>, one of the leading Dutch followers of <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio </span></a>. The candlelight effects he favoured in his early pictures (<i>Christ before the High Priest</i>, NG, London) earned him the nickname ‘Gherardo delle Notti’ (Gerard of the Night Scenes). In the late 1620s Honthorst abandoned his Caravaggesque style for a lighter manner in which he achieved international success (rare for a Dutch artist) as a court portraitist. He was employed by the Elector of Brandenburg and by King Christian IV of Denmark, and in 1628 Charles I called him to England, probably on trial as a court painter (his portrait of Charles is in the NPG, London). From 1637 to 1652 he was court painter at The Hague."
"Hooch, Pieter de","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hooch, Pieter de</b><div class=""content""><i>(1629&ndash;84).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> painter. He was born in Rotterdam, studied in Haarlem (as a pupil of <a href=""entry://Berchem, Nicolaes""><span class=""links"">Berchem </span></a>), and spent the last two decades of his life in Amsterdam, but he is particularly associated with Delft. His period of residence there was fairly brief (<i>c.</i>1655&ndash;<i>c.</i>1661), but during this time he painted the pictures on which his reputation depends&mdash;a small number of tranquil masterpieces that perfectly evoke the well-being of his peaceful and prosperous country. Typical subjects include a sunny yard (<i>The Courtyard of a House in Delft</i>, NG, London, 1658) or light streaming into the interior of a corner of a burgher's house (<i>The Pantry</i>, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, <i>c.</i>1658). There is a kinship of spirit with his great Delft contemporary, <a href=""entry://Vermeer, Jan""><span class=""links"">Vermeer </span></a>, and de Hooch sometimes approaches him in delicate observation of light and lucidity of composition, although not in beauty of brushwork. After de Hooch moved to Amsterdam in the early 1660s, however, the quality of his paintings was less remarkable than their quantity. Instead of the simple brick and plaster backgrounds of his earlier groups he chose sumptuous marble interiors, and towards the end these backgrounds acquired something of the harsh quality of a painted drop-scene. He died in a madhouse."

He was born in Amsterdam to a wealthy banking family, and travelled extensively before and after settling in England in 1795. In 1801 he was described as being reputedly ‘the richest, but undoubtedly far from the most agreeable man in Europe’, and he used his great wealth to spend lavishly on art for his London mansion in Duchess Street (to which the public could buy admission tickets) and his country seat at Deepdene, Surrey.

"Hopper, Edward","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hopper, Edward</b><div class=""content""><i>(1882&ndash;1967).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter and etcher. He spent almost all his career in New York, but he travelled extensively in the USA, making long journeys by car. His main training was at the New York School of Art, where Robert <a href=""entry://Henri, Robert""><span class=""links"">Henri </span></a> was one of his teachers. Between 1906 and 1910 he made three trips to Europe (mainly Paris), but these had little influence on his style. In 1913 he exhibited (and sold) a picture at the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a>, but from then until 1923 he earned his living entirely by commercial illustration. After turning to painting full-time in 1924, however, he enjoyed a fairly rapid rise to recognition as the outstanding exponent of <a href=""entry://American Scene painting""><span class=""links"">American Scene Painting</span></a> (he was given a retrospective exhibition by the <a href=""entry://Museum of Modern Art""><span class=""links"">Museum of Modern Art</span></a> in 1933 and this set the seal on his reputation). Hopper's distinctive style was formed by the mid-1920s and thereafter changed little. The central theme of his work is the loneliness of city life, generally expressed through one or two figures in a spare setting&mdash;his best-known work, <i>Nighthawks</i> (Art Institute of Chicago, 1942), has an unusually large ‘cast’ with four. Typical settings are motel rooms, filling stations, cafeterias, and almost deserted offices at night. He was the first artist to seize on this specifically American visual world and make it definitively his own. However, although his work is rooted in a particular period and place, it also has a peculiarly timeless feel and deals in unchanging realities about the human condition. He never makes feelings explicit or tries to tell a story; rather he suggests weariness, frustration, and troubled isolation with a poignancy that rises above the specific. Hopper himself enjoyed solitude (although he was happily married to another ex-student of Henri) and he disliked talking about his work. When he did, he discussed it mainly in terms of technical problems. Of <i>Nighthawks</i> he said: ‘I didn't see it as particularly lonely
Unconsciously, probably, I was painting the loneliness of a big city.’ Deliberately so or not, in his still, reserved, and blandly handled paintings he exerts a powerful psychological impact that makes him one of the great painters of modern life. Hopper worked in watercolour as well as oil and also made etchings, beginning in 1915&mdash;in fact his individual vision emerged in this medium before it did in painting. His best-known print is <i>Evening Wind</i> (1921), establishing a theme that would later often recur in his paintings&mdash;the female nude in a city interior. He virtually abandoned printmaking in 1923, but in spite of his short career in the medium he has been described as ‘undoubtedly the greatest American etcher of this century’ (Frances Carey and Antony Griffiths, <i>American Prints</i> 1879&ndash;1979, 1980)."

He was trained as a chorister in the Chapel Royal, and later received an allowance from George III to study at the Royal Academy Schools. The royal favour he was shown led to rumours that he was the king's illegitimate son, but these were never proved. In 1789 he was appointed Portrait Painter to the Prince of Wales (later George IV) and from this time was associated with ‘the Prince of Wales's Set’.

He was in Rome 1764&ndash;8 and there produced two works of sculpture which assured his reputation: an <a href=""entry://écorché figure""><i><span class=""links"">écorché</i></span></a> figure (Schlossmuseum, Gotha, 1767), casts of which were widely used in art academies, and <i>St Bruno</i> (Sta Maria degli Angeli, 1767), executed in a direct and unpretentious classical style. After returning to Paris in 1769, he was successful in the popular mythological idiom, becoming a member of the Academy in 1777 with his <i>Morpheus</i> (Louvre, Paris). His greatest strength, however, was in his portrait busts. By the middle 1780s he was acknowledged as the leading portrait sculptor of Europe and his fame spread also to America. In 1785 the State of Virginia commissioned from him a statue of George Washington, and he visited America in order to study his model face to face before doing his famous marble statue of Washington as the modern Cincinnatus, called from the ploughshare to wield the reins of government (Virginia State Capitol, Richmond, 1788, bronze copy outside the NG, London). In his portraiture Houdon had a knack of catching characteristic tricks of gesture and expression and a brilliant gift of depicting the marks of individuality, rather than a profound penetration into human character. His portraits of Voltaire (e.g. in the Comédie-Française, Paris, and V&amp;A, London) are among his most celebrated works. During the French Revolution Houdon narrowly escaped imprisonment and although he found favour again under Napoleon (a terracotta bust of the Emperor is in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon, 1806), he produced little of importance after the turn of the century. He became senile in 1823."

"Hundertwasser, Fitz","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hundertwasser, Fitz</b>
<i>(Friedrich Stowasser )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1928&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Austrian painter and graphic artist. He took the name Hundertwasser in 1949, translating the syllable ‘sto’ (which means ‘hundred’ in Czech) by the German ‘hundert’. From about 1969 he signed his work ‘Friedensreich Hundertwasser’, symbolizing by the word ‘Friedensreich’ (Kingdom of Peace) his boast that by his painting he would introduce the observer into a new life of peace and happiness. He often added ‘Regenstag’ (Rainy Day) to the name&mdash;making it in full ‘Friedensreich Hundertwasser Regenstag’&mdash;on the ground that he felt happy on rainy days because colours then began to sparkle and glow. This exaggerated concern with the name is a symptom of the braggadocio, conceit, and talent for self-advertisement that are apparent in his work as well as his life. Standing outside most contemporary artistic movements, though borrowing from many, he works mainly on a small scale, often in watercolour. His work has sometimes been compared with that of <a href=""entry://Klee, Paul""><span class=""links"">Klee</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Klimt, Gustav""><span class=""links"">Klimt </span></a>, but although it is in the same tradition of figurative fantasy it lacks their elegance and wit.

"Hunt, William Holman","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hunt, William Holman</b><div class=""content""><i>(1827&ndash;1910).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, co-founder of the <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</span></a> in 1848. He was the only member of the Brotherhood who throughout his entire career remained faithful to Pre-Raphaelite aims, which he summarized as finding serious and genuine ideas to express, direct study from nature in disregard of all arbitrary rules, and envisaging events as they must have happened rather than in accordance with the rules of design. Hunt's work was remarkable for its minute precision, its accmulation of incident, and its didactic emphasis on moral or social symbolism, and from 1854 he made several journeys to Egypt and Palestine to paint biblical scenes with accurate local detail. <i>The Scapegoat</i> (Lady Lever Art Gal., Port Sunlight, 1854&ndash;5), showing the outcast animal on the shore of the Dead Sea, is one of the most famous paintings that resulted from his fanatical devotion to authenticity. His colour tends to be painfully harsh and his sentiment mawkish, but he created some of the most enduring images of the Victorian age, among them <i>The Hireling Shepherd</i> (Manchester City Art Gallery, 1851), <i>The Awakening Conscience</i> (Tate Gallery, London, 1853), and <i>The Light of the World</i> (Keble College, Oxford, 1851&ndash;3; a smaller version is in Manchester City Art Gallery, and a larger replica, begun in 1899, is in St Paul's Cathedral, London). Like the other Pre-Raphaelites, Hunt suffered critical attacks early in his career, but the moral earnestness of his work later made it immensely popular with the Victorian public and he made a fortune from the sale of engravings of his paintings. In old age he became a patriarchal figure in the art world and he was awarded the Order of Merit in 1905. In the same year he published his autobiographical <i>Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</i>, which is the basic source book of the movement, though somewhat biased."

"ideal","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>ideal</b>.<div class=""content"">A conception of something that is perfect, referring in the visual arts to works that attempt to reproduce the best of nature, but also to improve on it, eliminating the inevitable flaws of particular examples. The notion derives ultimately from Plato's Theory of Ideas, according to which all perceptible objects are imperfect copies approximating to unchanging and imperceptible Ideas or Forms. This idea reappeared with the revival of Platonism in the Italian <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, and throughout much of subsequent European art the model of ideal beauty was supplied by classical statuary. Its most influential formation was in a lecture by <a href=""entry://Bellori, Giovanni Pietro""><span class=""links"">Bellori </span></a> delivered before the <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">Academy</span></a> of St Luke in Rome in 1664, and published as a Preface to his <i>Lives</i> in 1672. To Bellori, the contemporary artist who best exemplified the doctrine was <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>, whose example became binding for the French Academy of the 17th cent. The doctrine provided the philosophical justification for the <a href=""entry://Grand Manner""><span class=""links"">Grand Manner</span></a>, and was the basis of criticism of anti-idealistic artists such as <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt</span></a>, who were thought to have broken the ‘rules’ of good art. Although the doctrine has been responsible for much arid art, it has also been an inspiration to such great artists as <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>, who said, ‘To paint a beautiful woman I must see several, and I have also recourse to a certain ideal in my mind’, and Guido <a href=""entry://Reni, Guido""><span class=""links"">Reni </span></a>, who said ‘The beautiful and pure <i>idea</i> must be in the mind, and then it is no matter what the model is.’"

<b>illuminated manuscripts</b>.<div class=""content"">Books written by hand, decorated with paintings and ornaments of different kinds.

<b>Impressionism</b>.<div class=""content"">A movement in painting originating in the 1860s in France and regarded as one of the most momentous phenomena in 19th-cent. art. The Impressionists were not a formal group with clearly defined principles and aims; rather they were a loose association of artists linked by some community of outlook who banded together for the purpose of exhibiting. The central figures involved in the movement were (in alphabetical order) <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Degas, Edgar""><span class=""links"">Degas </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Monet, Claude""><span class=""links"">Monet </span></a>, Camille <a href=""entry://Pissarro, Camille""><span class=""links"">Pissarro </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Sisley, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Sisley </span></a>. Monet, Renoir, and Sisley met as students, and the others came into contact with them through the artistic café society of Paris. There were friendly ties of varied degrees of intimacy linking each of them to most of the others, but Degas and even more Manet were set somewhat apart because they came from a higher stratum of society than the others, and the artists' commitment to Impressionism varied considerably (Manet was much respected as a senior figure, but he never exhibited with the group). The Impressionists reacted against academic teaching and conventions and also were in revolt from the basic principle of <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a> that art should convey intense personal emotion. They repudiated imaginative art, including historical subjects, and were interested rather in the objective recording of contemporary life, trying to capture an ‘impression’ of what the eye sees at one particular moment. Landscape is considered the theme most typical of the Impressionists, but they painted many other subjects. Degas, for example, had little interest in landscape and made subjects such as horse races, dancers, and laundresses his own, and Renoir is famous for his pictures of pretty women and children. <br class=""nLine"" />The Impressionists' desire to look at the world with a new freshness and immediacy was encouraged by photography and by scientific research into colour and light. In trying to capture the effects of light on varied surfaces, particularly in open-air settings, they transformed painting, using bright colours and sketchy brushwork that seemed bewildering or shocking to traditionalists. The name ‘Impressionism’, in fact, was coined derisively, when it was applied to a picture by Monet, <i>Impression: Sunrise</i> (Musée Marmottan, Paris, 1872), which was shown at the first Impressionist exhibition, held in Paris in 1874. There were seven more Impressionist exhibitions (1876, 1877, 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882, and 1886), and after the final one the group broke up, only Monet continuing to pursue Impressionist ideals rigorously. Although Impressionism was at first greeted with great hostility and many of its practitioners had to endure great financial hardship early in their careers, it began to win critical acceptance in the 1880s (see <a href=""entry://Durand-Ruel, Paul""><span class=""links"">DURAND-RUEL</span></a>) and its influence was enormous&mdash;much of the history of late 19th cent. and early 20th cent. painting is the story of developments from it or reactions against it. The <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionists</span></a>, for example, tried to give the optical principles of Impressionism a scientific basis, and the <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionists</span></a> began a long series of movements that attempted to free colour and line from purely representational functions and return to the emotional and symbolic values that the Impressionists had sacrificed in their concentration on the fleeting and the casual."

"Ingres, Jean-Auguste-Dominique","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ingres, Jean-Auguste-Dominique</b><div class=""content""><i>(1780&ndash;1867).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, born at Montauban, the son of a minor painter and sculptor, <i>Jean-Marie-Joseph Ingres </i> (1755&ndash;1814). After an early academic training in the Toulouse Academy he went to Paris in 1796 and was a fellow student of <a href=""entry://Gros, Antoine-Jean""><span class=""links"">Gros</span></a> in <a href=""entry://David, Jacques-Louis""><span class=""links"">David's </span></a> studio. He won the <a href=""entry://Prix de Rome""><span class=""links"">Prix de Rome</span></a> in 1801, but owing to the state of France's economy he was not awarded the usual stay in Rome until 1807. In the interval he produced his first portraits. These fall into two categories: portraits of himself and his friends, conceived in a <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> spirit (<i>Self-portrait</i>, Musée Condé, Chantilly, 1804), and portraits of well-to-do clients characterized by purity of line and enamel-like colouring (<i>Mlle Rivière</i>, Louvre, Paris, 1805). These early portraits are notable for their calligraphic line and expressive contour, which had a sensuous beauty of its own beyond its function to contain and delineate form. It was a feature that formed the essential basis of Ingres's painting throughout his life. <br class=""nLine"" />During his first years in Rome he continued to execute portraits and began to paint bathers, a theme which was to become one of his favourites (<i>The Valpinçon Bather</i>, Louvre, Paris, 1808). He remained in Rome when his four-year scholarship ended, earning his living principally by pencil portraits of members of the French colony. But he also received more substantial commissions, including two decorative paintings for Napoleon's palace in Rome (<i>Triumph of Romulus over Acron</i>, École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, 1812; and <i>Ossian's Dream</i>, Musée Ingres, 1813). In 1820 he moved from Rome to Florence, where he remained for 4 years, working mainly on his <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphaelesque</span></a>
<i>Vow of Louis XIII</i>, commissioned for the cathedral of Montauban. Ingres's work had often been severely criticized in Paris because of its ‘Gothic’ distortions, and when he accompanied this painting to the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> of 1824 he was surprised to find it acclaimed and himself set up as the leader of the academic opposition to the new Romanticism. (<a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix's</span></a>
<i>Massacre of Chios</i> was shown at the same Salon.) Ingres stayed in Paris for the next ten years and received the official success and honours he had always craved. During this period he devoted much of his time to executing two large works: <i>The Apotheosis of Homer</i>, for a ceiling in the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a> (installed 1827), and <i>The Martyrdom of St Symphorian</i> (Salon, 1834) for the cathedral of Autun. When the latter painting was badly received, however, he accepted the Directorship of the French School in Rome, a post he retained for 7 years. He was a model administrator and teacher, greatly improving the school's facilities, but he produced few major works in this period. In 1841 he returned to France, once again acclaimed as the champion of traditional values. He was heartbroken when his wife died in 1849, but he made a happy second marriage in 1852, and he continued working with great energy into his 80s. One of his acknowledged masterpieces, the extraordinarily sensuous <i>Turkish Bath</i> (Louvre, 1863), dates from the last years of his life. At his death he left a huge bequest of his work (several paintings and more than 4,000 drawings) to his home town of Montauban and they are now in the museum bearing his name there. <br class=""nLine"" />Ingres is a puzzling artist and his career is full of contradictions. Yet more than most artists he was obsessed by a restricted number of themes and returned to the same subject again and again over a long period of years. He was a bourgeois with the limitations of a bourgeois mentality, but as <a href=""entry://Baudelaire, Charles""><span class=""links"">Baudelaire</span></a> remarked, his finest works ‘are the product of a deeply sensuous nature’. The central contradiction of his career is that although he was held up as the guardian of classical rules and precepts, it is his personal obsessions and mannerisms that make him such a great artist. His technique as a painter was academically unimpeachable&mdash;he said paint should be as smooth ‘as the skin of an onion’&mdash;but he was often attacked for the expressive distortions of his draughtsmanship; critics said, for example, that the abnormally long back of <i>La Grande Odalisque</i> (Louvre, 1814) had three extra vertebrae. Unfortunately the influence of Ingres was mainly seen in those shortcomings and weaknesses which have come to be regarded as the hallmark of inferior academic work. He had scores of pupils, but <a href=""entry://Chassériau, Théodore""><span class=""links"">Chassériau </span></a> was the only one to attain distinction. As a great calligraphic genius his true successors are <a href=""entry://Degas, Edgar""><span class=""links"">Degas </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>."

These materials were moulded into dry sticks or blocks, which were then mixed with water for use. Ink brought from China or Japan in such dry form came to be known in the West as ‘Chinese ink’ or ‘Indian ink’. The names are also given to a similar preparation made in Europe."

He was without formal training but developed his style in the course of frequent visits to Europe, being particularly influenced by the <a href=""entry://Barbizon School""><span class=""links"">Barbizon School</span></a>. His work falls into two fairly distinct periods. In the first he attempted to bring greater breadth to American <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> realism, dissolving hard outline into a play of atmosphere and colour, but with something of the ordered beauty of <a href=""entry://Claude Gellée ""><span class=""links"">Claude</span></a> (<i>Peace and Plenty</i>, Met. Mus., New York, 1865). From <i>c.</i>1859, when he went to live in the village of Medfield outside Boston, his style began to change to a more intimate manner of landscape in which he chose deliberately unpicturesque subjects and relied for pictorial appeal on subtle harmonies of colour and broad massing of light and shade. Inness has often been considered to be the outstanding American landscape painter of the 19th cent. His son, <i>George Inness </i>, <i>Jun</i> . (1854&ndash;1926), was also a painter and published an account of his father's career (1917)."

<b>International Gothic</b>.<div class=""content"">Style in painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts that spread widely over western Europe between <i>c.</i>1375 and <i>c.</i>1425. The style was characterized by aristocratic elegance and delicate naturalistic detail and was formed by a blending of elements from Italy and northern Europe, a situation encouraged by the cultural rivalry of major courts and the growing frequency with which leading artists travelled between them. Lombardy, Franco-Flemish Burgundy and Bohemia were among the most important centres of the style, major exponents of which included <a href=""entry://Gentile da Fabriano ""><span class=""links"">Gentile</span></a> da Fabriano, <a href=""entry://Pisanello""><span class=""links"">Pisanello</span></a>, and the <a href=""entry://Limburg ""><span class=""links"">Limburg</span></a> Brothers.

It shows Richard II being presented to the Virgin and Child by John the Baptist, Edward the Confessor, and Edmund, king and martyr (his patron saints), but its purpose and significance are uncertain. It probably dates from late in Richard's reign (heraldic evidence suggests it cannot be earlier than <i>c.</i>1395), but some scholars think it is a posthumous memorial."

He held the first three posts until 1953 and retired from the fourth in 1961. Itten wrote several books on art theory and his work as a painter consisted mainly of geometrical abstractions exemplifying his researches into colour. However, he is best remembered as a teacher, expecially for his Preliminary Course at the Bauhaus, which had a great influence on instruction in other art schools. He emphasized the importance of knowledge of materials, but also encouraged his pupils to develop their imaginations through, for example, automatic writing (see <a href=""entry://automatism""><span class=""links"">AUTOMATISM</span></a>). His mystical ideas were opposed to the technological outlook of <a href=""entry://Gropius, Walter""><span class=""links"">Gropius</span></a> (their quarrels caused Itten's departure from the Bauhaus) and he had a reputation as a crank (he followed an obscure faith called Mazdazhan, shaved his head, and wore a long robe), but he influenced many of his students.

Originally he was an army officer, but in 1906 he resigned his commission and moved to Munich to devote himself completely to art. Munich was to be his home until the outbreak of the First World War, but he travelled a good deal in this period, making several visits to France, for example (he was the first of his Munich associates to have direct contact with advanced French art).

His work there included a series of ‘variations’ on the view from a window&mdash;small, semi-abstract landscapes with a meditative, religious aura. Like Kandinsky and others, Jawlensky believed in a correspondence between colours and musical sounds and he named these pictures <i>Songs without Words</i>. In 1918 he began a series of nearly abstract heads, in which he reduced the features to a few curves and lines. Unlike Kandinsky, however, he always based his forms on nature. From 1921 he lived in Wiesbaden, and in 1924 he joined with Kandinsky, <a href=""entry://Klee, Paul""><span class=""links"">Klee </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Feininger, Lyonel""><span class=""links"">Feininger </span></a> to form the <a href=""entry://Blaue Vier, Die""><span class=""links"">Blaue Vier</span></a>. From 1929 he suffered from arthritis and by 1938 this had forced him to abandon painting completely."

His surname was pronounced, and often spelled, Jarvis. After studying with <a href=""entry://Kneller, Sir Godfrey""><span class=""links"">Kneller </span></a> he spent several years in Italy, particularly Rome, before settling in London in 1709. Jervas had a great reputation and succeeded Kneller as Principal Portrait Painter to King George II in 1723, but his fame depended on his friendship with various literary figures, who trumpeted his praises, rather than on the quality of his work, which does not rise above the level of that of any other of Kneller's pupils or followers. He has perhaps more claim to literary distinction, for he made a well-regarded translation of Cervantes' <i>Don Quixote</i>, posthumously published in 1742. His conceit was enormous: once, having copied a painting by <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a>, he looked from one to the other and said complacently ‘Poor Little Tit!

"John, Augustus","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>John, Augustus</b><div class=""content""><i>(1878&ndash;1961).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter and graphic artist. He studied at the <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School, 1894&ndash;8. In his early days there ‘he appeared a neat, timid, unremarkable personality’ (<i>DNB</i>), but after injuring his head diving into the sea while on holiday in Pembrokeshire in 1897 he became a dramatically changed figure, described by Wyndham <a href=""entry://Lewis, John Frederick""><span class=""links"">Lewis </span></a> as ‘a great man of action into whose hands the fairies had placed a paintbrush instead of a sword’. He grew a beard and became the very image of the unpredictable bohemain artist. His work, too, changed dramatically; previously it had been described by <a href=""entry://Tonks, Henry""><span class=""links"">Tonks </span></a> as ‘methodical’, but it became vigorous and spontaneous, especially in his brilliant drawings&mdash;his draughtsmanship was already legendary by the time he left the Slade. In the first quarter of the 20th cent. John was identified with all that was most independent and rebellious in British art and he became one of the most talked-about figures of the day. In 1911&ndash;14 he led a nomadic life, sometimes living in a caravan and camping with gypsies. As well as romanticized pictures of gypsy life he painted deliciously colourful small-scale landscapes, sometimes working alongside his friend J. D. <a href=""entry://Innes, J. D.""><span class=""links"">Innes </span></a>. During the same period he also painted ambitious figure compositions, with stylized forms that bring him close to French <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolist</span></a> painters (<i>The Way Down to the Sea</i>, Lamont Art Gallery, Exeter, New Hampshire, 1909&ndash;11). In the First World War he was an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a>. It is as a portraitist, however, that John is best remembered. He was taken up by society and painted a host of aristocratic beauties as well as many of the leading literary figures of the day. Increasingly, however, the painterly brilliance of his early work degenerated into flashiness and bombast, and the second half of his long career added little to his achievement, although he remained a colourful, newsworthy figure until the end of his life. He was one of the few British artists who have become familiar to the general public, and his image changed from that of rebel to Grand Old Man (he was awarded the Order of Merit in 1942). He wrote two volumes of autobiography, <i>Chiaroscuro</i>, 1952, and <i>Finishing Touches</i>, posthumously published in 1964. A new edition entitled <i>The Autobiography of Augustus John</i> appeared in 1975."
"John, Gwen","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>John, Gwen</b><div class=""content""><i>(1876&ndash;1939).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter. She was the sister of Augustus <a href=""entry://John, Augustus""><span class=""links"">John </span></a>, but his complete opposite artistically, as she was in personality, living a reclusive life and favouring introspective subjects. After studying at the <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School, 1895&ndash;8, she took lessons in Paris from <a href=""entry://Whistler, James Abbott McNeill""><span class=""links"">Whistler </span></a>, and adopted from him the delicate greyish tonality that characterizes her work. In 1899 she returned to London, but in 1904 she settled permanently in France, living first in Paris (earning her living modelling for other artists&mdash;including <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a>, who became her lover), then from 1911 in Meudon, on the outskirts of the city. In 1913 she became a Catholic, and she said ‘My religion and my art, these are my life.’ Most of her paintings depict single figures (typically girls or nuns) in interiors, painted with great sensitivity and an unobtrusive originality. Good examples are her self-portraits in the Tate Gallery and National Portrait Gallery, London. She had only one exhibition devoted to her work during her lifetime (at the New Chenil Galleries, London, in 1936) and at the time of her death was little known. However, her brother's prophecy that one day she would be considered a better artist than him has been fulfilled, for as his star has fallen hers has risen, and since the 1960s she has been the subject of numerous books and exhibitions."

<b>Johns, Jasper</b><div class=""content""><i>(1930&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, sculptor, and printmaker. His career has been closely associated with that of his friend Robert <a href=""entry://Rauschenberg, Robert""><span class=""links"">Rauschenberg </span></a>, and they are considered to have been largely responsible for the move away from <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a> to the types of <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Minimal art""><span class=""links"">Minimal art</span></a> that succeeded it. In the early 1950s he worked as a commercial artist in New York, doing display work for shop windows. He began to emerge on the art scene in 1955 and had his first one-man show at Leo <a href=""entry://Castelli, Leo""><span class=""links"">Castelli's </span></a> gallery in New York in 1958. This was an enormous success, and since then he has become one of the most famous (and wealthy) living artists. Much of his work has been done in the form of series of paintings presenting commonplace two-dimensional objects&mdash;for example <i>Flags, Targets</i>, and <i>Numbers</i>&mdash;and his sculptures have most characteristically been of equally banal subjects such as beer-cans or brushes in a coffee tin. Such works&mdash;at one and the same time laboriously realistic and patently artificial&mdash;are seen by his admirers as brilliant explorations of the relationship between art and reality; to others, they are as uninteresting as the objects depicted."

Although he has worked primarily as a painter, printmaker, and designer, he is best known to the public for a distinctive type of sculpture in which figures of women&mdash;more or less life-size, dressed in fetishistic clothing, and with what Jones calls ‘high definition female parts’&mdash;double as pieces of furniture; for example, a woman on all fours supporting a sheet of glass on her back becomes a coffee table, and a standing figure with outstretched hands becomes a hatstand. He began making such sculptures in the late 1960s and was still producing them in the 1990s, although in a manner that he calls ‘less aggressive’ and ‘easier to take’ (they have come in for a good deal of criticism for alleged demeaning of women as sex objects; an article in the feminist journal <i>Spare Rib</i> in 1973 suggested that they expressed a castration complex). His work as a designer has included sets and costumes for the erotic review <i>Oh! Calcutta!</i> (1969)."
"Jones, David","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Jones, David</b><div class=""content""><i>(1895&ndash;1974).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter, engraver, and writer. A convert to Roman Catholicism in 1921, he met Eric <a href=""entry://Gill, Eric""><span class=""links"">Gill </span></a> in 1922 and under his influence achieved a sense of purpose (his studies at the Camberwell School of Art, 1909&ndash;15, had left him, as he said, ‘completely muddle-headed as to the function of art in general’). Gill not only introduced him to the craft of engraving on wood, but also guided him to a conception of art that rejected the current concern with formal properties in favour of an art that aspired to reveal universal and symbolic truths behind the appearance of things. He worked mainly in pencil and watercolour, his subjects including landscape, portraits, still life, animals, and imaginative themes; Arthurian legend was one of his main inspirations. As a writer he is best known for <i>In Parenthesis</i> (1937), a long work of mixed poetry and prose on the subject of the First World War (in which he had fought). T. S. Eliot declared this to be a work of genius and it was awarded the Hawthornden Prize. After the Second World War Jones retired to Harrow and devoted himself mainly to calligraphic inscriptions in the Welsh language (he was of Welsh extraction). His work is well represented in the Tate Gallery."
"Jones, Inigo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Jones, Inigo</b><div class=""content""><i>(1573&ndash;1652).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English architect, stage designer, draughtsman, and painter. Jones was one of the greatest of English architects and certainly the most influential, introducing a pure classical style based on the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio to a country where <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> influence had previously been fairly superficial. It was not until he was in his 40s, however, that he showed his genius as an architect, and the first known mention of him as an artist is as a ‘picture maker’ in 1603. No paintings certainly by him are known, but his drawings survive in large numbers (the finest collection is at Chatsworth). They are mainly costume and scenery designs for the court masques, on which he worked from 1605 to 1640, and in which he introduced movable scenery and the proscenium arch into England. Inigo's lively and fluent style as a draughtsman reflects his two visits to Italy (<i>c.</i>1600 and 1613&ndash;14), the second of them accompanying the great collector the Earl of <a href=""entry://Arundel, Thomas Howard, 2nd Earl of""><span class=""links"">Arundel</span></a>. He advised Arundel on the purchase of Italian antiques while developing his own knowledge of Italian and <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> architecture, and his knowledge as well as his skills gave him immense prestige in England at the courts of James I and Charles I. His principal collaborator in the masques was the formidable Ben Jonson, with whom he had a running feud about the rival claims of words and spectacle. Few of Jones's buildings survive in anything like their original state. The most important are the Queen's House at Greenwich (1616&ndash;35) and the Banqueting House in Whitehall (1619&ndash;22), with its painted ceiling by <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>."

He was in Italy 1776&ndash;83, and although he painted some ambitious <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> landscapes, he is now best known for his remarkably fresh and unaffected oil sketches done in and around Naples and Rome (good examples are in the National Museum of Wales at Cardiff).

"Jongkind, Johan Barthold","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Jongkind, Johan Barthold</b><div class=""content""><i>(1819&ndash;91).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch landscape painter and etcher who had close affinities with the French <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>. Although he was better appreciated during his lifetime than van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a>, in some ways his career is similar to that of his more famous countryman. Both artists made a greater impression abroad than in their own country; both failed to adjust to the society of their time; both were troubled by serious psychological problems; and sensational aspects of their lives&mdash;in Jongkind's case it was alcoholism&mdash;have interfered with a balanced appraisal of their achievement. Jongkind studied in The Hague with <a href=""entry://Schelfhout, Andreas""><span class=""links"">Schelfhout</span></a>.

<b>Joos van Cleve </b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1490&ndash;1540).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Netherlandish painter, born presumably at Cleves in the lower Rhine region and active mainly in Antwerp, where he became a master painter in 1511. He was dean of the painters' guild in 1515 and 1525 and seems to have been one of the most productive Antwerp painters of his time, but his career is ill-defined. There is a flavour of <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a> in some of his works, and he may have visited Italy. Almost certainly he worked in France and there are several portraits of Francis I and his wife attributed to him, as is a portrait of Henry VIII of England (Royal Coll.). According to van <a href=""entry://Mander, Karel van""><span class=""links"">Mander </span></a> he collaborated with Joachim <a href=""entry://Patenier ""><span class=""links"">Patenier </span></a>: a <i>Rest on the Flight into Egypt</i> (Musées Royaux, Brussels) is possibly a joint work. Joos's son, <i>Cornelis van Cleve </i> (1520&ndash;67), was also a painter. He was known as ‘Sotte Cleve’ (Mad Cleve) after becoming insane in 1554&ndash;a result of failing to win the post of Court Painter to Philip II of Spain."

<b>Joos van Wassenhove </b><div class=""content""><i>(active <span class=""italic"">c.</i>1460&ndash;80).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Netherlandish painter, part of whose career was spent in Italy, where he was known as Giusto da Guanto (Justus of Ghent). He became a member of the Antwerp Guild in 1460, but by 1464 had moved to Ghent, where he was a friend of Hugo van der <a href=""entry://Goes, Hugo van der""><span class=""links"">Goes </span></a>. At some time after 1468 he went to Rome, and by 1472 had settled in Urbino, where he worked for Duke Federico da <a href=""entry://Montefeltro""><span class=""links"">Montefeltro </span></a>. Joos's only documented work is <i>The Communion of the Apostles</i> (also known as <i>The Institution of the Eucharist</i>, 1472&ndash;4), which is still at Urbino, in the Galleria Nazionale. Like Hugo's Portinari Altarpiece, it was an important work in spreading knowledge of the Netherlandish oil technique in Italy. Of the other works attributed to Joos, the most important are a series of twenty-eight <i>Famous Men</i> (Galleria Nazionale, Urbino, and Louvre, Paris), commissioned for the Ducal Palace. Their authorship is controversial, and they may have been a work of collaboration between Joos and the Spanish painter Pedro <a href=""entry://Berruguete ""><span class=""links"">Berruguete </span></a>."
"Jordaens, Jacob","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Jordaens, Jacob</b><div class=""content""><i>(1593&ndash;1678).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish painter.

Although Jordaens often assisted <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>, he had a flourishing studio of his own by the 1620s, and after Rubens's death in 1640 he was the leading figure painter in Flanders. His style was heavily indebted to Rubens, but was much more earthbound, using thick <a href=""entry://impasto""><span class=""links"">impasto</span></a>, strong contrasts of light and shade, and colouring that is often rather lurid. His physical types, too, are coarser than Rubens's and his name is particularly associated with large canvases of hearty rollicking peasants. Two of his favourite subjects, which he depicted several times, are <i>The Satyr and the Peasant</i>, based on one of Aesop's fables, and <i>The King Drinks</i>, which depicts a boisterous group enjoying an abundant Twelfth Night feast. Jordaens's prolific output, however, included many other subjects, including religious works and portraits, and he also etched and made designs for tapestries. He rarely left his native Antwerp, but commissions came from all over Europe, the most important being <i>The Triumph of Frederick Hendrik</i> (1651&ndash;2), an enormous composition painted for the Huis ten Bosch, the royal villa near The Hague. In about 1655 Jordaens became a Calvinist; he continued to paint pictures for Catholic churches, but the work of the last two decades of his life is more subdued."

He was the most distinguished of the group of artists who collaborated with <a href=""entry://La Fosse, Charles de""><span class=""links"">La Fosse </span></a> in the decorations at Trianon and Les Invalides, but he is now best remembered as the leading French religious painter of his generation, carrying out numerous major commissions for churches in Paris and elsewhere. His later work was marked both by <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> emotionalism and by a realistic treatment of details foreign to the principles encouraged by the Academy. It is recorded, for example, that before painting his <i>Miraculous Draught of Fishes</i> (Louvre, Paris, <i>c.</i>1706) he studied fishing scenes on the spot at Dieppe."

Initially he worked mainly in wood, but after a successful exhibition at the Green Gallery, New York, in 1963&ndash;4 he began having them industrially manufactured in various metals (or sometimes coloured perspex). In 1970 he began making works for the specific space in which they were to be exhibited, and in 1972 he began producing outdoor works. In spite of great financial success, Judd (who was notoriously touchy) disliked the New York ‘art crowd’ and in 1973 moved to Marfa, Texas, where he converted the buildings of an old army base into studios and installation spaces. <i>Donald Judd: Complete Writings</i>, 1959&ndash;75 was published in 1976."

<b>Junk art</b>.<div class=""content"">Art constructed from worthless materials, refuse, rubbish, and urban waste. In so far as Junk art represented a revolt against the traditional doctrine of fine materials and a desire to show that works of art can be constructed from the humblest and most worthless things, it may be plausibly traced back to Kurt <a href=""entry://Schwitters, Kurt""><span class=""links"">Schwitters </span></a> and the <a href=""entry://collage""><span class=""links"">collages</span></a> of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>. However, it is not possible to speak of a Junk movement until the 1950s, particularly with the work of Robert <a href=""entry://Rauschenberg, Robert""><span class=""links"">Rauschenberg </span></a>, who in the mid 1950s began to affix to his canvases rags and tatters of cloth, torn reproductions, and other waste materials (see <a href=""entry://Combine painting""><span class=""links"">COMBINE PAINTING</span></a>). The name ‘Junk art’ was first applied to these by Lawrence <a href=""entry://Alloway, Lawrence""><span class=""links"">Alloway </span></a> and was then extended to sculpture made from scrap metal, broken machine parts, used timber, and so on.

In the case of Rauschenberg and others the use of Junk material was objective and unemotional. In other instances, including the Junk sculpture of California and the work of Burri and Tàpies, a nostalgic emotional suggestion was conveyed by the use of discarded machine parts, rotted beams and rusted metal, torn and dirty textile scraps, and the detritus generally of industrialized urban life."

"Kahlo, Frida","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Kahlo, Frida</b><div class=""content""><i>(1907&ndash;54).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Mexican painter. In 1925, at a time when she was preparing to enter medical school, she suffered appalling injuries in a traffic accident, leaving her a permanent semi-invalid, often in severe pain. During her convalescence she began painting portraits of herself and others. She remained her own favourite model and her art was usually directly autobiographical. In 1928 she married Mexico's most famous artist, Diego <a href=""entry://Rivera, Diego""><span class=""links"">Rivera </span></a>, who was twice her age and twice her size. Their relationship was often strained, but it lasted to her death, through various separations, divorce and remarriage (1939&ndash;41), and infidelities on both sides (one of her lovers was Leon Trotsky, who was assassinated while living in her house in Coyoacán, Mexico City, in 1940). Kahlo was mainly self-taught as a painter. She was influenced by Rivera, but more by Mexican folk art, and her work has a colourful, almost <a href=""entry://naïve art""><span class=""links"">naïve</span></a> vigour, tinged with <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealist</span></a> fantasy. Her paintings of her own physical and psychic pain are narcissistic and nightmarish, but also&mdash;like her personality&mdash;fiery and flamboyant. They were widely shown in Mexico and in 1939 she had successful exhibitions in New York and Paris, but during her lifetime she was overshadowed by her husband. Since her death, however, her fame has grown and she has become something of a feminist heroine, admired for her refusal to let great physical suffering crush her spirit or interfere with her art and her left-wing political activities. Her house in Coyoacán was opened as a museum dedicated to her in 1958."

<b>Kandinsky, Wassily</b><div class=""content""><i>(1866&ndash;1944).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Russian-born painter and writer on art, one of the most important pioneers of <a href=""entry://abstract art""><span class=""links"">abstract art</span></a>. He abandoned a promising university career teaching law, partly under the impact of an exhibition in Moscow of French <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>, at which one of <a href=""entry://Monet, Claude""><span class=""links"">Monet's</span></a>
<i>Haystack</i> pictures made a particularly lasting impression upon him, and in 1896 went to Munich to study painting. In 1901 he was one of the founders of the avant-garde exhibiting society <a href=""entry://Phalanx""><span class=""links"">Phalanx</span></a>, the main forum for Jugendstil (<a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a>) in Germany, and in 1902 he joined the Berlin <a href=""entry://Sezession""><span class=""links"">Sezession</span></a>. Between 1903 and 1908 he travelled widely in western Europe and Africa. His pictures at the turn of the century combined features of Art Nouveau with reminiscences of Russian folk art, to which he added a <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauve</span></a>-like intensity of colour. In 1908 he returned to Munich and in 1909 was one of the founders of the <a href=""entry://Neue Künstlervereinigung München""><span class=""links"">Neue Künstlervereinigung</span></a> there. At about this time he began to eliminate the representational element from his work, until, in a series of <i>Compositions, Improvisations</i>, and <i>Impressions</i>, done between 1910 and 1913, he arrived at pure abstraction. (The best collection of his work from this period is in the Lenbachhaus in Munich.) Kandinsky said that his understanding of the power of nonrepresentational art derived from a night when he went into his studio in Munich and failed to recognize one of his own paintings that was lying the wrong way up, seeing in it a picture ‘of extraordinary beauty glowing with an inner radiance’. (He is often cited as the first person to paint an abstract picture, but other pioneers, such as the American Arthur <a href=""entry://Dove, Arthur""><span class=""links"">Dove </span></a>, were making similar experiments at this time and no artist can claim absolute primacy.) From 1911 Kandinsky was one of the most active figures in the <a href=""entry://Blaue Reiter, Der""><span class=""links"">Blaue Reiter</span></a>, editing with Franz <a href=""entry://Marc, Franz""><span class=""links"">Marc </span></a> the <i>Blaue Reiter</i> almanac. In 1914 he returned to Russia, where he gained several distinguished academic posts. However, being out of sympathy with the new ideas that subordinated fine art to industrial design, he left Russia in 1921 to take up a teaching post in the <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a>, where he remained until it was closed in 1933. In 1927 he became a German citizen. He left Germany for France in 1933 and settled at Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, becoming a French citizen in 1939. Kandinsky was one of the most influential artists of his generation both for his painting and for his writing. His progress towards abstraction proceeded alongside his philosophical views about the nature of art, which were influenced by theosophy and mysticism. He did not completely repudiate representation, but he held that the ‘pure’ artist seeks to express only ‘inner and essential’ feelings and ignores the superficial and fortuitous. His chief works setting forth his theories of abstract pictorial composition are <i>Über das Geistige in der Kunst</i> (Concerning the Spiritual in Art, 1912), <i>Rückblicke</i> (Reminiscences, 1913), and <i>Punkt und Linie zu Fläche</i> (Point, Line and Surface, published in 1926 as a Bauhaus pamphlet)."

<b>Kane, John</b><div class=""content""><i>(1860&ndash;1934).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American <a href=""entry://naïve art""><span class=""links"">naïve</span></a> painter, born in Scotland. He emigrated to the USA in 1879 and moved around a good deal working at various labouring jobs. However, he considered Pittsburgh his home. In 1891 he lost a leg when he was struck by a train, but he became so agile with his artificial limb that few realized he was disabled. He took to drink after his son died soon after birth in 1904 and his wife consequently left him, taking their two daughters with her. Kane then led a wandering life, scraping a living by housepainting and carpentry. His first oil paintings were done <i>c.</i>1910; he did portraits&mdash;an intense <i>Self-Portrait</i> (MOMA, New York, 1929) is his best-known work&mdash;landscapes, interiors, and cityscapes of industrial Pittsburgh, combining meticulous observation with naïve stylization and imaginative reconstruction. He achieved sudden fame at the age of 67 when one of his paintings was accepted for the Carnegie International Exhibition in Pittsburgh in 1927. Kane was the first American naïve painter to achieve such recognition; some people thought his picture was a hoax, but in the remaining seven years of his life he achieved considerable acclaim and became something of a celebrity (in consequence of which he was reunited with his wife). His autobiography <i>Sky Hooks</i> (named after the supports of a housepainter's scaffold) was posthumously published in 1938."

<b>Kent, William</b><div class=""content""><i>(1685&ndash;1748).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English architect, designer, landscape gardener, and painter. He began his career as a painter and studied in Rome, where in about 1717 he painted a ceiling in the church of S. Giuliano dei Fiamminghi (offering to work without payment for the chance to establish his reputation). As a guide and agent for Englishmen on the <a href=""entry://Grand Tour""><span class=""links"">Grand Tour</span></a> he met the architect and patron Lord Burlington, who in 1719 invited him to return with him to London. From then until Kent's death in 1748 the two were inseparable partners. After some rather unsuccessful decorative painting at Burlington House and Kensington Palace in London, Kent began to find himself as an architectural impresario, interior decorator, and garden designer, and he abandoned his first profession. The richness and fantasy of his interior decoration and the imagination displayed in his garden designs are probably his chief claim to fame, and are the perfect complement to the somewhat rigid classicism of Burlington's architecture. As an architect Kent's most important work is Holkham Hall, Norfolk, begun in 1734 for the first Earl of Leicester, whom he had first met in Rome. Although he was a painter of little talent, Kent has the distinction of painting the earliest medieval history subjects in British art&mdash;a series of three pictures for Queen Caroline depicting scenes from the life of Henry V (Royal Coll., <i>c.</i>1730). There is no attempt to re-create the scenes accurately, and in fact there is some doubt whether one of the pictures is intended to represent the Battle of Agincourt (1415) or the Battle of Crécy (1346)."

<b>Keyser, Hendrick de</b><div class=""content""><i>(1565&ndash;1621).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The outstanding Dutch sculptor and one of the leading Dutch architects of his period. Most of his career was spent in Amsterdam, where he was appointed municipal sculptor and architect in 1594. His most important buildings are the Zuiderkerk (South Church, 1606&ndash;14), Holland's first large Protestant Church, and the Westerkerk (West Church, 1620&ndash;38), which broke free from the <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> tradition, looking forward to the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classicism</span></a> of Jacob van <a href=""entry://Campen, Jacob van""><span class=""links"">Campen </span></a>. The splendid towers of these two churches are still among Amsterdam's chief landmarks. As a sculptor, de Keyser excelled particularly as a portraitist in a soberly realistic style (<i>Unknown Man</i>, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 1608), but his best-known work is the tomb of William the Silent (begun 1614) in the Niewe Kerk at Delft. <i>Thomas de Keyser </i> (1596/7&ndash;1667), Hendrick's son and pupil, was municipal architect to the City of Amsterdam from 1662 until his death (he added the cupola to van Campen's Town Hall), but he is better known as a portrait painter. He was, indeed, Amsterdam's leading portraitist before being overtaken in popularity by <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a> in the 1630s. His life-size portraits look stiff compared with Rembrandt's and he is more attractive and original on a small scale. <i>Constantin Huygens and His Clerk</i> (NG, London, 1627) is an excellent example of one of his small portraits of full-length figures in an interior, forerunners of the <a href=""entry://conversation piece""><span class=""links"">conversation pieces</span></a>. His small equestrian portraits were also a new type (<i>Pieter Schout</i>, Rijksmuseum, 1660). Two other sons of Hendrick, <i>Pieter</i> (1595&ndash;1676) and <i>Willem</i> (1603-after 1678), were sculptors.

"Kinetic art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Kinetic art</b>.<div class=""content"">Term describing art incorporating real or apparent movement (from the Greek <i>kinesis</i>, ‘movement’).

More usually, however, it is applied to sculptures such as <a href=""entry://Calder, Alexander""><span class=""links"">Calder's </span></a> mobiles that are moved either by air currents or by some artificial means&mdash;usually electronic or magnetic.

However, for many years Calder was the only leading figure who was associated specifically with moving sculpture (and many people regarded him as eccentric), and it was not until the 1950s that the phrase ‘Kinetic art’ became a recognized part of critical vocabulary; the exhibition ‘Le Mouvement’ at the Denise René Gallery, Paris, in 1955 was a key event in establishing it as a distinct genre.

He was the first of the group to discover an enthusiasm for Polynesian and other <a href=""entry://primitive""><span class=""links"">primitive</span></a> art, but this had less apparent effect on his own painting or sculpture than on the work of other members of the Brücke. In painting he was first influenced by the Post-Impressionists and particularly by <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin </span></a> and van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a>. But under the influence chiefly of <a href=""entry://Munch, Edvard""><span class=""links"">Munch </span></a> he developed a style similar to that of the <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauves</span></a>, with simplified drawing and boldly contrasting colours. By 1907&ndash;10 he had matured a manner of painting superficially similar to that achieved by <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a> and his colleagues in 1905, but he was more impetuous and direct in his approach to his subjects. He was also more committed to theme than they and attempted to express in paint the emotional atmosphere distilled by the life of the circus and the music-hall, the gaiety and the sadness with its overtones of sexuality in the human detritus of the urban scene. In 1911 he moved to Berlin and during 1912 and 1913 created the series of street scenes which are regarded as the most mature manifestation of German Expressionism. In a style which had become more frenzied, with more ruthless fragmentation of the object, he gave visible expression to the pace, the morbidity, the glare, and the exhibitionist eroticism of megapolitan man (<i>Street, Berlin</i>, MOMA, New York, 1913). Kirchner had always been highly strung and he was invalided out of the army in the First World War after suffering a physical and nervous breakdown. In 1917 he was sent to convalesce in Switzerland and stayed there for the rest of his life. Living in solitude among the Swiss mountains near Davos, Kirchner began to paint again, mainly monumental mountain landscapes and scenes from the life of mountain peasants. In the new environment his work gained in serenity what it lost in vigour. From 1928 his style underwent another change. It became more abstract as he painted less directly from nature. Kirchner's work was declared <a href=""entry://degenerate art""><span class=""links"">degenerate</span></a> by the Nazis in 1937, adding to his already acute depression at the political events in Germany, and in the following year he killed himself. Thoughout his life printmaking was as important as painting to him and he ranks as one of the 20th cent.'s greatest masters in this field. He produced a large body of work in wordcut, etching, and lithograph, but each print usually exists in only a few impressions as he liked to print his work himself. In addition to paintings and prints, he made coloured wooden sculpture."

The mood did not last and from the late 1950s the painters of the Kitchen Sink School developed in different ways, Bratby, for example, emphasizing his <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionist</span></a> handling and Smith eventually turning to abstraction.

<b>Klee, Paul</b><div class=""content""><i>(1879&ndash;1940).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German-Swiss painter, graphic artist, and writer on art, one of the most individual figures in 20th-cent. art. He trained at the Academy of Fine Art, Munich, 1898&ndash;1901, and after travelling in Italy, 1901&ndash;2, and visiting Paris in 1905 with Louis <a href=""entry://Moilliet, Louis""><span class=""links"">Moilliet </span></a> he settled in Munich in 1906, in the same year marrying the pianist Lily Stumpf (he was himself a talented violinist). In 1911 he met <a href=""entry://Jawlensky, Alexei von""><span class=""links"">Jawlensky </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Kandinsky, Wassily""><span class=""links"">Kandinsky </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Macke, August""><span class=""links"">Macke </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Marc, Franz""><span class=""links"">Marc </span></a>, and in the following year took part in the second Blaue Reiter exhibition. Also in 1912 he visited Paris for the second time; he met <a href=""entry://Delaunay, Robert""><span class=""links"">Delaunay </span></a> and saw <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a> pictures. In 1914 he travelled with Moilliet and August Macke to Tunisia, a journey which awakened him to a new sense of colour (most of his work before this date had been in black and white). During the war he served in the Germany army, being engaged for part of the time on painting aeroplane wings. In 1919 an exhibition in Munich of 362 of his works made Klee internationally famous. Invited by <a href=""entry://Gropius, Walter""><span class=""links"">Gropius</span></a> to teach at the <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a>, he moved to Weimar in 1921 and followed the Bauhaus to Dessau in 1926. In 1931 he left the Bauhaus to take up an appointment at the Düsseldorf Academy, but he was forced to abandon this in 1933 by the Nazi administration and left Germany for Berne. His works were included in the notorious exhibition of <a href=""entry://degenerate art""><span class=""links"">Degenerate Art</span></a> in 1937. <br class=""nLine"" />Although Klee was not politically inclined, there is no doubt that during his last years in Berne his mood was one of profound disappointment, perhaps bordering on acute depression. In 1935 he suffered the first symptoms of the illness that caused his death in 1940, a rare debilitating disease called scleroderma. Although he remained productive until the end, the predominance of a darker scale of colour in the paintings of the last seven years, their preoccupation with malign and malevolent forces and themes of corruption, and the appearance of a more bitter form of satire instead of his earlier playfulness all attest to the mental stress under which he lived during these years. Yet his technical and formal mastery remained unaffected and his sense of humour (albeit macabre humour) remained even when he was facing death (<i>Death and Fire</i>, Paul Klee Foundation, Kunstmuseum, Berne, 1940). Klee was one of the most inventive and prolific of the modern masters, his complete output being estimated at some 8,000 works. It is impossible to categorize his work stylistically as he moved freely between figuration and abstraction, absorbing countless influences and transforming these through his unrivalled imaginative gifts. In spite of this variety, his work&mdash;in whatever style&mdash;is almost always easily recognizable as his, revealing a joyous spirit that is hard to parallel in 20th-cent. art. Klee was a brilliant and undogmatic teacher and a stimulating writer on art. Various collections of his writings (including his notebooks and diaries) have been published. The best-known individual work is <i>Pädagogisches Skizzenbuch</i>, published in 1925 as the second of the Bauhaus Books and translated into English as <i>Pedagogical Sketch book</i> (1953)."
"Klein, Yves","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Klein, Yves</b><div class=""content""><i>(1928&ndash;62).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter and experimental artist, one of the most influential figures in European avant-garde art in the post-war period. Both his parents were painters, but he had no formal artistic training, and for much of his short life he earned his living as a judo instructor (in 1952&ndash;3 he lived in Japan, where he obtained the high rank of black belt, fourth dan). In the mid-1950s he began exhibiting ‘mono-chromes’, non-objective paintings in which a canvas was uniformly painted a single colour, usually a distinctive blue that he called ‘International Klein Blue.’ He used this also for other works including sculptured figures, and reliefs of sponges on canvas. In a lecture given at the Sorbonne in 1959, Klein explained his theory of monochrome painting as an attempt to depersonalize colour by ridding it of subjective emotion and thus giving it a metaphysical quality. Klein also made pictures by a variety of unorthodox methods, including the action of rain on a prepared paper (these he called <i>Cosmogonies</i>), the use of a flame-thrower (<i>Peintures de Feu</i>), or imprints of the human body (<i>Anthropométries</i>). In 1958 he created a sensation (and almost a riot) at the Galerie Iris Clert in Paris by an ‘exhibition of emptiness’ &mdash; an empty gallery painted white. It was called <i>Le Vide</i> (The Void). In 1960 he gave his first public exhibition of the <i>Anthropométries</i>: girls smeared with blue pigment were dragged over canvas laid on the floor to the accompaniment of his <i>Symphonie monotone</i>&mdash;a single note sustained for ten minutes and alternating with ten minutes' silence. Critical reception was very mixed. He became a celebrity in Europe, but an exhibition at the Leo <a href=""entry://Castelli, Leo""><span class=""links"">Castelli</span></a> gallery in New York in 1961 was a dismal failure. Klein died young of a heart attack, but he produced a large amount of work and had wide influence, particularly on the development of <a href=""entry://Minimal art""><span class=""links"">Minimal art</span></a>. A great showman, he represents the tendency in 20th-cent. art for the personality of the artist to be of more importance than the things he makes."
"Klimt, Gustav","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Klimt, Gustav</b><div class=""content""><i>(1862&ndash;1918).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Austrian painter and graphic artist. Early in his career he was highly successful as a painter of sumptuous decorative schemes in the grandiose tradition of <a href=""entry://Makart, Hans""><span class=""links"">Makart</span></a>, whose staircase decoration in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna Klimt completed after Makart's death in 1884. In spite of his official academic successes, Klimt was drawn to avant-garde art, and he came under the influence of <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolism</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a>. Discontent with the conservative attitudes of the Viennese Artists' Association led him and a group of friends to resign in 1897 and set up their own organization, the <a href=""entry://Sezession""><span class=""links"">Sezession</span></a>, of which he was elected President. His role as a leader of the avant-garde was confirmed when his allegorical mural paintings for Vienna University on the themes of <i>Jurisprudence, Medicine and Philosophy</i> aroused great hostility, being called nonsensical and pornographic. (Klimt abandoned the commission in 1905 and the paintings were destroyed by fire in 1945.) Although official commissions dried up after this he continued to be much in demand with private patrons, as a portraitist as well as a painter of mythological and allegorical themes. He was highly responsive to female beauty (he was a great womanizer) and in both his portraits and his subject pictures he stresses the allure and mystery of womanhood. Notable examples are the magnificent full-length portrait of Emilie Flöge (his sister-in-law and mistress) in the Historisches Museum der Stadt, Vienna (1902) and <i>Judith I</i> (Österreichische Galerie, Vienna, 1901), one of the archetypal images of the <i>femme fatale</i>. Characteristically, the figures in Klimt's paintings are treated more or less naturalistically but embellished&mdash;in the background or their clothing&mdash;with richly decorative patterns recalling butterfly or peacock wings, creating a highly distinctive style of extraordinarily lush sensuality. He had the opportunity to show his outstanding decorative gifts in a different vein in the major commission of his later years&mdash;the mosaic designs (executed 1909&ndash;11) for the dining-room of the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, a luxury home built at huge expense for the Belgian millionaire Adolphe Stoclet . Klimt's work was particularly influential on <a href=""entry://Kokoschka, Oskar""><span class=""links"">Kokoschka </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Schiele, Egon""><span class=""links"">Schiele </span></a>."

He began as a representational painter, notably of urban landscapes, but turned to abstraction at the end of the 1940s. This change of direction reflected the influence of <a href=""entry://de Kooning, Willem""><span class=""links"">de Kooning </span></a> and was also stimulated by his seeing some of his drawings enlarged by a projector, an experience that made him realize their potential as abstract compositions. Once he had embarked on this new path he very quickly developed an extremely original style, converting the brush-strokes of these drawings into large-scale abstract paintings, using bold black patterns on a white ground reminiscent of oriental calligraphy, but with a highly distinctive rough vigour (he used commercial paints and house-painter's brushes, sometimes up to eight inches wide). Towards the end of his life he sometimes incorporated vivid colours but for the most part remained constant in the black-and-white style perfected in the 1950s. He died of heart disease."

<b>Klinger, Max</b><div class=""content""><i>(1857&ndash;1920).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German painter, sculptor, and graphic artist, born at Leipzig. He studied at Karlsruhe and Berlin, then after brief periods in Brussels, Berlin, and Munich, he spent the years 1883&ndash;6 in Paris, 1886&ndash;8 in Berlin, and 1888&ndash;93 in Rome. After his return to Germany in 1893 he settled in Leipzig, where he was a leading figure of the city's cultural life. His work reveals a powerful imagination and an often morbid interest in themes of love and death. As a sculptor he experimented with <a href=""entry://polychrome""><span class=""links""> polychromy</span></a> in the manner of Greek <a href=""entry://chryselephantine""><span class=""links"">chryselephantine</span></a> statues; the culmination was his statue of Beethoven (Mus. der Bildenden Künste, Leipzig, 1899&ndash;1902) in white and coloured marbles, bronze, alabaster, and ivory. As a painter he is best known for his enormous <i>Judgement of Paris</i> (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, 1885&ndash;7), in which the frame is part of the decorative scheme. It is as a graphic artist, however, that Klinger is now best known and most clearly showed his originality, especially in <i>Adventures of a Glove</i> (three series, begun 1881), a grotesque exploration of fetishism that antedated the publication of Freud's theories. These etchings concern a hapless young man and his involvement with an elusive lost glove that has clearly sexual connotations.

<i>(originally Gottfried Kniller )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1646&ndash;1723).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German-born painter who settled in England and became the leading portraitist there in the late 17th cent. and early 18th cent. He studied in Amsterdam under <a href=""entry://Bol, Ferdinand""><span class=""links"">Bol</span></a>, a pupil of <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt</span></a>, and later in Italy, before moving to England, probably in the mid 1670s. The opportune death of serious rivals (notably <a href=""entry://Lely, Sir Peter""><span class=""links"">Lely</span></a> in 1680) and his own arrogant self-assurance enabled him to establish himself as the dominant court and society painter by the beginning of the reign of James II (1685). He was appointed Principal Painter jointly with <a href=""entry://Riley, John""><span class=""links"">Riley </span></a> on the accession of William III and Mary II in 1689 (becoming sole bearer of the title when Riley died in 1691), was knighted in 1692, and created a baronet in 1715. Kneller established a work-shop-studio in London with a large team of specialized assistants, many of them foreign, organized for the mass production of fashionable portraits. Sitters were required to pose only for a drawing of the face and efficient formulas were worked out for the accessories. He is said sometimes to have accommodated as many as fourteen sitters in a day. The average portrait turned out from his studio in this way was slick and mechanical (and the heavy wigs then fashionable make for great monotony in male portraits), but Kneller was capable of work of much higher quality when he had a sitter to whom he especially responded; outstanding examples are <i>The Chinese Convert</i> (Kensington Palace, London, 1687) and <i>Matthew Prior</i> (Trinity Coll., Cambridge, 1700). Many other examples of his work, including the portraits of the <a href=""entry://kit-cat""><span class=""links"">Kit-Cat</span></a> Club, are in the National Portrait Gallery, London. His style was less elegant and more forthright than Lely's. but the influence of his mass-produced work was stultifying. He was the last foreign-born artist to dominate English painting, but it needed a <a href=""entry://Hogarth, William""><span class=""links"">Hogarth </span></a> and a <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a> to break through the conventions that he had popularized."

His formative years were spent at Vienna amid the intellectual and artistic ferment brought about by the somewhat belated introduction of <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a> to Austria in the early years of the century. He made a name for himself <i>c.</i>1909&ndash;10 by his ‘psychological portraits’ in which the soul of the sitter was thought to be laid bare, and at the same time he produced striking and sometimes shocking lithographs and posters. He was seriously wounded in the First World War and after recovery taught at the Dresden Academy 1919&ndash;24. After this he embarked on a seven-year period of wide travel, and his interest turned from portraits to landscape, including a distinctive kind of ‘portrait’ picture of towns seen from a high viewpoint (<i>Jerusalem</i>, Detroit Institute of Arts, 1929&ndash;30). In 1931 he returned to Vienna, but he was outspokenly opposed to the Nazis, and in 1934 he moved to Prague, then in 1938 to London. From 1953 he lived mainly at Villeneuve in Switzerland. By this time he was internationally famous. In his later years he continued to paint landscapes and portraits, but his most important works of this time are allegorical and mythological paintings, including the <i>Prometheus</i> ceiling (1950) for Count Seilern's house at Princes Gate in London, and the <i>Thermopylae</i>
<a href=""entry://triptych""><span class=""links"">triptych</span></a> (1954) for Hamburg University. Kokoschka remained steadfastly unaffected by modern movements and throughout his long life he pursued his highly personal and imaginative version of pre-1914 Expressionism. His writings include an autobiography (1971) and several plays."
"Kollwitz, Käthe","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Kollwitz, Käthe</b>
<i>(née Schmidt</i>,<div class=""content""><i>1867&ndash;1945).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German graphic artist and sculptor. She came from a family of strong moral and social convictions, and after marrying a doctor, Karl Kollwitz, in 1891 she lived in the poorer quarters of northern Berlin, where she gained first-hand acquaintance of the wretched conditions in which the urban poor lived. The two series of etchings that established her reputation were inspired by a spirit of social protest against the working conditions of the day: <i>Weavers' Revolt</i> (1897&ndash;8) and <i>Peasants' War</i> (1902&ndash;8). After about 1911 she turned from etching to lithography, and after the First World War she turned from representing particular subjects to depicting abstract concepts and great timeless themes such as the Mother and Child. Her work is uncompromisingly serious and often deeply pessimistic in spirit and many of her later drawings and prints were pacifist in intention (her son was killed in the First World World War and her grandson in the Second World War, and her best-known sculpture is the war memorial at Dixmuiden, Flanders, completed in 1932). In line with her left-wing views she visited the Soviet Union in 1927, but was subsequently disillusioned with Soviet Communism. In 1919 she had been made the first woman member of the Prussian Academy in Berlin, but in 1933 she was expelled and suffered harassment from the Nazis, although her work was never declared <a href=""entry://degenerate art""><span class=""links"">degenerate</span></a> and the Nazis sometimes used her images&mdash;without her authorization&mdash;in their propaganda. Soon after this (1934&ndash;5) she made a moving series of eight lithographs on the theme of Death. In its elimination of the accidental, its instinctive grasp of the tragic essential, and its poignant concern for human suffering, her work represents one of the highpoints of German <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> and of 20th-cent. graphic art. Only rarely does she lapse into sentimentality. ‘I should like’, she wrote in 1922, ‘to exert influences in these times when human beings are so perplexed and in need of help.’"

Although he painted various subjects (the poet Vondel praised his portraits and history pictures) his fame now rests on his landscapes.

Like many Dutch painters he had a second occupation; he ran a prosperous shipping firm and evidently painted little in the last decade of his life. His wealth enabled him to collect drawings. He was a prolific draughtsman himself and his sketchy penmanship can be deceptively close to Rembrandt's. <i>Salomon Koninck </i> (1609&ndash;56), the cousin of Philips and Jacob, was also a painter. He was a follower of Rembrandt, imitating him in pictures of hermits, old men, and philosophers in their studies, as well as in religious scenes, and exaggerating the master's early predilection for rich exotic costumes, emphatic gestures, and dramatic contrasts of light and shadow. His work is fairly rare; there are examples in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and the Mauritshuis, The Hague."

A sensitive and highly principled man, he believed that ‘only a sense of social purpose can give an artist strength and multiply his powers
only confidence that the artist's work is needed and appreciated by society can help those exotic plants called pictures to ripen.’ He was one of the outstanding Russian portraitists of his time and also painted deeply serious religious works. The most famous is <i>Christ in the Wilderness</i> (Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, 1872), of which Tolstoy said ‘This is the best Christ I know.’ His style was clear and sharply focused, perhaps reflecting the fact that he had been a photographic re-toucher in his youth.

His work shows a taste for the morbid and fantastic, which he combined with pessimistic social satire and allegory. Often he depicted weird creatures in the kind of murky nightmare world associated with Odilon <a href=""entry://Redon, Odilon""><span class=""links"">Redon </span></a>, whom he met in 1905. Kubin's imagery reflects his disturbed and traumatic life (he had an unhappy childhood, attempted suicide on his mother's grave in 1896, and in 1903 underwent a mental breakdown after the death of his fiancée). He was obsessed with the theme of death (he is said to have liked to watch corpses being recovered from the river) and with the idea of female sexuality as a symbol of death. In 1909 he wrote a Kafkaesque novel <i>Die andere Seite</i> (The Other Side) and he illustrated many books, often ones whose subject-matter matched his own macabre interests, such as the stories of Edgar Allan Poe . From the 1920s his reputation was widespread and he was influential on the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealists</span></a>.

<b>Kupka, František</b>
<i>(Frank, François )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1871&ndash;1957).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Czech painter and graphic artist, active mainly in France, a pioneer of <a href=""entry://abstract art""><span class=""links"">abstract art</span></a>. He studied in Prague and Vienna, and settled in Paris in 1895 or 1896, working first mainly as a satirical draughtsman and book illustrator. From an early age he had been interested in spiritualism and the occult (later in theosophy), and from this grew an interest in the spiritual symbolism of colour. He came to the realization that a picture need not have a ‘subject’ and this laid the roots of his ambition to create paintings whose linear rhythms and colour schemes would produce effects similar to those of music&mdash;in his letters he sometimes signed himself ‘colour symphonist’. From 1909 (inspired by high-speed photography) he experimented&mdash;in a manner similar to that of the <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurists</span></a>&mdash;with ways of showing motion, and by 1912 this had led him to complete abstraction in <i>Amorpha: Fugue in Two Colours</i> (NG, Prague). This created something of a sensation when exhibited at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> d'Automne in 1912. As with <a href=""entry://Delaunay, Robert""><span class=""links"">Delaunay </span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Orphism""><span class=""links"">Orphists</span></a>, to whom his work is closely related, Kupka excelled at this stage in his career in the creation of lyrical colour effects. During the First World War Kupka enlisted in the Czech Legion; he fought on the Somme and he also did a good deal of propaganda work such as designing posters. After the war the Prague Academy appointed him a professor in Paris with the brief of introducing Czech students there to French culture. In 1931 he was one of the founder members of the <a href=""entry://Abstraction-Création""><span class=""links"">Abstraction-Création</span></a> group. His later work was in a more geometrical abstract style. Although Kupka gradually established a considerable reputation, his pioneering role in abstraction was not generally realized before the 1960s."

<b>La Fosse, Charles de</b><div class=""content""><i>(1636&ndash;1716).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, one of the pre-eminent decorative artists of Louis XIV's reign. He was a pupil of <a href=""entry://Lebrun, Charles""><span class=""links"">Lebrun </span></a> and his assistant at Versailles, but his style was more strongly affected by his stay in Italy (1658&ndash;63), where he absorbed the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> manner of Pietro da <a href=""entry://Cortona, Pietro da""><span class=""links"">Cortona </span></a> and was influenced by the colour and warmth of such north Italian artists as <a href=""entry://Correggio ""><span class=""links"">Correggio</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Veronese, Paolo""><span class=""links"">Veronese</span></a>. In the 1680s he turned more to <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a> as a source of inspiration. La Fosse was in London working for the first Duke of Montagu on the decoration of Montagu House (formerly on the site of the British Museum) from 1689 to 1692, in which year he returned to Paris to decorate the church of the Invalides. Originally he was commissioned to paint the entire building, but eventually he did only the dome and pendentives (1702&ndash;4), in a style that heralds something of the lightness and elegance of the ensuing <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a>.

La Tour's handling of light is more subtle and sensitive, however, and he is grander in conception and more sombre in mood. In his mature work he smoothed the forms of his figures until they approached geometric simplicity and achieved a feeling of monumental stillness that is considered to represent the spirit of 17th cent. French <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classicism</span></a> no less than the paintings of Philippe de <a href=""entry://Champaigne, Philippe de""><span class=""links"">Champaigne </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Poussin, Nicolas""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a> in their different fields. Only three of La Tour's paintings are dated&mdash;<i>The Payment of Dues</i> (Museum, Lvov, Ukraine, 1634?); <i>Penitent St Peter</i> (Cleveland Mus. of Art, 1645); <i>The Denial of St Peter</i> (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Nantes, 1650)&mdash;and there is much scholarly debate about his chronology. The works associated with the beginning of his career are daylit scenes of such subjects as peasants and card-sharpers; they are very different in spirit from the calm and majestic religious images of his maturity and have become controversial as regards attribution as well as dating. It has been argued (and hotly disputed) that <i>The Fortune Teller</i> (Met. Mus., New York) is a modern fake, and although the status of most of the other early works as authentic (and high-quality) 17th-cent. French paintings is not denied, their attribution to La Tour (which rests almost entirely on stylistic evidence) has been questioned. Another problem in La Tour studies is that many of his undeniably authentic compositions exist in more than one version, and the studio replicas (as they appear to be) are sometimes of extremely high quality; the versions of <i>St Sebastian Tended by St Irene</i> in the Louvre and the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, for example, are each extraordinarily beautiful. La Tour's son <i>Etienne</i> (1621&ndash;92) worked in his father's studio and may have been responsible for some of the replicas. No independent works certainly by him are known, but <i>The Education of the Virgin</i> (Frick Coll., New York), signed ‘de la Tour’, has been attributed to him."

La Tour portrayed many of the most famous men and women of his day and in 1750 he became portraitist to Louis XV, a position he held until he had a nervous breakdown in 1773."

He was one of the pioneers of modern sculpture. Lachaise settled first in Boston, then in 1912 moved to New York, where he became assistant to Paul <a href=""entry://Manship, Paul""><span class=""links"">Manship </span></a>. Lachaise was a consummate craftsman in stone, metal, and wood (his father was a cabinet maker), but his most characteristic works are in bronze. He did a number of portrait busts remarkable for their psychological insight and he earned a good deal of his living from decorative animal sculptures, but is best known for his female nudes&mdash;monumental and anatomically simplified figures, with voluptuous forms and a sense of fluid rhythmical movement (<i>Standing Woman</i>, Whitney Mus., New York, 1912&ndash;27). Their smooth modelling links them with the work of <a href=""entry://Nadelman, Elie""><span class=""links"">Nadelman</span></a>, who was also at this time helping to lead American sculpture away from the 19th-cent. academic tradition, but Lachaise's figures are more powerful than those of Nadelman and have an overt sexuality that has caused them to be compared with the nudes of <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir </span></a>. The inspiration for the figures Lachaise's embodiment of female beauty was Isabel Dutaud Nagle, a married American woman with whom he fell in love when he was about 20; she was the reason for his move to America and he was eventually able to marry her in 1917."

There he was nicknamed ‘Il Bamboccio’ (which may be translated as ‘Little clumsy one’) on account of his deformed body. His self-portrait in the Pallavicini Gallery in Rome suggests that he bore his handicap bravely and without bitterness, and he was one of the leaders of the <a href=""entry://Schildersbent""><i><span class=""links"">Schildersbent</i></span></a>, a fraternal organization set up by the Netherlandish artists in Rome to protect their interests. Van Laer was the first artist to specialize in scenes of street life in Rome. His work proved popular with collectors and he inspired numerous followers who were known as the ‘Bamboccianti’. They were mainly other Northerners working in Rome, such as the Flemings Jan Miel (1599&ndash;1663) and Michiel <a href=""entry://Sweerts, Michiel""><span class=""links"">Sweerts </span></a>, but also included Italians such as Michelangelo <a href=""entry://Cerquozzi, Michelangelo""><span class=""links"">Cerquozzi </span></a> and Viviano Codazzi (1611&ndash;72). Their pictures are called <i>bambocciate</i> (the singular is <i>bambocciata</i>&mdash;Italian for childishness) or in French <i>bambochades</i>; an English equivalent&mdash;bambocciade&mdash;exists, but it is rarely used. In 1639 van Laer returned to his native Haarlem."

<b>Lairesse, Gerard de</b><div class=""content""><i>(1641&ndash;1711).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter, etcher, and writer on art. Born in Liège, he settled in Amsterdam in 1665, and moved to The Hague in 1684. He was the leading decorative painter in Holland in the second half of the 17th cent., working in an academic <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> style that inspired his over-enthusiastic contemporaries to call him ‘the Dutch <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>’ and ‘the Dutch <a href=""entry://Poussin, Nicolas""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>’. In about 1690, however, he went blind and thereafter devoted himself to art theory. His lectures were collected in two books&mdash;<i>Grondlegginge der Teekenkonst</i> (Foundation of Drawing, 1701) and <i>Het Groot Schilderboek</i> (The Great Painting Book, 1707)&mdash;which were translated and much reprinted during the 18th cent. Lairesse's writings reveal the same academic approach as his paintings and he somewhat naïvely confessed that he had a special preference for <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a> until he learned ‘the infallible rules of art’. Rembrandt had painted a portrait of the young Lairesse in 1665 (Met. Mus., New York), sympathetically showing his disease-disfigured face."

<b>Lam, Wifredo</b><div class=""content""><i>(1902&ndash;82).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Cuban painter. His father was Chinese and his mother of mixed African, Indian, and European origin, and Lam's career was appropriately cosmopolitan. After studying in Havana, he went to Madrid in 1924, then in 1938 moved to Paris, where he became a friend of <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>. He also met André <a href=""entry://Breton, André""><span class=""links"">Breton</span></a>, whose book <i>Fata Morgana</i> he illustrated in 1940, and joined the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealist</span></a> association. In 1941 Lam sailed from Marseilles for Martinique on the same ship as <a href=""entry://Masson, André""><span class=""links"">Masson </span></a>, Breton, and many other intellectuals who were fleeing the Germans. After his return to Cuba in 1942 he came increasingly under the spell of African and Oceanic sculpture, and following visits to Haiti in 1945 and 1946 he also began incorporating images of Voodoo gods and rites in his work. In 1952 he returned to Paris and from the 1960s also spent much of his time at Albisola Mare, near Genoa. In the 1970s he began making bronze sculpture. Lam's work successfully reconciles the artistic vigour of Latin America with the European avant-garde and with the powerful mystique of African and Oceanic tradition, fusing human, animal, and vegetable elements in menacing semi-abstract images. He won numerous prestigious prizes and his work is included in many leading collections."

Above all he is remembered for his portrait of Lytton Strachey (Tate Gallery, London, 1914), in which he ‘has relished emphasizing Strachey's gaunt, ungainly figure, and the air of resigned intellectual superiority with which he surveys the world from that incredible slab-like head’ (<i>DNB</i>); Sir John <a href=""entry://Rothenstein, Sir William""><span class=""links"">Rothenstein </span></a> describes it as ‘one of the best portraits painted in England in this century’.

<b>Land art</b>
<i>(or Earth art or Earthworks)</i>.<div class=""content"">A type of art that uses as its raw materials earth, rocks, soil, and so on. The terms are not usually clearly differentiated, although ‘Earthworks’ generally refers to very large constructions. Earth art emerged as a movement in the late 1960s and has links with several other movements that flourished at that time: <a href=""entry://Minimal art""><span class=""links"">Minimal art</span></a> in that the shapes created are often extremely simple; <a href=""entry://Arte Povera""><i><span class=""links"">Arte Povera</i></span></a> in the use of ‘worthless’ materials; <a href=""entry://happening""><span class=""links"">happenings</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Performance art""><span class=""links"">Performance art</span></a> because the work created was often impermanent; and <a href=""entry://Conceptual art""><span class=""links"">Conceptual art</span></a> because the more ambitious earthwork schemes frequently exist only as projects. There are affinities also with the passion at this time for the study of prehistoric mounds and ley lines&mdash;part of the hippie back-to-nature ethos that expressed a disenchantment with the sophisticated technology of urban culture. The desire to get away from the traditional élitist and moneyorientated gallery world was also very much typical of the time, although large earthworks have in fact necessitated very hefty expenditure, and far from being populist and accessible, such works are usually in remote areas. Moreover, in spite of the desire to sidestep the gallery system, dealers have proved capable of exploiting this kind of art, just like any other, and some land artists at least have made handsome livings from it.<br class=""nLine"" />The artist associated more than any other with large-scale earthworks <i>in situ</i> was Robert <a href=""entry://Smithson, Robert""><span class=""links"">Smithson </span></a>, whose <i>Spiral Jetty</i> (1970) in the Great Salt Lake, Utah, is easily the most reproduced work of this kind. Most of the other leading exponents are&mdash;like Smithson-Americans. They include Alice Aycock (1946&ndash; ), whose work has included underground mazes, and Michael Heizer (1944&ndash; ), whose best-known work is <i>Double Negative</i> (1969&ndash;70) in the Nevada desert&mdash;two massive cuts 30 feet wide and 50 feet deep in an area where he said he found ‘that kind of unraped, peaceful religious space artists have always tried to put in their work’. Some critics, however, consider that earthworks can themselves constitute a type of rape or violation.<br class=""nLine"" /><a href=""entry://Christo""><span class=""links"">Christo </span></a> is sometimes grouped with land artists, although his work really defies classification.

"Landseer, Sir Edwin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Landseer, Sir Edwin</b><div class=""content""><i>(1802/3&ndash;73).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, sculptor, and engraver of animal subjects. He was the son of an engraver and writer, <i>John Landseer </i> (1769&ndash;1852), and was an infant prodigy. His life was one of continuous professional and social success; he was the favourite painter of Queen Victoria (who considered him ‘very good looking although rather short’) and his friends included Dickens and Thackeray. The qualities in his work that delighted the Victorian public, however, have subsequently caused his reputation to plummet, for although he had great skill in depicting animal anatomy, he tended to humanize his subjects to tell a sentimental story or point a moral. His most familiar works in this vein include <i>The Old Shepherd's Chief Mourner</i> (V&amp;A, London, 1837), <i>Dignity and Impudence</i> (Tate, London, 1839), and the celebrated <i>The Monarch of the Glen</i> (Guinness plc, Edinburgh, 1850). Other paintings by Landseer have been attacked for their cruelty (he made many visits to the Scottish Highlands and frequently painted scenes of deer-hunting). Apart from animal subjects, Landseer also painted portraits and historical scenes. As a sculptor he is best known for the lions at the base of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London, unveiled in 1867. Landseer's health broke down in the 1860s, and in his last years he suffered from bouts of madness, aggravated by alcohol. His brother <i>Thomas</i> (1798&ndash;1880) was an engraver, whose prints played a great part in popularizing Edwin's work. Another brother, <i>Charles</i> (1800&ndash;79), bequeathed £10,000 to the Royal Academy to found Landseer scholarships."
"Lane, Sir Hugh","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Lane, Sir Hugh</b><div class=""content""><i>(1875&ndash;1915).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Irish dealer, patron, collector, and administrator. He made his fortune as a picture dealer in London and had no particular interest in Ireland until about 1900, when through the influence of Sarah <a href=""entry://Purser, Sarah""><span class=""links"">Purser </span></a> and the play-wright Lady Gregory (his aunt) he became caught up in the rising tide of nationalism in the arts. He commissioned Jack <a href=""entry://Yeats, Jack Butler""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a> to paint a series of eminent contemporary Irishmen (it was completed by <a href=""entry://Orpen, Sir William""><span class=""links"">Orpen </span></a>, a distant cousin and close friend of Lane's) and he helped to found Dublin's Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, opened in temporary premises in 1906. In addition to giving and lending numerous works to the gallery, he offered to bequeath his finest late 19th- and early 20th-cent. French paintings to Dublin, on condition that a suitable gallery were built to house them. This caused arguments with the Dublin City Authorities, however, and he moved the pictures to the National Gallery in London. Lane was killed when the <i>Lusitania</i> (on which he was returning from business in the USA) was torpedoed by a German submarine. A codicil to his will expressed his intention of returning the French pictures to Dublin, but it was unwitnessed, creating a long-term legal dispute about their ownership. In 1959 an agreement was eventually reached whereby the paintings were divided into groups to be shown alternately in Dublin and London. This agreement was renewed in 1980. The Municipal Gallery of Modern Art was given a permanent home in Dublin in 1933, and in 1979 it was renamed the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art."
"Lanfranco, Giovanni","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Lanfranco, Giovanni</b><div class=""content""><i>(1582&ndash;1647).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, who with <a href=""entry://Guercino, Il""><span class=""links"">Guercino </span></a> and Pietro da <a href=""entry://Cortona, Pietro da""><span class=""links"">Cortona </span></a> ranks as one of the founders of the High <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> style of painting. He was born in Parma, where he trained under Agostino <a href=""entry://Carracci""><span class=""links"">Carracci </span></a> before going to Rome in 1602 to work under Annibale Carracci in the Palazzo Farnese. After Annibale's death in 1609, he returned for a while to Emilia, but by about 1612 was back in Rome, where he gradually superseded his arch-rival <a href=""entry://Domenichino ""><span class=""links"">Domenichino </span></a> as the leading fresco decorator in the city. His ascendancy was confirmed when he took over from Domenichino the major commission for the decoration of the dome of S. Andrea della Valle ; the <i>Assumption of the Virgin</i> (1625&ndash;7) that Lanfranco painted here is one of the key works of Baroque art and it ended the dominance of Bolognese classicism in Rome. The heroic figure style derives from the Carracci, but the <a href=""entry://illusionism""><span class=""links"">illusionistic</span></a> foreshortening is based on <a href=""entry://Correggio ""><span class=""links"">Correggio's</span></a> dome paintings in Lanfranco's native Parma, here carried to new extremes. <a href=""entry://Bellori, Giovanni Pietro""><span class=""links"">Bellori </span></a> compared the way in which Lanfranco handles the multitude of figures to the harmonious blending of voices in a choir, and the dynamic design became a pattern for illusionistic decorators throughout Europe. Between 1633 and 1646 Lanfranco was in Naples, where his work was an inspiration to such Neapolitan masters as Mattia <a href=""entry://Preti, Mattia""><span class=""links"">Preti </span></a>, Luca <a href=""entry://Giordano, Luca""><span class=""links"">Giordano </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Solimena, Francesco""><span class=""links"">Solimena </span></a>. In the S. Gennaro Chapel of the cathedral he painted an even more extravagant dome (1641&ndash;3) than his masterpiece in S. Andrea della Valle, and this inspired Pietro da Cortona in the Chiesa Nuova in Rome and <a href=""entry://Mignard, Pierre""><span class=""links"">Mignard </span></a> in the church of the Val-de-Grâce in Paris. He returned to Rome in 1646 and his last (unfinished) work in the apse of S. Carlo ai Catinari exemplifies the airy luminosity of his final style. Lanfranco is much less renowned as an easel painter, but he created some outstanding works in this field also. Particularly remarkable are his <i>Ecstasy of St Margaret of Cortona</i> (Pitti, Florence), on which <a href=""entry://Bernini, Gianlorenzo""><span class=""links"">Bernini </span></a> may have drawn for his <i>St Teresa</i>, and <i>St Mary Magdalen Transported to Heaven</i> (Museo di Capodimonte, Naples), a bizarre and highly original work in which the rapturous saint is carried by angels above a poetically evoked view of the Roman Campagna."

</i> (1792; 2nd edn., 1795&ndash;6; 3rd edn. 1800). Lanzi classified his material by regional schools and based his work on a thorough knowledge of previous writings on the subject and of the paintings themselves (he was keeper of the galleries of Florence from 1773 and also visited churches and collections throughout central and northern Italy in the course of his work). His methodical arrangement and his synthesis of solid research with sensitive analysis of style make his work a landmark in art historical writing, and Rudolf <a href=""entry://Wittkower, Rudolf""><span class=""links"">Wittkower </span></a> has described it as ‘still unequalled for knowledge of the material and breadth of approach’. There have been several English translations and editions (the first in 1828), as well as numerous other Italian editions published after Lanzi's death. Lanzi published scholarly but controversial works on the Etruscan language and also a book on ancient vases (1806) in which he correctly perceived that vases traditionally called Etruscan were in fact Greek in origin."
"Laocoön","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Laocoön</b>.<div class=""content"">An antique marble group (Vatican Mus.) representing the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons being crushed to death by snakes as a penalty for warning the Trojans against the wooden horse of the Greeks, an incident related by Virgil in the <i>Aeneid</i> ii. 264&ndash;95. It is usually dated to the 2nd or 1st cent. BC or the 1st cent. AD, although whether it is an original <a href=""entry://Hellenistic""><span class=""links"">Hellenistic</span></a> piece or a Roman copy has long been a matter of dispute. <a href=""entry://Pliny the Elder""><span class=""links"">Pliny</span></a> states that in his time it stood in the palace of the emperor Titus in Rome, records that it was made by the sculptors Hagesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus of Rhodes, and describes it as ‘a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced’. This praise echoed long after the sculpture had disappeared, and its dramatic rediscovery in a vineyard in Rome in 1506 made an overwhelming impression, notably on <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, who went to see it immediately. Its liberating influence for the expression of the emotions continued to be important for <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> sculpture and until the 19th cent. it was ranked (with the <i><a href=""entry://Apollo Belvedere""><span class=""links"">Apollo Belvedere</i></a></span> and the <i><a href=""entry://Belvedere Torso""><span class=""links"">Belvedere Torso</i></a></span>) as one of the greatest works of antiquity. (As early as about 1530 <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian</span></a> satirized the adulation it received in a woodcut showing the figures changed to monkeys.) It was given a new aesthetic significance by <a href=""entry://Winckelmann, Johann Joachim""><span class=""links"">Winckelmann </span></a>, who saw it as a supreme symbol of the moral dignity of the tragic hero and the most complete exemplification of the ‘noble simplicity and quiet majesty’ which he regarded as the essence of Greek idealistic art and the key to true beauty. In 1766 <a href=""entry://Lessing, Gotthold Ephraim""><span class=""links"">Lessing </span></a> chose <i>Laokoon</i> as the title of the book in which he attacked Winckelmann's ideas. The sculpture was one of the prizes taken from Italy by Napoleon and was in Paris 1798&ndash;1815. Although no longer considered one of the world's greatest masterpieces, the <i>Laocoön</i> has slipped in esteem much less than some once-revered antique statues; it continues to be a work with a powerful hold over the imagination and still finds a place in almost all general histories of art. It has been restored several times since its discovery, and a complete renovation was made in the 1950s, when Laocoön's original right arm was returned to the figure and replaced in its correct position behind his head.<br class=""nLine"" />Study of the <i>Laocoön</i> was revolutionized in 1957 by one of the most spectacular archaeological discoveries of the 20th cent., when several groups of marble figures representing events in Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> were found at Sperlonga near Naples; the names Hagesander, Polydoros, and Athenodoros are inscribed on one of the groups (now in the museum at Sperlonga), which are close in style to the <i>Laocoön</i>. The cave in which these sculptures were found was evidently used as a banqueting hall by the Emperor Tiberius (reigned AD 14&ndash;37), and there is other evidence linking them with the 1st cent. AD, so this date is now finding favour among classical archaeologists for the <i>Laocoön</i> also."

His output of portraits was prodigious (contemporary sources indicate he painted about 1,500), and he also did religious works (once highly regarded), still lifes, and landscapes. At his best, his paintings are vigorous, forthright, and colourful; at his worst, they are pompous and vacuous."

<b>Larionov, Mikhail</b><div class=""content""><i>(1881&ndash;1964).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Russian painter and designer, one of the leading figures in the development of modernism in Russia in the period before the First World War. His early work was influenced by <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionism</span></a>, but from 1908, together with Natalia <a href=""entry://Goncharova, Natalia""><span class=""links"">Goncharova </span></a> (his life long companion and collaborator), he developed a form of cultivated <a href=""entry://primitive""><span class=""links"">primitivism</span></a>&mdash;his style more aggressive than hers&mdash;based upon an interest in Russian folk art. In a series of ‘Soldier’ and ‘Prostitute’ pictures done in 1908&ndash;13 this primitivism was exaggerated into crude distortions and a deliberate flouting of conventional good taste. Larionov was involved in avant-garde groups such as the <a href=""entry://Knave of Diamonds""><span class=""links"">Knave of Diamonds</span></a>, and he helped to organize major shows of progressive art, including the <a href=""entry://Donkey's Tail""><span class=""links"">Donkey's Tail</span></a> exhibition in 1912 and the <a href=""entry://Target exhibition""><span class=""links"">Target exhibition</span></a> in 1913, at which he launched <a href=""entry://Rayonism""><span class=""links"">Rayonism</span></a>, a near abstract movement that was a counterpart to Italian <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a>. In May 1914 Larionov and Goncharova accompanied <a href=""entry://Diaghilev, Sergei""><span class=""links"">Diaghilev's </span></a>
<i>Ballets Russes</i> to Paris. They returned to Russia in July on the outbreak of the First World War, and Larionov served in the army and was wounded. After being invalided out, he and Goncharova left Russia permanently in 1915, moving first to Switzerland and then settling in Paris in 1919 (they became French citizens in 1938). In Paris he practically abandoned easel painting and concentrated on theatrical designing for the <i>Ballets Russes</i>. After Diaghilev's death in 1929 Larionov gradually sank into obscurity, but his reputation was revived shortly before his death with retrospective exhibitions (jointly with Goncharova) in London (Arts Council, 1961) and Paris (Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, 1963)."

He emerged from total obscurity in 1952 with the publication of his only documented works&mdash;a pair of oval portraits at Charlecote Park, Warwickshire. Subsequently several other portraits in a different vein&mdash;full-lengths featuring elaborate Turkey carpets, dazzling metallic curtains, and poses of a starched magnificence&mdash;have been attributed to him, including a breathtaking group at Ranger's House, London. If they are indeed all by Larkin he was the genius of Jacobean painting; Ellis <a href=""entry://Waterhouse, Sir Ellis""><span class=""links"">Waterhouse </span></a> considered the Ranger's House portraits to be the work of ‘at least three different hands’ (one of them perhaps Isaac <a href=""entry://Oliver, Isaac""><span class=""links"">Oliver's </span></a>), but technical examination in the 1980s indicated they are all from the same studio."

Most of his career was spent in his native Amsterdam, but in about 1603&ndash;7 he was in Italy, where <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Elsheimer, Adam""><span class=""links"">Elsheimer </span></a> made a strong impact on his style. He specialized in religious, historical, and mythological scenes and often chose unusual subjects that proclaimed his status as a learned artist (<i>The Volscian Women and Children Beseeching Coriolanus not to Attack Rome</i>, Trinity College, Dublin, 1622). The glossy colours, the animated gestures and facial expressions, and the dramatic lighting of Rembrandt's early works all owe much to Lastman, and his <i>Balaam and the Ass</i> (Musée Cognacq-Jay, Paris, 1626), for example, is clearly based on a prototype by his master (private coll., 1622).

<b>Laurana, Francesco</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1430&ndash;1502?).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian sculptor, born near Zara in Dalmatia, at that time subject to Venice. In 1453 he is recorded working on decorations to the Triumphal Arch of Alfonso I at Castelnuovo, Naples. He was one of several sculptors who did so and his contribution is uncertain. Thereafter he divided his time between France and Italy, mainly the south of the country, including Sicily, although he also visited Urbino, and was possibly related to the architect Luciano Laurano, who designed the celebrated Ducal Palace there. In France his most important work was the chapel of St Lazare (1475&ndash;81) in the church of La Major at Marseilles, described by Anthony <a href=""entry://Blunt, Anthony""><span class=""links"">Blunt </span></a> as ‘probably the earliest purely Italian work on French soil’. He is best known, however, for his portrait busts of members, mostly female, of the Neapolitan royal house and their relatives. In these remarkably sensitive works the forms of the face are subtly generalized in a search for basic geometric shapes, and their simple naturalism was sometimes enhanced by heightening the marble with colour, as in the bust of Isabella of Aragon in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna."

<b>Laurens, Henri</b><div class=""content""><i>(1885&ndash;1954).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French sculptor, designer, and illustrator, born in Paris, where he trained as an ornamental stonemason.

He made collages, reliefs, and constructions of wood and metal, mainly still lifes using the familiar Cubist repertory of bottles, glasses, and fruit. Much of his work was coloured, but he retained a genuine sculptor's feeling for mass, and his distrust of intellectual speculation preserved his independence from Cubist theorizing. In the mid-1920s he moved away from his geometrical style to one that featured curved lines and voluptuous forms, notably in female nudes. Many of his fellow artists regarded him as one of the greatest sculptors of his time, but financial success and official recognition were slow in coming. When he failed to win the first prize for sculpture at the 1948 Venice <a href=""entry://Biennale""><span class=""links"">Biennale</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a> was so disgusted that he offered to share his own painting prize with him.

Between 1885 and 1896 he lived mainly in Glasgow (see <a href=""entry://Glasgow School""><span class=""links"">GLASGOW SCHOOL</span></a>), then settled in London, although he travelled a good deal and often wintered in Morocco, where he bought a house in about 1903. Lavery had an immensely successful career as a fashionable portraitist (particularly of women), painting in a dashing and fluid, if rather facile, style. He also painted interiors, landscapes, and outdoor scenes such as tennis and bathing parties, and he was an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a>, 1917&ndash;18.

"Lawrence, Sir Thomas","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Lawrence, Sir Thomas</b><div class=""content""><i>(1769&ndash;1830).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The outstanding English portrait painter of his generation. Lawrence was a child prodigy and was almost entirely self-taught. He was also handsome and charming, and after a resounding early triumph with his portrait of Queen Charlotte (NG, London, 1789) he never looked back in terms of professional and social success. On the death of Reynolds in 1792 he succeeded him as Painter in Ordinary to the King, and on the death of <a href=""entry://Hoppner, John""><span class=""links"">Hoppner </span></a> in 1810 he was recognized as the leading portrait painter of the time, and also to some extent as head of the profession of painting in Britain. The high point of his career came in 1818, when he was sent to Europe as the envoy of the Prince Regent (later George IV) to paint the heads of state and military leaders who were involved with the allied victory over Napoleon. As a preliminary gesture he was knighted, and on his return in 1820 he succeeded Benjamin <a href=""entry://West, Benjamin""><span class=""links"">West </span></a> as President of the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a>. The portraits painted on this tour are now in the Waterloo Chamber, Windsor Castle. Lawrence was devoted to the memory and example of Reynolds and in some respects he was the last of the great portrait painters in the 18th-cent. tradition. In others he was a <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a>, responding to the glamour of the historic years through which he lived. His fluid and lush brushwork won the admiration of French painters when his work was exhibited at the Paris <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> of 1824 and after <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a> visited London in the following year he paid Lawrence the compliment of painting a portrait in his style (<i>Baron Schwiter</i>, NG, London). Lawrence's reputation declined after his death, however, and has never revived to its former heights. He was constantly in debt in spite of his success and took on too many commissions, so his work is uneven and sometimes careless (and like Reynolds he was a failure as a history painter), but at his best he has a feeling for paint that few British artists can rival. Lawrence was a man of great taste and made one of the finest collections of Old Master drawings ever assembled, particularly rich in works by <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> (these are now among the greatest treasures of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford).

Up to 1929 he painted only still life, but from that time the human figure was occasionally introduced into his compositions. He adopted the pseudonym Le Corbusier in 1920, but continued to sign his paintings ‘Jeanneret’. The pseudonym derives from the name of one of his grandparents and is also a pun on his facial resemblance to a raven (French, ‘corbeau’).

He spent the First World War in the Netherlands, where he laid the basis of a European reputation and exercised considerable influence on the development of northern Expressionism (his work is better represented in Dutch collections than it is in French). After his return to Paris in 1920 he gradually abandoned his Expressionist manner for a more restrained and austere style.

<b>Le Nain, Antoine</b><div class=""content""><i>(d. 1648), Louis (d. 1648), and Mathieu (<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1607&ndash;77).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> French painters, brothers, who were born at Laon but had all moved to Paris by 1630. The traditional birth-dates for Antoine and Louis are 1588 and 1593 respectively, but it is now thought likely that they were born shortly before and shortly after 1600, so that all three brothers were of much the same generation. Mathieu was made painter to the city of Paris in 1633, and all three were foundation members of the <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">Academy</span></a> in 1648. Apart from this, little is known of their careers and the assigning of works to one or the other of them is fraught with difficulty and controversy, for such paintings as are signed bear only their surname, and of those that are dated none is later than 1648, when all were still alive. The finest and most original works associated with the brothers&mdash;powerful and dignified <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes of peasants&mdash;are conventionally given to Louis; Antoine is credited with a group of small-scale and richly coloured family scenes, mainly on copper; and in a third group, attributed to Mathieu, are paintings of a more <a href=""entry://eclectic""><span class=""links"">eclectic</span></a> style, chiefly portraits and group portraits in a manner suggesting influence from Holland. The brothers are also said to have collaborated on religious works. Examples of all these types are in the Louvre. In 1978&ndash;9 a major exhibition in Paris brought together most of the pictures associated with the brothers, but it raised as many problems as it solved. It also, however, confirmed the stature of ‘Louis’, whose sympathetic and unaffected peasant scenes are the main reason why the Le Nains have attracted so much attention. It has recently been proposed that the traditional description of the figures in these paintings as ‘peasants’ is a misnomer (they are said to be too well dressed for that) and that in fact they represent members of the bourgeoisie."

Le Parc professes to adopt a rational and objective attitude to his work, repudiating the ideas of artistic creativity or symbolic meaning and working according to scientific principles. He often uses the idea of spectator participation, but tries to eliminate subjective response on the part of the spectator, looking for an objective and predictable perceptual response to a planned stimulus. Much of his work consists of devices for disorienting the spectator (distorting glasses and so on), but he has also made some outstanding <a href=""entry://mobile""><span class=""links"">mobiles</span></a>, using perspex or metallic elements to scatter or reflect the light."

In the last years of his life his chief model became <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>, whom he imitated in an uninspired manner.

He worked much for Charles I, his most famous work being the equestrian statue of the king (1633) at Charing Cross in London. This shows the skill as a bronze caster for which he was renowned, but also his smooth, lifeless surfaces, which give his works, in the words of Margaret Whinney (<i>Sculpture in Britain</i> 1530 to 1830, 1964), ‘a curious, inflated appearance, as if they were not modelled, but blown up from within’. He was remarkably conceited, on occasions signing himself ‘<a href=""entry://Praxiteles ""><span class=""links"">Praxiteles Le Sueur </span></a>’, but Charles recognized him as a second-rate artist and sometimes reduced the prices he asked for his work. By 1643 Le Sueur was back in Paris. His main influence in England was in popularizing the bust portrait."

After training with <a href=""entry://Vouet, Simon""><span class=""links"">Vouet </span></a> he went to Rome in 1642 and worked under <a href=""entry://Poussin, Nicolas""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>, becoming a convert to the latter's theories of art. He returned to Paris in 1646. In 1662 he was raised to the nobility and named <i>Premier Peintre du roi</i>, and in 1663 he was made director of the reorganized <a href=""entry://Gobelins""><span class=""links"">Gobelins</span></a> factory. Also in 1663 he was made director of the reorganized Académie, which he turned into a channel for imposing a codified system of orthodoxy in matters of art (see <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">ACADEMY</span></a>). His lectures came to be accepted as providing the official standards of artistic correctness and, formulated on the basis of the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classicism</span></a> of Poussin, gave authority to the view that every aspect of artistic creation can be reduced to teachable rule and precept. In 1698 his small illustrated treatise <i>Méthode pour apprendre è dessiner les passions</i>
was posthumously published; in this, again following theories of Poussin, he purported to codify the visual expression of the emotions in painting. Despite the classicism of his theories, Lebrun's own talents lay rather in the direction of flamboyant and grandiose decorative effects. Among the most outstanding of his works for the king were the Galerie d'Apollon at the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a> (1663), and the famous Galerie des Glaces (1679&ndash;84) and the Great Staircase (1671&ndash;8, destroyed in 1752) at Versailles. His importance in the history of French art is twofold: his contributions to the magnificence of the <a href=""entry://Grand Manner""><span class=""links"">Grand Manner</span></a> of Louis XIV and his influence in laying the basis of academicism. Many of the leading French artists of the next generation trained in his studio. Lebrun was a fine portraitist and an extremely prolific draughtsman."

His early work was influenced by <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a>, but from about 1910 he developed a more personal style characterized by simplified and stylized forms: his work remained representational, but he eliminated perspective and reduced his figures (which included labourers, soldiers, and women going to market) to sharply delineated geometrical forms in primary colours. In 1916 he met <a href=""entry://Mondrian, Piet""><span class=""links"">Mondrian </span></a> and in 1917 was one of the founders of De <a href=""entry://Stijl, De""><span class=""links"">Stijl</span></a>. At this time his work was purely abstract, featuring geometrically disposed bars and rectangles in a style close to Mondrian and van <a href=""entry://Doesburg, Theo van""><span class=""links"">Doesburg </span></a>. However, he found the dogmatism of the movement uncongenial and left it in 1918, reverting to geometrically simplified figural subjects. In the 1920s he became interested in textile design and during the 1930s and 1940s he extended his interests to ceramics and interior decoration, experimenting with the effects of colour on the sense of space.

"Lehmbruck, Wilhelm","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Lehmbruck, Wilhelm</b><div class=""content""><i>(1881&ndash;1919).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German sculptor. His early work was in a fairly conservative academic manner, but when he was living in Paris from 1910 to 1914 he found a much more personal style, influenced by the formal simplifications of <a href=""entry://Archipenko, Alexander""><span class=""links"">Archipenko </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Brancusi, Constantin""><span class=""links"">Brancusi </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Modigliani, Amedeo""><span class=""links"">Modigliani </span></a>, although still essentially in the tradition of <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Maillol, Aristide""><span class=""links"">Maillol </span></a>. It is exemplified in the extremely attenuated forms, angular pose, and melancholic expression of his <i>Kneeling Woman</i> (MOMA, New York, 1911). On the outbreak of the First World War he returned to Germany and worked in a hospital, the suffering he witnessed being reflected in the poignancy of his last works. The war brought him to a state of acute depression and he committed suicide in 1919. Lehmbruck often worked in marble, but he was by temperament a modeller rather than a carver, working in clay over a spindly armature, and several of his works were cast in artificial stone to preserve the texture of the clay.

Intelligent, cultured, and of distinguished appearance, he was one of the chief adornments of London society. Leighton's varied output included portraits and book illustrations, but he is best known for his paintings of classical Greek subjects, the finest of which are distinguished by magnificently opulent colouring as well as splendid draughtsmanship (<i>The Garden of the Hesperides</i>, Lady Lever Art Gal., Port Sunlight, 1892). As a sculptor he is best known for the bronze <i>Athlete Struggling with a Python</i> (1874&ndash;7), which can be seen in Leighton House (on loan from the Tate Gallery), the sumptuously decorated house and studio he built in Holland Park Road, Kensington, now a Leighton museum."
"Lely, Sir Peter","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Lely, Sir Peter</b><div class=""content""><i>(1618&ndash;80).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Painter of Dutch origin who spent almost all his career in England and was naturalized in 1662. His family name was originally vander Faes, and the name Lely is said to have come from a lily carved on the house in The Hague where his father was born. Lely was born at Soest in Westphalia (where his father, a captain of infantry, was stationed) and trained in Haarlem. He came to England in the early 1640s (early biographers say 1641 or 1643), and although he first painted figure compositions in landscapes (<i>Sleeping Nymphs</i>, Dulwich College Picture Gallery), he soon turned to the more profitable field of portraiture. Fortune shone on him, for within a few years of his arrival the best portraitists in England disappeared from the scene; van <a href=""entry://Dyck, Sir Anthony van""><span class=""links"">Dyck </span></a> and William <a href=""entry://Dobson, William""><span class=""links"">Dobson </span></a> died in 1641 and 1646 respectively, and Cornelius <a href=""entry://Johnson, Cornelius""><span class=""links"">Johnson </span></a> returned to Holland in 1643. In 1654 he was described as ‘the best artist in England’. Lely portrayed Charles I and his children, Oliver Cromwell and his son Richard, and other leading figures of the Interregnum, but he is associated chiefly with the Restoration court of Charles II. He was made Principal Painter to the King in 1661 and was able to enjoy a lavish lifestyle, described in Samuel Pepys's <i>Diary</i>. With the aid of a team of assistants he maintained an enormous output, and his fleshy, sleepy beauties clad in exquisite silks and his bewigged courtiers have created the popular image of Restoration England. Van Dyck was the strongest influence on his style, but Lely was more earthy and less refined. Much of his work is repetitive (it is sometimes hard to tell sitters apart), but he was a fluent and lively colourist and had a gift for impressive composition. He completely dominated portraiture in his time, and the tradition of the society portrait which he consolidated, developed by <a href=""entry://Kneller, Sir Godfrey""><span class=""links"">Kneller </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Jervas, Charles""><span class=""links"">Jervas </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Hudson, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Hudson </span></a>, endured for almost a century until it was challenged by <a href=""entry://Hogarth, William""><span class=""links"">Hogarth </span></a>.

She quickly established a reputation as a painter of portraits, mainly of people in the smart social circles in which she moved&mdash;writers, entertainers, the disposed nobility of Eastern Europe. Her style owes something to the ‘tubism’ of <a href=""entry://Léger, Fernand""><span class=""links"">Léger </span></a>, but is very distinctive in its hard, streamlined elegance and sense of chic decadence&mdash;better than anyone else she represents the <a href=""entry://Art Deco""><span class=""links"">Art Deco</span></a> style in painting. Apart from portraits, her main subjects were hefty erotic nudes and still lifes of calla lilies. She received considerable critical acclaim and also became a social celebrity, famed for her aloof Garboesque beauty, her parties, and her love affairs (with women as well as men). In 1939 she moved to the USA with her second husband Baron Raoul Huffner, repeating her artistic and social success in Hollywood and New York. By the 1950s, however, her work was going out of fashion. She tried painting pictures in a different, much looser style, but these were coolly received. Interest in her earlier work began to revive in the 1970s and by the 1990s she had again become something of a stylish icon, with her paintings fetching huge prices in the saleroom and featuring in television advertisements as a symbol of the high life."

"Leonardo da Vinci","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Leonardo da Vinci </b><div class=""content""><i>(1452&ndash;1519).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine artist, scientist, and thinker, the most versatile genius of the Italian <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. Leonardo was born in or near the small town of Vinci in the Tuscan countryside. His father Piero was a Florentine notary and Leonardo was his illegitimate son by a peasant girl, Caterina . In 1472 he was enrolled as a painter in the fraternity of St Luke in Florence, after serving an apprenticeship with <a href=""entry://Verrocchio, Andrea del""><span class=""links"">Verrocchio </span></a>. <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> attributed to Leonardo one of the angels in Verrocchio's <i>Baptism of Christ</i> (Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1470), and the head of the angel on the left of the picture does indeed far surpass its companion in spirituality and beauty of technique, giving the first demonstration of that combined languor and intensity which is so characteristic of Leonardo's work. Verrocchio is said to have been so impressed that he gave up painting, and it is possible that he was content to entrust the painting side of his business to Leonardo, who was still living in his master's house in 1476. Leonardo stayed in Florence until 1481 or 1482, when he moved to Milan. Several paintings are reasonably attributed to this early Florentine period, notably an exquisite <i>Annunciation</i> in the Uffizi, and a portrait of Ginevra de' Benci (NG, Washington), probably painted <i>c.</i>1476 for the Venetian ambassador Bernardo Bembo, as well as the large altarpiece of <i>The Adoration of the Magi</i> (Uffizi, Florence), commissioned in 1481 by the monks of S. Donato a Scopeto and left unfinished when Leonardo moved to Milan. This painting and the numerous preparatory drawings for it show the astonishing fecundity of Leonardo's mind. The range of gesture and expression was unprecedented, and features such as the contrasting figures of wise old sage and beautiful youth who stand at either side of the painting, and the rearing horses in the background, became permanent obsessions in his work.<br class=""nLine"" />Leonardo lived in Milan until 1499 (when the French invaded), working mainly at the court of Duke Ludovico <a href=""entry://Sforza""><span class=""links"">Sforza </span></a> (II Moro). He is said to have been recommended primarily as a musician, and in a letter to the duke listing his accomplishments he gives some idea of his versatility, writing of himself first and foremost as a designer of instruments of war and adding his attainments as an artist almost as an afterthought. From then on schemes of applied science and investigations of all kinds into the natural world occupied much of his time and filled his notebooks. He never properly formulated his researches, and when he put theories into practice, whether methods of painting or diversions of rivers, the results were generally faulty. It was the quest which absorbed him, and there was never the dedication to his art that characterizes many great masters. Although he surpassed all of his contemporaries in the sheer beauty of his technique as a painter, this ‘mechanical’ aspect of his work was much less appealing to him than solving problems of composition and characterization in his drawings (incomparably the finest collection of which is at Windsor Castle). His dilatoriness infuriated his paymasters and although his <i>œuvre</i> as a painter is small, he left a high proportion of his pictures unfinished. This stress on the intellectual aspects of painting was one of the most momentous features of Leonardo's career, for he was largely responsible for establishing the idea of the artist as a creative thinker, not simply a skilled craftsman (see <a href=""entry://liberal arts""><span class=""links"">LIBERAL ARTS</span></a>). Leonardo's main artistic undertakings in Milan were a project for a huge equestrian statue to Ludovico Sforza's father, now known only in preliminary drawings, and the wall-painting of the <i>Last Supper</i> (<i>c.</i>1495&ndash;7) in the refectory of Sta Maria delle Grazie. The <a href=""entry://fresco""><span class=""links"">fresco</span></a> method of mural painting was not flexible or subtle enough for the slow-working Leonardo, so he adopted an experimental technique that quickly caused the picture to deteriorate disastrously. It has been many times restored, but although it is only a shadow of Leonardo's original creation it still retains some of the immense authority that has made it, for almost five centuries, the most revered painting in the world. Leonardo's other works in Milan included portraits, notably the marvellous picture of Duke Ludovico's mistress Cecilia Gallerani known as the <i>Lady with an Ermine</i> (Czartoryski Gal., Cracow) and an altarpiece of the <i>Virgin of the Rocks</i>, which exists in two problematically related versions, the earlier (Louvre, Paris) possibly painted when Leonardo was still in Florence, the later (NG, London) still being worked on in 1508. There may have been some studio assistance in the London version, but the finest passages, notably the heads of the Virgin and the angel, with their exquisitely curled hair and heavylidded eyes, can be by no one but Leonardo himself. The larger, bolder forms of the London picture show Leonardo's move towards the more monumental style of the High Renaissance, of which he was the main creator.<br class=""nLine"" />Between 1500, when he returned for a time to Florence, and 1516, when he left Italy for France, Leonardo's life was unsettled. In 1502&ndash;3 he worked as a military engineer for Cesare Borgia, in 1506&ndash;13 he was based again in Milan, and in 1513 he moved to Rome, but the artistic activity of his later years was chiefly centred in Florence in the years 1500&ndash;6. From this time dates his portrait of <i>Mona Lisa</i> (Louvre) and the wall painting of the <i>Battle of Anghiari</i> in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, where he worked in rivalry with <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>. The battle piece is destroyed, but is preserved in copies; fittingly, the most famous copy is a drawing by <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a> (Louvre), for Leonardo's painting anticipated the dynamism of the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> and influenced battle painters up to the 19th cent. In Florence also Leonardo worked out variations on a theme that fascinated him at this time and presented a great challenge to his skill in composing closely knit groups of figures. This was <i>The Virgin and Child with St Anne</i>, known today mainly through a painting in the Louvre and the incomparably beautiful <a href=""entry://cartoon""><span class=""links"">cartoon</span></a> (which includes also the infant John the Baptist) in the National Gallery, London. The exact dates of these two famous works are controversial.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1516 Leonardo accepted an invitation from Francis I to move to France, and he died at Cloux, near Amboise, in 1519. He did little artistic work in the last decade of his life, the last paintings from his hand generally being accepted as two pictures of <i>St John the Baptist</i> (one later converted into a <i>Bacchus</i>), both in the Louvre (<i>c.</i>1515). They show the enigmatic smile, the dense shadow, the pointing finger, and the thick curling hair that rapidly became clichés in the work of his followers. In painting Leonardo had an enormous influence. His heroic figures and beautifully balanced compositions (particularly his use of pyramidical grouping) were the basis of the High Renaissance style, influencing particularly his two greatest contemporaries, Michelangelo and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>, and his subtle modelling through light and shade (see <a href=""entry://Sfumato""><i><span class=""links"">SFUMATO</i></span></a>) showed the potentialities of the <a href=""entry://oil paint""><span class=""links"">oil</span></a> medium, which he was one of the first Italians to exploit. <a href=""entry://Giorgione ""><span class=""links"">Giorgione </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Correggio ""><span class=""links"">Correggio </span></a> were among those most deeply influenced by this aspect of Leonardo's work. His writings on painting were influential too; they were first published from his scattered notes as the <i>Treatise On Painting</i> (in Italian and French) in 1651, but were well known before then. In sculpture and architecture no work that is indisputably by Leonardo survives, but his expertise and ideas were important in both fields. Leonardo is one of the very few artists whose reputation has from his own times onward constantly remained at the highest level, even though his output of completed works was small&mdash;a reflection of his extraordinary force of intellect and his virtually single-handed creation of the idea of the artist as genius."

He was a man of formidable intellect and great versatility who played a leading role in the development of German theatre, but he is known mainly for his treatise on aesthetics, <i>Laokoon</i> (1766). This takes as its starting-point a passage in <a href=""entry://Winckelmann, Johann Joachim""><span class=""links"">Winckelmann's </span></a> writings in which he discussed the celebrated antique statue <i><a href=""entry://Laocoön""><span class=""links"">Laocoön</i></a></span>. Winckelmann contrasted what he considered the stoical beauty of Laocoon in the sculpture with the loud cries that Virgil causes him to utter in the <i>Aeneid</i>, interpreting the alleged difference (to most people he appears to be howling with pain in the sculpture too) as a superior serenity in Greek art. Lessing dissented, and argued that each art achieves its effects by the means appropriate to its medium and that the artist must exploit the potentialities of his medium to the full, whilst respecting its limitations. The impact of Lessing's book stemmed from its emphasis on the aesthetic functions of art in contrast with the traditional view of art as the handmaid of religion and philosophy, whose duty was primarily to instruct."

He was a great traveller and spent the years 1841&ndash;51 in Cairo. His colourful and highly detailed scenes of life in the harem and bazaar were a huge success in London, and after his return there in 1851 he concentrated on them exclusively, playing a major part in creating the vogue for ‘Oriental’ subjects. His brother, <i>Frederick Christian Lewis, Jr.</i> (1813&ndash;75), was also a painter.

He came to England as a child, studied at the <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School, 1898&ndash;1901, then lived on the Continent for seven years, mostly in Paris. In 1909 he returned to England and in the years leading up to the First World War emerged as one of the leading figures in British avant-garde art. From 1911 he developed an angular, machine-like, semiabstract style that had affinities with both <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a>. He worked for a short time with Roger <a href=""entry://Fry, Roger""><span class=""links"">Fry </span></a> at the <a href=""entry://Omega Workshops""><span class=""links"">Omega Workshops</span></a>, but after quarrelling with him in 1914 he formed the Rebel Art Centre, from which grew <a href=""entry://Vorticism""><span class=""links"">Vorticism</span></a>, a movement of which he was the chief figure and whose journal <i>Blast</i> he edited. He served with the Royal Artillery, 1915&ndash;17, and as an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a>, 1917&ndash;18, carrying his Vorticist style into works such as <i>A Battery Shelled</i> (Imperial War Museum, London). In 1919 he founded Group X as an attempt to revive Vorticism, but this failed, and from the late 1920s he devoted himself mainly to writing, in which he often made savage attacks on his contemporaries (particularly the <a href=""entry://Bloomsbury Group""><span class=""links"">Bloomsbury Group</span></a>). His association with the British Fascist Party and his praise of Hitler alienated him from the literary world. The best-known paintings of his later years are his incisive portraits; the rejection of that of T. S.

He built his personal style on features taken from Cubism and Futurism but did not accept either. He accused Cubism of failure to ‘synthesize the quality of LIFE with the significance or spiritual weight that is the mark of all the greatest art’ and of being mere visual acrobatics. The Futurists, he wrote, had the vivacity that the Cubists lacked, but they themselves lacked the grandness and the ‘great plastic qualities’ that Cubism achieved. His own work, he declared, was ‘electric with a mastered and vivid vitality’. He wrote several books, including novels, notably <i>Tarr</i> (1918), and collections of essays and criticism. <i>Blasting and Bombadiering</i> (1937), <i>Wyndham Lewis the Artist</i> (1939), and <i>Rude Assignment</i> (1950) are autobiographical."

"liberal arts","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>liberal arts</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to those arts that were traditionally considered primarily as exercises of the mind rather than of practical skill and craftsmanship. The concept of a distinction between ‘liberal’ (worthy of a free man: Latin <i>homo liber</i>) and ‘vulgar’ arts goes back to classical antiquity, and survived in one form or another up to the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, forming the basis of secular learning in the Middle Ages. In the early Renaissance the lowly position accorded to the visual arts was increasingly contested, providing a theoretical basis for the social struggle which took place to raise them from the status of manual skill to the dignity of a liberal exercise of the spirit. The most formidable champion of the visual arts was <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo </span></a>, who more than anyone else was responsible for creating the idea of the painter as a creative thinker. By about 1500 painting and sculpture were generally accepted as liberal arts by Italian humanists (significantly so in Baldassare Castiglione's influential <i>Book of the Courtier</i> of 1528, which was translated into English in 1561). However, as Anthony <a href=""entry://Blunt, Anthony""><span class=""links"">Blunt </span></a> points out (<i>Artistic Theory in Italy</i> 1450&ndash;1600), ‘As soon as the visual arts became generally accepted as liberal, the protagonists began to quarrel among themselves about which of them was the noblest and most liberal.’ The acceptance came later in other parts of Europe than in Italy."

<b>Lichtenstein, Roy</b><div class=""content""><i>(1923&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, sculptor, and graphic artist. In the late 1950s his style was <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionist</span></a>, but in the early 1960s he changed to <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a> and his first one-man exhibition in this style, at the Leo <a href=""entry://Castelli, Leo""><span class=""links"">Castelli</span></a> gallery, New York, in 1962 was a sensational success. In common with other Pop artists, Lichtenstein adopted the images of commercial art, but he did so in a highly distinctive manner. He took his inspiration from comic strips but blew up the images to a large scale, reproducing the primary colours and dots of the cheap printing processes (<i>Whaam!</i>, Tate Gallery, London, 1963). The initial stimulus is said to have come from one of his young children, who pointed to a comic book and challenged ‘I bet you can't paint as good as that.’ Despite their use of such kitsch material, his paintings show an impressive feeling for composition and colour and Lichtenstein has enjoyed continued critical success as well as popular appeal. In the mid-1960s he began making Pop versions of paintings by modern masters such as <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Mondrian, Piet""><span class=""links"">Mondrian </span></a>, and in the 1970s he expanded his range to include sculpture, mostly in polished brass and imitating the <a href=""entry://Art Deco""><span class=""links"">Art Deco</span></a> forms of the 1930s.

From <i>c.</i>1625 to 1631/2 he worked in close collaboration with his friend <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a>. They shared the same models (and probably a studio) and even worked together on the same pictures&mdash;a <i>Portrait of a Child</i> in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, for example, is signed ‘Lievens retouched by Rembrandt’. The diplomat and connoisseur Constantin Huygens visited them in 1629 and thought they showed equal promise of greatness. He wrote that Rembrandt surpassed Lievens in vivacity of expression, but that Lievens was superior in ‘a certain grandeur of invention and boldness of subjects and forms’. That this was not excessive praise is borne out by Lievens's marvellously melodramatic <i>Raising of Lazarus</i> (Brighton Museum and Art Gallery, 1631), in which the only parts of Lazarus shown are his arms emerging from the tomb. After the paths of the two young artists separated in 1631/2, however, Lievens did not sustain his early brilliance. From 1635 to 1644 he was in Antwerp, where under the influence of van <a href=""entry://Dyck, Sir Anthony van""><span class=""links"">Dyck </span></a> he adopted a more elegant and facile style that brought him renown as a portraitist. In 1644 he returned to the Netherlands, where he remained for the rest of his life and during the last three decades was popular in official circles in Amsterdam and The Hague. Lievens was a talented etcher and also made some woodcuts."

He was, indeed, one of the most extravagant patrons and collectors in the history of art, and the Limburgs illuminated two manuscripts for his celebrated library: the Belles Heures (Met. Mus., New York, <i>c.</i>1408) and the Très Riches Heures (Musée Condé, Chantilly), which was begun <i>c.</i>1413 and left unfinished at their deaths (it was completed by the French illuminator Jean Colombe (<i>c.</i>1440&ndash;93?) about seventy years later). The Très Riches Heures (<i>see <a href=""entry://Book of Hours""><span class=""links"">BOOK OF HOURS</i></a></span>) is by common consent one of the supreme masterpieces of manuscript illumination and the archetype of the <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a> style.

"line engraving","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>line engraving</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to a method of making prints (and the print so made) in which the design is cut directly into the surface of a metal (usually copper) plate. In normal parlance the term <a href=""entry://engraving""><span class=""links"">engraving</span></a> usually refers to line engraving, but strictly the former is a generic term, covering a variety of processes (see <a href=""entry://print""><span class=""links"">PRINT</span></a>). The line engraver cuts the design into a smooth metal plate with a tool called a <a href=""entry://burin""><span class=""links"">burin</span></a>.

The essential nature of the medium is linear, though shading and tone may be suggested by parallel strokes, cross-<a href=""entry://hatching""><span class=""links"">hatching</span></a>, or textures compounded of various dots and flicks. Line engraving seems to have originated towards the middle of the 15th cent. in the workshops of goldsmiths, arising independently in Italy (see <a href=""entry://niello""><span class=""links"">NIELLO</span></a>) and Germany, though perhaps slightly earlier in the latter country. Martin <a href=""entry://Schongauer, Martin""><span class=""links"">Schongauer </span></a>, who died in 1491, was the first major artist to work mainly as an engraver, and the medium had its finest flowering in the early 16th cent. in the work of Albrecht <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Lucas van Leyden ""><span class=""links"">Lucas van Leyden </span></a>.

His first major commission (1484) was the completion of <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio's </span></a> fresco cycle in the Brancacci Chapel of Sta Maria del Carmine, a task he carried out with such skill and tact that it is sometimes difficult to tell where his work begins and that of more than half a century earlier ends. Filippino painted several other frescos, the most important of which are cycles on the life to St Thomas Aquinas (1488&ndash;93) in the Caraffa Chapel, Sta Maria sopra Minerva, Rome, and the lives of S. S. Philip and John (1495&ndash;1502) in the Strozzi Chapel, Sta Maria Novella, Florence. In these he strove for picturesque, dramatic and even bizarre effects that reveal him as one of the most inventive of late <a href=""entry://quattrocento""><span class=""links"">quattrocento</span></a> painters. Filippino also painted many altarpieces, the most famous of which is <i>The Vision of St Bernard</i> (Badia, Florence, <i>c.</i>1480), an exquisitely tender work, full of beautiful detail. Although he is now somewhat overshadowed by Botticelli, Filippino enjoyed a great reputation in his lifetime, being described by Lorenzo de' <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici </span></a> as ‘superior to <a href=""entry://Apelles""><span class=""links"">Apelles</span></a>’."
"Lippi, Fra Filippo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Lippi, Fra Filippo</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1406&ndash;69).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter. He was brought up as an unwanted child in the Carmelite friary of the Carmine, where he took his vows in 1421. Unlike the Dominican Fra <a href=""entry://Angelico, Fra""><span class=""links"">Angelico </span></a>, however, Lippi was a reluctant friar and had a scandalous love affair with a nun, Lucrezia Buti, who bore his son Filippino and a daughter Alessandra . The couple were released from their vows and allowed to marry, but Lippi still signed himself ‘Frater Philippus ’. His biography (romantically embroidered to include capture by pirates) is one of the most colourful in <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari's </span></a>
<i>Lives</i> and has given rise to the picture of a worldly <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> artist, rebelling against the discipline of the Church-an image reflected in Robert Browning's poem about Lippi (‘Fra Lippo Lippi’ in <i>Men and Women</i>, 1855). He must certainly have had a more eventful life than most, but there is little documentary evidence of his character and personality. Vasari writes that Lippi was inspired to become a painter by watching <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a> at work in the Carmine church, and his early work, notably the <i>Tarquinia Madonna</i> (Galleria Nazionale, Rome, 1437) is certainly overwhelmingly influenced by him. From about 1440, however, his style changed direction, becoming more linear and preoccupied with decorative motifs&mdash;thin, fluttering draperies, brocades, etc. Lippi is associated particularly with paintings of the Virgin and Child, which are sometimes in the form of <i><a href=""entry://tondo""><span class=""links"">tondi</i></a></span>, a format he was among the first to use&mdash;a beautiful example, showing the wistful delicacy and exquisite pale lighting that characterizes his best work, is in the Pitti, Florence. Another formal innovation with which Lippi is closely associated is the <a href=""entry://sacra conversazione""><i><span class=""links"">sacra conversazione</i></span></a>&mdash;his <i>Barbadori</i> Altarpiece (Louvre, Paris, begun 1437) is sometimes claimed as the earliest example of the type. As a fresco painter Lippi's finest achievement is his cycle on the lives of SS. Stephen and John the Baptist (1452&ndash;66) in Prato Cathedral. Lippi was highly regarded in his day (he was patronized by the <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici </span></a>, who came to his aid when he was imprisoned and tortured for alleged fraud) and his influence is seen in the work of numerous artists, most notably <a href=""entry://Botticelli, Sandro""><span class=""links"">Botticelli </span></a>, who was probably his pupil. Four centuries later he was one of the major sources for the second wave of <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelitism</span></a>."

<b>Lissitzky, El</b>
<i>(Eliezer Markowich )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1890&ndash;1941).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Russian painter, designer, graphic artist, and architect. After studying engineering at Darmstadt and architecture in Moscow he worked in an architect's office and collaborated with <a href=""entry://Chagall, Marc""><span class=""links"">Chagall </span></a> on the illustration of Jewish books (he was an expert lithographer). In 1918 Chagall became head of the art school at Vitebsk and in the following year he appointed Lissitzky as Professor of Architecture and Graphic Art. One of his colleagues at Vitebsk was <a href=""entry://Malevich, Kasimir""><span class=""links"">Malevich </span></a>, whose advocacy of the use of pure geometric form greatly influenced Lissitzky, notably in his series of abstract paintings to which he gave the collective name ‘Proun’ and which he referred to as ‘the interchange station between painting and architecture’. They do indeed look like plans for three-dimensional constructions, and at the same time Lissitzky made ambitious architectonic designs that were never realized. In 1921, after a brief period as professor at the state art school in Moscow, he went to Berlin, where he arranged and designed the important exhibition of abstract art at the Van Diemen Gallery that first comprehensively presented the modern movement in Russia to the West (it was later shown also in Amsterdam). While in Berlin he made contact with van <a href=""entry://Doesburg, Theo van""><span class=""links"">Doesburg </span></a> and members of <a href=""entry://Stijl, De""><span class=""links"">De Stijl</span></a> and with <a href=""entry://Moholy-Nagy, László""><span class=""links"">Moholy-Nagy </span></a>, who spread Lissitzky's ideas through his teaching at the <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a>.

From 1923 to 1925 he lived in Switzerland, and (after a short visit to Russia) from 1925 to 1928 in Hanover. He returned to Russia in 1928 and settled in Moscow. By this time he had abandoned painting and devoted himself mainly to typography and industrial design. His work included several propaganda and trade exhibitions, notably the Soviet Pavilion of the 1939 World's Fair in New York, and his dynamic techniques of <a href=""entry://photomontage""><span class=""links"">photomontage</span></a>, printing, and lighting had wide influence. For a considerable time Lissitzky was the best known of the Russian abstract artists in the West. In his mature work he achieved a fusion between the <a href=""entry://Suprematism""><span class=""links"">Suprematism</span></a> of Malevich (often using his diagonal axis), the <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivism</span></a> of <a href=""entry://Tatlin, Vladimir""><span class=""links"">Tatlin </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Rodchenko, Alexander""><span class=""links"">Rodchenko </span></a>, and features of the <a href=""entry://Neo-Plasticism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Plasticism</span></a> of <a href=""entry://Mondrian, Piet""><span class=""links"">Mondrian </span></a>."
"lithography","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>lithography</b>.<div class=""content"">A method of printing from a design drawn directly onto a slab of stone or other suitable material. The most recent of the major graphic techniques, it was invented in 1798 by Aloys <a href=""entry://Senefelder, Aloys""><span class=""links"">Senefelder </span></a>. The process is based on the antipathy of grease and water, the design being drawn with a greasy crayon. After this has been chemically fixed, the stone is wetted and then rolled with oily ink, which adheres only to the greasy drawing, the rest of the surface, being damp, repelling the ink. Prints can then be taken in a press. Only certain types of stone are suitable for use in lithography, and zinc (from about 1830) and aluminium (from about 1890) have been employed as substitutes. The results they produce are usually identical. Colour lithography, using a different stone for each ink, was introduced in the 1830s. Many distinguished artists of the 19th and 20th cents. have worked in the lithographic technique (beginning with <a href=""entry://Goya, Francisco de""><span class=""links"">Goya </span></a> in his old age), attracted by the freedom it allows (the artist need do nothing more than draw on the stone&mdash;the printer can handle all the technicalities), and <a href=""entry://Daumier, Honoré""><span class=""links"">Daumier </span></a> was the first great figure to execute the major part of his life's work in lithography. <a href=""entry://Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri de""><span class=""links"">Toulouse-Lautrec </span></a> was another great master of the process; he sometimes created tonal effects by spattering ink on the stone with a toothbrush."

A formidable <i>Portrait of the Artist</i> in the Musée de I'Art Wallon, Liège (another version is in the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kassel) is among the best works given to him, but some critics think it is by his pupil Frans Floris .

They were among the outstanding Italian artists of their time, but their lives are poorly documented&mdash;both are assumed to have died in the Black Death of 1348. Pietro is usually said to have been the elder brother, but the evidence is not conclusive. His first dated work is of 1320&ndash;a <a href=""entry://polyptych""><span class=""links"">polyptych</span></a> of <i>The Virgin and Child with Saints</i> in the Pieve di Sta Maria at Arezzo; Ambrogio's earliest reliably attibuted work is of a year earlier&mdash;a <i>Virgin and Child</i> for a church at Vico I'Abate (Museo Diocesano, Florence). Apart from collaborating in a cycle on the <i>Life of Mary</i>, which they painted in fresco on the façade of Siena's public hospital in 1335 (now lost), the brothers worked independently. They shared a certain affinity of style, however, the weightiness of their figures showing the influence of <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto</span></a> and clearly setting them apart from the elegance of their greatest Sienese contemporary, <a href=""entry://Simone Martini ""><span class=""links"">Simone Martini </span></a>. Ambrogio was the more innovative of the brothers, and his greatest work, the fresco series representing <i>Good and Bad Government</i> in the Town Hall at Siena (1338&ndash;9), is one of the most remarkable achievements in 14th-cent. Italian art. In it he broke new ground in the naturalistic painting of landscape and townscape, and the talkative crowds of figures show he was an acute observer of his fellow men. Ambrogio's other dated work includes altarpieces of <i>The Presentation in the Temple</i> (Uffizi, Florence, 1342) and <i>The Annunciation</i> (Pinacoteca, Siena, 1344). Pietro's work is noted for its emotional expressiveness, his fresco of <i>The Descent from the Cross</i> in the Lower Church of S. Francesco at Assisi having remarkable pathos and dramatic power. The extent and the date of Pietro's contribution at Assisi are matters of controversy, but his other work includes dated altarpieces of <i>The Virgin and Child Enthroned</i> (Uffizi, 1340) and <i>The Birth of the Virgin</i> (Cathedral Museum, Siena, 1342)."

According to <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Ridolfi, Carlo""><span class=""links"">Ridolfi </span></a>, he trained with <a href=""entry://Giorgione ""><span class=""links"">Giorgione</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a> in the studio of Giovanni <a href=""entry://Bellini""><span class=""links"">Bellini </span></a>, but he worked in many places apart from Venice, had an idiosyncratic style, and stands somewhat apart from the central Venetian tradition. In 1508&ndash;12 he was in Rome, then lived mainly in Bergamo until 1526, when he returned to Venice. From 1530 he worked mainly in various towns in the Marches, and in 1554, when he was partially blind, he became a lay-brother at the monastery at Loreto, where he died. His rootless existence reflects his anxious, difficult temperament and his work is extremely uneven. It draws on a wide variety of sources, from Northern Europe as well as Italy, but at the same time shows acute freshness of observation. He is now perhaps best known for his portraits, in which he often conveys a mood of psychological unrest (<i>Young Man in his Study</i>, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), but he worked mainly as a religious painter. An outstanding example of how original and poetic his altarpieces could be is <i>The Annunciation</i> in the church of Sta Maria sopra Mercanti at Recanati&mdash;a bizarre and captivating work full of brilliant colours and lighting effects, odd expressions and poses, and unusual and beautifully painted details, including a startled cat."
"Louis, Morris","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Louis, Morris</b>
<i>(Morris Louis Bernstein )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1912&ndash;62).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, a major pioneer of the movement from <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a> to Colour Stain painting (see <a href=""entry://Colour Field painting""><span class=""links"">COLOUR FIELD PAINTING</span></a>). Almost all his career was spent first in Baltimore and then from 1947 in nearby Washington. He isolated himself from the New York art world, concentrating on his own experiments and supporting himself by teaching. However, it was a visit to New York in 1953 with Kenneth <a href=""entry://Noland, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Noland </span></a> that led to the breakthrough in his art. He and Noland went to Helen <a href=""entry://Frankenthaler, Helen""><span class=""links"">Frankenthaler's </span></a> studio, where they were immensely impressed by her painting <i>Mountains and Sea</i>, and Louis immediately began experimenting with her technique of applying liquid paint on to unprimed canvas, allowing it to flow over and soak into the canvas so that it acted as a stain and not as an overlaid surface of pigment. He was secretive about his technical methods and it is uncertain how he achieved his control over the flow of colour, but towards the end of his life he suffered from chronic back problems caused by his constant bending and stooping over the canvas. Whatever his technique, the effect was to create suave and radiant flushes of colour, with no sense of brush gesture or hint of figuration. His method was exacting, allowing no possibility for alteration or modification. For this reason, perhaps, Louis destroyed much of his work of this period.<br class=""nLine"" />Louis painted various series of pictures in his new technique, the first of which was <i>Veils</i> (1954; he did another series in 1957&ndash;60). The other major series were <i>Florals</i> (1959&ndash;60), <i>Unfurleds</i> (1960&ndash;1), and <i>Stripes</i> (1961&ndash;2). The <i>Veils</i> consist of subtly billowing and overlapping shapes filling almost the entire canvas, but his development after that was towards rivulets of colour arranged in rainbow-like bands, often on a predominantly bare canvas. It was not until 1959 that his career began to take off and he had little time to enjoy his success before dying of lung cancer. However, his reputation now stands very high and he has had enormous influence on the development of Colour Stain painting. In the introduction to the catalogue of the 1974 Arts Council exhibition of his work, John Elderfield wrote: ‘Morris Louis is one of the very few artists whose work has really changed the course of painting
With Louis, fully autonomous abstract painting came into its own for really the first time, and did so in paintings of a quality that matches the level of their innovation.’"
"Louvre","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Louvre</b>, Paris.<div class=""content"">The national museum and art gallery of France, an epitome of the nation's history and culture. The first building on the site, begun <i>c.</i>1190 by Philip-Augustus as a fortress and arsenal, held the royal treasures of jewels, armour, illuminated manuscripts, etc. It was enlarged and beautified by Charles V (reigned 1364&ndash;80), and his successor Charles VI used it as a residence for visiting royalty. Francis I began to demolish it in the 1520s and in 1546 commissioned the architect Pierre Lescot to build a new palace of four wings around a square court, roughly of the same size as the old castle and on the same site. Only the west and half of the south wings were completed by Lescot, but his work forms the heart of the present vast structure, and his elegant and sophisticated <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> style set the tone for all the future additions, which were made by virtually every French monarch up to Napoleon III. Under Louis XIV the royal collection increased from some 200 pictures to over 2,000. In support of the policy for state control of the arts and taste, some of the king's pictures were opened to public view in the Louvre from 1681 and the exhibitions of the new Académie were held there from 1673. The court had moved into the Louvre in 1652, but it transferred to Versailles in 1678. Under Louis XVI the conversion of the Grande Galerie into a museum was begun and as a result of the democratic fervour incidental to the Revolution the Louvre was opened as the first national public gallery in 1793 (though as a public gallery it was preceded by others, including the <a href=""entry://Ashmolean Museum""><span class=""links"">Ashmolean</span></a> in Oxford and the <a href=""entry://Vatican Museums""><span class=""links"">Vatican</span></a>). Napoleon renamed the Louvre the Musée Napoléon in 1803 and exhibited there the works of art he had gathered from conquered territories. Most were restored after his fall from power. The Louvre was reopened by Napoleon III in 1851 with the addition of the <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens's</span></a> Medici cycle from the Luxembourg Palace. In addition to one of the world's greatest collections of paintings, the Louvre houses many other treasures, including large holdings of Greek and Roman antiquities. Among the famous ancient statues are the <i><a href=""entry://Borghese Warrior""><span class=""links"">Borghese Warrior</i></a></span>, the <i><a href=""entry://Venus de Milo""><span class=""links"">Venus de Milo</i></a></span>, and the <i><a href=""entry://Victory of Samothrace""><span class=""links"">Victory of Samothrace</i></a></span>. To relieve congestion after the Second World War a special museum for Impressionist art was formed at the Jeu de Paume in the gardens of the Tuileries. The paintings from the Jeu de Paume, together with certain other works from the Louvre, have now been moved to the Musée d'Orsay in Paris (opened 1986), which is devoted to the art of the late 19th cent., <i>c.</i>1848&ndash;<i>c.</i>1905."
"Lowry, L. S.","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Lowry, L. S.</b>
<i>(Laurence Stephen )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1887&ndash;1976).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter. He lived all his life in or near Manchester (mainly in Salford) and worked as a rent collector and clerk for a property company until he retired in 1952. His painting was done mainly at night after his day's work, but he was not a <a href=""entry://naïve art""><span class=""links"">naïve</span></a> painter, having studied intermittently at art schools from 1905 to 1925. The most important of his teachers&mdash;at Manchester School of Art&mdash;was Adolphe Valette (1876&ndash;1942), a French painter who settled in Manchester in 1905 and whose work includes some memorably atmospheric views of the city. Lowry, too, concentrated on urban subjects, developing a highly distinctive type of picture featuring firmly drawn backgrounds of industrial buildings bathed in a white haze, against which groups or crowds of figures, painted in his characteristic stick-like manner, move about their affairs isolated in an intensely individual, personal life. There is sometimes an element of humour, but his paintings generally embody a disquieting vision, revealing a sense of alienation and man's inconsequence against the juggernaut of industrialism (he was a solitary character and said ‘Had I not been lonely I should not have seen what I did’). Although he achieved national recognition with an exhibition at the Reid and Lefevre Gallery in London in 1939, he remained an elusive figure until a large retrospective exhibition arranged by the Arts Council in 1966 (he led a spartan existence and had no great desire to exhibit or sell his pictures). Ten years later, a few months after his death, a comprehensive retrospective exhibition of his work at the Royal Academy brought considerable divergence of opinion among critics. Some thought of him as a great artist with an important original vision. Others represented him as a very minor talent, although interesting as a social commentator."
"Lucas van Leyden","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Lucas van Leyden </b><div class=""content""><i>(1494?&ndash;1533).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Netherlandish engraver and painter, born and mainly active in Leiden. He was the pupil of his father, from whose hand no works are known, and of Cornelis <a href=""entry://Engelbrechtsz ., Cornelis""><span class=""links"">Engelbrechtsz </span></a>, but both of these were painters whereas Lucas himself was principally an engraver. Where he learnt engraving is unknown, but he was highly skilled in that art at a very early age; the earliest known print by him (<i>Mohammed and the Murdered Monk</i>) dates from 1508, when he was perhaps only 14, yet reveals no trace of immaturity in inspiration or technique. In 1514 he entered the Painters' Guild at Leiden. He seems to have travelled a certain amount, and visits are recorded to Antwerp in 1521, the year of <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer's </span></a> Netherlandish journey, and to Middelburg in 1527, when he met <a href=""entry://Gossaert, Jan""><span class=""links"">Gossaert </span></a>. An unbroken series of dated engravings makes it possible to follow his career as a print-maker and to date many of his paintings, but no clear pattern of stylistic development emerges. Dürer was the single greatest influence on him, but Lucas was less intellectual in his approach, tending to concentrate on the anecdotal features of the subject and to take delight in <a href=""entry://caricature""><span class=""links"">caricatures</span></a> and <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> motifs. Van <a href=""entry://Mander, Karel van""><span class=""links"">Mander </span></a> characterizes Lucas as a pleasure-loving dilettante, who sometimes worked in bed, but he left a large <i>œuvre</i>, in spite of his fairly early death, and must have been a prodigious worker. Lucas had a great reputation in his day (<a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> even rated him above Dürer) and is universally regarded as one of the greatest figures in the history of <a href=""entry://graphic art""><span class=""links"">graphic art</span></a> (he made etchings and woodcuts as well as engravings and was a prolific draughtsman). His status as a painter is less elevated, but he was undoubtedly one of the outstanding Netherlandish painters of his period. He was a pioneer of the Netherlandish genre tradition, as witness his <i>Chess Players</i> (Staatliche Museen, Berlin)&mdash;which actually represents a variant game called ‘courier’&mdash;and his <i>Card Players</i> (Wilton House, Wiltshire), while his celebrated <i>Last Judgement</i>
<a href=""entry://triptych""><span class=""links"">triptych</span></a> (Lakenhal Museum, Leiden, 1526&ndash;7) shows the heights to which he could rise as a religious painter. It eloquently displays his vivid imaginative powers, his marvellous skill as a colourist and his deft and fluid brushwork. Lucas left no pupils or direct followers, but his work was a stimulus to an even greater Leiden-born artist, <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt</span></a>."

Little is known of his life, but his prolific output indicates that he must have enjoyed a successful career (he was unusual among Leonardo's followers in that he painted numerous frescos as well as easel pictures). Luini sentimentalized Leonardo's style, and this helped to win him great popularity with the Victorians. His work is well represented in the Brera in Milan and many of his frescos and altarpieces are in Lombard churches. He painted mythological as well as religious subjects, an example being <i>Cephalus and Procris</i> in the National Gallery, Washington. Luini's best work is of high quality, but he ran a busy workship and some of his followers and copyists vulgarized his style into almost a parody of Leonardo, with sickly smirks and exaggerated <a href=""entry://chiaroscuro""><i><span class=""links"">chiaroscuro</i></span></a>."

A flamboyant character who identified himself with the poorer classes and made a pose of bohemianism, he was much given to tall tales and sometimes posed as ‘Lusty Luks’, an ex-boxer. His work was uneven and unpredictable. It had vigour and spontaneity but often lapsed into superficial vitality. One of his best-known works is <i>The Wrestlers</i> (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1905), which shows his preference for earthy themes and admiration for the bravura painterly technique of artists such as <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a>.

"Luminism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Luminism</b>.<div class=""content"">Term coined in 1954 by John Baur, director of the Whitney Museum in New York, to describe an aspect of mid 19th cent. American landscape painting in which the study of light was paramount. He defined Luminism as ‘a polished and meticulous realism in which there is no sign of brushwork and no trace of impressionism, the atmospheric effects being achieved by infinitely careful gradations of tone, by the most exact study of the relative clarity of near and far objects, and by a precise rendering of the variations in texture and color produced by direct or reflected rays’ (‘American Luminism’, <i>Perspectives USA</i>, Autumn 1954). At their most characteristic, Luminist paintings are concerned chiefly with the depiction of water and sky. Leading Luminists included <a href=""entry://Bingham, George Caleb""><span class=""links"">Bingham </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Durand, Asher B.""><span class=""links"">Durand </span></a>, and aspects of it can be seen in the work of the <a href=""entry://Hudson River School""><span class=""links"">Hudson River School</span></a>.

"Lurçat, Jean","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Lurçat, Jean</b><div class=""content""><i>(1892&ndash;1966).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter and designer. For a time he was influenced by <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, but more important and lasting influences on his painting came from his extensive travels during the 1920s in the Mediterranean countries. North Africa, and the Middle East. His pictures were dominated by impressions of desert landscapes, reminiscences of Spanish and Greek architecture, and a love of fantasy that led him to join the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealist</span></a> movement for a short period in the 1930s. Lurçat is chiefly remembered, however, for his work in the revival of the art of tapestry in both design and technique. His designs combined exalted themes from human history with fantastic representations of the vegetable and insect worlds, and he succeeded in reconciling the stylizations of medieval religious tapestry with modern modes of abstraction. In 1939 he was appointed designer to the tapestry factory at Aubusson and together with Marcel Gromaire (1892&ndash;1971) he brought about a renaissance in its work. He made more than a thousand designs, the most famous probably being the huge <i>Apocalypse</i> for the church of Notre-Dame-de-Toute-Grâce at Assy (1948). From 1930 onwards he did a number of coloured lithographs, stage designs, and book illustrations, and in the 1960s he renewed his painting activities. Lurçat also wrote poetry and books on tapestry."
"lyrical abstraction","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>lyrical abstraction</b>.<div class=""content"">A rather vague term, used differently by different writers, applied to a type of expressive but non-violent abstract painting flourishing particularly in the 1950s and 1960s; the term seems to have been coined by the French painter Georges <a href=""entry://Mathieu, Georges""><span class=""links"">Mathieu </span></a>, who spoke of ‘abstraction lyrique’ in 1947.

"Lysippus","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Lysippus</b>.<div class=""content"">Greek sculptor from Sicyon, active in the middle and later 4th cent. BC. He was one of the most famous of Greek sculptors, with a long and prolific career (he worked from perhaps as early as <i>c.</i>360 BC to as late as <i>c.</i>305 BC and <a href=""entry://Pliny the Elder""><span class=""links"">Pliny</span></a> said he made 1,500 works&mdash;all in bronze), but nothing is known to survive from his own hand. However, there are numerous Roman copies that can be said with a fair measure of certainty to reproduce his works, the best and most reliable being the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> (a young athlete scraping himself with a strigil) in the Vatican Museum. The figure is tall and slender, bearing out the tradition current in antiquity that Lysippus introduced a new scheme of proportions for the human body to supersede that of <a href=""entry://Polyclitus""><span class=""links"">Polyclitus</span></a>, and the pose&mdash;with one arm outstretched&mdash;is novel. Lysippus was famous also for his portraits of Alexander the Great, who is said to have let no other sculptor portray him; many copies survive, including examples in the British Museum, London, and the Louvre, Paris. Among his other works was a colossal statue of Hercules at Sicyon, which was probably the original of the celebrated <i><a href=""entry://Farnese Hercules""><span class=""links"">Farnese Hercules</i></a></span> in the Archaeological Museum in Naples. It shows the realism that was said to be another hallmark of his work. Of the works associated with him on stylistic grounds, the best-known is a bronze statue of a victorious athlete found in the Adriatic Sea in 1964. This was bought by the Getty Museum, Malibu, in 1977 for $3,900,000, then the highest price ever paid for a piece of sculpture, and it is now sometimes known as ‘the Getty Victor’. Even from the second-hand evidence that survives, it is clear that Lysippus was an outstandingly original sculptor whose stylistic innovations, like those of his great contemporary <a href=""entry://Praxiteles ""><span class=""links"">Praxiteles</span></a>, became common currency in the Greek world; J. J. Pollitt (<i>Art in the Hellenistic Age</i>, 1986) describes him as ‘probably the single most creative and influential artist of the entire <a href=""entry://Hellenistic""><span class=""links"">Hellenistic</span></a> period’."

He trained in Budapest, Munich, and Paris (at the <a href=""entry://académie""><i><span class=""links"">Académie</i></span></a> Julian) and already had an international reputation as a society portraitist when he moved to England. There his career continued in its successful course, his sitters including Edward VII and numerous members of the aristocracy (examples are in the NPG, London). According to the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, he had ‘a pleasing, courteous, and exuberant manner, and was very popular in society’. He was a fast and fluent worker and his style was elegant but superficial."
"Léger, Fernand","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Léger, Fernand</b><div class=""content""><i>(1881&ndash;1955).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter and designer. From <i>c.</i>1909 he participated in the <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a> movement. He is generally considered one of its major masters, but his curvilinear and tubular forms (he was for a time called a ‘tubist’) contrasted with the fragmented forms preferred by <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Braque, Georges""><span class=""links"">Braque </span></a>. The First World War, during which he was gassed whilst serving as a stretcher-bearer, had a profound, effect on Léger. His contact with men of different social classes and different walks of life came as a revelation: ‘I was abruptly thrust into a reality which was both blinding and new’, he said. Henceforward he made it his ambition to create an art which should be accessible to all ranks of modern society. In 1920 he met <a href=""entry://Le Corbusier ""><span class=""links"">Le Corbusier </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Ozenfant, Amédée""><span class=""links"">Ozenfant </span></a> and in the early 1920s he was associated with their <a href=""entry://Purism""><span class=""links"">Purist</span></a> movement. His paintings were static, with the precise and polished facture of machinery, and he had a fondness for including representations of mechanical parts. During the late 1920s and 1930s he also painted single objects isolated in space and sometimes blown up to gigantic size. In the interwar years he expanded his range beyond easel painting, with murals and designs for the theatre and cinema. He was also busy as a teacher, notably at his own school, the Académie de I'Art Contemporain, and he travelled widely, making three visits to the USA in the 1930s. The connections he had made there stood him in good stead when he lived in America during the Second World War, teaching at Yale University, and at Mills College, California. Acrobats and cyclists were favourite subjects in his paintings of this time. From his return to France in 1945 his painting reflected more prominently his political interest in the working classes. But its static, monumental style remained, with flat, unmodulated colours, heavy black contours, and a continuing concern with the contrast between cylindrical and rectilinear forms. In his later career Léger worked much on large decorative commissions, notably the windows and tapestries for the church at Audincourt (1951). Many honours came to him late in life, and a museum dedicated to him opened at Biot in France in 1957. In the catalogue of the exhibition ‘Léger and Purist Paris’ (Tate Gallery, London, 1970), John Golding wrote of Léger: ‘No other major twentieth-century artist was to react to, and to reflect, such a wide range of artistic currents and movements
And yet he was to remain supremely independent as an artistic personality. Never at any moment in his career could he be described as a follower
But his originality lay basically in his ability to adapt the ideas and to a certain extent even the visual discoveries of others to his own ends.’"

He abandoned the reddish tone of his earlier manner for a wider, lighter, and cooler range (greys and blacks in the shadows instead of brownish tones), and the fashionable portraits he now specialized in were closer to van <a href=""entry://Dyck, Sir Anthony van""><span class=""links"">Dyck </span></a> than to Rembrandt.

<b>Magic(al) Realism</b>.<div class=""content"">Term coined by the German critic Franz Roh in 1925 to describe the aspect of <a href=""entry://Neue Sachlichkeit""><span class=""links"">Neue Sachlichkeit</span></a> characterized by sharp-focus detail. In the book in which he originated the term&mdash;<i>Nach-Expressionismus, Magischer Realismus, Probleme der neuesten Europäischen Malerie</i> (Leipzig, 1925)&mdash;Roh also included a rather mixed bag of non-German painters as ‘Magic Realists’, among them <a href=""entry://Miró, Joan""><span class=""links"">Miró</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>. Subsequently critics have used the term to cover various types of painting in which objects are depicted with photographic naturalism but which, because of paradoxical elements or strange juxtapositions, convey a feeling of unreality, infusing the ordinary with a sense of mystery. The paintings of <a href=""entry://Magritte, René""><span class=""links"">Magritte </span></a> are a prime example. In the English-speaking world the term gained currency with an exhibition entitled ‘American Realists and Magic Realists’ at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1943. The director of the museum, Alfred H. <a href=""entry://Barr, Alfred H., jun.""><span class=""links"">Barr </span></a>, wrote that the term was ‘sometimes applied to the work of painters who by means of an exact realistic technique try to make plausible and convincing their improbable, dreamlike or fantastic visions’."

"Magritte, René","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Magritte, René</b><div class=""content""><i>(1898&ndash;1967).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Belgian painter, one of the leading figures of the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealist</span></a> movement. Apart from three years living in a suburb of Paris (1927&ndash;30), his entire career was spent in Brussels, where he lived a life of bourgeois regularity (the bowler-hatted figure who so often features in his work is to some extent a self-portrait). After initially working in a <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a>-Futurist style, he turned to Surrealism in 1925 under the influence of de <a href=""entry://Chirico, Giorgio de""><span class=""links"">Chirico </span></a> and by the following year had already emerged as a highly individual artist with <i>The Menaced Assassin</i> (MOMA, New York), a picture that displays the startling and disturbing juxtapositions of the ordinary, the strange, and the erotic that were to characterize his work for the rest of his life. Apart from a period in the 1940s when he experimented first with pseudo-<a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> brushwork and then with a <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauve</span></a> technique, he worked in a precise, scrupulously banal manner (a reminder of the early days when he made his living designing wallpaper and drawing fashion advertisements) and he always remained true to Surrealism. <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">Iconographically</span></a> he had a repertory of obsessive images that appeared again and again in ordinary but incongruous surroundings. Enormous rocks that float in the air and fishes with human legs are typical leitmotivs. He repeatedly exploited ambiguities concerning real objects and images of them (many of his works feature paintings within paintings), inside and out-of-doors, day and night. He also made Surrealist analogues of a number of famous paintings&mdash;for example <a href=""entry://David, Jacques-Louis""><span class=""links"">David's </span></a>
<i>Madame Récamier</i> and <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet's </span></a>
<i>The Balcony</i>, in which he replaced the figures with coffins. For the fertility of his imagery, the unforced spontaneity of his effects, and not least his rare gift of humour, Magritte was one of the very few natural and inspired Surrealist painters. J. T. Soby summed this up felicitously when he wrote: ‘In viewing Magritte's paintings
everything seems proper. And then abruptly the rape of commonsense occurs, usually in broad daylight’ (<i>René Magritte</i>, 1965). His work was included in many Surrealist exhibitions, but it was not until he was in his fifties that he began to achieve international success and honours. By the time of his death his work had had a profound influence on <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a> and it has subsequently been widely imitated in advertising."

His early career was spent mainly as a tapestry designer, but he also painted, exhibiting with the <a href=""entry://Nabis""><span class=""links"">Nabis</span></a>. Although he first made sculpture in 1895, it was only in 1900 that he decided to devote himself to it after serious eyestrain made him give up tapestry. In 1902 he had his first one-man exhibition, which drew praise from <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a>; in 1905 came his first conspicuous public success at the <a href=""entry://Salon d'Automne""><span class=""links"">Salon d'Automne</span></a>; and after about 1910 he was internationally famous and received a constant flow of commissions. With only a few exceptions, he restricted himself to the female nude, expressing his whole philosophy of form through this medium. Commissioned in 1905 to make a monument to the revolutionary Louis-Auguste Blanqui, and asked by the committee what form he proposed to give it, he replied: ‘Eh! une femme nue.’ More than any artist before him he brought to conscious realization the concept of sculpture in the round as an independent art form stripped of literary associations and architectural context, and he ranks as the most distinguished figure of the transition from Rodin to the moderns. He rejected Rodin's emotionalism and animated surfaces, however; instead, Maillol's weighty figures, often shown in repose, are solemn and broadly modelled, with simple poses and gestures. His work consciously continued the classical tradition of Greek and Roman sculpture (Maillol visited Greece in 1908), but at the same time has a quality of healthy sensuousness (his peasant wife sometimes modelled for him). Maillol took up painting again in 1939 when he returned to his birthplace, Banyuls, but apart from his sculpture the most important works of his maturity are his book illustrations, which helped reestablish the art of the book in the 1920s and 1930s. His finest achievements in this field are the woodcut illustrations (which he cut himself) for an edition of Virgil's <i>Eclogues</i> (begun 1912 but not published until 1926), which show superb economy of line. Maillol's work is in many important collections of modern art."

He began working in an unexceptional <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionist</span></a> manner, but by 1912 he was painting peasant subjects in a massive ‘tubular’ style similar to that of <a href=""entry://Léger, Fernand""><span class=""links"">Léger </span></a> as well as pictures combining the fragmentation of form of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> with the multiplication of the image of <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a> (<i>The Knife Grinder</i>, Yale Univ. Art Gal., 1912). Malevich, however, was fired with the desire ‘to free art from the burden of the object’ and launched the <a href=""entry://Suprematism""><span class=""links"">Suprematist</span></a> movement, which brought abstract art to a geometric simplicity more radical than anything previously seen. He claimed that he made a picture ‘consisting of nothing more than a black square on a white field’ as early as 1913, but Suprematist paintings were first made public in Moscow in 1915 (there is often difficulty in dating his work and also in knowing which way up his paintings should be hung, photographs of early exhibitions sometimes providing conflicting evidence). Malevich moved away from absolute austerity, tilting rectangles from the vertical, adding more colours and introducing a suggestion of the third dimension and even a degree of painterly handling, but around 1918 he returned to his purest ideals with a series of <i>White on White</i> paintings. After this he seems to have realized he could go no further along this road and virtually gave up abstract painting, turning more to teaching, writing, and making three-dimensional models that were important in the growth of <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivism</span></a>. In 1919, at the invitation of <a href=""entry://Chagall, Marc""><span class=""links"">Chagall </span></a>, he started teaching at the art school at Vitebsk, where he exerted a profound influence on <a href=""entry://Lissitzky, El""><span class=""links"">Lissitzky </span></a>, and in 1922 he moved to Petrograd (Leningrad), where he lived for the rest of his life. He visited Warsaw and Berlin in 1927, accompanying an exhibition of his works and visited the <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a>. In the late 1920s he returned to figurative painting, but he was out of favour with a political system that now demanded <a href=""entry://Socialist Realism""><span class=""links"">Socialist Realism</span></a> from its artists and he ran into trouble with the authorities. However, he remained a revered figure among artists. Malevich wrote various theoretical tracts and several collections of his writings have been published.

In 1921 he settled in Paris, where he continued his Dada activities and then became a member of the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealist</span></a> movement. For several years he earned his living mainly as a fashion and portrait photographer, but he painted regularly again from the mid-1930s. In 1940 he went back to America to escape the Nazi occupation of Paris and settled in Hollywood, then in 1951 returned to Paris, where he died. From the 1940s photography took a secondary place in Man Ray's activities, but it is as a photographer that his reputation is now most secure. In the 1920s and 1930s he was one of the most imaginative artists in this field, particularly for his exploitation of the ‘Rayograph’ (also known as photogram), a photograph produced without a camera by placing objects directly on sensitized paper and exposing them to light, and for his development of the technique of ‘solarization’ (the complete or partial reversal of the tones of a photographic image). He gained an international reputation as one of the most prominent figures of Dada and Surrealism, and several of his ‘objects’ have became icons of the movements, but critics have often been dismissive about his paintings."

<b>Mander, Karel van</b><div class=""content""><i>(1548&ndash;1606).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Netherlandish painter and writer on art, born in Flanders and active mainly in Haarlem. He is sometimes known as the ‘Dutch <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>’, for his fame rests primarily on his work as a biographer of artists, published in <i>Het Schilder Boeck</i> (<i>The Book of Painters</i>) in 1604. The most important part of the book is made up of about 175 biographies of Netherlandish and German artists from <a href=""entry://Eyck, Jan van""><span class=""links"">van Eyck </span></a> to van Mander's own younger contemporaries. This is the first systematic account of the lives of northern European artists, and our only source of information about some of them. The book also contains the lives of Italian artists from <a href=""entry://Cimabue ""><span class=""links"">Cimabue </span></a> up to his own time. Most of this material is a condensed translation into Dutch of Vasari, but it also has valuable information collected by van Mander himself when he was in Italy in 1573&ndash;7 or from friends and correspondents: he was sufficiently up to date to mention <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio </span></a>, ‘who is doing extraordinary things in Rome’. Another part of the book is a long poem that gives practical advice to artists and sums up much of the theory and practice of 16th-cent. Netherlandish art. Van Mander's own pictures, which were mainly religious and allegorical, adopted the elongated forms of the <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerists</span></a>, but his later works showed a tendency towards <a href=""entry://naturalism""><span class=""links"">naturalism</span></a>. With <a href=""entry://Cornelis van Haarlem ""><span class=""links"">Cornelis van Haarlem </span></a> and Hendrick <a href=""entry://Goltzius, Hendrick""><span class=""links"">Goltzius </span></a>, van Mander is said to have founded an academy in Haarlem.

"Manet, Édouard","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Manet, Édouard</b><div class=""content""><i>(1832&ndash;83).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter and graphic artist. He was the son of a senior civil servant in the Ministry of Justice and inherited considerable wealth when his father (who disapproved of his choice of career) died in 1862. His upper middle-class background was important, for although he was cast as an artistic rebel, he always sought traditional honours and success and he cut an impeccable figure as a man-about-town. He entered the studio of <a href=""entry://Couture, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Couture</span></a> in 1850 and remained a pupil there for six years. His own painting style was, however, based mainly on a study of the Old Masters at the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a>, and particularly Spanish painters such as <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez </span></a> (his greatest artistic hero) and <a href=""entry://Ribera, José""><span class=""links"">Ribera </span></a>. During the 1850s he visited museums in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Italy and it is one of the ironies of Manet's career that a painter with such reverence for the art of the past should be so much attacked for his modernity. His first taste of official disfavour came when his first submission to the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a>&mdash;<i>The Absinthe Drinker</i> (Ny Carlsberg Glyptothek, Copenhagen, 1859)&mdash;was rejected. He had two paintings accepted in 1861, but then in 1863 his <i>Déjeuner sur l'herbe</i> (Musée d'Orsay, Paris) caused a scandal. It was turned down by the Salon and was shown instead at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> des Refusés, set up specially for such rejected paintings. Its hostile reception was based on moral as well as aesthetic grounds, for nudity was considered acceptable only if it was sufficiently remote in time or place and this showed a naked woman having a picnic with two contemporary, clothed men. Manet caused even greater outrage two years later when his <i>Olympia</i> (Musée d'Orsay, 1863) was exhibited at the Salon. The reclining nude figure was based on <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian's </span></a>
<i>Venus of Urbino</i> (which Manet had copied in Florence 10 years earlier), but her blatant sexuality was thought an affront to accepted standards of decorum, and one critic wrote ‘Art sunk so low does not even deserve reproach.’ Manet was denounced also for his bold technique, in which he eliminated the fine tonal gradations of academic practice and created vivid contrasts of light and shade: ‘The shadows are indicated by more or less large smears of blacking’, wrote another critic, ‘The least beautiful woman has bones, muscles, skin, and some sort of colour. Here there is nothing.’ From this time, Manet reluctantly found himself acquiring a reputation as a leader of the avant-garde. He was a respected and admired member of the group of young <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>, including <a href=""entry://Monet, Claude""><span class=""links"">Monet </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Bazille, Frédéric""><span class=""links"">Bazille </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Sisley, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Sisley </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a>, who met at the Café Guerbois and elsewhere. But despite their admiration for him, Manet stood somewhat aloof from the group (although he enjoyed going to the races with <a href=""entry://Degas, Edgar""><span class=""links"">Degas </span></a>, who was also from the upper middle class) and did not participate in the Impressionist exhibitions. He did, however, adopt the Impressionist technique of painting out of doors (persuaded by Berthe <a href=""entry://Morisot, Berthe""><span class=""links"">Morisot </span></a>, who became his sister-in-law in 1874), and his work became freer and lighter in the 1870s under their influence. In the late 1870s Manet became ill with a disease diagnosed as locomotor ataxia (associated with the late stages of syphilis), which caused him bouts of great pain and extreme tiredness. Increasingly he preferred to work in pastels, which were less physically demanding than oils, but in his last great painting, <i>A Bar at the Folies-Bergère</i> (Courtauld Inst. Galleries, London, 1882), Manet rose to heights of painterly brilliance that no other 19th-cent. artist surpassed. He died in appalling pain a week after having a gangrenous leg amputated. The official honours he had craved&mdash;in the form of a second-class medal at the Salon and membership of the Legion of Honour&mdash;came too late (1881) to be enjoyed.<br class=""nLine"" />Manet was a varied and complex artist. He painted a great variety of subjects (he was also a skilled etcher and lithographer) and rarely repeated himself. His approach was completely undogmatic and he was reluctant to theorize; his friend Émile Zola wrote of him ‘In beginning a picture, he could never say how it would come-out.’ In spite of the fact that his work often has a feeling of complete freshness and spontaneity, he would often repaint and rework pictures or even cut them into fragments. His greatest strength was with modern-life subjects (he sketched constantly in the boulevards and cafés of Paris), but although he is accused by some critics of having no imagination, of being able to paint something only if he had it in front of him, his pictures are anything but straight transcriptions of nature. They are, indeed, sometimes enigmatic and elusive, as with <i>A Bar at the Folies-Bergère</i>, and seem to be more concerned with the act of painting than with the ostensible subject. It is partly in this freedom from the traditional literary, anecdotal, or moralistic associations of painting that he is seen as one of the founders of ‘modern’ art, and it is significant that the official title of the first <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionist</span></a> Exhibition, organized by Roger <a href=""entry://Fry, Roger""><span class=""links"">Fry </span></a> in 1910&ndash;11, was <i>Manet and the Post-Impressionists</i>."

<b>manière criblée</b>
<i>(or dotted manner)</i>.<div class=""content"">An early type of metal engraving in which dots were stamped with a punch over selected parts of the plate to create a textured effect in those areas, the dots showing as white against the inked background. The technique was not common after the end of the 15th cent., but there was something of a revival in the late 18th cent."
"Mannerism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Mannerism</b>.<div class=""content"">Term used in the study of the visual arts (and by transference in the study of literature and music) with a confused medley of combined historical and critical connotations. Even more than with most stylistic labels, there is little agreement amongst scholars as to its delimitations, and John Shearman begins his book on the subject (<i>Mannerism</i>, 1967) with the frank admission: ‘This book will have at least one feature in common with all those already published on Mannerism; it will appear to describe something quite different from what all the rest describe.’ The word derives from the Italian <i>maniera</i>, meaning ‘style’ or ‘stylishness’, and it was popularized mainly by the writings of <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>, who used it as a term of praise, signifying qualities of grace, poise, facility, and sophistication&mdash;characteristics that are indeed apparent in much of the art that he admired from his own time. From the 17th cent., however, most critics thought that Italian art of Vasari's period marked a decline from the peaks of grandeur and harmony reached during the High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> by <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>, and the term ‘Mannerism’ came to suggest an art characterized by artificiality, superficiality, and exaggeration, feebly plagiarizing and distorting the work of the masters. From being a stylistic label the term expanded its meaning to become a period label, so that ‘Mannerism’ came to designate the era in Italian art between the High Renaissance and the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a>&mdash;that is, from about 1520 to about 1600. The term is still applied mainly to Italian art and architecture, but it is also used of art in other countries.<br class=""nLine"" />It was not until the 20th cent.&mdash;and particularly the period between the two world wars&mdash;that a more sympathetic attitude towards Mannerist art emerged, and the word began to be used neutrally, without the implication of decadence that it had long carried. At this time, after the revolutionary achievements of early 20th-cent. art, Mannerist art was looked at with new eyes, and the work of artists who had long been ignored or disparaged began to seem exciting and original to modern taste. The qualities associated with Mannerist art include tension, emotionalism, elongation of the human figure, strained poses, unusual or bizarre effects of scale, lighting, or perspective, and vivid&mdash;sometimes harsh or lurid&mdash;colours. Often the subject is approached in an unconventional way, with the artist drawing attention to his own learning or virtuosity. In the hands of the greatest Mannerist artists (for example <a href=""entry://Pontormo""><span class=""links"">Pontormo</span></a> or <a href=""entry://Parmigianino ""><span class=""links"">Parmigianino </span></a>) such preoccupations led to works that are not only highly sophisticated but also powerful, disturbing, and moving. The work of less accomplished Mannerists (for example Vasari as a painter) often degenerated, however, into insipid or frenzied gesturing and grimacing.<br class=""nLine"" />With Mannerism no longer receiving blanket condemnation, more subtle issues occupied the minds of historians, for example to what extent the term could be applied to art outside Italy (e.g. El <a href=""entry://Greco, El""><span class=""links"">Greco </span></a> in Spain, Romanist painters in the Netherlands, the École de <a href=""entry://Fontainebleau, School of""><span class=""links"">Fontainebleau</span></a> in France, and <a href=""entry://Hilliard, Nicholas""><span class=""links"">Hilliard </span></a> in England) or to architecture (where what might be taken in one context as playful or capricious disregard for the rules of classical architecture might in another be regarded as provincial clumsiness). While some critics wish to expand the use of the term, others wish to contract it, and still others seek to distinguish what they regard as the central elements of the style within the general period label by using the term <i>‘maniera’</i>. The following sentence from S. J. Freedberg's <i>Painting in Italy</i>: 1500&ndash;1600 (1971) in the Pelican History of Art series shows how potentially bewildering the terminology can be: ‘The first generation of Mannerism, its inventors, thus could achieve <i>maniera</i>, but this requires to be distinguished not only chronologically but in degree and in some respects of kind from the “high Maniera” or Maniera proper.’ Thus while the term ‘Mannerism’ can generally be taken to imply an elegant, refined, artificial, self-conscious, and courtly style, the shade of meaning to be attached to it varies very much according to the context and the outlook of the writer using it."

One of his best-known works is the gilded bronze <i>Prometheus</i> (1933) in Rockefeller Center Plaza, New York. Manship was also an excellent portraitist.

"Mantegna, Andrea","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Mantegna, Andrea</b><div class=""content""><i>(1431&ndash;1506).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter. He was the pupil and adopted son of <a href=""entry://Squarcione, Francesco""><span class=""links"">Squarcione </span></a> in Padua, growing up in a humanist atmosphere that was to colour his whole approach to art. Squarcione exploited his pupils for his own ends and at the age of 17 Mantegna gave an early indication of his formidable strength of character by taking him to court and forcing him to recognize his independence. He was remarkably precocious, and the distinctive style he created at the beginning of his career changed little over the next half century. It was a style characterized by sharp clarity of drawing, colouring, and lighting, a passion for archaeology that fed on the abundance of <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> remains in northern Italy, and a mastery of *perspective and foreshortening unequalled in the 15th cent. These qualities were apparent in his first major commission (1448), the decoration of the Ovetari Chapel of the Eremitani Church in Padua with frescos on the lives of SS. Christopher and James (almost totally destroyed in the Second World War) and they can be seen in the celebrated <i>Agony in the Garden</i> (NG, London, <i>c.</i>1455).<br class=""nLine"" />In 1460 Mantegna was appointed court painter to Ludovico <a href=""entry://Gonzaga""><span class=""links"">Gonzaga </span></a> at Mantua, and apart from a visit to Rome in 1488&ndash;90 he remained there for the rest of his life. Mantegna was held in the highest esteem by Ludovico, by his son and successor Federico, and by Isabella d'<a href=""entry://Este""><span class=""links"">Este</span></a>, who married Federico's successor, Francesco. At this time Mantua was rising to take its place among the leading centres of humanist culture in Europe, and Mantegna glorified the Gonzaga family and court in his most famous work&mdash;the fresco decoration of the Camera degli Sposi (Bridal Chamber) in the Ducal Palace (completed 1474). Group portraits of the Gonzaga family, arranged in various courtly scenes, line the walls and above them are bust medallions of the Caesars, indicating that the reigning house was worthy of the Roman Empire. The most remarkable feature of the room, however, is the <a href=""entry://illusionism""><span class=""links"">illusionistic</span></a> painting of the architecture (particularly of the ceiling), which appears to extend the real space of the room. This was the first time since antiquity that such a scheme had been carried out and Mantegna's work became the foundation for much subsequent decorative painting. Mantegna's other great work for the Gonzaga was his series of nine paintings on the <i>Triumph of Caesar</i> (Hampton Court, London, <i>c.</i>1480&ndash;95)&mdash;it is often said that they were done for Francesco, but in fact it is not known which member of the family commissioned them. These large and fragile canvases have suffered dreadfully at the hands of ‘restorers’ in former centuries, but they were successfully cleaned in the 1960s and 1970s, and although they are battered and faded they still give a maravellous picture of Mantegna's magnificent powers of invention and design and rank alongside <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael's</span></a> tapestry <a href=""entry://cartoon""><span class=""links"">cartoons</span></a> as one of the greatest ensembles of <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> art outside Italy.<br class=""nLine"" />Mantegna was an engraver as well as a painter and was one of the first artists to use prints to disseminate his compositions. He also designed his own house in Mantua, and it is generally thought that he modelled the bronze bust of himself in his memorial chapel in the church of S. Andrea. At his death he was a venerated figure and his fame has never declined. His influence was profound, not only on Italian artists such as his brother-in-law Giovanni <a href=""entry://Bellini""><span class=""links"">Bellini </span></a>, but also, for example, on <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a>, one of the many northern artists who found his version of the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> particularly easy to assimilate."

At the age of 11, he was apprenticed to a wood-carver, then to a gilder and stucco-worker, but he was virtually self-taught as an artist. His early work was influenced by Egyptian and Etruscan art, but then he turned to a more <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionistic</span></a> style owing much to the example of <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a> and Medardo <a href=""entry://Rosso, Medardo""><span class=""links"">Rosso </span></a>. In the 1940s he simplified his style, so that although the surface of his work is often animated, the feeling it produces is one of classic calm. Manzù worked much on religious subjects (including numerous figures of cardinals), and is celebrated above all for the set of bronze doors he made for St Peter's in Rome after winning an international competition in 1950 (they were not completed until 1964). In 1958 he also completed a set of doors for Salzburg Cathedral and in 1968 one for the church of St Laurence in Rotterdam. His work shows the possibility of producing sculpture that fits within a traditional religious context and yet is in a modern and personal idiom.

<b>marble</b>.<div class=""content"">Word loosely applied to any hard limestone that can be sawn into thin slabs and will take a good polish so that it is suitable for decorative work; more strictly, it refers to metamorphosed limestones whose structure has been recrystallized by heat or pressure. Marbles are widely disseminated and occur in a great variety of colours and patterns, but certain types have been particularly prized by sculptors.

In 1910 he entered into a close friendship with <a href=""entry://Macke, August""><span class=""links"">Macke</span></a>, who introduced him to the Expressionist use of colour. Through Macke he joined the <a href=""entry://Neue Künstlervereinigung München""><span class=""links"">Neue Künstlervereinigung</span></a> at Munich and found in <a href=""entry://Kandinsky, Wassily""><span class=""links"">Kandinsky </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Jawlensky, Alexei von""><span class=""links"">Jawlensky</span></a> men of congenial artistic views. With them he founded the <a href=""entry://Blaue Reiter, Der""><span class=""links"">Blaue Reiter</span></a> group in 1911. Marc was of a deeply religious disposition (in 1906 he visited Mt. Athos in Greece with its famous monasteries) and was troubled by a profound spiritual malaise; through painting he sought to uncover mystical inner forces that animate nature. His ideas were expressed most intensely in paintings of animals, for he believed that they were both more beautiful and more spiritual than man. Using non-naturalistic symbolic colour and simplified, rhythmic shapes, he tried to paint animals not as we see them, but as they feel their own existence (<i>Blue Horses</i>, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, 1911). In 1912 Marc met <a href=""entry://Delaunay, Robert""><span class=""links"">Delaunay</span></a> in Paris and was influenced by the <a href=""entry://Orphism""><span class=""links"">Orphist</span></a> experiments in the abstract use of colour. The culminating work of this period was <i>Animal Destinies</i> (Kunstmuseum, Basle, 1913), which uses panic-stricken animals to symbolize a world on the edge of destruction; on the back of the picture he wrote: ‘Und alles sein ist flammend leid’ (And all being is flaming suffering). By 1914, under the influence partly of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a>, his paintings had become still more abstract, losing almost entirely any representational content, as in <i>Fighting Forms</i> (Neue Pinakothek, Munich, 1914), an image of convulsive fury.

The <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a> also made a great impact on him. Responding especially to German <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a>, and the planimetric structure of the late work of <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a>, he developed a distinctive semi-abstract style that he used most characteristically in powerful watercolours of city life and the Maine coast (where he often painted in the summer). His oil paintings (which became more important in his work from the 1930s) are often similar in effect to watercolours, leaving parts of the canvas bare. Marin also made etchings, especially early in his career. From the 1920s he enjoyed a high reputation. He was an individualist, belonging to no movement, and one of the finest watercolourists of the 20th cent."

During the 1930s he travelled widely in Europe and also visited the USA. Although his travels brought him into contact with many distinguished artists, Marini did not ally himself with any avant-garde movements, remaining essentially isolated in his artistic aims. Working mainly in bronze, he concentrated on a few favourite themes, most notably the Horse and Rider, a subject in which he seemed to express an obscure but poignant tragic symbolism. He also made numerous portrait busts, remarkable for their psychological penetration and sensuous exploitation of the surface qualities of the material. Often he <a href=""entry://polychrome""><span class=""links"">polychromed</span></a> his bronzes, sometimes working with corrosive dyes. In the 1940s he took up painting seriously, many of his pictures being near abstracts. There is a Marini museum in Milan, where he spent much of his career, and his work is represented in many major collections of modern art."

<b>Marinus van Reymerswaele </b><div class=""content""><i>(active <span class=""italic"">c.</i>1509&ndash; d. after 1567).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Netherlandish painter, presumably from Roymerswaele in Zeeland. He specialized in two types of picture, both with more or less life-size half-length figures: representations of St Jerome in his study (seemingly deriving from <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a>) and <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes of bankers, usurers, misers, and tax-collectors. The genre scenes show the sin of avarice and the vanity of earthly possessions; according to a Flemish proverb a banker, a usurer, a tax-collector, and a miller were the four evangelists of the devil. These paintings must have been very popular, for they exist in numerous versions and copies, but it is not known what kind of clientele bought pictures of such unpleasant characters, grotesquely presented in a manner deriving (via <a href=""entry://Massys ""><span class=""links"">Massys </span></a>) from <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo's</span></a>

He was a newspaper illustrator in the 1920s, but became well known for his pictures depicting the shabbiness and tawdriness of city life in New York (<i>Tattoo and Haircut</i>, Art Institute of Chicago, 1932). He was also capable of bitter satire against the smug complacency of the wealthy, but in general his work shows a love of depicting teeming life through ugly but colourful subjects rather than a desire for social protest. His aim was to depict contemporary life in the manner of the Old Masters and he worked mainly in <a href=""entry://tempera""><span class=""links"">tempera</span></a>, also experimenting with other venerable techniques.

He caught the public imagination with spectacular paintings such as <i>Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still</i> (United Grand Lodge of Great Britain, London, 1816), the work that made him famous, and in 1821 <a href=""entry://Lawrence, Sir Thomas""><span class=""links"">Lawrence </span></a> referred to him as ‘the most popular painter of the day’. His work was indeed truly popular, for he made his living mainly through the sale of engravings of his pictures rather than the paintings themselves. He became famous in France as well as Britain, he was knighted by Leopold I of Belgium (1833), and his influence was felt by American artists such as <a href=""entry://Cole, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Cole </span></a>. However, while he pleased a vast audience and was regarded by some admirers as one of the greatest geniuses who ever lived, Martin was reviled by <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a> and other critics, who considered his work vulgar sensationalism. Few artists, indeed, have been subject to such extremes of critical fortune, and his fame sank to such an astonishing degree after his death that very large and once famous paintings by him were sold in the 1930s for as little as £2. In the 1970s his reputation greatly revived. Martin made mezzotints not only as a means of reproducing his paintings but also as original compositions. Particularly noteworthy are his illustrations to the Bible and John Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, which show that although he had great weaknesses as an artist, especially in his drawing of the human figure, he also had a vividness and grandiloquence of imagination not unworthy of such elevated subjects. He is sometimes called ‘Mad Martin’, but the sobriquet is undeserved and applies more to his brother Jonathan, who was insane and set fire to York Minister. John Martin was eminently sane and in the 1830s almost bankrupted himself with extremely ambitious but entirely practical plans for improving the water supply and sewage system of London. They were unsuccessful, but reveal a heroic desire to put the architectural visions of his paintings into a concrete form. His work is best represented in the Tate Gallery, London, and the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne."

"Masaccio","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Masaccio </b>
<i>(Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Mone )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1401&ndash;28).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter. Although he died in his mid-twenties he brought about a revolution in painting and he ranks alongside his friends <a href=""entry://Alberti, Leon Battista""><span class=""links"">Alberti </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Brunelleschi, Filippo""><span class=""links"">Brunelleschi </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello </span></a> as one of the founding fathers of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. His affectionate nickname, which may be translated as ‘Sloppy Tom’, was given to him, so <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> says, because he was so devoted to art that ‘he refused to give any time to worldly causes, even to the way he dressed’. He became a guild member in Florence in 1422, but nothing is known of his training, the tradition that he was taught by <a href=""entry://Masolino da Panicalec ""><span class=""links"">Masolino</span></a>, later his collaborator, now being discounted. The earliest work attributed to him is the San Giovenale <a href=""entry://triptych""><span class=""links"">Triptych</span></a> (Uffizi, Florence, 1422), which is somewhat uncouth but reveals a totally individual spirit in its rejection of all <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> elegance and concentration on the weight and bulk of the figures. Instead of learning from contemporary painters, Masaccio looked back to <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto</span></a> for inspiration, recapturing the gravity and grandeur that characterized his work. But whereas Giotto set his figures in space intuitively, Masaccio grappled with and solved the problem of creating a completely coherent and consistent sense of three dimensions on a two-dimensional surface, his work thus becoming one of the cornerstones of European painting. His enormous achievement was based on his mastery of the new science of <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a> and his use of a single constant light source to define the construction of the body and its draperies. Among contemporary artists he was closest in spirit to Donatello. Both artists were less concerned with surface appearances and isolated detail than with the underlying construction of objects and both excelled at the depiction of emotion with great force and directness. Masaccio has left three great works to posterity in which he enunciated his new principles: a <a href=""entry://polyptych""><span class=""links"">polyptych</span></a> (1426) for the Carmelite church in Pisa (the central panel is in the National Gallery in London, and other parts in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, the Getty Museum, Malibu, the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples, and the Museo Nazionale, Pisa); a fresco cycle, done in collaboration with Masolino, on the life of St Peter (with additional scenes of <i>The Temptation</i> and <i>The Expulsion from Paradise</i>) in the Brancacci Chapel of Sta Maria del Carmine, Florence (<i>c.</i>1425&ndash;8); and a fresco of the <i>Trinity</i> in Sta Maria Novella, Florence (probably 1428). Masaccio went to Rome in 1428, leaving the frescos in the Brancacci Chapel unfinished, and died so suddenly that Vasari said ‘there were some who even suspected he had been poisoned’. Vasari adds that ‘during his lifetime he had made only a modest name for himself’, and certainly many of his Florentine contemporaries and successors were unmoved by his innovations. He was a great inspiration to the progressive masters of the next generation, however (Filippo <a href=""entry://Lippi, Filippino""><span class=""links"">Lippi </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Piero della Francesca ""><span class=""links"">Piero della Francesca </span></a>), and Vasari records a whole roster of great artists, including <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>, who studied his work with profit."

His career is closely linked to that of <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a>, but the exact nature of the association remains ill-defined. The tradition that he was Masaccio's master is now dismissed, for he became a guild member in Florence only in 1423 (a year after Masaccio) and although he was appreciably the older man it was he who was influenced by Masaccio rather than the other way round. They are thought to have collaborated on <i>The Madonna and Child with St Anne</i> (Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1425), but the major undertaking on which they worked together was the decoration of the Brancacci Chapel of Sta Maria del Carmine in Florence. Masolino's style was softer than Masaccio's and there is a fair measure of agreement about the division of hands. After Masaccio's death Masolino reverted to the more decorative style he had practised earlier in his career. At his best he was a painter of great distinction, his masterpiece perhaps being the fresco of the <i>Baptism of Christ</i> (<i>c.</i>1435) in the Baptistery at Castiglione d'Olona, near Como, a graceful and lyrical work that is a world away from Masaccio's <i>Baptism of the Neophytes</i> in the Brancacci Chapel."

In the early 1920s he was influenced by <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, but in 1924 he joined the Surrealist movement and remained a member until 1929, when he left in protest against <a href=""entry://Breton, André""><span class=""links"">Breton's </span></a> authoritarian leadership. His work belonged to the spontaneous, expressive, semi-abstract variety of Surrealism, and included experiments with automatic drawings (see <a href=""entry://automatism""><span class=""links"">AUTOMATISM</span></a>), chance effects, and the incorporation of sand in his paintings. Themes of metamorphosis, violence, psychic pain, and eroticism dominated his work. In 1934&ndash;6 he lived in Spain until the Civil War drove him back to France and in 1941&ndash;5 he took refuge from the Second World War in the USA.

Massys also painted portraits and <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes. The satirical quality in his pictures of bankers, tax-collectors, and avaricious merchants has been linked with the writings of the great humanist Erasmus. Certainly the two met, for Massys painted a pair of portraits of Erasmus (Gal. Naz., Rome) and Petrus Egidius (Earl of Radnor Coll., Longford Castle, Wiltshire) as a gift for Sir Thomas More in 1517. They instituted a new type&mdash;the scholar in his study&mdash;that influenced <a href=""entry://Holbein, Hans""><span class=""links"">Holbein </span></a> among others.

<b>Master E. S.</b><div class=""content"">(sometimes called the Master of 1466 from the date on one of his engravings). German engraver working in the mid-15th cent., named after the monogram on eighteen of his surviving prints. He was the most prolific and influential of the early German engravers, working on profane and fantastic subjects as well as religious images and producing more than 300 known prints.

"Master of","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Master of</b><div class=""content"">Term used in art history to label the author of anonymous works for convenience in discussing them. This use of invented names is more common in the study of painting and the <a href=""entry://graphic art""><span class=""links"">graphic arts</span></a> than of sculpture, and historians of architecture hardly ever resort to it. It began in Germany in the early 19th cent. with the description of Early Netherlandish painting. The choice of names was then often more lyrical than descriptive: for instance the ‘Master of the Pearl of Brabant’ (who later was identified with <a href=""entry://Bouts, Dirk""><span class=""links"">Bouts </span></a>) got his name from an altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) which had become known by that poetical title simply because it caught the imagination. Nowadays invented names are more prosaic and more directly appropriate. Often the anonymous master is named after a particular picture and/or the collection to which it belongs, e.g. ‘Master of the Louvre Annunciation’. Alternatively, the name can refer to some aspect of the artist's style, as in the ‘Master of the Anaemic Figures’ (a 15th-cent. Spanish painter), which shows that the designation ‘master’ is used neutrally and is not a sign of approbation. The practice of creating artistic personalities in this way has been overdone, but is often useful."
"Master of Alkmaar","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Master of Alkmaar</b> (active early 16th cent.).<div class=""content"">Netherlandish painter named after the altarpiece of the <i>Seven Works of Mercy</i> painted for the church of St Lawrence in Alkmaar in 1504 and now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Attempts have been made to identify the painter with Cornelis Buys, who was the brother of Jacob <a href=""entry://Cornelisz. van Oostsanen, Jacob""><span class=""links"">Cornelisz. van Oostsanen </span></a>.

"Master of Flémalle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Master of Flémalle</b>.<div class=""content"">Netherlandish painter named after three paintings in the Städelsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt that were wrongly supposed to have come from Flémalle, near Liège. There is a strong consensus of scholarly opinion that he is to be identified with Robert Campin (active 1406&ndash;44), who was the leading painter of his day in Tournai but none of whose documented pictures survive. The identification depends on the similarity between the Master of Flémalle's paintings and those of Jacques <a href=""entry://Daret, Jacques""><span class=""links"">Daret </span></a> and Rogier van der <a href=""entry://Weyden, Rogier van der""><span class=""links"">Weyden </span></a>, for Daret was Campin's pupil and Rogier almost certainly was. The hypothesis that the Master of Flémalle's paintings are early works by Rogier now has few adherents. While there is still doubt about the Master of Flémalle's identity, there is no argument about his achievement, for he made a radical break with the elegant <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a> style and ranks with van <a href=""entry://Eyck, Jan van""><span class=""links"">Eyck </span></a> as one of the founders of the Netherlandish school of painting. None of the paintings given to him is dated&mdash;with the exception of the wings of the Werl altarpiece of 1438 in the Prado, a doubtful attribution&mdash;but it seems likely that his earliest works antedate any surviving picture by van Eyck . The earliest of all is generally thought to be <i>The Entombment</i> (Courtauld Inst., London) of about 1410/20. This still has the decorative gold background of medieval tradition, but the influence of Claus <a href=""entry://Sluter, Claus""><span class=""links"">Sluter </span></a> is clear in the sculptural solidity and dramatic force of the figures. The most famous work associated with the Master of Flémalle is the Mérode Altarpiece (Met. Mus., New York), and he is indeed sometimes referred to as the Master of Mérode. However, the attribution of this painting has also been questioned. Among the other works associated with him are <i>The Marriage of the Virgin</i> (Prado, Madrid), <i>The Nativity</i> (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon), and <i>The Virgin and Child before a Firescreen</i> (NG, London), which shows the homely detail and down-to-earth naturalism characteristic of the artist (the firescreen behind the Virgin's head forms a substitute for a halo). The National Gallery also has three portraits attributed to the Master of Flémalle. In spite of the many problems that still surround him, he emerges as a very powerful and important artistic personality."

They are among the finest illuminated books of the period, with many charming everyday-life and still-life details, and other fine works in a similar style have been attributed to him, notably a <i>Book of Hours in the Bodleian Library</i>, Oxford.

"Master of St Cecilia","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Master of St Cecilia</b> (active <i>c.</i>1304).<div class=""content"">Italian painter named after the St Cecilia Altarpiece in the Uffizi, which was originally in the church of Sta Cecilia, destroyed by fire in 1304. Presumably he was a Florentine, but nothing is known about him. Other works have been attributed to him because of their resemblance to the Uffizi picture, the most important being the three concluding scenes of the great fresco cycle of the life of St Francis in the Upper Church of S. Francesco at Assisi (see <a href=""entry://Master of the St Francis Cycle""><span class=""links"">MASTER OF THE ST FRANCIS CYCLE</span></a>). The painter of these scenes resembles <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto </span></a> in lucidity of presentation and the solid drawing of his figures, but he is more genial in feeling. His figures are more vivacious, his colour warmer and sweeter.

Other paintings in the same style have been grouped round them. Their attention to detail and their meticulous finish have caused some to consider that the artist was trained in the Netherlands, but the inclusion of views of Paris in some of his works indicates that he worked there, whatever his origin.

"Master of the Brunswick Monogram","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Master of the Brunswick Monogram</b> (active <i>c.</i>1520&ndash;40).<div class=""content"">Netherlandish painter, named after a picture in the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich Museum in Brunswick of <i>The Parable of the Great Supper</i> (Luke 14). There is no agreement how the monogram should be read. A dozen or so small pictures have been attributed to the same hand; about half depict religious subjects in the open air, and most of the others scenes in brothels. The quality of the pictures is uniformly high. The artist's observation of nature, his fine drawing, and ability to integrate figures into a landscape make him an important forerunner of Pieter <a href=""entry://Bruegel, Pieter""><span class=""links"">Bruegel </span></a> the Elder.

About twenty paintings have been attributed to him, revealing a very distinctive and distinguished artist, who obtained his highly emotional effects through intense colours, desolate landscapes, and gaunt figures.

"Matisse, Henri","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Matisse, Henri</b><div class=""content""><i>(1869&ndash;1954).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, sculptor, graphic artist, and designer. From about 1920 he enjoyed an international reputation alongside <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a> as the foremost painter of his time, and for sensitivity of line and beauty of colouring he was unrivalled among his contemporaries. In 1891 he abandoned a legal career for painting. Initially he produced still lifes and landscapes in a sober range of colour, but in the summer of 1896, painting in Brittany, he began to adopt the lighter palette of the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>. In 1899 he began to experiment with the <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionist</span></a> technique, which he still used five years later in one of his first major works&mdash;the celebrated <i>Luxe, calme et volupté</i> (Musée d'Orsay, Paris, 1904&ndash;5), exhibited at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> des Indépendants in 1905 and bought by <a href=""entry://Signac, Paul""><span class=""links"">Signac </span></a>. During the same years he had been painting with <a href=""entry://Marquet, Albert""><span class=""links"">Marquet </span></a>, had met <a href=""entry://Derain, André""><span class=""links"">Derain </span></a> and through him <a href=""entry://Vlaminck, Maurice de""><span class=""links"">Vlaminck </span></a>, and in 1905, together with these and other friends from student days, he took part in the sensational exhibition at the <a href=""entry://Salon d'Automne""><span class=""links"">Salon d'Automne</span></a> that give birth to the name <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauves</span></a>. In the same year (Matisse's <i>annus mirabilis</i>) he acquired his first important patrons&mdash;the expatriate Americans Gertrude, Leo, and Michael <a href=""entry://Stein, Gertrude""><span class=""links"">Stein </span></a>&mdash;and they were soon followed by others. Previously he had struggled to earn a living, but he was now freed from financial worries and could afford to travel. His growing reputation also attracted many pupils to the art school he ran in Paris from 1907 to 1911.<br class=""nLine"" />Matisse had met Picasso as early as 1906, and like him was excited by African sculpture at this time. Although he never allied himself with the <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubists</span></a>, he was influenced by their work in the second decade of the century, when he painted some of his most austere and formal pictures (<i>Bathers by a River</i>, Art Institute of Chicago, 1916&ndash;17). In the 1920s, however, he returned to the luminous serenity that characterized his work for the rest of his long career. From 1916 he spent most of his winters on the Riviera, mainly at Nice and also at Vence. The luxuriously sensual works he painted there&mdash;odalisques, still lifes of tropical fruits and flowers, and glowing interiors&mdash;are irradiated with the strong sun and rich colours of the south. Following two major operations for duodenal cancer in 1941, Matisse was confined to bed or a wheelchair, but he worked until the end of his life and one of his greatest and most original works was created in 1949&ndash;51, when he was in his eighties. This is the Chapel of the Rosary at Vence, a gift of thanksgiving for a woman who had nursed him after his operations then become a nun at this Dominican convent. Matisse designed every detail, including the priests' vestments. The stained-glass windows show his familiar love of colour, but the walls feature murals of pure white ceramic tiles decorated with black line drawings of inspired simplicity. Matisse was not a believer, but he created here one of the most moving religious buildings of the 20th cent. and expressed what he called ‘the nearly religious feeling I have for life’.<br class=""nLine"" />In his bedridden final years Matisse also embarked on another kind of highly original work, using brightly coloured cut-out paper shapes (<i>gouaches découpées</i>) arranged into purely abstract patterns (<i>L'Escargot</i>, Tate Gallery, London, 1953). ‘The paper cut-out’, he said, ‘allows me to draw in the colour. It is a simplification for me. Instead of drawing the outline and putting the colour inside it&mdash;the one modifying the other&mdash;I draw straight into the colour.’ The colours he used in his cut-outs were often so strong that his doctor advised him to wear dark glasses. They must rank among the most joyous works ever created by an artist in old age. Unlike many of his great contemporaries, Matisse did not attempt to express in his work the troubled times through which he lived. ‘What I dream of’, he wrote, ‘is an art of balance, of purity and serenity devoid of troubling or disturbing subject-matter
like a comforting influence, a mental balm&mdash;something like a good armchair in which one rests from physical fatigue.’<br class=""nLine"" />Matisse made sculptures at intervals throughout his career, the best known probably being the four bronzes called <i>The Back I-IV</i> (casts in the Tate and elsewhere, 1909&ndash;<i>c.</i>1929), in which he progressively removed all detail, paring the figure down to massively simple forms. He also designed sets and costumes for <a href=""entry://Diaghilev, Sergei""><span class=""links"">Diaghilev </span></a> and was a brilliant book illustrator. His work is represented in most important collections of modern art, the finest holdings being at the <a href=""entry://Barnes, Dr Albert C.""><span class=""links"">Barnes</span></a> Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania, the Hermitage, St Petersburg, and the Pushkin Museum, Moscow. There are also Matisse museums in Le Cateau (his birthplace) and Nice."

His style changed very little and it is difficult to place undated paintings in a chronological scheme. He painted numerous portraits and showed rather more originality in this field than in religious painting. Among his patrons were Italians then living in Bruges (<i>Tommaso Portinari and his wife</i>, Metropolitan Museum, New York, <i>c.</i>1468), and his portraits seem to have influenced artists such as Giovanni <a href=""entry://Bellini""><span class=""links"">Bellini </span></a> in northern Italy.

He was extremely industrious and achieved fame with 400 illustrations (wood engravings from his lively drawings) for Franz Kugler's <i>History of Frederick the Great</i> (1840&ndash;2). In painting he worked on similar themes and with comparable success, creating the popular image of the founder of the Prussian state. From the 1860s he turned to subjects from modern life and was one of the first German painters to note the picturesque qualities of industry (<i>The Steel Mill</i>, Staatliche Museen, Berlin, 1875).

The term (<i>Pittura Metafisica</i>) was coined by de Chirico and Carrà in 1917, when both were patients at a military hospital in Ferrara, and the style is characterized by images conveying a sense of mystery and hallucination. This was achieved partly by unreal perspectives and lighting, partly by the adoption of a strange <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">iconography</span></a> involving, for example, the use of tailor's dummies and statues in place of human figures, and partly by an incongruous juxtaposition of realistically depicted objects in a manner later taken over by some of the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealists</span></a>.

Between 1880 and 1925, at a time when the major public collections in Europe were engaged in consolidation, relying largely on their purchase grants and other state aid, the Metropolitan Museum was being built up out of the private fortunes of great businessmen, who collected rather for prestige than out of connoisseurship, but collected only first-class works of art.

"mezzotint","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>mezzotint</b>.<div class=""content"">A method of engraving that produces tonal areas rather than lines; the term also applies to a print made by this method. A metal (usually copper) plate is roughened with a tool called a rocker, which raises a ‘burr’ on the surface. The design is formed by scraping away the burr where the light tones are required and by polishing the metal quite smooth in the highlights. When the plate has been inked and then wiped, the ink is retained where the plate is rough and will print an intense black, but where it has been smoothed less ink is held and a lighter tone occurs. Mezzotint was invented in the Netherlands in the mid 17th cent. by Ludwig von <a href=""entry://Siegen, Ludwig von""><span class=""links"">Siegen </span></a> and soon spread to England, where it became an extremely popular method for reproducing portraits in particular.

Like <a href=""entry://drypoint""><span class=""links"">drypoint</span></a>, mezzotint yields only a small number of good impressions before the burr wears down.

His father, a member of the gentry, claimed noble lineage and throughout his life Michelangelo was touchy on the subject; pride of birth had much to do with the family opposition to his apprenticeship as a painter as well as with Michelangelo's own insistence in later life on the status of painting and sculpture among the <a href=""entry://liberal arts""><span class=""links"">liberal arts</span></a>. In 1488 he was apprenticed for a term of three years to Domenico <a href=""entry://Ghirlandaio, Domenico""><span class=""links"">Ghirlandaio </span></a> and from him he must have learnt the elements of <a href=""entry://fresco""><span class=""links"">fresco</span></a> technique. He could not have learnt very much else, however, since he seems to have transferred very quickly to the school set up in the <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici</span></a> gardens and run by <a href=""entry://Bertoldo di Giovanni ""><span class=""links"">Bertoldo di Giovanni </span></a>. More important than either master, however, was what he learned from the drawings he made of figures in the frescos of <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a>. After the death of his patron Lorenzo de Medici in 1492 the political situation in Florence deteriorated, and in October 1494 Michelangelo left for Bologna, where he carved three small figures for the tomb of S. Dominic (see <a href=""entry://Niccolò dell' Arca ""><span class=""links"">NICCOLÒ DELL' ARCA </span></a>). By June 1496 he was in Rome, where he remained for the next five years and where he carved the two statues that established his fame&mdash;the <i>Bacchus</i> (Bargello, Florence, <i>c.</i>1496&ndash;7) and the <a href=""entry://Pietà""><i><span class=""links"">Pietà</i></span></a> (St Peter's, Rome, 1498&ndash;9). The latter is the masterpiece of his early years&mdash;a tragically expressive and yet beautiful and harmonious solution to the problem of representing a full-grown man lying dead in the lap of a woman. There are no marks of suffering&mdash;as were common in northern representations of the period&mdash;and the carving has a flawless beauty and polish demonstrating his absolute technical mastery. Still in his mid-twenties, Michelangelo returned to Florence in 1501 to consolidate the reputation he had made in Rome. He remained there until the spring of 1505, the major completed work of the period being the <i>David</i> (Accademia, Florence, 1501&ndash;4), which has become a symbol of Florence and Florentine art. Soon after the <i>David</i> was completed, Michelangelo received a commission from the Signoria of Florence to paint a huge mural of the <i>Battle of Cascina</i> for the new Council Chamber in the Palazzo Vecchio; here he worked in rivalry with <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, who was engaged on the <i>Battle of Anghiari</i> for the same room. Neither painting was completed, but Michelangelo began work on the full-size <a href=""entry://cartoon""><span class=""links"">cartoon</span></a> in the winter of 1504, and the fragment known as the <i>Bathers</i> was, while it existed, a model for all the young artists in Florence&mdash;including <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>&mdash;and was one of the prime causes of Mannerist preoccupation with the nude figure in violent action. It is now known from a copy (Earl of Leicester coll.) and an engraving, as well as some preliminary drawings (for example in the BM).<br class=""nLine"" />Michelangelo left the battlepiece unfinished when Pope Julius II summoned him to Rome in 1505 to make him a tomb. Julius died in 1513, but the project dragged on until 1545 and was rightly described by <a href=""entry://Condivi, Ascanio""><span class=""links"">Condivi </span></a> as the ‘Tragedy of the Tomb’. It was originally conceived on the most grandiose scale, but was whittled down in successive contracts with Julius's heirs, and of the monument finally erected in S. Pietro in Vincoli in 1545 only the celebrated <i>Moses</i> (<i>c.</i>1515) was from Michelangelo's own hand. (Two figures of <i>Slaves</i>, <i>c.</i>1513, carved by Michelangelo for the tomb are now in the Louvre.) The other great work commissioned from Michelangelo by Julius &mdash;the frescoing of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel&mdash;was equally daunting, but was brought to sublime fruition. The contract was signed on 10 May 1508 and the finished ceiling was unveiled on 31 October 1512. Michelangelo, who always regarded himself as a sculptor first and foremost, was reluctant to undertake the work, but he made of it his most heroic achievement, not only for its quality as a work of art, but also in terms of the endurance and stamina he showed in completing so quickly and virtually unaided such a huge and physically uncomfortable task. There is still much debate about the exact interpretation of the scores of figures that adorn the ceiling, but the main panels represent scenes from Genesis, from the Creation to the Drunkenness of Noah, forming the background to the frescos on the life of Moses and of Christ on the walls below by a number of 15th-cent. artists. Prophets and Sibyls who foretold Christ's birth are at the sides of the ceiling, and at each corner of the central scenes are figures of beautiful nude youths (usually called the <i>Ignudi</i>), whose exact significance is uncertain. They have been thought to represent the Neoplatonic ideal of humanity, and as Kenneth <a href=""entry://Clark, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Clark </span></a> wrote, ‘Their physical beauty is an image of divine perfection; their alter and vigorous movements an expression of divine energy.’ From the moment of its completion the Ceiling has always been regarded as one of the supreme masterpieces of pictorial art (the recent cleaning has revealed anew the beauty of the colouring), and Michelangelo was, at the age of 37, recognized as the greatest artist of his day, a position he retained unchallenged until his death.<br class=""nLine"" />In December 1516 he was commissioned by the new pope, Leo X (Giovanni de' Medici ), to design a façade for the Medici parish church in Florence, S. Lorenzo, which had been left unfinished by <a href=""entry://Brunelleschi, Filippo""><span class=""links"">Brunelleschi </span></a>. The project came to nothing and wasted a good deal of Michelangelo's time, but it led to two other works for S. Lorenzo &mdash;the Medici Chapel, or New Sacristy, planned as a counterpart to Brunelleschi's Old Sacristy, and the Biblioteca Laurenziana. Both were left unfinished, but they nevertheless rank among Michelangelo's finest creations. The Medici Chapel was planned from November 1520 as a mortuary chapel for the family to contain the monuments of four members, but it was abandoned when the Medici were expelled from Florence in 1527, restarted in 1530, and left incomplete in 1534 when Michelangelo finally settled in Rome. It was intended to be a union of architecture and sculpture (like the projected S. Lorenzo façade), with the view from the altar leading to the climax of the whole composition in the figures of the <i>Madonna and Child</i> (unfinished) and with the Active and Contemplative Life symbolized by figures on the wall-tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici. The figures of the Medici are set above reclining figures symbolizing <i>Day</i> and <i>Night</i> (for <i>Vita activa</i>) and <i>Dawn</i> and <i>Evening</i> (for <i>Vita contemplativa</i>).<br class=""nLine"" />In the thirty years that remained to him in Rome, Michelangelo worked mainly for the papacy. He was at once commissioned to paint the <i>Last Judgement</i> in the Sistine Chapel and began the actual painting in 1536. It was unveiled on 31 October 1541, twenty-nine years to the day after the unveiling of the Sistine Ceiling but a whole world away from it in feeling and meaning, with its massive and menacing figures and mood of wrathful desolation. In the interval the world of Michelangelo's youth had collapsed in the horror of the Sack of Rome (1527), and its confident humanism had been found insufficient in the face of the rise of Protestantism and the new, militant spirit of the Counter-Reformation. For Paul III (Alessandro <a href=""entry://Farnese""><span class=""links"">Farnese </span></a>), who commissioned the Last Judgement, Michelangelo also executed his last works in painting, the <i>Conversion of St Paul and the Crucifixion of St Peter</i> (1542&ndash;50), frescos in the Cappella Paolina in the Vatican. The figures here are even more blunt, heavy, and unconcerned with physical allure, totally repudiating his own early ideals. Something of the same deep and troubled spirituality is seen in his late drawings of the Crucifixion and two sculptures of the Pietà. One (now in Florence Cathedral) was intended for his own tomb and contains a self-portrait as Nicodemus; it was begun <i>c.</i>1546 and mutilated and abandoned by Michelangelo in 1555. The other (Castello Sforza, Milan) was his last work, left unfinished at his death.<br class=""nLine"" />For the last thirty years of his life, however, Michelangelo devoted most of his attentions to architecture, and in this field his stature is just as great as in sculpture and painting. His most important commission&mdash;indeed the most important in Christendom&mdash;was the completion of St Peter's, which had been begun under Julius II in 1506. When Michelangelo became architect in 1546, the building had advanced little since <a href=""entry://Bramante, Donato""><span class=""links"">Bramante's </span></a> death in 1514. As with the Sistine Ceiling, he was initially unwilling to undertake the task, but he then proceeded with formidable energy and by the time of his death work had advanced so far that the drum of the dome was nearly complete. Michelangelo also designed the dome itself, but this was executed after his death and is probably a good deal steeper in outline than he intended. The addition of a long nave in the early 17th cent. altered Michelangelo's plan for a centralized church, but nevertheless the exterior of the building owes more to him than to any other architect and forms a fitting conclusion to his titanic career. In architecture, Michelangelo's decorative vocabulary soon attained widespread currency, but it was only in the 17th cent., however, that his massive and dynamic style was fully appreciated and emulated; it is fitting that <a href=""entry://Bernini, Gianlorenzo""><span class=""links"">Bernini </span></a>, the great sculptor-architect of the age, should complete St Peter's with his glorious piazza. In painting and sculpture Michelangelo's means of expression was limited almost entirely to the heroic male figure, usually nude, but in this field he reigned supreme as no artist has done before or since. The awe that his contemporaries felt for him has not diminished through the centuries and his influence, for good and ill, has been enormous."

<b>Millais, Sir John Everett</b><div class=""content""><i>(1829&ndash;96).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter and book illustrator. A child prodigy who was hard-working as well as naturally gifted, he became the youngest ever student at the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> Schools when he was 11, and although he suffered some temporary setbacks in his twenties, his career was essentially one of the great Victorian success stories. In 1848, with <a href=""entry://Rossetti, Dante Gabriel""><span class=""links"">Rossetti </span></a> and Holman <a href=""entry://Hunt, William Holman""><span class=""links"">Hunt </span></a>, he founded the <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</span></a> and had his share of the abuse heaped against the members until <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a> stepped in as their champion. (In 1854 Millais married Effie Gray, formerly Ruskin's wife, after this first marriage had been annulled.) In the 1850s Millais's style changed, as he moved away from the brilliantly coloured, minutely detailed Pre-Raphaelite manner to a broader and more fluent way of painting&mdash;with a family to support he said he could not afford to spend a whole day working on an area ‘no larger than a five shilling piece’. His subjects changed also, from highly serious, morally uplifting themes to scenes that met the public demand for sentiment and a good story (<i>The Boyhood of Raleigh</i>, Tate, London, 1870). He became enormously popular, not only with subject pictures such as this, but also as a portraitist and book illustrator, his drawings for the novels of Anthony Trollope being such a success that Trollope said they influenced the way he developed the characters in sequels. Millais lived in some splendour on his huge income, in 1885 became the first artist to be awarded a baronetcy, and in the year of his death was elected President of the Royal Academy. To some contemporaries it seemed that he wasted his talents pandering to public taste, and many 20th-cent. critics have presented him as a young genius who sacrificed his artistic conscience for money. Millais, an easy-going and much-liked man, certainly enjoyed his success, but he was far from being a cynic. He was always proud of his skills (near the end of his career he wrote ‘I may honestly say that I have never consciously placed an idle touch upon canvas’), and few of his contemporaries could match his late works for sheer beauty of handling (<i>Bubbles</i>, A. &amp; F. Pears Ltd.,1886)."

He is best known for his numerous large-scale fountains, distinguished by rhythmic vitality and inventive figure types (he would fuse classical and Nordic types such as tritons and goblins), and sometimes by a grotesque humour. From 1931 to 1945 he was Professor of Sculpture at the Cranbrook Academy at Bloomfield Hills, Michigan; his work in the USA includes fountains in Chicago, Kansas City, New York, and St Louis.

<b>Millet, Jean-François</b><div class=""content""><i>(1814&ndash;75).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter and graphic artist, born of a peasant family at Gruchy, near Cherbourg in Normandy. He studied locally, then in 1837 entered the studio of <a href=""entry://Delaroche, Paul""><span class=""links"">Delaroche </span></a> in Paris. His early pictures consisted of conventional mythological and anecdotal <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes and portraits, but with <i>The Winnower</i> (Musée d'Orsay, Paris), exhibited at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> in 1848, he turned to the scenes of rustic life from which his name is now inseparable. He emphasized the serious and even melancholy aspects of country life, emotionalizing the labours of the soil and the sad solemnities of toil. Hostile critics accused him of being a socialist, but Millet's concerns were aesthetic rather than political and he said his desire was ‘to make the trivial serve to express the sublime’. In 1849 he settled at Barbizon, where he remained for the rest of his life apart from a stay in Cherbourg during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&ndash;1. Late in his career he turned increasingly to pure landscape, influenced by his close friend Théodore <a href=""entry://Rousseau, Henri""><span class=""links"">Rousseau </span></a>. Millet passed much of his life in poverty, but his work began to bring him success in the 1860s and <i>The Angelus</i> (Musée d'Orsay, 1859) became perhaps the most widely reproduced painting of the 19th cent. This has had a harmful effect on his subsequent critical fortunes, for largely on the strength of it he has been pigeon-holed as a purveyor of pious sentimentality. His greatness lies rather in his drawing, which for its elimination of the inessential, investing the ordinary with weight and dignity, has been compared with that of <a href=""entry://Seurat, Georges""><span class=""links"">Seurat </span></a>. Van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a> and Camille <a href=""entry://Pissarro, Camille""><span class=""links"">Pissarro </span></a> were among those who admired Millet's work."

In 1848 he won a competition for the monument to President Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square, Washington, and worked for five years on this, the first equestrian statue in the USA. He built his own foundry to cast the statue, which daringly has the rearing horse supported only by hind legs, and eventually succeeded at the seventh attempt. The ecstatic response when the statue was unveiled in 1853 brought him great financial rewards and the commission for an equestrian statue to George Washington in Washington Circle (1860). He spent his final years under a cloud, however, suspected of dishonesty in handling the metal assigned to him."
"miniature","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>miniature</b>.<div class=""content"">A very small painting, particularly a portrait that can be held in the hand or worn as a piece of jewellery. The word is applied to manuscript <a href=""entry://illuminated manuscripts""><span class=""links"">illuminations</span></a> as well as portraits and derives from the Latin <i>minimum</i>, the red lead used to emphasize initial letters, decorated by the <i>miniator</i>. Since the 17th cent. the term has been applied to all types of manuscript illustration on account of a mistaken etymology: the word was connected with ‘minute’ (small). What we today call a ‘miniature’ was called <i>historia</i> in the Middle Ages and the portraits painted by <a href=""entry://Hilliard, Nicholas""><span class=""links"">Hilliard </span></a> and others were named ‘limnings’ or ‘pictures in little’ by the Elizabethans. They were painted on vellum (see <a href=""entry://parchment""><span class=""links"">PARCHMENT</span></a>), or occasionally on ivory or card, and in the 17th and 18th cents. there was a vogue for miniatures done in an <a href=""entry://enamel""><span class=""links"">enamelling</span></a> technique. The portrait miniature developed from a fusion of the traditions of medieval illumination and the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> medal and flourished from the early 16th cent. to the mid 19th cent., when photography virtually killed it as a serious art form."
"Minimal art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Minimal art</b>.<div class=""content"">A type of abstract art, particularly sculpture, characterized by extreme simplicity of form and a deliberate lack of expressive content; it emerged as a trend in the 1950s and flourished particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. The roots of Minimal art can be traced to the geometrical abstractions of <a href=""entry://Malevich, Kasimir""><span class=""links"">Malevich </span></a> and the <a href=""entry://ready-made""><span class=""links"">ready-mades</span></a> of <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a> in the second decade of the 20th cent., but as a movement it developed mainly in the USA and its impersonality is seen as a reaction against the emotiveness of <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a>. ‘The theory of minimalism is that without the diverting presence of “composition”, and by the use of plain, often industrial materials arranged in geometrical or highly simplified configurations we may experience all the more strongly the pure qualities of colour, form, space and materials’ (<i>The Tale Gallery: An Illustrated Companion</i>, 1979). Minimal art has close links with <a href=""entry://Conceptual art""><span class=""links"">Conceptual art</span></a> (Minimalist sculpture often has a strong element of theoretical demonstration about it, with the artist leaving the fabrication of his designs to industrial specialists), and sometimes there are affinities with other contemporaneous movements, such as <a href=""entry://Land art""><span class=""links"">Land art</span></a>. There is even a kinship with <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a> in a shared preference for slick, impersonal surfaces (some Minimal artists, however, have used ‘natural’ materials such as logs rather than machine-finished products). The leading Minimalist sculptors include Carl <a href=""entry://Andre, Carl""><span class=""links"">Andre </span></a>, Don <a href=""entry://Judd, Donald""><span class=""links"">Judd </span></a>, and Tony <a href=""entry://Smith, Tony""><span class=""links"">Smith </span></a>.

Mino is remembered mainly for his portrait busts. Whereas Desiderio's are all of women, Mino's are almost all of men; the earliest&mdash;that of Piero de <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici </span></a> (Bargello, Florence, 1453) is the first dated portrait bust of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. Mino also worked as a tomb sculptor, but much of his work in this field has been altered or destroyed or is of uncertain attribution because he collaborated with other sculptors. The one that most clearly shows his own workmanship is that of Count Hugo of Tuscany (Badia, Florence, completed 1481), which Vasari describes as ‘the most beautiful work that he ever produced’. Mino had three documented stays in Rome (1454, 1463, and 1474&ndash;80) and also worked briefly in Naples (1455). His reputation was at its height in the 19th cent., when his delicate carving of marble was much admired."

From 1943 to 1946 he had a studio in London at 77 Bedford Gardens (the house in which <a href=""entry://Colquhoun, Robert""><span class=""links"">Colquhoun </span></a> and MacBryde lived) and from 1946 to 1952 he lived with Keith <a href=""entry://Vaughan, Keith""><span class=""links"">Vaughan </span></a>. Minton was a leading exponent of <a href=""entry://Neo-Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Romanticism</span></a> and an influential figure through his teaching at Camberwell School of Art (1943&ndash;7), the Central School of Arts and Crafts (1947&ndash;8), and the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a> (1948&ndash;56). He was extremely energetic, travelling widely and producing a large body of work as a painter (of portraits, landscapes, and figure compositions), book illustrator, and designer. After about 1950, however, his work went increasingly out of fashion. He made an effort to keep up with the times with subjects such as <i>The Death of James Dean</i> (Tate Gallery, London, 1957), but stylistically he changed little.

<b>Miró, Joan</b><div class=""content""><i>(1893&ndash;1983).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Spanish painter, sculptor, graphic artist, and designer. He first visited Paris in 1919 and from then until 1936 (when the Spanish Civil War began) his regular pattern was to spend the winter in Paris and the summer at his family's farm near Barcelona. His early work shows the influence of various modern movements&mdash;<a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauvism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> (he was a friend of Pablo <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>), and <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dadaism</span></a>&mdash;but he is particularly associated with the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealists</span></a>, whose first manifesto he signed in 1924. Throughout his life, whether his work was purely abstract or whether it retained figurative suggestions, Miró remained true to the basic Surrealist principle of releasing the creative forces of the subconscious mind from the control of logic and reason. However, even though André <a href=""entry://Breton, André""><span class=""links"">Breton </span></a> wrote that he was ‘probably the most Surrealistic of us all’, Miró stood apart from the other members of the movement in the variety, geniality, and lack of attitudinizing in his work, which shows none of the superficial devices beloved of other Surrealists. One of the works in which he first displayed an unmistakable personal vision is <i>Harlequin's Carnival</i> (Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, 1924&ndash;5), featuring a bizarre assembly of insect-like creatures dancing and making music&mdash;a scene inspired by ‘my hallucinations brought on by hunger’. Much of his work has the delightful quality of playfulness seen in this picture, but he was inspired to much more sombre and even savage imagery by the Spanish Civil War, during which he designed propaganda posters for the Republicans fighting against Franco.<br class=""nLine"" />Miró settled in Paris in 1936 because of the Civil War, but in 1940 he returned to Spain to escape the German occupation of France and thereafter lived mainly on the island of Majorca. It was from about this time that he began to achieve international recognition. For the rest of his long life he worked with great energy in a wide variety of fields. In 1944 he began making ceramics and slightly later he took up sculpture, initially small terracottas but eventually large-scale pieces for casting in bronze. He visited the USA for the first time in 1947 and did a large mural for the Terrace Hilton Hotel in Cincinnati. This fulfilled his desire to communicate with a large public, and several of his major works of the 1950s were in a similar vein: a mural for Harvard University in 1950 (now replaced by a ceramic copy; the original is in MOMA, New York) and two vast ceramic wall decorations, <i>Wall of the Sun and Wall of the Moon</i> (installed 1958), for the Unesco Building in Paris. Another aspect of his desire to make his art widely accessible is his productivity as a printmaker (etchings and lithographs). He continued to explore new techniques into his old age, taking up stained-glass design when he was in his eighties. In spite of the world-wide fame he acquired he was a modest, retiring character, utterly devoted to his work, and in one of his rare public statements he criticized Picasso for what seemed to him like a mania for publicity. The Foundation Joan Miró was opened in 1975 on the heights of Montjuic overlooking Barcelona. It is designed both as a memorial museum housing a collection of Miró's works and as a centre of artistic activity."

"Modersohn-Becker, Paula","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Modersohn-Becker, Paula</b><div class=""content""><i>(1876&ndash;1907).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German painter and graphic artist, born Paula Becker. In 1898 she joined the artists' colony at <a href=""entry://Worpswede""><span class=""links"">Worpswede</span></a> and in 1901 she married <i>Otto Modersohn </i> (1865&ndash;1943), another member of the group. She shared in a high degree the poetic sensibility for nature which was cultivated by the Worpswede School and she was a friend of the poet Rilke. But she was dissatisfied with the sentimentalized idealization of the Worpswede manner, and made it her object to express by means of the utmost simplicity and economy of form ‘the unconscious feeling that often murmurs so softly and sweetly within me’. She visited Paris in 1900 and on three subsequent visits before her early death in 1907, and in the last years of her life, under the influence of <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin </span></a>, van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a>, she found the ‘great simplicity of form’ for which she had been searching. Up to about 1900 she painted landscapes and scenes of peasant life; thereafter she concentrated on single figures, including self-portraits and portraits of peasants, and also still lifes. In her self-portraits she typically shows herself with wide, staring eyes and often in the nude. Although she had a weak physical constitution, she worked with great discipline and perseverance, producing about 650 pictures in a career that lasted only 10 years. She died soon after giving birth to her first child. At this time she was little known, but she has since become recognized as one of the most important precursors of German <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> because of her symbolic use of colour and pattern, her highly subjective vision, and the almost primitive force of some of her work."

<b>Modigliani, Amedeo</b><div class=""content""><i>(1884&ndash;1920).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, sculptor, and draughtsman, active mainly in Paris. Although virtually his whole career was spent in France, he laid the foundations of his style in Italy with his study of the masters of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. In particular he is often seen as a spiritual heir of <a href=""entry://Botticelli, Sandro""><span class=""links"">Botticelli </span></a> because of the linear grace of his work. He moved to Paris in 1906; apart from visits to his family in Italy and a year spent at Nice and Cagnes, 1918&ndash;19, this was his home for the rest of his life, and he became a familiar figure in the café and night life of Montmartre. In about 1909 he met <a href=""entry://Brancusi, Constantin""><span class=""links"">Brancusi </span></a> and devoted himself mainly to stonecarving until 1914, when the war made it impossible for him to get materials. He returned to painting and his finest works were produced in the last five years of his short life. Both as a sculptor and as a painter his range was limited. With few exceptions his sculptures are heads or crouching caryatid figures and the paintings are portraits or female nudes. Common to virtually all his work are extremely elongated, simplified forms and a superb sense of rhythmic vitality, but there is a great difference in mood between, for example, his sculpted heads (<i>Head</i>, Tate, London, <i>c.</i>1911&ndash;12), which have the primitive power of the African masks that inspired them, and his gloriously sensual nudes (<i>Reclining Nude</i>, MOMA, New York, <i>c.</i>1919), which were censured for their open eroticism. Modigliani's early death from tuberculosis was hastened by his notoriously dissolute lifestyle, and his mistress Jeanne Hébuterne, pregnant with their second child, committed suicide the day after he died. He had exhibited little during his lifetime; his posthumous fame was established by an exhibition at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, in 1922 and a biography by the poet André Salmon in 1926&mdash;<i>Modigliani, sa vie et son œuvre</i>. His reputation as one of the outstandingly original artists of his time is now secure, but his fame rests even more on his reputation as the bohemian <i>par excellence</i>: in the popular imagination he is the archetypal romantic genius, starving in a garret, the victim of drugs and alcohol, an inveterate womanizer, but painting and carving obsessively."
"Moholy-Nagy, László","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Moholy-Nagy, László</b><div class=""content""><i>(1895&ndash;1946).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Hungarian born painter, sculptor, experimental artist, and writer who became an American citizen in 1944. After qualifying in law at Budapest University and serving in the First World War, he moved to Vienna in 1919 and then in 1921 to Berlin, where he painted abstract pictures influenced by <a href=""entry://Lissitzky, El""><span class=""links"">Lissitzky </span></a> (himself newly arrived from Russia). He also experimented with <a href=""entry://collage""><span class=""links"">collage</span></a> and <a href=""entry://photomontage""><span class=""links"">photomontage</span></a> and in 1922 had his first one-man exhibition, at the <a href=""entry://Sturm, Der""><span class=""links"">Sturm</span></a> Gallery. From 1923 to 1928 he taught at the <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a>, taking over from <a href=""entry://Itten, Johannes""><span class=""links"">Itten </span></a> the running of the preliminary course. The difference in approach between these two highly distinctive characters is summed up by Frank Whitford (<i>Bauhaus</i>, 1984): ‘Even Moholy's appearance proclaimed his artistic sympathies. Itten had worn something like a monk's habit and had kept his head immaculately shaved with the intention of creating an aura of spirituality and communion with the transcendental. Moholy sported the kind of overall worn by workers in modern industy. His nickel-rimned spectacles contributed further to an image of sobriety and calculation belonging to a man mistrustful of the emotions, more at home among machines than human beings.’ Following an argument with Hannes Meyer, <a href=""entry://Gropius, Walter""><span class=""links"">Gropius's </span></a> successor as Director, Moholy-Nagy resigned from the Bauhaus in 1928. He worked for some years in Berlin, chiefly on stage design and experimental film, then moved to Amsterdam and in 1935 to London, where he was a member of the <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivist</span></a> group represented by the publication <i><a href=""entry://Circle""><span class=""links"">Circle</i></a></span>. In London he also began the constructions which he named ‘Space Modulators’ and worked on designs for the film <i>Things to Come</i> (1936), produced by his fellow Hungarian Alexander Korda. In 1937 he emigrated to Chicago, where he became Director of the short-lived New Bauhaus (1937&ndash;8), then founded his own School of Design (1939; it changed its name to Institute of Design in 1944), directing it until his death. Moholy-Nagy was one of the most inventive and versatile artists in the Constructivist school, pioneering especially in the artistic uses of light, movement (see <a href=""entry://Kinetic art""><span class=""links"">KINETIC ART</span></a>), photography, film, and plastic materials, and he was one of the most influential teachers of the 20th cent. He also was an emphatic advocate of the Constructivist doctrine that so-called <a href=""entry://fine arts""><span class=""links"">fine art</span></a> must be integrated with the total environment. His views were most fully expressed in his post-humously published book <i>Vision in Motion</i> (1947)."

He painted frescos in Roman churches and palaces, and his best-known painting is the striking <i>Barbary Pirate</i> (Louvre, Paris, 1650), but his most characteristic works are fairly small canvases with religious or mythological figures set in landscapes (two examples are in the National Gallery, London). They are somewhat reminiscent of Albani, but much freer, and closer in spirit to Salvator <a href=""entry://Rosa, Salvator""><span class=""links"">Rosa </span></a>, with whom Mola was one of the chief representatives of a distinctively romantic strain in Roman painting in the mid 17th cent."

It is not known if these three painters worked together, if they arrived at similar solutions independently, or if one of them began experiments with monochromatic pictures of dunes and cottages and the others followed his lead. However, <i>The Sand Dune</i> (Herzog-Anton-Ulrich Museum, Brunswick, 1626) by Molyn is earlier than any comparable dated picture by van Goyen or Ruysdael . Molyn's later career was less distinguished, and he seems then to have worked more as a draughtsman than a painter. He also etched."

<b>Momper, Joos</b>
<i>(or Jodocus ) II de</i><div class=""content""><i>(1564&ndash;1634/5).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish landscape painter, the outstanding member of a family of artists. He worked in his native Antwerp, where he became a master in the guild in 1581, but mountains are so much a prevailing theme in his work that it seems likely he crossed the Alps to Italy at some time in his career. His chief inspiration was <a href=""entry://Bruegel, Pieter""><span class=""links"">Bruegel </span></a> and his work stands half-way between the constructed landscapes of the 16th cent. and the naturalistic landscapes of the 17th cent. He enriched the traditional colour scheme of 16th cent. landscape painting, hitherto largely confined to cool blues and greens, until it ranged from brown to grey via green, yellow, and blue. Judging by the great number of extant pictures in his manner, his work must have enjoyed great popularity. They vary greatly in quality, but the best works that are indisputably from his own hand, for example the majestic <i>Winter Landscape with the Flight into Egypt</i> (Ashmolean, Oxford), show that he was one of the greatest landscape painters of his period and worthy to be mentioned in the same breath as Bruegel. His style seems to have changed little and his work is difficult to date. Figures in his paintings are often the work of other artists, notably Jan <a href=""entry://Brueghel, Jan""><span class=""links"">Brueghel I</span></a>."
"Mondrian, Piet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Mondrian, Piet</b><div class=""content""><i>(1872&ndash;1944).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter, one of the most important figures in the development of <a href=""entry://abstract art""><span class=""links"">abstract art</span></a>. His early painting was naturalistic and direct, often delicate in colour, but between 1907 and 1910 his painting took on a <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolist</span></a> character, partly under the influence of <a href=""entry://Toorop, Jan""><span class=""links"">Toorop </span></a> and perhaps partly owing to his conversion to Theosophy. In 1911 he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> and executed a now famous series of paintings on the theme of a tree, in which the image became progressively more abstract (<i>Flowering Apple Tree</i>, Gemeente Mus., The Hague, 1912). He returned to Holland in 1914 and remained there during the war, continuing his study of abstraction and developing theories about the horizontal-vertical axes. With Theo van <a href=""entry://Doesburg, Theo van""><span class=""links"">Doesburg </span></a> he founded the group <a href=""entry://Stijl, De""><span class=""links"">De Stijl</span></a> in 1917 and became the main exponent of a new kind of rigorously geometrical abstract painting that he named <a href=""entry://Neo-Plasticism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Plasticism</span></a>, in which he limited himself to rectangular forms and a range of colours consisting of the three primaries plus black, white, and grey. From 1919 to 1938 Mondrian lived in Paris, where in 1931 he joined the <a href=""entry://Abstraction-Création""><span class=""links"">Abstraction-Création</span></a> group. For many years he had struggled to earn a living, but in the 1920s he gradually became known to an international circle of admirers, including the American Katherine <a href=""entry://Dreier, Katherine S.""><span class=""links"">Dreier </span></a> (from 1926). In 1938 he left Paris because of the threat of war, and for the next two years he lived in London, near Naum <a href=""entry://Gabo, Naum""><span class=""links"">Gabo </span></a> and Ben <a href=""entry://Nicholson, Ben""><span class=""links"">Nicholson </span></a>. In 1940 he settled in New York, where he died. In America he developed a more colourful style, with syncopated rhythms that reflect his interest in jazz and dancing (<i>Broadway Boogie-Woogie</i>, MOMA, 1942&ndash;3); he was noted for his immaculate tidiness and rather fussy lifestyle, but he had a passion for social dancing and took lessons in fashionable steps. Mondrian's concept of ‘pure plasticity’ consisted partly in the simplification of the means of expression to the bare essentials. He not only banished representation and three-dimensional picture-space but also the curved line, sensuous qualities of texture and surface, and the sensuous appeal of colour. This restrictedness he regarded as a sort of mystical pursuit of the Absolute, which he justified in terms of his Theosophical beliefs. His extensive influence&mdash;expressed through his writings as well as his paintings&mdash;was not limited to artists whose style had direct affinities with his own. He also had a profound influence on much industrial, decorative, and advertisement art from the 1930s onwards."
"Monet, Claude","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Monet, Claude</b><div class=""content""><i>(1840&ndash;1926).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> painter. He is regarded as the archetypal Impressionist in that his devotion to the ideals of the movement was unwavering throughout his long career, and it is fitting that one of his pictures&mdash;<i>Impression: Sunrise</i> (Musée Marmottan, Paris, 1872)&mdash;gave the group its name. His youth was spent in Le Havre, where he first excelled as a <a href=""entry://caricature""><span class=""links"">caricaturist</span></a> but was then converted to landscape painting by his early mentor <a href=""entry://Boudin, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Boudin </span></a>, from whom he derived his firm predilection for painting out of doors. In 1859 he studied in Paris at the <a href=""entry://académie""><i><span class=""links"">Académie</i></span></a> Suisse and formed a friendship with <a href=""entry://Pissarro, Camille""><span class=""links"">Pissarro </span></a>. After two years' military service in Algiers, he returned to Le Havre and met <a href=""entry://Jongkind, Johan Barthold""><span class=""links"">Jongkind </span></a>, to whom he said he owed ‘the definitive education of my eye’. He then, in 1862, entered the studio of <a href=""entry://Gleyre, Charles""><span class=""links"">Gleyre </span></a> in Paris and there met <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Sisley, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Sisley </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Bazille, Frédéric""><span class=""links"">Bazille </span></a>, with whom he was to form the nucleus of the Impressionist group. Monet's devotion to painting out of doors is illustrated by the famous story concerning one of his most ambitious early works, <i>Women in the Garden</i> (Musée d'Orsay, Paris, 1866&ndash;7). The picture is about 2.5m. high and to enable him to paint all of it outside he had a trench dug in the garden so the canvas could be raised or lowered by pulleys to the height he required.<a href=""entry://Courbet, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Courbet </span></a> visited him when he was working on it and said Monet would not paint even the leaves in the background unless the lighting conditions were exactly right.<br class=""nLine"" />During the Franco-Prussian War (1870&ndash;1) Monet took refuge in England with Pissarro: he studied the work of <a href=""entry://Constable, John""><span class=""links"">Constable</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Turner, J. M. W.""><span class=""links"">Turner </span></a>, painted the Thames and London parks, and met the dealer <a href=""entry://Durand-Ruel, Paul""><span class=""links"">Durand-Ruel </span></a>, who was to become one of the great champions of the Impressionists. From 1871 to 1876 he lived at Argenteuil, a village on the Seine near Paris, and here were painted some of the most joyous and famous works of the Impressionist movement, not only by Monet, but by his visitors <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a>, Renoir, and Sisley. In 1878 he moved to Vétheuil and in 1883 he settled at Giverny, also on the Seine, but about 40 miles from Paris. After having experienced extreme poverty, Monet began to prosper. By 1890 he was successful enough to buy the house at Giverny he had previously rented and in 1892 he married his mistress, with whom he had begun an affair in 1876, three years before the death of his first wife. From 1890 he concentrated on series of pictures in which he painted the same subject at different times of the day in different lights- <i>Haystacks or Grainstacks</i> (1890&ndash;1) <i>and Rouen Cathedral</i> (1891&ndash;5) are the best known. He continued to travel widely, visiting London and Venice several times (and also Norway as a guest of Queen Christiana), but increasingly his attention was focused on the celebrated water-garden he created at Giverny, which served as the theme for the series of paintings on <i>Water-lilies</i> that began in 1899 and grew to dominate his work completely (in 1914 he had a special studio built in the grounds of his house so he could work on the huge canvases). In his final years he was troubled by failing eyesight, but he painted until the end. He was enormously prolific and many major galleries have examples of his work."
"monotype","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>monotype</b>.<div class=""content"">A method of making a print (and the print so made) in which a design is painted (usually in oil colours) on a flat sheet of metal or glass and is then transferred directly to a sheet of paper. With glass plates it is necessary to apply the pressure to the back of the paper by hand; in other cases monotypes may be printed in a press. Strictly speaking, only one print may be taken by this process (hence the term ‘monotype’); in practice the colour on the slab may be reinforced after printing and another one or two impressions taken, although they will differ considerably from the first. Various modifications of the principle are known. G.

<b>Moore, Henry</b><div class=""content""><i>(1898&ndash;1986).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English sculptor and graphic artist. He is recognized as one of the greatest sculptors of the 20th cent. and from the late 1940s until his death was unchallenged as the most celebrated British artist of his time. He was born in Yorkshire, the son of a miner, and after service in the British Army in the First World War, he trained at Leeds School of Art and from there obtained a scholarship to the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a> in 1919. After completing his training in 1924, he taught there until 1931. From 1932 to 1939 he was the first head of sculpture in a new department at Chelsea School of Art. During the 1930s he lived in Hampstead in the same area as Ben <a href=""entry://Nicholson, Ben""><span class=""links"">Nicholson </span></a>, Barbara <a href=""entry://Hepworth, Dame Barbara""><span class=""links"">Hepworth </span></a>, the critic Herbert <a href=""entry://Read, Sir Herbert ""><span class=""links"">Read </span></a>, and others of the avant-garde. In 1940, after the bombing of his studio, he moved to Much Hadham in Hertfordshire, where he lived for the rest of his life. Most of Moore's early work was carved, rejecting the academic tradition of modelling in favour of the doctrine of truth to material, according to which the nature of the stone or wood&mdash;its shape, texture, and so on&mdash;was part of the conception of the work. He also rejected the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> conception of beauty and put in its place an ideal of vital force and formal vigour which he found exemplified in much ancient sculpture (Mexican, Sumerian, etc.), which he studied in the British Museum, and also in the frescos of <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a>, which he saw in Italy in 1925 in the course of a travelling scholarship.

Although he produced some purely abstract pieces, his work was almost always based on forms in the natural world&mdash;often the human figure, but also, for example, bones, pebbles, and shells. The reclining female figure and the mother and child were among his perennial themes. By the late 1930s Moore was well known in informed circles as the leading avant-garde sculptor in England (Kenneth <a href=""entry://Clark, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Clark </span></a> and Jacob <a href=""entry://Epstein, Sir Jacob""><span class=""links"">Epstein </span></a> were among his early supporters), but his wider fame was established by the poignant drawings he did as an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a> (1940&ndash;2) of people sheltering from air-raids in underground stations. Subsequently his reputation grew rapidly (particularly after he won the International Sculpture Prize at the 1948 Venice <a href=""entry://Biennale""><span class=""links"">Biennale</span></a>), and from the 1950s he carried out many public commissions in Britain and elsewhere. During this time there were major changes in his way of working. Bronze took over from stone as his preferred medium and he often worked on a very large scale. There was a tendency also for his works to be composed of several elements grouped together rather than made up of a single object. Some critics discerned a falling away of his powers in his later work, marked in particular by a tendency towards inflated rhetoric, but for others he remained a commanding figure to the end. A man of great integrity and unaffected charm, Moore was held in almost universally high regard. The tributes paid after his death made it clear that he was widely regarded not only as one of the greatest artists of the century, but also as one of the greatest Englishmen. He was a lucid and perceptive commentator on his own and other people's sculpture, and his writings have been collected as <i>Henry Moore on Sculpture</i> (1966). His work is represented in collections of modern art throughout the world; among those with particularly fine holdings are the Tate Gallery, London, and the Moore Sculpture Gallery (opened in 1982) at Leeds City Art Gallery."

He was the most successful court portraitist of his day, leading an international career that took him to England, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. In England he painted a portrait of Mary Tudor (Prado, Madrid, 1554, and other versions), for which he is said to have been knighted&mdash;he is sometimes known as Sir Anthony More (it is thus he appears in <i>The Dictionary of National Biography</i>) and the Spanish version of his name, Antonio Moro, is also commonly used. His work shows little variation throughout his career; sitters are shown life-size or a little larger, half-, three-quarter-, or full-length, turned slightly to the side, with an air of unruffled dignity. His composition is simple and strong and his grasp of character firm but undemonstrative. He owed much to <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a>, but his surfaces are much more detailed and polished in the northern manner.

His pictures are usually fairly small and he concentrated on devotional images such as the <i>Mater Dolorosa or Ecce Homo</i> painted with intense spirituality.

Although he had some success at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a>, he had no need to court this as he had private means, and much of his life was spent in seclusion. In 1892 he became a professor at the École des <a href=""entry://Beaux-Arts, École Nationale Supérieure des""><span class=""links"">Beaux-Arts</span></a> and proved an inspired teacher, bringing out his pupils' individual talents rather than trying to impose ideas on them.

<b>Morelli, Giovanni</b><div class=""content""><i>(1816&ndash;91).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian critic. He trained as a physician, but from 1873 he began to write on Italian art. As a student at Munich he had acquired such a command of German that he preferred to write in that language, and at first he published his work as supposed translations from the Russian of Ivan Lermolieff (an anagram of his surname with a Russian termination). Morelli concentrated mainly on the problems of attribution and claimed to have reduced this to scientific principles. He maintained that an artist's method of dealing with subordinate details, such as the treatment of fingernails or ears (here his anatomical training was useful), is tantamount to a signature and that by systematic study of such details attribution can be put beyond doubt. This method, still sometimes referred to as ‘Morellian criticism’, was influential on connoisseurs such as <a href=""entry://Berenson, Bernard""><span class=""links"">Berenson </span></a>, but it has proved much less productive of scientific certainly than Morelli hoped; it is now felt that we recognize the work of individual artists more by general effect than by details, and that the details rather than the general effect are what an imitator will be able to reproduce most convincingly. Morelli himself made some brilliant attributions, but also some noteworthy blunders. He was a patriot and a politician as well as a writer (he declined the directorship of the <a href=""entry://Uffizi""><span class=""links"">Uffizi</span></a> because he did not want to be distracted from his political duties), and he secured the passing of an act forbidding the sale of works of art from religious or public institutions.

However, his portraits, although much less numerous, are considered to be generally of higher quality and of greater importance historically. It seems likely that he introduced the independent full-length portrait to Italy, for although <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> credits Titian with this distinction, Moretto's <i>Portrait of a Gentleman</i> of 1526 in the National Gallery, London, antedates any known example by Titian by several years.

As a student at Oxford University he formed a lifelong friendship with <a href=""entry://Burne-Jones, Sir Edward Coley""><span class=""links"">Burne-Jones </span></a> and began to write poetry and to study medieval architecture. In 1856 he was apprenticed to the architect G. E.

In 1859, Morris married Jane Burden, who appears in numerous paintings by Rossetti as the archetypal <i>femme fatale</i>; Morris's architect friend Philip Webb built the famous Red House, Bexley Heath, for the couple. With Webb, Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Ford Madox <a href=""entry://Brown, Ford Madox""><span class=""links"">Brown </span></a>, P. P. Marshall (a surveyor), and Charles Faulkner (an accountant), Morris founded the manufacturing and decorating firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. in 1861. After a shaky start, the firm prospered, producing furniture, tapestry, stained glass, furnishing fabrics, carpets, and much more. Morris's wallpaper designs are particularly well known (they are still produced commercially today) and Burne-Jones did some superb work for the firm, particularly in stained glass and tapestry design. Morris repudiated the concept of <a href=""entry://fine arts""><span class=""links"">fine art</span></a> and his company was based on the ideal of a medieval guild, in which the craftsman both designed and executed the work. He defined art as ‘man's expression of his joy in labour’, and saw it as an essential part of human well-being. As a socialist he wished to produce art for the masses, but there was an inherent flaw in his ambition, for only the rich could afford his expensive hand-made products. His ideal of universal craftsmanship and his glorification of manual skill thus proved unrealistic in so far as it ran counter to or failed to come to terms with modern machine production. But his work bore lasting fruit, in England (see <a href=""entry://Arts and Crafts Movement""><span class=""links"">ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT</span></a>) and abroad, in the emphasis which it laid upon the social importance of good design and fine workmanship in every walk of life. He also had an important part in the development of the private printing-press, through the founding of the <a href=""entry://Kelmscott Press""><span class=""links"">Kelmscott Press</span></a>.

He took up painting seriously in 1941 after studying aesthetics at Stanford and Harvard universities and the erudite approach of his writings played a large part in setting the serious intellectual tone of the Abstract Expressionist movement. Motherwell was unusual among Abstract Expressionists in that his painting was essentially abstract from the beginning of his career. However, his work was deeply influenced by <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a> (particularly in the use of <a href=""entry://automatism""><span class=""links"">automatism</span></a>) and there is often a suggestion of figuration in the large amorphous shapes and bold austere colours of his paintings. Moreover, the intellectual sensibilities he brought to his work are reflected in the inspiration from literature, history, or his personal life. For example, he painted a series of works (more than a hundred pictures) entitled <i>Elegy to the Spanish Republic.</i> By the late 1960s his style had moved towards <a href=""entry://Colour Field painting""><span class=""links"">Colour Field painting</span></a>.

"Mucha, Alphonse","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Mucha, Alphonse</b><div class=""content""><i>(1860&ndash;1939).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Czech painter and designer. He had a highly varied career, but is best known for his luxuriously flowing poster designs, which rank among the most distinctive products of the <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a> style. They often feature beautiful women, but have nothing of the morbid sexuality typical of the period. Some of the best known were made in Paris in the 1890s for the celebrated actress Sarah Bernhardt. Mucha also designed sets, costumes, and jewellery for her. He was successful in the USA also, making four journeys there between 1903 and 1922. A Chicago industrialist and Slavophile, Charles Richard Crane, sponsored his series of twenty huge paintings entitled <i>Slav Epic</i> (Moravsky Krumlov Castle, 1909&ndash;28). Although he is so strongly associated with Paris, Mucha was an ardent patriot, and in 1922 he settled in Prague. Czechoslovakia had become independent only in 1918 and Mucha did a good deal of work for the new nation (giving his services free), including designing its first banknotes and stamps. After a period of neglect a revival of interest in his work culminated in a large exhibition of paintings, posters, drawings; furniture, and jewellery at the Grand Palais, Paris, in 1980."
"Mulready William","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Mulready William </b><div class=""content""><i>(1786&ndash;1863).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Irish-born painter, active in England, the pupil and brother-in-law of John <a href=""entry://Varley, Frederick""><span class=""links"">Varley </span></a>. After undistinguished beginnings with historical <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> and landscape he turned with great success to scenes of contemporary life in the vein made popular by <a href=""entry://Wilkie, Sir David""><span class=""links"">Wilkie </span></a>. <i>The Fight Interrupted</i> (V&amp;A, London, 1816), which shows a vicar intervening between two boys who have come to blows, made his reputation and set the course for his career. Although at first his meticulous brushwork showed the influence of 17th-cent. Dutch painting, in the 1820s he began to develop a more distinctive technique, using light clear colours over a white ground. This, together with his clear draughtsmanship and the poetic quality of some of his later paintings (<i>The Sonnet</i>, V&amp;A, 1839), has led him to be seen as a precursor of the <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelites</span></a>, although they themselves rejected his work as trivial.

In principle they are not industrially produced copies of an original work hand-made by the artist himself. Indeed, in some cases the artist produces only a blueprint or instructions for the industrial process. The concept of the multiple represents a revolution of aesthetic attitude according to which craftsmanship is disparaged and works of art are no longer regarded as items for connoisseurs but as consumer goods for the masses like any other industrial product."

"Munch, Edvard","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Munch, Edvard</b><div class=""content""><i>(1863&ndash;1944).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Norwegian painter, lithographer, etcher, and wood-engraver, his country's greatest artist. He began painting in a conventional manner, but by 1884 was part of the world of bohemian artists in Christiania (now Oslo) who had advanced ideas on ethics and sexual morality, Christian <a href=""entry://Krøhg, Christian""><span class=""links"">Krøhg </span></a> being his early mentor. In 1885 he made the first of several visits to Paris, where he was influenced by the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolists</span></a> and, above all, by <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin's </span></a> use of simplified forms and non-naturalistic colours. Munch had endured a traumatic childhood (his father was almost dementedly pious and his mother and eldest sister died of consumption when he was young): ‘Illness, madness and death were the black angels that kept watch over my cradle’, he wrote, and in his paintings he gave expression to the neuroses that haunted him. Certain themes&mdash;jealousy, sickness, the awakening of sexual desire&mdash;occur again and again, and he painted extreme psychological states with an unprecedented conviction and an intensity that sometimes bordered on the frenzied.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1892 he was invited to exhibit at the Kunstlerverein (Artists' Union) in Berlin and his work caused such an uproar in the press that the exhibition was closed. The scandal made him famous overnight in Germany, so Munch moved there and from 1892 to 1908 lived mainly in Berlin with frequent stays in Norway and visits also to France and Italy. In the 1890s much of his effort went into an ambitious series of pictures that never had a definitive form and which he called the ‘Frieze of Life’&mdash;‘a poem of life, love and death’. The most famous of the paintings from the series, <i>The Shriek</i> (NG, Oslo, 1893), and several others were translated by Munch into etching, lithography, or woodcut. The woodcuts (often in colour) are particularly impressive, exploiting the grain of the wood to contribute to their rough, intense vigour. With those of Gauguin they played a major part in the 20th-cent. revival of the technique. In 1908 Munch suffered what he called ‘a complete mental collapse’, the legacy of heavy drinking, overwork, and a wretched love-affair, and after recuperating he returned permanently to Norway. He realized that his mental instability was part of his genius (‘I would not cast off my illness, for there is much in my art that I owe to it’), but he made a conscious decision to devote himself to recovery and abandoned his familiar imagery. The anguished intensity of his art disappeared and his work became much more extroverted. In landscapes, portraits, and pictures of workmen in the snow his technique grew more and more sketchy and energetic, his palette bright and vigorous. The great achievement of this period is a series of large oil paintings for the University Hall of Oslo (1910&ndash;15) exalting the positive forces of nature, science, and history. In 1916 he settled at Ekely, Oslo, thenceforth living a solitary life. In some of his later work, however, he rekindled the passion and profundity of his early years, as in the last of his numerous self-portraits, <i>Between the Clock and the Bed</i> (Munch Mus., 1940&ndash;2), in which he shows himself old and frail, hovering on the edge of eternity. At his death he left the large body of his work still in his possession to the City of Oslo to found the Munch Museum.<br class=""nLine"" />Munch ranks as one of the most powerful and influential of modern artists. His influence was particularly strong in Scandinavia and Germany, where he and van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a> are regarded as the two main sources of <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionist</span></a> art. The intensity with which he symbolized and communicated mental anguish through an unrestrained and violent distortion of colours and forms opened up new paths for art. ‘Just as <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo da Vinci </span></a> studied human anatomy and dissected corpses’, he said, ‘so I try to dissect souls.’"

These theatrical costume pieces were enormously popular with rich collectors and Munkácsy became one of the wealthiest artists of his day.

"Murillo, Bartolomé Esteban","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Murillo, Bartolomé Esteban</b><div class=""content""><i>(1617/18&ndash;82).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Spanish painter, active for almost all his life in his native Seville. His early career is not well documented, but he started working in a naturalistic <a href=""entry://tenebrism""><span class=""links"">tenebrist</span></a> style, showing the influence of <a href=""entry://Zurbarán, Francisco de""><span class=""links"">Zurbarán </span></a>. After making his reputation with a series of eleven paintings on the lives of Franciscan saints for the Franciscan monastery in Seville (1645&ndash;6, the pictures are now dispersed in Spain and elsewhere), he displaced Zurbarán as the city's leading painter and was unrivalled in this position for the rest of his life. Most of his paintings are of religious subjects, appealing strongly to popular piety and illustrating the doctrines of the Counter-Reformation church, above all the Immaculate Conception, which was his favourite theme. His mature style was very different to that seen in his early works; it is characterized by idealized figures, soft, melting forms, delicate colouring, and sweetness of expression and mood. The term <i>estilo vaporoso</i> (‘vaporous style’) is often used of it. Murillo also painted <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes of beggar children that have a similar sentimental appeal, but his fairly rare portraits are strikingly different in feeling&mdash;much more sombre and intellectual (an outstanding self-portrait is in the NG, London). In 1660, with the collaboration of <a href=""entry://Valdés Leal, Juan de""><span class=""links"">Valdés Leal </span></a> and Francisco <a href=""entry://Herrera, Francisco the Elder""><span class=""links"">Herrera </span></a> the Younger, Murillo founded an <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">academy</span></a> of painting at Seville and became its first president. He died at Seville in 1682, evidently from the after-effects of a fall from scaffolding. He had many assistants and followers, and his style continued to influence Sevillian painting into the 19th cent. His fame in the 18th cent. and early 19th cent. was enormous. With <a href=""entry://Ribera, José""><span class=""links"">Ribera </span></a> he was the only Spanish painter who was widely known outside his own country and he was ranked by many critics amongst the greatest artists of all time. Later his reputatiòn plummeted, and he was dismissed as facile and sugary, but now that his own work is being distinguished from that of his numerous imitators his star is rising again."

Muybridge became Director of Photographic Surveys to the US Government, and while surveying the Pacific coast in 1872, he was asked by the railroad magnate Leland Stanford, then Governor of California, to photograph a horse in motion, evidently to settle a bet as to whether a horse ever had all four legs off the ground simultaneously. Muybridge experimented with a battery of cameras with high-speed shutters operated by the horse itself passing across trip threads (he worked at Stanford's stud farm, and at his expense), and succeeded in proving that all four legs of a horse are indeed at times in the air simultaneously. He published his photographs in <i>The Horse in Motion</i> (1878), and then went on to study the movement of other animals, including humans, publishing his results in volumes such as <i>Animal Locomotion</i> (1887). In 1880 he invented the zoopraxiscope to project the pictures and recreate the movements he had photographed, and this he showed to scientific bodies all over Europe and America. This predecessor of the modern cinema caused a sensation.

<b>Nash, Paul</b><div class=""content""><i>(1889&ndash;1946).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, book illustrator, writer, photographer, and designer. Nash was one of the most individual British artists of his period, taking a distinguished place in the English tradition of deep attachment to the countryside whilst at the same time responding imaginatively to European modernism. He saw himself as a successor of <a href=""entry://Blake, William""><span class=""links"">Blake</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Turner, J. M. W.""><span class=""links"">Turner </span></a>. After training at the <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School he served in the First World War, was wounded, and worked as an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a>, creating memorable images of the devastation the war wrought on the countryside.

In 1933 he was the prime mover in the formation of <a href=""entry://Unit One""><span class=""links"">Unit One</span></a>, and he helped to organize and exhibited in the International Surrealist Exhibition in London in 1936. In the Second World War he was again an Official War Artist. He was already very sick with the asthmatic condition that killed him, but he produced one of the best-known works to be inspired by the conflict, <i>Totes Meer (Dead Sea)</i> (Tate Gal., London, 1940&ndash;1), which portrays shot-down aircraft with their wings looking like undulating waves. Nash was regarded as one of the finest book illustrators of his time; he also designed scenery, fabrics, and posters, and was a photographer and writer, his books including a guide to Dorset. His brother <i>John </i> (1893&ndash;1977) was also a painter and illustrator, excelling in meticulous flower drawings for botanical publications.

<b>National Gallery</b>, London.<div class=""content"">The national collection of European paintings from <i>c.</i>1300 to <i>c.</i>1900 (it also includes a few earlier pictures and has recently started to acquire works from the early 20th cent.). It was founded in 1824 when the government purchased thirty-eight paintings from the collection of John Julius Angerstein, a merchant who died in 1823. They were first displayed in his former house at 100 Pall Mall. Further bequests (including that of SirGeorge <a href=""entry://Beaumont, Sir George""><span class=""links"">Beaumont </span></a>) soon necessitated larger premises, and the present building in Trafalgar Square, designed by William Wilkins, was opened in 1838; the gallery shared the premises with the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> until 1869, by which time it had grown into one of the great collections of the world. Since then there have been various enlargements of the building and in 1991 a major extension was opened&mdash;the Sainsbury Wing, the gift of Sir John, Simon, and Timothy Sainsbury . This wing now houses the gallery's early paintings, up to about 1510. The collection as a whole now has about 2,000 pictures. This is a fairly small number compared with some of the great Continental galleries based on former royal collections, but the National Gallery's paintings surpass those of any other gallery in giving a comprehensive view of the mainstream of European painting from <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto</span></a> to <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a>. Best represented of all are the early Italian and Dutch Schools. The representation of the British School is selective because of the existence of the <a href=""entry://Tate Gallery""><span class=""links"">Tate Gallery</span></a> as a separate National Gallery of British art. Other well-known national galleries, with their dates of foundation, are: the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh (1859); the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne (1859); the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin (1864); the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa (1880); the National Gallery of Art in Washington (1937); and the Australian National Gallery in Canberra (1976)."

<b>National Portrait Gallery</b>, London.<div class=""content"">The national collection of portraits of eminent British men and women. It was founded in 1856 at the urging of the historian and politician Philip Henry Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope, who was the first chairman of the trustees. The collection was originally housed at 29 Great George Street, Westminster, and the present premises, adjoining the National Gallery, were opened in 1896. The criterion for inclusion in the gallery is the celebrity of the sitter rather than the quality of the portrait, so as works of art the pictures in the collection vary enormously, from an acknowledged masterpiece such as <a href=""entry://Holbein, Hans""><span class=""links"">Holbein's </span></a> cartoon of Henry VIII to the wholly amateurish representation of the three Brontë sisters by their brother Branwell . Nevertheless, because portraiture has played such a great part in the history of British art, many illustrious artists are well represented there. Recently the NPG has begun to commission portraits of living sitters, and since 1980 it has organized a series of annual portrait awards for artists under 40 years old. The NPG has four outstations: Montacute House in Somerset, Beningbrough Hall in Yorkshire, Gawthorpe Hall in Lancashire, and Bodelwyddan Castle in Wales. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery was established in Edinburgh in 1882, and the National Portrait Gallery in Washington in 1962."

<b>Nattier, Jean-Marc</b><div class=""content""><i>(1685&ndash;1766).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French portrait painter. His father, <i>Jean </i> (<i>c.</i>1642&ndash;1705), was a painter and his mother, <i>Marie Courtois </i> (<i>c.</i>1655&ndash;1703), was a <a href=""entry://miniature""><span class=""links"">miniaturist</span></a>. He was one of the most successful artists at the court of Louis XV, excelling in the vogue for painting women in mythological or allegorical fancy dress&mdash;or undress&mdash;transforming his matrons into goddesses (<i>Mme de Lambesc as Minerva</i>, Louvre, Paris, 1737). His portraits are little concerned with individual characterization, but they show fluency, vivacity, and a relaxed charm. He was at his best with women and has been accused of ‘painting with make-up’, a comment that suggests the pastel-like delicacy of his handling. Taste was turning against him towards the end of his career and some of his later work shows signs of fatigue. His brother <i>Jean-Baptiste</i> (1678&ndash;1726) was also a painter; he committed suicide after being expelled by the Académie."
"naturalism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>naturalism</b>.<div class=""content"">Term denoting an approach to art in which the artist endeavours to represent objects as they are empirically observed, rather than in a stylized or conceptual manner. <a href=""entry://Bellori, Giovanni Pietro""><span class=""links"">Bellori </span></a> (1672) was the first to apply the term to a particular type of painting in discussing the followers of <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio </span></a>, with reference to their doctrine of copying nature faithfully whether it seems to us ugly or beautiful. Naturalism, however, is not inconsistent with the <a href=""entry://ideal""><span class=""links"">idealization</span></a> of nature, for Greek sculpture may be naturalistic in its command of anatomy, but idealistic in that it sets up a standard of physical beauty remote from the everyday world. Nor need the term imply minute attention to detail, although this is often part of a naturalistic approach. The shade of meaning to be attached to the word can thus vary greatly according to context; when used in its broadest sense it may suggest little more than that a work is representational rather than <a href=""entry://abstract art""><span class=""links"">abstract</span></a>. The terms ‘naturalistic’ and ‘realistic’ are often used more or less synonymously, but <a href=""entry://realism""><span class=""links"">Realism</span></a> with a capital ‘r’ has a specific meaning in the history of art and should not be used loosely."

"Nazarenes","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Nazarenes</b>.<div class=""content"">A group of young, idealistic German painters of the early 19th cent. who believed that art should serve a religious or moral purpose and desired to return to the spirit of the Middle Ages. The nucleus of the group was established in 1809 when six students at the Vienna Academy formed an association called the Brotherhood of St Luke (<i>Lukasbrüder</i>), named after the patron saint of painting. The name Nazarenes was given to them derisively because of their affectation of biblical dress and hairstyles. They wished to revive the working environment as well as the spiritual sincerity of the Middle Ages, and lived and worked together in a quasi-monastic fashion. In 1810 <a href=""entry://Overbeck, Friedrich""><span class=""links"">Overbeck</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Pforr, Franz""><span class=""links"">Pforr </span></a>, and two other members moved to Rome, where they occupied the disused monastery of S. Isidoro . Here they were joined by Peter von <a href=""entry://Cornelius, Peter von""><span class=""links"">Cornelius </span></a> and others. One of their aims was the revival of monumental <a href=""entry://fresco""><span class=""links"">fresco</span></a> and they obtained two important commissions which made their work internationally known (Casa Bartholdy, 1816&ndash;17, the paintings are now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin; and Casino Massimo, Rome, 1817&ndash;29). Stylistically they were much indebted to <a href=""entry://Perugino, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Perugino </span></a>, and their work is clear and prettily coloured, but often insipid. In general, modern taste has been more sympathetic towards the Nazarenes’ simple and sensitive landscape and portrait drawings than to their ambitious and didactic figure paintings. The Nazarenes broke up as a group in the 1820s, but their ideas continued to be influential. Cornelius had moved in 1819 to Munich, where he surrounded himself with a large number of pupils and assistants who in turn carried his style to other German centres. The studio of Overbeck (the only one to remain permanently in Rome) was a meeting-place for artists from many countries (the Russian <a href=""entry://Ivanov, Alexander""><span class=""links"">Ivanov</span></a> was his friend, for example); <a href=""entry://Ingres, Jean-Auguste-Dominique""><span class=""links"">Ingres </span></a> admired him and Ford Madox <a href=""entry://Brown, Ford Madox""><span class=""links"">Brown </span></a> visited him. William <a href=""entry://Dyce, William""><span class=""links"">Dyce </span></a> introduced some of the Nazarene ideals into English art and there is a kinship of spirit with the <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelites</span></a>."
"naïve art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>naïve art</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to painting (and to a much lesser degree sculpture) produced in more or less sophisticated societies but lacking conventional expertise in representational skills. Colours are characteristically bright and non-naturalistic, perspective non-scientific, and the vision childlike or literal-minded. The term *‘<a href=""entry://primitive""><span class=""links"">primitive</span></a>’ is sometimes used more or less synonymously with naïve, but this can be confusing, as ‘primitive’ is also applied loosely to paintings of the pre-Renaissance era as well as to art of ‘uncivilized’ societies. Other terms that are sometimes used in a similar way are ‘folk’, ‘popular’, or ‘Sunday painters’, but these too have their pitfalls, not least ‘Sunday painter’, for many amateurs do not paint in a naïve style, and naïve artists (at least the successful ones) often paint as a full-time job. Sophisticated artists may also deliberately effect a naïve style, but this ‘false naïvety’ (<i>faux naïf</i>) is no more to be confused with the spontaneous quality of the true naïve than the deliberately childlike work of say <a href=""entry://Klee, Paul""><span class=""links"">Klee </span></a> or <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a> is to be confused with genuine children's drawing. Naïve art has a quality of its own that is easy to recognize but hard to define. Scottie <a href=""entry://Wilson, Scottie""><span class=""links"">Wilson </span></a> summed it up when he said ‘It's a feeling you cannot explain. You’re born with it and it just comes out.’<br class=""nLine"" />Henri <a href=""entry://Rousseau, Henri""><span class=""links"">Rousseau </span></a> was the first naïve painter to win serious critical recognition and he remains the only one who is regarded as a great master, but many others have won an honourable place in modern art. The critic Wilhelm <a href=""entry://Uhde, Wilhelm""><span class=""links"">Uhde </span></a> was mainly responsible for putting naïve painters on the map in the years after the First World War. At first their freshness and directness of vision appealed mainly to fellow artists, but a number of major group exhibitions in the 1920s and 1930s helped to develop public taste for them, notably ‘Masters of Popular Painting: Modern Primitives of Europe and America’ at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1938. Most of the early naïve painters to make reputations were French (mainly because Uhde was active in discovering and promoting them in France); they included <a href=""entry://Bauchant, André""><span class=""links"">Bauchant </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Bombois, Camille""><span class=""links"">Bombois </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Séraphine""><span class=""links"">Séraphine</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Vivin, Louis""><span class=""links"">Vivin </span></a>.

"Neo-Expressionism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Neo-Expressionism</b>.<div class=""content"">Movement in painting (and to a lesser extent sculpture) emerging in the late 1970s, characterized by intense subjectivity of feeling and aggressively raw handling of materials. Neo-Expressionist paintings are typically large and rapidly executed, sometimes with materials such as straw or broken crockery embedded in their surfaces. They are usually figurative, often with violent or doomladen subjects, but the image is sometimes almost lost in the welter of surface activity. To some extent Neo-Expressionism marked a return to more traditional forms after the ‘anything goes’ experimentation of the 1970s. Perhaps partly for this reason it was welcomed by art dealers and collectors, but critical reaction to it has been very mixed. Several exponents, above all the American Julian Schnabel (1951&ndash; ), have become rich and famous, but to many critics their work seems deliberately bad, ignoring all conventional ideas of skill; indeed the term <i>‘Bad Painting’</i> (from the title of an exhibition at the New Museum, New York, in 1978) has been applied to certain works in the vein (Punk Art and Stupid Painting are alternative terms). Distinguishing between good <i>‘Bad Painting’</i> (i.e. that which deliberately cultivates crudeness for its emotional value) and bad <i>‘Bad Painting’</i> (something that is just a mess) is an unenviable critical task. Neo-Expressionism has flourished mainly in Germany (where its exponents are sometimes called Neue Wilden&mdash;‘New Wild Ones’), Italy, and the USA. Leading exponents include: in Germany, Georg <a href=""entry://Baselitz, Georg""><span class=""links"">Baselitz </span></a> and Anselm Kiefer (1945&ndash; ); in Italy, Sandro Chia (1946&ndash; ) and Francesco Clemente (1952&ndash; ); in the USA, David Salle (1952&ndash; ) and Julian Schnabel .

"Neo-Impressionism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Neo-Impressionism</b>.<div class=""content"">Term coined by the critic Félix Fénéon in 1886 for a movement in French painting that was both a development from <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a> and a reaction against it. Like the Impressionists, the exponents of Neo-Impressionism were fundamentally concerned with the representation of light and colour, but whereas Impressionism was empirical and spontaneous, Neo-Impressionism was based on scientific principles and resulted in highly formalized compositions. <a href=""entry://Seurat, Georges""><span class=""links"">Seurat </span></a> was the outstanding artist of the movement; <a href=""entry://Signac, Paul""><span class=""links"">Signac </span></a> (who was its main theoretician) and (for a while) Camille <a href=""entry://Pissarro, Camille""><span class=""links"">Pissarro </span></a> were the other leading adherents. All three showed Neo-Impressionist pictures at the final Impressionist exhibition in 1886. The theoretical basis of Neo-Impressionism was <a href=""entry://divisionism""><span class=""links"">divisionism</span></a>, with its associated technique of <a href=""entry://pointillism""><span class=""links"">pointillism</span></a>&mdash;the use of dots of pure colour applied in such a way that when seen from an appropriate distance they achieve a maximum of luminosity. In each painting the dots were of a uniform size, chosen to harmonize with the scale of the work. In Seurat's paintings, this approach combined solidity and clarity of form with a vibrating intensity of light; in the hands of lesser artists, it often produced works that look rigid and contrived. Neo-Impressionism was short-lived, but it had a significant influence on several major artists of the late 19th and early 20th cents., notably <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin </span></a>, van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri de""><span class=""links"">Toulouse-Lautrec </span></a>."
"Neo-Plasticism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Neo-Plasticism</b>.<div class=""content"">Term coined by Piet <a href=""entry://Mondrian, Piet""><span class=""links"">Mondrian </span></a> for his style of austerely geometrical abstract painting and more broadly for the philosophical ideas about art that his work embodied. He claimed that art should be ‘denaturalized’, by which he meant that it must be purely abstract, with no representational relation to the natural world. To this end he limited the elements of pictorial design to the straight line and the rectangle (the right angles in a strictly horizontal&mdash;vertical relation to the frame) and to the primary colours&mdash;blue, red, and yellow&mdash;together with black, white, and grey. In this way he thought that one might escape the particular and achieve expression of an ideal of universal harmony. Mondrian took the term ‘nieuwe beelding’ from the writings of DrMatthieu Schoenmaekers, a Dutch author of popular books on philosophy and religion, whom he admired for a time but later considered to be a charlatan. It was used in Mondrian's first published work, the long essay ‘De Nieuwe Beelding in de Schilderkunst’ (Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art), which appeared in eleven instalments of the periodical <a href=""entry://Stijl, De""><span class=""links"">De Stijl</span></a> in 1917&ndash;18."

Other artists whose work has been dubbed Neo-Romantic include the poet Dylan Thomas, the film director Michael Powell, and photographers such as Bill Brandt and Edwin Smith . The term Neo-Romanticism has also been applied to certain painters working in France in the 1930s, notably <a href=""entry://Berman, Eugene""><span class=""links"">Berman </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Tchelitchew, Pavel""><span class=""links"">Tchelitchew </span></a>, who typically painted dream like imaginary landscapes with rather mournful figures.

"Neoclassicism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Neoclassicism</b>.<div class=""content"">The dominant movement in European art and architecture in the late 18th and early 19th cents., characterized by a desire to re-create the spirit and forms of the art of Greece and Rome. A new and more scientific interest in <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> antiquity, greatly stimulated by the discoveries at Pompeii (where excavations began in 1748) and Herculaneum, was one of the features of the movement, and it is also seen as mounting a reaction against the light-hearted and frivolous <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> style. The order, clarity, and reason of Greek and Roman art appealed greatly in the Age of Englightenment, and the Neoclassical style could have moral as well as aesthetic implications, particularly in France, where it is associated with the Revolution and a desire to restore ancient Roman values into civil life. It is, indeed, in the paintings of <a href=""entry://David, Jacques-Louis""><span class=""links"">David </span></a>, with their antique grandeur and simplicity of form, and their heroic severity of tone, that Neoclassicism finds its purest expression, but the style was born and had its focal point in Rome. <a href=""entry://Mengs, Anton Raffael""><span class=""links"">Mengs </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Winckelmann, Johann Joachim""><span class=""links"">Winckelmann </span></a> were in the vanguard of the movement there, and other leading figures from all over Europe&mdash;<a href=""entry://Canova, Antonio""><span class=""links"">Canova </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Flaxman, John""><span class=""links"">Flaxman </span></a>, Gavin <a href=""entry://Hamilton, Gavin""><span class=""links"">Hamilton </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Thorvaldsen ""><span class=""links"">Thorvaldsen </span></a>&mdash;spent the main or important parts of their careers in the city.

Because Neoclassicism placed respect for approved models above personal expression it was a style that particularly lent itself to having this kind of international currency. The 18th cent. saw a great growth in the publication of lavishly illustrated volumes on classical art, architecture and antiquities, and this helped to spread the ideals of the movement. There was, however, considerable stylistic variation within Neoclassicism; Angelica <a href=""entry://Kauffmann, Angelica""><span class=""links"">Kauffmann </span></a>, for example, painted in a delicate and pretty manner that is far removed from David's severity. Moreover, there is no firm dividing line between Neoclassicism and <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a>, even though in some ways they appear to be at opposite spiritual poles. In the revival of interest in antique art, archaeological zeal could easily give way to a nostalgic yearning for a lost Golden Age, and the term ‘Romantic Classicism’ is sometimes used to characterize an aspect of Neoclassicism in which an interest in antiquity is tinged with Romantic feeling. In fact the antipathy between Classics and Romantics (exemplified by <a href=""entry://Ingres, Jean-Auguste-Dominique""><span class=""links"">Ingres </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a>, for example) was unknown before the 19th cent., and it was only in the mid 19th cent., at a time when the antique revival style was out of fashion, that the word ‘Neoclassicism’ was coined&mdash;originally a pejorative term with suggestions of lifelessness and impersonality. These negative connotations have clung tenaciously to the term, and the ardent aspirations of the founders of Neoclassicism have been obscured by the fact that the more decorative aspects of the movement&mdash;Wedgwood pottery, for example&mdash;have become more closely associated with the word in the public consciousness than have the great masterpieces of David and Canova .<br class=""nLine"" />Neoclassicism is related to but can be distinguished from Greek Taste, which was a fairly superficial fashion for Greek-inspired decoration, and from the Greek Revival, which in architecture was a movement expressing a new interest in the simplicity and gravity of ancient Greek buildings. It began seriously in the 1790s and culminated in the 1820s and 1830s. Greek architecture became widely known in the west only around 1750&ndash;60 and in the early days of Neoclassicism it was regarded as primitive and few architects cared to imitate it."

His work included landscapes, urban scenes, figure compositions, and flowers, but he found his ideal subjects during the First World War. He served in France with the Red Cross and the Royal Army Medical Corps, 1914&ndash;16, before being invalided out, and his harsh, steely images of life and death in the trenches met with great acclaim when he held a one-man exhibition at the Leicester Gallery, London, in 1916. Stylistically they drew on certain <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a> as well as Futurist ideas, but they are closer to the work of the <a href=""entry://Vorticism""><span class=""links"">Vorticists</span></a> (with whom he had exhibited in 1915). In 1917 Nevinson returned to France as an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a>, and he was the first to make drawings from the air. Some of his work was considered too horrific and was censored, but a second one-man exhibition at the Leicester Gallery in 1918 was another triumph. At the end of the war Nevinson renounced Futurism and his later, more conventional paintings are a sad anticlimax; an example is <i>Twentieth Century</i> (Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne), a turgid attempt to portray a world on the brink of catastrophe."

It was given currency by an exhibition entitled ‘New Image Painting’ at the Whitney Museum, New York, in 1978. The accompanying catalogue unhelpfully informs us that the New Image painters ‘felt free to manipulate the image on canvas so that it can be experienced as a physical object, an abstract configuration, a psychological associative, a receptacle for applied paint, an analytically systemized exercise, an ambiguous quasi-narrative, a specifically non-specific experience, a vehicle for formalist explorations or combinations of any’.

The name was coined by the critic Edmund Gosse in a series of four articles, ‘The New Sculpture, 1879&ndash;1894’, published in the <i>Art Journal</i> in 1894. Leading representatives of the trend include Gilbert Bayes (1872&ndash;1953), Alfred Drury (1856&ndash;1944), Edward Onslow Ford (1852&ndash;1901), Sir George <a href=""entry://Frampton, Sir George""><span class=""links"">Frampton </span></a>, Sir Alfred <a href=""entry://Gilbert, Sir Alfred""><span class=""links"">Gilbert </span></a>, the Australian-born Sir Bertram Mackennal (1863&ndash;1931), Sir William Reynolds-Stephens (1862&ndash;1943), Sir Hamo <a href=""entry://Thornycroft, Sir Hamo""><span class=""links"">Thornycroft </span></a>, Albert Toft (1862&ndash;1949), and Derwent Wood (1871&ndash;1926). Their archetypal product was the ‘ideal’ free-standing figure, often with imagery drawn from mythology or poetry. Most typically these ideal figures were in bronze, but polychromy&mdash;using such materials as ivory and coloured stones&mdash;was also a feature of the New Sculpture. Although the New Sculpture did not survive the First World War as a major force, some of the practitioners went on working in the idiom long after this."

One of the attractions of Newlyn was the mild climate, which made it particularly suitable for outdoor work, and Forbes and his associates were among the pioneers of <a href=""entry://plein air""><span class=""links"">plein-air</span></a> painting in Britain.

During the 1930s he had a hard time financially; the Depression almost ruined his father's clothing business, and unlike most American painters of the time Newman did not work for the <a href=""entry://Federal Art Project""><span class=""links"">Federal Art Project</span></a>, being unwilling to accept State hand-outs. Part of his living came from teaching art in high schools. He destroyed most of his early work and stopped painting in the early 1940s, but he began again in 1944, and in the second half of the 1940s evolved a distinctive style of mystical abstraction&mdash;he considered ‘the sublime’ to be his ultimate subject matter. The work with which he announced this style was <i>Onement I</i> (private collection, 1948), a monochromatic canvas of dark red with a single stripe of lighter red running down the middle. Such stripes (or ‘zips’ as Newman preferred to call them) became a characteristic feature of his work. By the time he painted <i>Onement I</i> Newman already had a reputation as a controversialist and a spokesman for avant-garde art (in catalogue essays and in articles in journals). In 1949 he painted his first wall-size pictures (he was one of the pioneers of the very large format) and in 1950 he had his first one-man exhibition, at the Betty <a href=""entry://Parsons, Betty""><span class=""links"">Parsons</span></a> gallery. This was coolly received by critics and fellow artists, and by the mid-1950s his very spare style had separated him from the predominantly <a href=""entry://Gestural painting""><span class=""links"">Gestural</span></a> idiom of his colleagues. For a time he became a somewhat marginalized figure and he stopped painting in 1956. He had a heart attack in 1957, but the following year a resurgence began with a series of paintings in black and white, and in the last decade of his life his reputation soared and his output was prolific. From 1965 he made steel sculptures (vertical strips recalling his paintings) and in his late years he also experimented with <a href=""entry://shaped canvas""><span class=""links"">shaped canvases</span></a>, painting several triangular pictures."

<b>Nicholson, Ben</b><div class=""content""><i>(1894&ndash;1982).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter and maker of painted <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">reliefs</span></a>, one of the most distinguished pioneers of abstract art in Britain. From his father, Sir William <a href=""entry://Nicholson, Sir William""><span class=""links"">Nicholson </span></a>, he inherited a feeling for simple and fastidious still lifes, which with landscapes made up the bulk of his early work. They show him responding to the innovations of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, using the standard Cubist repertoire of objects such as jugs and glasses and arranging them as flat shapes on the picture plane. In 1933, during one of the several long stays in Paris he made at this time, Nicholson made the first of a series of white reliefs using only right angles and circles (<i>White Relief</i>, Tate, London, 1935). They show the influence of <a href=""entry://Mondrian, Piet""><span class=""links"">Mondrian </span></a> (whom Nicholson met in Paris in 1934) and were the most uncompromising examples of abstract art that had been made by a British artist up to that date. By this time he was recognized as being at the forefront of the modern movement in England; he was a member of <a href=""entry://Unit One""><span class=""links"">Unit One</span></a> and one of the editors of <i><a href=""entry://Circle""><span class=""links"">Circle</i></a></span>. In 1932 he married Barbara <a href=""entry://Hepworth, Dame Barbara""><span class=""links"">Hepworth </span></a> (they were divorced in 1951) and in 1939 moved with her to <a href=""entry://St Ives School""><span class=""links"">St Ives</span></a>, where with John <a href=""entry://Piper, John""><span class=""links"">Piper </span></a> and others he became the centre of a local art movement. After the war his international reputation grew and he won many prestigious awards. His late work moved freely between abstraction and figuration. From 1958 he lived in Switzerland. Nicholson's first wife, <i>Winifred Nicholson </i> (1893&ndash;1981), was a painter of distinction. She is best known for her flower paintings, but she also did other subjects and abstracts, all her work showing her joy in colour and light."

<b>Nolan, Sir Sidney</b><div class=""content""><i>(1917&ndash;92).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The most internationally famous of Australian painters. He turned from odd jobs to art after attending night classes in his native Melbourne, and became a full-time painter when he was 21. His early work was abstract, but while serving in the Australian army (1941&ndash;5) he painted a series of land-scapes of the Wimmera District of Victoria that gave the first unmistakable signs of the originality of his vision, capturing the heat and emptiness of the bush. In 1946 he began a series of paintings on the notorious bushranger Ned Kelly, who had become a legendary figure in Australian folk history, and it was with these works that he made his name. He returned to the Kelly theme throughout his career and he also drew on other events from Australian history. In such works Nolan created a distinctive idiom to express this novel Australian subject matter and memorably portrayed the hard, dry beauty of the desert landscape. Technically, his work is remarkable for the lush fluidity of his brushwork and sometimes he painted on glass or other smooth materials. Nolan first visited Europe in 1950 (in that year he had his first London exhibition) and from that time he lived mainly in England and travelled widely. Apart from Australian themes, he was inspired by journeys to Antarctica and New Guinea, for example, as well as by literary subjects such as the legend of Leda and the Swan."

Initially he used concentric circles on a square canvas. This was followed by a chevron motif, sometimes on a diamond or lozenge-shaped canvas, and this again was gradually lengthened into horizontal stripes running across a canvas of a very long rectangular format.

"Nolde, Emil","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Nolde, Emil</b><div class=""content""><i>(1867&ndash;1956).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German painter and graphic artist, one of the most powerful representatives of <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a>. Born of a peasant family, he was originally trained as a wood-carver and came late to artistic maturity. His studies took him from his native North Germany to Munich and Paris, and from 1905 to 1907 he was a member of the <a href=""entry://Brücke, Die""><span class=""links"">Brücke</span></a> in Dresden, but he was essentially an isolated figure, standing apart from his great German contemporaries. He moved around a good deal in Germany and was well travelled elsewhere (in 1913&ndash;14 he visited Russia, the Far East, and the South Sea islands as part of an ethnographic expedition), but at times he lived almost like a hermit. His travel broadened his knowledge of the kind of <a href=""entry://primitive""><span class=""links"">primitive</span></a> art that was then beginning to excite avant-garde artists, but Nolde had already established the essential features of his style before his contact with such art, and when the term ‘primitive’ is applied to his work it refers to its brutal force, not to any exotic trappings. He was a deeply religious man and is now famous for his paintings of Old and New Testament subjects, in which he expresses intense emotion through violent colour, radically simplified drawing, and grotesque distortion. The majority of his pictures, however, were landscapes, and he was also one of the outstanding 20th-cent. exponents of flower painting, working with gloriously vivid colour, often in watercolour. He was also a prolific etcher and lithographer. Although he was a member of the Nazi Party, he was declared a <a href=""entry://degenerate art""><span class=""links"">degenerate</span></a> artist by the Nazis and in 1941 forbidden to paint. He did, however, execute small watercolours in secret (these are called the ‘unpainted pictures’) and from these made larger oils after the war. From 1926 he lived at Seebüll, where there is now a Nolde Foundation that has an outstanding collection of his work."

He was a pupil of <a href=""entry://Scheemakers, Peter""><span class=""links"">Scheemakers </span></a>. From 1760 to 1770 he worked in Rome, making a handsome living copying, restoring, faking, and dealing in <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> sculpture. He also made a few portrait busts including that of Laurence Sterne (NPG, 1766), a splendid character study in the antique manner, and on his return to England it was chiefly as a portraitist that he built up his great reputation and fortune (he left £200,000 at his death). His finest portraits are vivacious and brilliantly characterized, but there are many inferior studio copies of his more popular works. He also made statues in a slightly erotic antique manner, and had a large practice as a tomb sculptor. Nollekens and his wife were well-known figures in London's artistic circles and were notorious skinflints. The life by his pupil and disappointed executor J. T. Smith (1766&ndash;1833), <i>Nollekens and his Times</i> (1828), gives a remarkable picture of their meanness and has been described by Rupert Gunnis (<i>Dictionary of British Sculptors</i> 1660&ndash;1851, 1953) as probably ‘the most candid, pitiless and uncomplimentary biography in the English language’."

In the 1950s he returned to architecture, now advocating a more ‘organic’ approach inspired in part by Frank Lloyd Wright . His most celebrated work in this vein is the Library of the National University in Mexico City (1951&ndash;3) in which a modern structural design is completely covered externally in mosaics of his own design symbolically representing the history of Mexican culture. In 1953&ndash;6 O'Gorman built a second home for himself outside Mexico City.

Clark regarded his work on the committee as ‘my only worthwhile activity’ during the war: ‘We employed every artist whom we thought had any merit, not because we supposed that we would get records of the war more truthful or striking than those supplied by photography, but because it seemed a good way of preventing artists being killed’ (<a href=""entry://Ravilious, Eric""><span class=""links"">Ravilious</span></a> was one of the rare fatalities). Several painters who had been Official War Artists in the First World War were employed in the same capacity in the Second, among them Nash and Spencer, but the Committee mainly employed men of a younger generation. The terms in which they were employed varied: some were given salaried posts for a specific period, while others were given one-off commissions. The Committee also encouraged artists, whether serving or civilian, to submit pictures for consideration. Generally the commissions in the Second World War were on a smaller scale than those in the First, with many works being executed in watercolour (Spencer's huge canvases of shipbuilding on the Clyde are a conspicuous exception). Henry <a href=""entry://Moore, Henry""><span class=""links"">Moore's </span></a> drawings of Londoners sheltering from air raids in Underground stations are perhaps the best known of all the works produced under the auspices of Clark's Committee.<br class=""nLine"" />In both wars women were employed as Official War Artists on the home front, notably the animal painter Lucy Kemp-Welch (1869&ndash;1958) in the First and Laura <a href=""entry://Knight, Dame Laura""><span class=""links"">Knight </span></a> in the Second. A huge number of works was produced. The largest collection (about 10,000 items) is in the Imperial War Museum, London, which was opened in 1920 and moved to its present home (the former Royal Bethlehem Hospital) in 1936. There is another major collection in the Tate Gallery, London, and many provincial museums have good examples.<br class=""nLine"" />Since the Second World War the tradition of Official War Art has been maintained on a lesser scale by the Artistic Records Committee of the Imperial War Museum. Linda Kitson (1945&ndash; ) went on its behalf to the Falkland Islands during the war there against Argentina in 1982, for example, and Peter Howson (1958&ndash; ) went to Bosnia in 1993. His exhibition ‘War in Bosnia’ at the Imperial War Museum the following year attracted considerable attention because of its unsparing depiction of atrocities: ‘Now that I've actually seen dead bodies, and guts and brains, and starving children, it has made the work authentic.’"

There is no doubt, however, that van Eyck revolutionized the technique and brought it to a sudden peak of perfection.

Other painters soon took up his innovations&mdash;first in Northern Europe, then in Italy&mdash;and from the 16th century oil colour has been the dominant medium in Europe for serious painting. Its success has been largely on account of its versatility and ability to show an artist's personal ‘handwriting’, for its can attain any variety of surface from violent impasto to porcelain smoothness. Its versatility was increased still further in the 19th century with the invention of the collapsible metal tube (devised in 1841), which made it convenient to work out of doors.

This led to the work with which his name is most closely associated&mdash;giant-size sculptures of foodstuffs and ‘soft sculptures’ of normally hard objects (<i>Dual Hamburger</i>, MOMA, New York, 1962). With these he was hailed as one of the leaders of American <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a>. Oldenburg is also well known for his projects for colossal monuments&mdash;for example, <i>Lipsticks in Piccadilly Circus, London</i> (Tate, London, 1966), consisting of a magazine cutting of an array of lipsticks pasted on to a picture postcard. The first of these projects to be realized was a giant lipstick erected at Yale University in 1969. Since 1976 he has concentrated almost exclusively on such large-scale projects, for example the 70- feet high Match Cover erected in Barcelona in 1992."

"Op art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Op art</b> (abbreviation of Optical art on the analogy of Pop art).<div class=""content"">A type of abstract art that exploits certain optical phenomena to cause a work to seem to vibrate, pulsate, or flicker. It flourished mainly in the 1960s; the term was first used in print in the American magazine <i>Time</i> in October 1964 and had become a household phrase by the following year, partly through the attention given to the exhibition ‘The Responsive Eye’ held at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1965. This was the first international exhibition with a predominance of Op paintings. The development of Op art as a recognizable movement had begun a few years earlier than this, in about 1960, the works and theories of Josef <a href=""entry://Albers, Josef""><span class=""links"">Albers </span></a> being among the main sources. The devices employed by Op artists (after-images, effects of dazzle and vibration, and so on) are often elaborations on the well-known visual illusions to be found in standard textbooks of perceptual psychology, and maximum precision is sought in the control of surfaces and edges in order to evoke an exactly prescribed retinal response. Many Op paintings employ repeated small-scale patterns arranged so as to suggest underlying secondary shapes or warping or swelling surfaces. This kind of work can retain much of its effect in reproduction, but Op art also embraces constructions that depend for their effects on light and/or movement, so Op and <a href=""entry://Kinetic art""><span class=""links"">Kinetic art</span></a> sometimes overlap. The two most famous exponents of Op art are Bridget <a href=""entry://Riley, Bridget""><span class=""links"">Riley </span></a> and Victor <a href=""entry://Vasarely, Victor""><span class=""links"">Vasarely </span></a>. Their work illustrates the considerable impact that Op made on fashion and design in the 1960s&mdash;its instant popular success (accompanied by a fairly cool critical reception) is hard to parallel in modern art. Op art became something of a craze in women's fashion and in 1965 Riley unsuccessfully tried to sue an American clothing company that used one of her paintings as a fabric design. One of Vasarely's designs was used on the plastic carrier bags of France's chain of COOP stores. Among other exponents of Op art the best known is probably the American Richard Anuszkiewicz (1930&ndash; ), a former pupil of Albers; his work is typically concerned with radiating expanses of lines and colours."

<b>Orcagna, Andrea</b>
<i>(Andrea di Cione )</i><div class=""content""><i>(d. 1368/9).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The leading Florentine artist of the third quarter of the 14th cent., a painter, sculptor, architect, and administrator. His nickname ‘Orcagna’ was apparently local slang for ‘Archangel’ (<i>Arcangelo</i>). In 1343/4 he was admitted to the guild of the painters and nine years later to that of the masons. His only certain work as a painter is the altarpiece of <i>The Redeemer with the Madonna and Saints</i> (1354&ndash;7) in the Strozzi Chapel of Sta Maria Novella. This is the most powerful Florentine painting of its period, and in spite of the massiveness of the figures it represents a reversion from <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto's </span></a> naturalism to the hieratic ideals of <a href=""entry://Byzantine art""><span class=""links"">Byzantine art</span></a>. Colours are resplendent, with lavish use of gold, and the figures are remote and immobile. The major work attributed to Orcagna is a fragmentary fresco trilogy of the <i>Triumph of Death, Last Judgement</i>, and <i>Hell</i> in Sta Croce. As a sculptor and architect he is known through one work, the tabernacle in Or San Michele (finished 1359), a highly elaborate ornamental structure housing a painting of the <i>Virgin Enthroned</i> by Bernardo <a href=""entry://Daddi, Bernardo""><span class=""links"">Daddi </span></a>. Orcagna was <i>capomaestro</i> of Orvieto Cathedral from 1358 to 1362, supervising the mosaic decoration of the façade. He was also an adviser on the construction of Florence Cathedral. During 1368 Orcagna fell mortally ill while painting the <i>St Matthew</i> altarpiece (Uffizi, Florence) and this work was finished by his brother <i>Jacopo di Cione </i> (active 1365&ndash;98), who worked in his style and continued it to the end of the century. Another brother, <i>Nardo di Cione </i> (active 1343/6&ndash;65/6), was also a painter. <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti </span></a> attributes to him the series of frescos of <i>The Last Judgement</i>, <i>Hell</i>, and <i>Paradise</i> in the Strozzi Chapel, Sta Maria Novella, which houses Andrea's great altarpiece.

There followed a number of contracts for tombs, including that of Charles V's parents, Philip I and Juana of Castille, commissioned by Charles himself for the chapel royal at Granada. Ordóñez died while carrying out these commissions with Italian assistants at Carrara; but his testament records that he had completed the greater part of the work, including most of the royal tomb.

His best-known work is the turbulent <i>Job</i> altarpiece (Musées Royaux, Brussels, 1521). As a portraitist his style was quieter and more thoughtful (<i>Georg Zelle</i>, Musées Royaux, Brussels, 1519).

Following the first outburst of revolutionary activity in Mexico in 1910 (which was to last on and off until 1920), Orozco began working as a political cartoonist. In 1912 he began a series of watercolours called ‘House of Tears’ dealing with prostitutes (a favourite symbol of human degradation for Orozco). The angry reaction of critics and moralists to these works was one of his reasons for leaving for the USA, where he spent three unhappy and unproductive years, 1917&ndash;20. His career as a muralist began after he returned to Mexico in 1920. The country was now relatively stable under the government of Alvaro Obregón, who encouraged nationalistic subjects as a way of creating a positive identity for the country after years of turmoil. Orozco's first murals were in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (National Training School), 1923&ndash;4. They were controversial because of their caricatural style, and all except <i>Maternity</i> and <i>The Rich Banquet while the Workers Quarrel</i> were subsequently destroyed or altered. His style matured towards a greater monumentality in frescos in the Casa de los Azulejos (House of Tiles), Mexico City (1926), and in a second series at the National Training School (1926&ndash;7). The work brought him little recognition, however, so in 1927 to 1934 (broken by a brief trip to Europe in 1932) he again worked in the USA. This time he was much more successful, carrying out a number of important mural commissions, most notably a cycle for Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, on <i>The Coming</i> and <i>The Return of Quetzalcoatl</i> (1932&ndash;4). This huge scheme showed his outlook crystallizing into a contrast between a pagan paradise and a capitalist hell. Unlike Rivera and Siqueiros, Orozco did not align himself with a political movement, but his work had an intense humanitarian mission. He returned to Mexico in 1934 with a big reputation after his success in the USA, and he spent most of the rest of his life engaged on mural projects in Mexico City and Guadalajara, the country's second city. In his last years his work became ever more violent in expression, moved by a passionate concern for the suffering and miseries of mankind. His studio in Guadalajara is now a museum dedicated to him."

He worked mainly in London but he kept up links with his native Ireland, teaching parttime at the Metropolitan School in Dublin, 1902&ndash;14. His style had much in common with that of his friend Augustus <a href=""entry://John, Augustus""><span class=""links"">John </span></a>, being vigorous and painterly but sometimes rather flashy. He was at his best when he was away from his standard boardroom and drawing-room fare, and his numerous self-portraits are often particularly engaging, as he pokes fun at himself in character roles. Up to the First World war he had a steady rise in worldly success and after the war he earned an average of about £35,000 a year, rising to over £50,000 a year in 1929&ndash;a colossal sum then. In 1920 a story appeared in London newspapers that he had refused an offer of £1,000,000 to work for a dealer in the USA, and he was one of the few British artists of his time capable of attracting public attention in such a way. Apart from portraits, Orpen also painted genre subjects, landscapes, interiors, nudes, and allegories, and he did memorable work as an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a> in France (he also attended the 1919 Peace Conference in Paris and painted <i>The Signing of the Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles</i>, 28 June, 1919 (Imperial War Museum, London)).

His early pictures depict lively scenes of peasants carousing or brawling in crowded taverns or hovels. In his later works (after <i>c.</i>1650) his peasants learn better manners and the rooms they live in are tidier. These later pictures are lighter in key and more colourful; thus they follow the general trend of Dutch painting around this time. Ostade was successful, popular, and much imitated. His most talented pupil was his brother <i>Isaak</i> (1621&ndash;49), who also worked in Haarlem. As well as painting genre scenes in the manner of Adriaen, Isaak was an outstanding practitioner of the winter landscape, and his early death cut short a career of great promise. Good examples of the work of both brothers are in the National Gallery, London."

He was a man of great culture, a poet and scholar as well as a painter, and his house was the focus of Seville's artistic life. As a painter he was undistinguished, working in a stiff academic style (though his portraits are fresher than his religious works). He was an outstanding teacher, however, for (in spite of his own limitations) he was sympathetic to the more naturalistic style that was then developing. And he was generous enough in spirit to acknowledge openly that his greatest pupil, <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez</span></a> (who became his son-in-law in 1618), was a much better painter than himself: ‘I consider it no disgrace for the pupil to surpass the master.’ Alonso <a href=""entry://Cano, Alonso""><span class=""links"">Cano </span></a> was his other outstanding pupil, and Pacheco often collaborated with the great sculptor <a href=""entry://Montañes, Juan Martínez""><span class=""links"">Montañés </span></a>, painting his wooden figures. In 1649 his book <i>El Arte de la Pintura</i> (The Art of Painting), was posthumously published; part theoretical, part biographical, this is a major source of information for the period (it includes accounts of his meeting with El <a href=""entry://Greco, El""><span class=""links"">Greco </span></a> in Toledo in 1611 and of Velázquez's early career).

"Pacher, Michael","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pacher, Michael</b><div class=""content""><i>(active 1465?&ndash;98).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Austrian painter and sculptor. He died at Salzburg, but most of his career was spent at Bruneck in the Tyrol. Nothing is known of his training, and the earliest recorded work by him (a signed and dated altarpiece of 1465) is now lost. He worked mainly for local churches, carrying out the carving as well as the painting of his altarpieces, and much of his work is still <i>in situ</i>. His most celebrated work is the St Wolfgang altarpiece (1471&ndash;81) in the church of S. Wolfgang on the Abersee, a huge <a href=""entry://polyptych""><span class=""links"">polyptych</span></a> with some astonishingly intricate woodcarving. Although Pacher's sculpture is thoroughly late <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> in spirit, his painting is strongly influenced by Italian art. He is particularly close to <a href=""entry://Mantegna, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Mantegna </span></a>, especially in the way dramatic effects are obtained by using a low viewpoint and setting the figures close to the picture plane. There is no documentary evidence that Pacher visited Italy, but because of its proximity to the Tyrol it seems overwhelmingly likely that he did.

<b>palette</b>.<div class=""content"">A flat board, usually rectangular, ovoid, or kidney-shaped, and generally with a hole for the thumb, on which artists arrange their paints ready for use; early examples sometimes had a handle, rather like a table-tennis bat, but a thumb-hole is now standard. Palettes first appeared <i>c.</i>1400; before then individual containers (sometimes shells) were used for mixing colours. For oil painting, mahogany is traditionally considered the best material for palettes, although other close-grained hardwoods have been used. Materials such as porcelain or ivory have been used by watercolour or <a href=""entry://miniature""><span class=""links"">miniature</span></a> painters and also sometimes by oil painters&mdash;<a href=""entry://Millais, Sir John Everett""><span class=""links"">Millais</span></a>, for example, used a porcelain palette early in his career, when he painted with fastidious detail and wished to avoid muddying his colours. For many artists, choice of their pigments and the order in which they are set out on the palette is a very important and personal matter and much advice was published on how to ‘set’ a palette in handbooks of the 17th and 18th cents. By extension, the term ‘palette’ thus refers to the range of colours characteristic of an artist; <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio</span></a> has a dark or restricted palette, <a href=""entry://Monet, Claude""><span class=""links"">Monet</span></a> a bright or rich palette."

His original name was Jacomo Negreti, but he was using the name Palma by 1513. He is called Palma Vecchio (Old Palma) to distinguish him from <a href=""entry://Palma Giovane ""><span class=""links"">Palma Giovane </span></a> (Young Palma ), his great-nephew. Nothing is known of his training, and there is indeed very little secure knowledge about his life and works, none of his pictures being dated or reliably signed and very few of them being certainly identifiable from early sources. His style is distinctive, however, and in practice the definition of his <i>œuvre</i> is much less problematic than with many of his contemporaries. He painted a few altarpieces for Venetian churches, but most of his work was done for private clients, his speciality being half-length portrayals of beautiful and voluptuous blonde-haired women, sometimes in religious or mythological guise. In opulence of colour and beauty of handling they show the influence of the early work of <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a>, and the finest, such as the celebrated <i>La Bella</i> (Thyssen Coll., Madrid), are worthy of his name.

"Palmer, Samuel","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Palmer, Samuel</b><div class=""content""><i>(1805&ndash;81).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English landscape painter and etcher. He showed a precocious talent and exhibited landscape drawings at the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> when he was 14.

Palmer had had visionary experiences from childhood and the effect of Blake upon him was to intensify an inherent mystical bent. In 1826 he moved to Shoreham, near Sevenoaks, Kent, where he was the central figure of the group of artists known as the <a href=""entry://Ancients""><span class=""links"">Ancients</span></a> and produced what are now his most famous works&mdash;landscapes charged with a sense of pantheistic fecundity and other&mdash;worldly beauty. In about 1832 what he called his ‘primitive and infantine feeling’ for landscape began to fade, and after returning to London in 1835, marrying Linnell's daughter in 1837, and spending a two-year honeymoon in Italy, the break with his visionary manner was complete. His later paintings were in a much more conventional topographical or pastoral mode, highly-wrought and often sentimental in feeling. In his etchings, however, something of his early genius remained; at his death he was working on an edition of Virgil's <i>Eclogues</i>, translated and illustrated by himself. His early work was virtually forgotten until the 1920s, but it has subsequently influenced modern romantic landscape artists such as Paul <a href=""entry://Nash, Paul""><span class=""links"">Nash </span></a> and Graham <a href=""entry://Sutherland, Graham""><span class=""links"">Sutherland </span></a>."

Until the adoption of canvas in the 15th cent. nearly all the movable paintings of Europe were executed on wood, and even up to the beginning of the 17th cent. it is probable that as much painting was done on the one support as on the other. Painters who worked on a small scale often used copper panels (<a href=""entry://Elsheimer, Adam""><span class=""links"">Elsheimer</span></a> is a leading example), and in the colonial art of South America copper and tin and even lead and zinc were used. On a larger scale, slate has occasionally been used as a support, notably by <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens</span></a> for his altarpiece for Sta Maria in Vallicella (the Chiesa Nuova) in Rome; the picture he originally painted was said to reflect the light unpleasantly and slate was used for the replacement to produce a more matt finish. For wood panels the Italian masters of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> preferred white poplar, while oak was the most common wood used in northern Europe. Many other types were used, however; analysis of the contents of art galleries has yielded a long list, including beech, cedar, chestnut, fir, larch, linden, mahogany, olive, and walnut. In the 20th cent. cedar, teak, and dark walnut are favourites, and modern painters have also used plywood, fibre-board, and other synthetic materials as supports (see also <a href=""entry://academy board""><span class=""links"">ACADEMY BOARD</span></a>)."

In 1787 a patent for such a device was granted to Robert Barker (1739&ndash;1806), an Irish-born painter working in Edinburgh, and it soon became a popular form of entertainment: ‘Panorama painting seems all the rage’, <a href=""entry://Constable, John""><span class=""links"">Constable</span></a> wrote in 1803.

<b>Paolozzi, Sir Eduardo</b><div class=""content""><i>(1924&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British sculptor and printmaker of Italian parentage.

From the 1950s he has worked primarily as an abstract sculptor, often on a large scale. His work of the 1950s was characteristically heavy and bulky, often incorporating industrial components, showing his interest in technology as well as in popular culture. In the 1960s his work became more colourful, including large totem-like figures made up from casts of pieces of machinery and often brightly painted. In the 1970s he made solemn machine-like forms and also box-like low <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">reliefs</span></a>, both small and large, in wood or bronze, sometimes made to hang on the wall, compartmented and filled with small carved items. His more recent work has included several large public commissions, for example mosaic decorations for Tottenham Court Road underground station in London (installed 1983&ndash;5). Paolozzi has taught at various art schools and universities in Britain, Europe, and the USA, and he has been awarded many honours.

France, southern Germany, and Switzerland had well-developed industries in paper by the end of the 14th cent. White paper was first made in England in 1495, but not on a large scale until the 18th cent. Until 1800 European paper was made entirely of rags pulped in water, and drawing-paper of the best quality is still made by hand in the traditional way. Writing papers, less expensive drawing-papers, and some book papers are machine made of a mixture of cotton, hemp, esparto, and wood, with a good deal of china clay added to make them smooth and opaque, <a href=""entry://size""><span class=""links"">size</span></a> to make them non-absorbent, and starch to make them stiff.

He became a monk at St Albans in 1217 and was appointed monastery chronicler in 1236. In 1248 he visited Norway to reform the monastery of St Benet-Holme, but otherwise seems never to have travelled further than London (the surname Paris is found elsewhere in England in the 13th cent. and does not necessarily imply that he had any French associations). Matthew carried on the abbey's <i>Chronica Majora</i> from 1235 until his death (it is now divided between Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and the BL, London) and also wrote a summary of the chief events between 1200 and 1250 that is known as the <i>Historia Minor</i> or <i>Historia Anglorum</i> (BL). His historical manuscripts are almost unique in being illustrated with numerous marginal scenes and symbols from his own hand. He also composed several Lives of the Saints (the <i>Life of St Alban</i>, Trinity College, Dublin, is autograph) in which the illustrations occupy the upper half of the page and are of equal importance with the text. The frontispiece to his <i>Historia Anglorum</i> is his only signed work&mdash;a self-portrait showing him on his knees dedicating the manuscript to the Virgin. It is a tinted outline drawing, and because of his fame there has been a mistaken tendency to assign all mid 13th-cent.

In this broadest sense, the term reflects the intense concentration of artistic activity, supported by critics, dealers, and connoisseurs, that made Paris the world centre of advanced art during the first 40 years of the 20th cent.

"Parmigianino","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Parmigianino </b>
<i>(Girolamo Francesco Mazzola )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1503&ndash;40).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> painter and etcher, born in Parma, from which he takes his nickname. He was a precocious artist, and as early as 1522&ndash;3 painted accomplished frescos in two chapels in S. Giovanni Evangelista, Parma, showing his admiration for <a href=""entry://Correggio ""><span class=""links"">Correggio</span></a>, who had worked in the same church a year or two before. The originality and sophistication he displayed from the beginning, particularly his love of unusual spatial effects, is, however, most memorably seen in his celebrated <i>Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror</i> (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, 1524), in which <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> said he looks ‘so beautiful that he seemed an angel rather than a man’. In 1524 Parmigianino moved to Rome, possibly via Florence, and his work became both grander and more graceful under the influence of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>. <i>The Vision of St Jerome</i> (NG, London, 1526&ndash;7) is his most important work of this time, showing the disturbing emotional intensity he created with his elongated forms, disjointed sense of space, chill lighting, and lascivious atmosphere. Parmigianino left Rome after it was sacked by German troops in 1527 and moved to Bologna. In 1531 he returned to Parma and contracted to paint frescos in Sta Maria della Steccata. He failed to complete the work, however, and was eventually imprisoned for breach of contract. Vasari says he neglected the work because he was infatuated with alchemy&mdash;‘he allowed his beard to grow long and disordered
he neglected himself and grew melancholy and eccentric.’ His later paintings show no falling off in his powers, however, and his work reaches its apotheosis in his celebrated <i>Madonna of the Long Neck</i> (Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1535). The forms of the figures are extraordinarily elongated and tapering and the painting has a refinement and grace that place it among the archetypal works of Mannerism. Parmigianino's range extended beyond religious works. He painted a highly erotic <i>Cupid Carving his Bow</i> (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, 1535), and was one of the subtlest portraitists of his age (two superb examples are in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples). The landscape backgrounds to his religious works have a mysterious and visionary quality that influenced Niccolò dell' <a href=""entry://Abbate, Niccolò dell'""><span class=""links"">Abbate </span></a> and through him French art (see <a href=""entry://Fontainebleau, School of""><span class=""links"">FONTAINEBLEAU, SCHOOL OF</span></a>). Parmigianino, whose draughtsmanship was exquisite, also made designs for engravings and <a href=""entry://chiaroscuro""><i><span class=""links"">chiaroscuro</i></span></a> woodcuts and seems to have been the first Italian artist to produce original etchings from his own designs."

<b>Parrish, Maxfield</b><div class=""content""><i>(1870&ndash;1966).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter and illustrator. He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts with the author-illustrator Howard Pyle (1853&ndash;1911), celebrated for his children's books. In 1895 Parrish designed a cover for <i>Harper's Weekly</i> and thereafter rapidly made a name for himself with illustrations, posters, and advertisements. His greatest fame and popularity came with colour prints designed for the mass market. Sentimental scenes such as <i>The Garden of Allah</i> (copyrighted 1919) and <i>Dawn</i> (1920) sold by the million. They are in a lush and romantic style, set in an escapist world combining elements of the Arabian Nights, Hollywood, and classical antiquity, with languorous maidens and idyllic landscape backgrounds. His draughtsmanship and detailing are immaculate and his colouring distinctively high-keyed and luminous. Many of his advertisements were in a similar vein. In the 1930s his style went out of fashion and he retired to paint landscapes, working up to his death at the age of 95. Shortly before this there was a revival of interest in his work, which had long been dismissed as kitsch; in 1964, for example, the Metropolitan Museum, New York, bought his painting <i>Errant Pan</i> (<i>c.</i>1915)."

Characteristic of his work at this time and in the early 1940s are some splendid female nudes and lyrically sensitive Thames-side landscapes that have been likened to those of <a href=""entry://Whistler, James Abbott McNeill""><span class=""links"">Whistler </span></a> (<i>Chiswick Reach</i>, NG of Canada, Ottawa, 1943). In the late 1940s he underwent a dramatic conversion to pure abstract art, and by the early 1950s he had matured a personal style of geometrical abstraction. At the same time he made abstract <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">reliefs</span></a>, partly under the influence of Ben <a href=""entry://Nicholson, Ben""><span class=""links"">Nicholson </span></a>. His earlier reliefs had a handmade quality but later, through the introduction of transparent perspex, he gave them the impersonal precision and finish of machine products (examples are in the Tate Gallery). Through work in this style he came to be regarded as one of the leaders of the <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivist</span></a> revival in Britain. Later paintings are less austere and more organic. Pasmore has been an influential teacher, notably at King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne (University of Durham), where he was head of the painting department, 1954&ndash;61. The ‘basic design’ course he taught there (based on <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a> ideas) spread to many British art schools. He has also been much concerned with bringing abstract art to the general public. In 1955, for example, he was appointed Consulting Director of Architectural Design for Peterlee New Town, County Durham, and designed an urban centre in the form of a Pavilion which integrated architectural design with abstract relief painting. Kenneth <a href=""entry://Clark, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Clark </span></a> described Pasmore as ‘one of the two or three most talented English painters of this century’."

He is now best known as a novelist, but he studied at the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> Schools and spent much of his career teaching drawing in London art schools. His reputation rests mainly on his trilogy of novels <i>Titus Groan</i> (1946), <i>Gormenghast</i> (1950), and <i>Titus Alone</i> (1959), a work of grotesque Gothic fantasy to which his vividly imaginative drawing style was well matched (originally, however, the books were published without his accompanying illustrations). Peake also illustrated numerous other books, including Stevenson's <i>Treasure Island</i> (1949) and several by himself (among them an instructional manual, <i>The Craft of the Lead Pencil</i>, 1946). In 1946 he was commissioned by the Ministry of Information to make drawings of people liberated from Belsen concentration camp&mdash;an experience that left him emotionally scarred. In the last decade of his life he was gradually incapacitated by Parkinsons' disease. Peake is described in <i>The Dictionary of National Biography</i> as ‘Tall, thin, dark, and haggard

<b>Peale, Charles Willson</b><div class=""content""><i>(1741&ndash;1827).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, inventor, naturalist, and patriot, the founder and most distinguished member of a family of artists. A highly versatile craftsman, Peale was a saddler, watchmaker, silversmith, and upholsterer before working briefly in <a href=""entry://Copley, John Singleton""><span class=""links"">Copley's</span></a> studio in Boston. He then spent two years in London (1767&ndash;9), where he studied under Benjamin <a href=""entry://West, Benjamin""><span class=""links"">West </span></a>. In 1775 he settled in Philadelphia, where he became the most fashionable portraitist in the Colonies, Copley having left for England in 1774. He fought as a colonel of the militia in the War of Independence and became a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania Assembly. In 1782 he opened an exhibition gallery next to his studio, the first art gallery in the United States, and there displayed his own portraits of leading personalities of the Revolutionary War (he painted George Washington several times). This expanded into a natural history museum, which attained a vast size and included as its star exhibit the first mastodon skeleton to be exhumed in America. Two of his most famous paintings celebrate his scientific interests&mdash;<i>The Exhumation of the Mastodon</i> (1806) in the Peale Museum, Baltimore, and <i>The Artist in his Museum</i> (1822) in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, an institution he helped to found in 1805. His inventions included new types of spectacles and false teeth. As a painter, Peale generally worked in a solid, dignified style, but his most celebrated work is a witty piece of <a href=""entry://trompe-l'œil""><i><span class=""links"">trompe-l'œil</i></span></a>. This is <i>The Staircase Group</i> (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1795), a life-size portrait of two of his sons mounting a staircase, with a real step at the bottom and a real door jamb as a frame; George Washington is said to have been deceived into doffing his hat to the boys' images. Peale married three times and had seventeen children, of whom several became artists. The most important were <i>Raphaelle</i> (1774&ndash;1825), one of America's most distinguished still-life painters, <i>Rembrandt</i> (1778&ndash;1860), a gifted though uneven portraitist, and <i>Titian Ramsay II</i> (1799&ndash;1885), who continued his father's tradition as an artist-naturalist. Apart from his portraits, Rembrandt won fame with his huge picture <i>The Court of Death</i> (Detroit Inst. of Arts, 1821), which toured the country with success for over half a century. Charles Willson's brother <i>James</i> (1749&ndash;1831) was also a painter and his son and four daughters carried on the family tradition. The Peales were largely responsible for establishing Philadelphia as one of the country's leading cultural centres."

His early works (mainly landscapes) were painted with a vigorous <a href=""entry://Gestural painting""><span class=""links"">Gestural</span></a> handling, but in the 1960s he developed a cooler, more even type of brushwork. He specializes in starkly unidealized portrayals of the nude figure (singly or in pairs), usually set in domestic surroundings. Because of the clarity of his compositions and the relentlessness of his scrutiny, he is sometimes described as a <a href=""entry://Superrealism""><span class=""links"">Superrealist</span></a>, but his work has an individuality that puts him outside this classification. He uses harsh lighting, oblique angles, and cropping of the image (heads are often excluded and the body is seen in voyeuristic close-up) in a way that suggests candid photography, but his pictures do not try to counterfeit the effect of photographs; the handling of paint is smooth&mdash;but vigorous rather than finicky."

His other subjects included nudes, landscapes, portraits, and opulent flower pieces. He was the most French in spirit of the German Expressionists (he was particularly influenced by <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a>) and probably because his work was decorative rather than emotionally intense, he was the first of the Brücke to achieve success and general recognition; the 1920s marked the height of the fashion for his work. Since then his reputation has faded whilst those of his former colleagues have grown. In 1918 he was one of the founders of the <a href=""entry://Novembergruppe""><span class=""links"">Novembergruppe</span></a> and he taught in the Berlin Academy from 1923, being dismissed in 1933 by the Nazis and reinstated in 1945.

"pen","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pen</b>.<div class=""content"">Writing and drawing instrument used with ink or a similar coloured fluid. From Early Christian times until the 19th cent. the standard form of pen in Europe was the quill, made from bird feathers, and most of the pen drawings of the Old Masters were done with the quill. Goose, swan, and turkey quills have commonly been used for writing and crow quills provide a very fine point for drawing. The reed pen, made from stems of bamboo-like grasses, was already in use in classical antiquity and is probably older than the quill. The point is much coarser, producing a bold, angular line sometimes slightly blurred at the edges. For drawing it has been used much less than the quill, though <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt</span></a>, for example, was a master of the broad energetic technique appropriate to it. The metal pen dates back at least to Roman times, but steel nibs of the modern type were not made until late in the 18th cent. and began to replace the quill only when they were produced by machine, <i>c.</i>1822. No other drawing tool can produce such a variety of texture or reveal so intimately the personal ‘handwriting’ of an artist. The pen is the ideal medium for rapidly noting down the first idea and has been used in this way by masters of drawing as different as <a href=""entry://Pisanello""><span class=""links"">Pisanello</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a>, and Rembrandt. But apart from its use for the hasty or inspired <a href=""entry://sketch""><span class=""links"">sketch</span></a>, in which the fire of execution is reflected in the line, the pen has been used with great effect in a careful, calligraphic manner, as in <a href=""entry://Botticelli, Sandro""><span class=""links"">Botticelli's</span></a> illustrations to Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>."
"pencil","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pencil</b>.<div class=""content"">Writing or drawing instrument consisting of a slender rod of graphite or similar substance encased in a cylinder of wood (or less usually metal or plastic). Although the material is graphite (a form of carbon), the ‘lead’ pencil took its name from the lead point (see <a href=""entry://metal point""><span class=""links"">METAL POINT</span></a>) which it superseded, and is first heard of in the 1560s. Pencils of predetermined hardness or softness were not produced until 1790, however, when Nicolas-Jacques <a href=""entry://conté crayon""><span class=""links"">Conté </span></a> undertook to solve the problem of making pencils when France was cut off from the English supply of graphite (the mines in Borrowdale, Cumbria, which had opened in 1664, being the main source). He found that the graphite could be eked out with clay and fired in a kiln, and that more clay meant a harder pencil. Conté obtained a patent for his process in 1795. It was only then that the pencil became the universal drawing instrument that it is today. <a href=""entry://Ingres, Jean-Auguste-Dominique""><span class=""links"">Ingres </span></a>, who often used pencil with great delicacy in his portrait drawings, was one of the first to show its potential. Although the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> records the usage of the phrase ‘a pencil of black lead’ as early as 1612, until the end of the 18th cent. the word ‘pencil’ more commonly meant a brush (particularly a small brush). ‘Pencilling’ could mean ‘colouring’ or ‘brushwork’ as well as ‘drawing’."

It is related to the <a href=""entry://happening""><span class=""links"">happening</span></a> (the two terms are sometimes used synonymously), but Performance art is usually more carefully programmed and generally does not involve audience participation. The tradition of Performance art can be traced back to the <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurists</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dadaists</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealists</span></a>, who often staged humorous or provocative events to promote their work or ideas, then through such activities as Georges <a href=""entry://Mathieu, Georges""><span class=""links"">Mathieu </span></a> painting in front of an audience in the 1950s and Yves <a href=""entry://Klein, Yves""><span class=""links"">Klein </span></a> directing nude models smeared with paint in the early 1960s. However, it was only in the later 1960s and particularly in the 1970s that Performance art became recognized as a category of art in itself. ‘At that time’, RoseLee Goldberg writes, ‘Conceptual art was in its heyday and performance was often a demonstration, or an execution, of [its] ideas
Art spaces devoted to performance sprang up in the major international art centres, museums sponsored festivals, art colleges introduced performance courses, and specialist magazines appeared’ (<i>Performance Art, From Futurism to the Present</i>, 1988). The form and tone of Performances have varied enormously. Some practitioners have cultivated sado-masochism and scatology (the abuse of the performer's body is something that often occurs also in <a href=""entry://Body art""><span class=""links"">Body art</span></a>, with which Performance art sometimes overlaps). In Britain, however, the field has more often been characterized by whimsicality (in the 1970s there was a fad for Performance groups with quaint names and for wacky newsworthy stunts). Performance art has also been used as an adjunct to rock music (the American Laurie Anderson (1947&ndash; ) is the most noted exponent) and as a vehicle for political dissent, as well as for the exploration of private fantasies.

The works associated with the Pergamene school are characterized by an exaggeration of the general tendency of Hellenistic sculpture towards emotional display and virtuoso naturalistic detail. They include a series of Dying Gauls (the most famous is in the Capitoline Museum, Rome) that have been identified as copies of statues dedicated by Attalus I to celebrate a victory over the Gauls, and the Great Altar of Zeus (Pergamum Museum, Berlin, <i>c.</i>180&ndash;150 BC), which features relief carvings of the fight between gods and giants depicted with an extraordinary sense of movement and dramatic tension. It is perhaps the ‘Satan's seat’ of Revelation 2:13. Other Hellenistic works from places other than Pergamum (above all the celebrated <i><a href=""entry://Laocoön""><span class=""links"">Laocoön</i></a></span>) are clearly similar in their restless energy and some scholars deny that there is adequate reason for supposing there is a separate Pergamene School.

"perspective","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>perspective</b>.<div class=""content"">Method of representing spatial extension into depth on a flat or shallow surface, utilizing such optical phenomena as the apparent convergence of parallel lines and diminution in size of objects as they recede from the spectator. Perspective is by no means common to the art of all epochs and all peoples. For example, the pictorial art of the ancient Egyptians, although a richly developed tradition, did not take account of the optical effects of recession. Systematic, mathematically founded perspective, based initially on a fixed central viewpoint, was developed in Italy in the early 15th cent., when it was invented by <a href=""entry://Brunelleschi, Filippo""><span class=""links"">Brunelleschi </span></a>, described by <a href=""entry://Alberti, Leon Battista""><span class=""links"">Alberti </span></a> in his treatise <i>De Pictura</i>, and put into majestic practice by <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a>. Various names are given to this type of perspective&mdash;geometric, linear, mathematical, optical, <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> or scientific perspective&mdash;which remained one of the foundations of European painting until the late 19th cent. In pre-Renaissance Europe and in the East more intuitive systems of representing spatial recession were used. In medieval paintings, for example, lines that would in strict perspective converge are often shown diverging (this ‘inverted perspective’ can look much more convincing in practice than it sounds in theory); and in Chinese art ‘parallel perspective’ was a common convention in the depiction of buildings.

His early career is obscure, but he seems to have formed his style chiefly in Florence, where <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> says he studied with <a href=""entry://Verrocchio, Andrea del""><span class=""links"">Verrocchio</span></a>&mdash;this would have been at about the same time that <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a> da Vinci was training with him (another tradition has it that Perugino was a pupil of <a href=""entry://Piero della Francesca ""><span class=""links"">Piero della Francesca </span></a>; this could have preceded his training in Florence). In 1472 he was enrolled as a painter in the fraternity of St Luke in Florence (the same year as Leonardo) and in 1475 he was back in Perugia. By 1481 he was sufficiently well known to be commissioned to paint frescos on the walls of the newly built Sistine Chapel, Rome, along with <a href=""entry://Botticelli, Sandro""><span class=""links"">Botticelli</span></a>, Domenico <a href=""entry://Ghirlandaio, Domenico""><span class=""links"">Ghirlandaio </span></a>, and Cosimo <a href=""entry://Rosselli, Cosimo""><span class=""links"">Rosselli </span></a> (<a href=""entry://Signorelli, Luca""><span class=""links"">Signorelli</span></a> later completed the work). Vasari says that Botticelli was head of the team, but some modern scholars think that Perugino was more likely to have been leader, partly because of the prominence of his contributions. His main work there is <i>Christ Delivering the Keys to St Peter</i>; he also did the frescoed altarpiece, but this was destroyed to make way for <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo's</span></a>
<i>Last Judgement</i>. His reputation firmly established, he travelled extensively in central Italy, and in the 1490s he maintained a workshop in Florence as well as in Perugia. In 1500, when he was decorating the Audience Chamber of the Collegio del Cambio at Perugia, he was called by Agostino Chigi, the wealthy Sienese banker and patron, the best painter in Italy, and he was indeed at his peak at about this time. Perugino was a fine portraitist as well as a fresco painter, but today he is best known for his altarpieces, which are usually gentle, pious, and rather sentimental in manner. His style does not seem to have been a reflection of his personality, for Vasari says he ‘was not a religious man’ and that he ‘would have gone to any lengths for money’. In about 1505 he left the competitive atmosphere of Florence, where his work now seemed old-fashioned, and settled permanently in Perugia; his later work is often routine and repetitive. At his best, however, as in the Vatican fresco, he has the authority of a great master. The harmony and spatial clarity of his compositions and his idealized physical types had great influence on the young <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>, who worked with him early in his career, so Perugino can be seen as one of the harbingers of the High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>.

He moved back to Paris in 1923 because of official disapproval of abstract art and lived there for the rest of his life. Up to this time he had been a painter, but he now turned to sculpture, at first working mainly in plastic, then in welded metal. Initially his sculptures retained vestiges of representation, as in his witty <i>Portrait of Marcel Duchamp</i> (Yale University Art Gallery, 1926), but by 1927 he had arrived at pure abstraction.

"Phidias","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Phidias </b><div class=""content""><i>(d. <span class=""italic"">c.</i>432 BC).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Greek sculptor, active mainly in Athens, the most famous artist of the ancient world. No work survives that is certainly from his own hand, but through copies, descriptions, and above all the surviving sculpture of the Parthenon at Athens, which Phidias supervised, a fair idea can be gained of his style. In antiquity he was most celebrated for two enormous <a href=""entry://chryselephantine""><span class=""links"">chryselephantine</span></a> cult statues&mdash;of Athena, inside the Parthenon, and of Zeus in the temple dedicated to the god at Olympia. The statue of Zeus, a seated figure about 12m. high and one of the Seven Wonders of the World, is known through reproductions on Roman coins. The statue of Athena (dedicated 438 BC), a standing figure about 9m. high, is known through several (much smaller) copies. Phidias also made two bronze statues of Athena for the Acropolis in Athens: the huge <i>Athena Promachos</i> (champion), in which the goddess was shown holding a spear; and the <i>Lemnian Athena</i> (so called because it was dedicated by Athenian colonists going to Lemnos between 451 and 448 BC). The <i>Athena Promachos</i> is represented in coins and the <i>Lemnian Athena</i> can be partially reconstructed from two fragmentary copies: a remarkably sensitive head in Bologna (Museo Civico Archeologico) and a substantially complete figure in Dresden (Albertinum). Other copies have been credibly associated with works of Phidias mentioned in ancient sources, and recently the two bronze statues of warriors found in the sea near Riace in 1972 (‘The Riace bronzes’) and now in the archaeological museum at Reggio di Calabria have been linked with his name because of their superlative quality. The greatest testimony to his genius, however, is the sculpture of the Parthenon (447&ndash;432 BC), the most ambitious sculptural undertaking of the age, consisting of a low-<a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> frieze about 160m. long, ninety-two metopes (decorative panels) in high relief, and groups of free-standing figures on both pediments. The quality is variable, as a team of sculptors was involved and Phidias could not have carved more than a tiny fraction of the work himself, but the finest parts (see <a href=""entry://Elgin Marbles""><span class=""links"">ELGIN MARBLES</span></a>) exemplify the harmony and serene majesty that earned the raptures of ancient commentators and stand as the greatest surviving examples of the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">Classical</span></a> period in Greek art.<br class=""nLine"" />The end of Phidias' career is something of a mystery. When the great statesman Pericles, his friend and patron, fell out of favour Phidias was accused of misappropriating gold supplied to him for the statue of Athena. Then, according to Plutarch, having cleared himself of this charge, he was thrown into prison for ‘impiety’ on the ground that he had introduced portraits of Pericles and himself on the shield of the goddess (a copy of the shield&mdash;the ‘Strangford Shield’&mdash;is in the British Museum). Plutarch says that Phidias died in prison, but according to another ancient source he escaped and went to Olympia to work on his statue of Zeus, the date of which is uncertain. In 1954&ndash;8 Phidias' workshop at Olympia was excavated. Moulds, scraps of ivory, and other fragments were discovered, and&mdash;remarkably&mdash;a cup bearing the inscription ‘I belong to Phidias’&mdash;the great man's tea-mug, as it were. This poignant relic is in the Olympia Museum. Phidias is said to have been a painter, engraver, and worker in embossed metalwork. His influence is seen in the best of contemporary vase-painting as well as in the sculpture of his successors."

<b>Piazzetta, Giovanni Battista</b><div class=""content""><i>(1683&ndash;1754).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Venetian painter and graphic artist. After preliminary training in Venice he worked under G. M. <a href=""entry://Crespi, Giuseppe Maria""><span class=""links"">Crespi </span></a> in Bologna, then settled permanently in his native city by 1711. He was one of the most individual Venetian painters of his period, his sombre and dramatic style looking back to work done a century earlier by <a href=""entry://Liss ""><span class=""links"">Liss </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Strozzi, Bernardo""><span class=""links"">Strozzi </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Feti ""><span class=""links"">Feti </span></a>. Apart from a ceiling fresco of the <i>Glory of St Dominic</i> (<i>c.</i>1727) in SS. Giovanni e Paolo, he painted in oils and he was a notoriously slow worker, but his pictures seem fresh and spontaneous rather than laboured. He had a large family and although he was not without wealthy patrons (<a href=""entry://Algarotti, Francesco""><span class=""links"">Algarotti</span></a> among them) he relied much on drawings and book illustrations to earn money. As a painter he did religious and historical works and portraits, as well as some hauntingly enigmatic <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes that reflect his training with Crespi . In 1750 Piazzetta became the first Director of the Venice Academy of Fine Arts, but in his last years he was eclipsed by the new generation. The young <a href=""entry://Tiepolo, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Tiepolo</span></a> was greatly influenced by him, but later the influence was reversed, as Piazzetta's style became softer and light&mdash;more <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a>&mdash;in feeling."

<b>Picabia, Francis</b><div class=""content""><i>(1879&ndash;1953).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, designer, writer, and editor. His talent as an artist was modest, but his restless and energetic personality gave him a significant role successively in the <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dadaist</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealist</span></a> movements, and through his publications he helped to disseminate avant-garde ideas. A private income enabled him to carry on his activities without having to worry about earning a living, as well as to indulge his love of fast cars, fast women, and wild living in general. Early in his career he was a successful painter of <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> landscapes. In 1908&ndash;9 he experimented with <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionism</span></a>, and then with <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauvism</span></a> and Cubism. In 1911 he met Marcel <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a>, who was to be the most important influence on his career, and with him became an exponent of <a href=""entry://Orphism""><span class=""links"">Orphism</span></a>. He painted his first purely abstract works in 1912. In 1913 he visited New York as spokesman for the Cubist pictures in the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a>, and he returned in 1915&ndash;16, when he, Duchamp, and <a href=""entry://Man Ray ""><span class=""links"">Man</span></a> Ray were involved in the first stirrings of Dada. After moving to Barcelona (where he lived 1916&ndash;17), he launched a magazine entitled 391 (1917&ndash;24). In 1917 he returned to New York for six months then lived in Zurich (1918&ndash;19) before returning to Paris, where he helped to launch the Dada movement. However, in 1921 he denounced Dada for being no longer ‘new’, and became involved with André <a href=""entry://Breton, André""><span class=""links"">Breton </span></a> and the nascent Surrealist movement. In 1924 he attacked this, too, but some of his later works are in a Surrealist idiom. From 1925 to 1945 he lived mainly on the Côte d'Azur, experimenting with various styles. In 1945 he settled permanently in Paris and in his final years returned to abstract painting. Apart from his contributions to avant-garde magazines, Picabia published various pamphlets and wrote poetry. He also conceived the fantasy ballet <i>Relâche</i> (1924), with music by Erik Satie, together with the film <i>Entr'acte</i> (directed by René Clair ), which was used to fill the intermission between the ballet's two acts. Among Picabia's paintings, the most highly regarded today are those in his ‘machinist’ style, in which mechanistic and <a href=""entry://biomorphic""><span class=""links"">biomorphic</span></a> forms are combined in dynamic compositions. The most famous is <i>I See Again in Memory My Dear Udnie</i> (MOMA, New York, 1914)."
"Picasso, Pablo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Picasso, Pablo</b><div class=""content""><i>(1881&ndash;1973).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Spanish painter, sculptor, graphic artist, ceramicist, and designer, the most famous, versatile, prolific, and influential artist of the 20th cent. Although it is conventional to divide his work into certain phases, all such divisions are to some extent arbitrary, as his energy and imagination were such that he was at all times working on a wealth of themes and in a variety of styles. He himself said: ‘The several manners I have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution, or as steps toward an unknown ideal of painting. When I have found something to express, I have done it without thinking of the past or future. I do not believe I have used radically different elements in the different manners I have used in painting. If the subjects I have wanted to express have suggested different ways of expression, I haven't hesitated to adopt them.’<br class=""nLine"" />Picasso was the son of a painter and drawing master and was remarkably precocious, mastering academic draughtsmanship when he was still a child (his first word as a baby is said to have been ‘lápiz’&mdash;pencil). In 1900 he made his first trip to Paris and by this time had already absorbed a wide range of influences. Between 1900 and 1904 he alternated between Paris and Barcelona, and this time coincides with his Blue Period, when he took his subjects from the poor and social outcasts, and the predominant mood of his paintings was one of slightly sentimentalized melancholy expressed through cold ethereal blue tones (<i>La Vie</i>, Cleveland Mus. of Art, 1903). He also did a number of powerful engravings in a similar vein (<i>The Frugal Repast</i>, 1904). In 1904 Picasso settled in Paris and became the centre of an avant-garde circle of artists and writers including <a href=""entry://Apollinaire, Guillaume""><span class=""links"">Apollinaire</span></a>. A brief phase in 1904&ndash;5 is known as his Rose Period. The predominant blue tones of his earlier work gave way to pinks and greys and the mood became less austere. His favourite subjects were acrobats and dancers, particularly the figure of the harlequin. In 1906 he met <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a>, but although he seems to have admired the work being done by the <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauves</span></a>, he did not himself follow their method in the decorative and expressive use of colour (indeed his work often shows little concern with colour, and it is significant that&mdash;unlike most painters&mdash;he preferred to work at night by artificial light). The period around 1906&ndash;7 is sometimes called Picasso's Negro Period, because of the influence of African sculpture on his work at this point, but <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne</span></a> was an equally powerful influence at this time, as he concentrated on the analysis and simplification of form. His researches culminated in <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> (MOMA, New York, 1906&ndash;7), which in its distortions of form and disregard of any conventional idea of beauty was as violent a revolt against tradition as the paintings of the Fauves in the realm of colour. At the time the picture was incomprehensible to artists, including Matisse and <a href=""entry://Derain, André""><span class=""links"">Derain </span></a>, and it was not publicly exhibited until 1937. It is now seen not only as a crucial achievement in Picasso's personal development but as the most important single landmark in the development of contemporary painting and as the herald of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, which he developed in close association with <a href=""entry://Braque, Georges""><span class=""links"">Braque</span></a> and then <a href=""entry://Gris, Juan""><span class=""links"">Gris</span></a> from 1907 up to the First World War.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1917 Picasso went with his friend Jean Cocteau to Rome to design costumes and scenery for the ballet <i>Parade</i> and in the following years he designed for other <a href=""entry://Diaghilev, Sergei""><span class=""links"">Diaghilev</span></a> productions. The visit to Italy was one factor in introducing the strain of monumental classicism that was one of the features of Picasso's work in the early 1920s (<i>Mother and Child</i>, Art Institute of Chicago, 1921), but at this time he was also involved with <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>&mdash;indeed André <a href=""entry://Breton, André""><span class=""links"">Breton</span></a> hailed him as one of the initiators of the movement. However, his predominant interest in the analysis and synthesis of forms was at bottom opposed to the irrationalist elements of the Surrealists, their exaltation of chance, and equally to the direct realistic reproduction of dream or subconscious material. Following the most serene period in his art, Picasso began to make violently expressive works, fraught with emotional tension, a mood of foreboding, and an almost clinical preoccupation with anguish and despair. This phase begins with <i>The Three Dancers</i> (Tate Gallery, London, 1925), a savage parody of classical ballet, painted at a time when his first marriage was becoming a source of increasing unhappiness and frustration. Following this he took up the mythological image of the Minotaur and images of the Dying Horse and the Weeping Woman. The period culminated in his most famous work, <i>Guernica</i> (Centro Cultural Reina Sofía, Madrid, 1937), produced for the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1937 to express horror and revulsion at the destruction by bombing of the Basque capital Guernica during the civil war (1936&ndash;9). It was followed by a number of other great paintings, including <i>The Charnel House</i> (MOMA, New York,1945), attacking the cruelty and destructiveness of war. ‘Painting is not done to decorate apartments’, he said: ‘it is an instrument of war against brutality and darkness.’ Picasso remained in Paris during the German Occupation, but from 1946 lived mainly in the South of France, where he added pottery to his many activities. His later output as a painter does not compare in momentousness with his pre-war work, but it remained vigorous, varied, and continuously inventive of new modes for the solution of new problems. It included a number of variations on paintings by other artists, including forty-four on <i>Las Meninas</i> of <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez</span></a>. The theme of the artist and his almost magical powers is one that exercised him greatly throughout his long career.Picasso's status as a painter has perhaps overshadowed his work as a sculptor, but in this field too (although his interest was sporadic) he ranks as one of the outstanding figures in 20th-cent. art. He was one of the first artists to make sculpture that was assembled from varied materials rather than modelled or carved, and he made brilliantly witty use of found objects (see <a href=""entry://objet trouvé""><i><span class=""links"">OBJET TROUVÉ</i></span></a>). The most celebrated example is <i>Head of a Bull, Metamorphosis</i> (Musée Picasso, Paris, 1943), made of the saddle and handlebars of a bicycle. Alan Bowness has written (<i>Modern Sculpture</i>, 1965) ‘Picasso's sculpture sparkles with bright ideas&mdash;enough to have kept many a lesser man occupied for the whole of a working lifetime
it is not inconceivable that the time will come when his activities as a sculptor in the second part of his life are regarded as of more consequence than his later paintings.’ As a graphic artist (draughtsman, etcher, lithographer, linocutter), too, Picasso ranks with the greatest of the century. He was a prolific book illustrator, and as few other artists had the power to concentrate the impress of his genius in even the smallest and slightest of his works. Picasso's emotional range is as wide as his varied technical mastery. By turns tragic and playful, his work is suffused with a passionate love of life, and no artist has more devastatingly exposed the cruelty and folly of his fellow men or more rapturously celebrated the physical pleasures of love. There are Picasso museums in Barcelona and Paris and other examples of his huge output (which has been estimated at 20,000 works) are in collections throughout the world."

Little is known of his youth, but by 1671 he was well established in London and was much employed by Sir Christopher Wren on the rebuilding of the City churches, both as a mason and as a stone-carver. He was also a wood-carver, and his work in this field is of such quality that it has sometimes been credited to Grinling <a href=""entry://Gibbons, Grinling""><span class=""links"">Gibbons </span></a>.

<b>Piero della Francesca </b>
<i>(Piero dei Franceschi )</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1410/20&ndash;1492).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, virtually forgotten for centuries after his death, but regarded since his rediscovery in the early 20th cent. as one of the supreme artists of the <a href=""entry://quattrocento""><span class=""links"">quattrocento</span></a>. He was born in Borgo San Sepolcro (now Sansepolcro) in Umbria and spent much of his life there. We hear of him also at various times in Ferrara, Rimini, Arezzo, Rome, and Urbino. But he found the origins of his style in Florence, and he probably lived there as a young man for some time during the 1430s, although he is documented there only once, in 1439 (the first known reference to him), when he was assisting <a href=""entry://Domenico Veneziano ""><span class=""links"">Domenico Veneziano </span></a> on frescos (now lost) in S. Egidio. His first documented work, the <a href=""entry://polyptych""><span class=""links"">polyptych</span></a> of the <i>Madonna della Misericordia</i> (Pinacoteca, Sansepolcro), commissioned in 1445 but not completed until much later, shows that he had studied and absorbed the artistic discoveries of his great Florentine predecessors and contemporaries&mdash;<a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello</span></a>, Domenico Veneziano, Filippo <a href=""entry://Lippi, Filippino""><span class=""links"">Lippi </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Uccello, Paolo""><span class=""links"">Uccello </span></a>, and even <a href=""entry://Masolino da Panicalec ""><span class=""links"">Masolino</span></a>, who anticipated something of Piero's use of broad masses of colour. Piero unified, completed, and refined upon the discoveries these artists had made in the previous 20 years and created a style in which monumental, meditative grandeur and almost mathematical lucidity are combined with limpid beauty of colour and light. His major work is a series of <a href=""entry://fresco""><span class=""links"">frescos</span></a> on the <i>Legend of the True Cross</i> in the choir of S. Francesco at Arezzo (<i>c.</i>1452&ndash;<i>c.</i>1465). The subject was a medieval legend of great complexity, but Piero made from its fanciful details some of the most solemn and serene images in western art&mdash;even the two battle scenes have a feeling of grim deliberation rather than violent movement. He was a slow and thoughtful worker and often applied wet cloths to the plaster at night so that&mdash;contrary to normal fresco practice&mdash;he could work for more than one day on the same section.<br class=""nLine"" />Much of Piero's later career was spent working at the humanist court of Federico da <a href=""entry://Montefeltro""><span class=""links"">Montefeltro</span></a> at Urbino. There he painted the portraits of Federico and his wife (Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1465) and the celebrated <i>Flagellation</i> (still at Urbino, in the Ducal Palace). The <i>Flagellation</i> is his most enigmatic work, and it has called forth varied interpretations; <a href=""entry://Gombrich, Sir Ernst""><span class=""links"">Gombrich</span></a> has suggested that the subject is rather <i>The Repentance of Judas</i> and <a href=""entry://Pope-Hennessy, Sir John""><span class=""links"">Pope-Hennessy</span></a> that it is <i>The Dream of St Jerome</i>. Piero is last mentioned as a painter in 1478 (in connection with a lost work) and his two final works are probably <i>The Madonna and Child with Federigo da Montefeltro</i> (Brera, Milan, <i>c.</i>1475) and the unfinished <i>Nativity</i> (NG, London). Thereafter he seems to have devoted himself to mathematics and <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a>, writing treatises on both subjects. <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> said Piero was blind when he died, and failing eyesight may have been his reason for giving up painting, but his will of 1487 declares him to be ‘sound in mind, in intellect and in body’ and is written in his own clear hand. After his death, Piero was remembered mainly as a mathematician rather than as a painter. Even Vasari, who as a native of Arezzo must have known the frescos in S. Francesco well, is lukewarm in his enthusiasm for his work. However, he had considerable influence, notably on <a href=""entry://Signorelli, Luca""><span class=""links"">Signorelli</span></a> (in the weighty solemnity of his figures) and <a href=""entry://Perugino, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Perugino</span></a> (in the spatial clarity of his compositions).

"Piero di Cosimo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Piero di Cosimo </b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1462&ndash;1521?).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter, a pupil of Cosimo <a href=""entry://Rosselli, Cosimo""><span class=""links"">Rosselli </span></a>, whose Christian name he adopted as a patronym. There are no signed, documented, or dated works by him, and reconstruction of his <i>œuvre</i> depends on the account given in <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari's </span></a>
<i>Lives</i>. It is one of Vasari's most entertaining biographies, for he portrays Piero as a highly eccentric character who lived on hard-boiled eggs, ‘which he cooked while he was boiling his glue, to save the firing’. The paintings for which he is best known are appropriately idiosyncratic&mdash;fanciful mythological inventions, inhabited by fauns, centaurs, and primitive men. There is sometimes a spirit of low comedy about these delightful works, but in the so-called <i>Death of Procris</i> (NG, London) he created a poignant scene of the utmost pathos and tenderness. He was a marvellous painter of animals and the dog in this picture, depicted with a mournful dignity, is one of his most memorable creations. Piero also painted portraits, the finest of which is that of Simonetta Vespucci (Musée Condé, Chantilly), in which she is depicted as Cleopatra with the asp around her neck. His religious works are somewhat more conventional, although still distinctive, and Frederick Hartt (<i>A History of Italian Renaissance Art</i>, 1970) has written that ‘His whimsical Madonnas, Holy Families, and Adorations provide a welcome relief from the wholesale imitation of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> in early Cinquecento Florence.’ One of his outstanding religious works is the <i>Immaculate Conception</i> (Uffizi, Florence), which seems to have been the compositional model for the <i>Madonna of the Harpies</i> by his pupil <a href=""entry://Andrea da Firenze ""><span class=""links"">Andrea del Sarto </span></a>."

<i>(or Pinturicchio) (Bernardino di Betto )</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1454&ndash;1513).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, born in Perugia. He was probably a pupil of <a href=""entry://Perugino, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Perugino</span></a> and it is likely that he assisted him with his frescos in the Sistine Chapel, Rome (1481&ndash;2). His style was strongly influenced by Perugino, especially in his sweet, elegant figure types, but Pintoricchio lacked Perugino's lucidity of design and was more interested in decorative effects. His chief works are frescos in the Borgia rooms in the Vatican (1492&ndash;5) and the colourful <i>Scenes from the Life of Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini</i> (i.e. Pope Pius II) in the Piccolomini Library of Siena Cathedral (1503). In these he showed the brilliant colours, ornamental detail, and fanciful charm that make him at his best, in the words of Frederick Hartt (<i>A History of Italian Renaissance Art</i>, 1970), ‘one of the most endearing masters of the <a href=""entry://quattrocento""><span class=""links"">Quattrocento</span></a>
a kind of Perugian Benozzo <a href=""entry://Gozzoli, Benozzo""><span class=""links"">Gozzoli </span></a>’. Pintoricchio was a prolific painter of panels as well as frescos&mdash;there are several examples of his work in the National Gallery, London."
"Piper, John","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Piper, John</b><div class=""content""><i>(1903&ndash;92).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, graphic artist, designer, and writer. He reluctantly became an articled clerk in his father's legal firm, but took up the study of art after his father's death in 1926, first at the Richmond School of Art and then at the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a>. From 1928 to 1933 he wrote as an art critic for the <i>Listener</i> and the <i>Nation</i> and was among the first to recognize such contemporaries as William <a href=""entry://Coldstream, Sir William""><span class=""links"">Coldstream </span></a>, Ivon <a href=""entry://Hitchens, Ivon""><span class=""links"">Hitchens </span></a>, Victor <a href=""entry://Pasmore, Victor""><span class=""links"">Pasmore </span></a>, and Ceri <a href=""entry://Richards, Ceri""><span class=""links"">Richards </span></a>. By the mid 1930s he was one of the leading British abstract artists, but by the end of the decade he had become disillusioned with non-representational art and reverted to naturalism. He concentrated on landscape and architectural views in a subjective emotionally charged style that continued the English <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic tradition</span></a>. Some of his most memorable works were done as an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a> when he made pictures of bomb-damaged buildings. A similar stormy atmosphere pervades his famous views of country houses of the same period. Piper's work diversified in the 1950s and he became recognized as one of the most versatile British artists of his generation. He did much work as a stage designer and designer of stained glass (notably at Coventry Cathedral) and was a prolific printmaker. In addition he made book illustrations and designed pottery and textiles. As a writer he is probably best known for his book <i>British Romantic Artists</i> (1942). He also compiled architectural guidebooks to several English counties, usually in collaboration with the poet Sir John Betjeman ."
"Piranesi, Giovanni Battista","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Piranesi, Giovanni Battista</b><div class=""content""><i>(1720&ndash;78).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian etcher, archaeologist, and architect, born in Venice but active for almost all his career in Rome, where he settled in 1740. In Venice he had studied perspective and stage design and in Rome he achieved great popularity with his dramatically conceived etchings of the ancient and modern city&mdash;the <i>Vedute</i>&mdash;published from 1745 onwards. He often altered the scale of buildings to make them look even grander than they are in actuality (Horace <a href=""entry://Walpole, Horace""><span class=""links"">Walpole </span></a> said he ‘conceived visions of Rome beyond what it boasted even in the meridian of its splendour’) and his work played a major role in shaping the popular mental image of the city. Piranesi produced numerous other plates of Roman antiquities and architectural details, but his most original works are a series of <i>Carceri d'Invenzione</i>, fantastic imaginary prisons, begun <i>c.</i>1745 and reworked in 1761. These striking and obsessive works were later claimed by the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealists</span></a> as an anticipation of their principles and their influence can be seen in 20th-cent. horror movies. Only one of Piranesi's architectural designs was built (Sta Maria del Priorato, Rome, 1764&ndash;6), but he was important as an architectural polemicist, most notably in his <i>Della magnificenza ed architettura de' Romani</i> (1761), in which he championed the superiority of Roman architecture over Greek. He influenced not only architects, but also stage designers and painters of <a href=""entry://capriccio""><span class=""links"">capricci</span></a> such as his friend Hubert <a href=""entry://Robert, Hubert""><span class=""links"">Robert </span></a>, and he had a powerful impact on the literary imagination. William <a href=""entry://Beckford, William""><span class=""links"">Beckford </span></a>, for example, said that in writing his Gothic novel <i>Vathek</i> (1786) ‘I drew chasms, and subterranean hollows, the domain of fear and torture, with chains, racks, wheels and dreadful engines in the style of Piranesi.’ His etchings continued to be published for many years after his death and his work was continued by his son <i>Francesco</i> (1758&ndash;1810)."
"Pisanello","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pisanello</b>
<i>(Antonio Pisano )</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1395&ndash;1455?).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter and medallist. He presumably came from Pisa (hence his nickname), but he spent his early years in Verona, a city with which he kept up his association for most of his life. His successful career also took him to the Vatican and numerous courts of northern Italy. With <a href=""entry://Gentile da Fabriano ""><span class=""links"">Gentile da Fabriano </span></a>, Pisanello is regarded as the foremost exponent of the <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a> style in Italian painting, but most of his major works have perished, including frescos in Venice (in which he collaborated with Gentile) and in Rome (in which he completed work left unfinished by Gentile at his death). His surviving documented frescos are <i>The Annunciation</i> (S. Fermo, Verona, 1423&ndash;4) and <i>St George and the Princess of Trebizond</i> (Sta Anastasia, Verona, 1437&ndash;8), and attributed to him are some fragments of murals of jousting knights in the Palazzo Ducale in Mantua, uncovered in 1968 and one of the most spectacular art discoveries of recent years. A very small number of panel paintings is also given to him, two being in the National Gallery, London. On the other hand, a good many of his drawings survive, those of animals being particularly memorable. They show his keen eye for detail and his ability to convey an animal's personality. Pisanello was also the greatest portrait medallist of his period and arguably of the whole <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, his work setting standards of delicacy, precision, and clarity that have not been surpassed."
"Pisano, Andrea","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pisano, Andrea</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1290&ndash;1348/9?).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian sculptor and architect, not related to Nicola and Giovanni <a href=""entry://Pisano, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Pisano</span></a>. He probably came from Pontedera near Pisa (he is sometimes called Andrea da Pontedera), but he is first documented in Florence in 1330, when he received the commission to make a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery. The doors, finished in 1336, are the first of the three great sets for the Baptistery (the other two are by <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti </span></a>), and represent twenty scenes from the life of St John the Baptist and eight Virtues. They show a melodious line and a jeweller's refinement of execution. By 1340 Andrea was architect to Florence Cathedral (succeeding <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto </span></a>) and the only other works certainly by him or from his workshop are <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">reliefs</span></a> and statues for the cathedral's campanile. In their clear-cut designs the reliefs show the influence of Giotto's painting. In 1347 Andrea was appointed master of works at Orvieto Cathedral, where he was succeeded by his son <i>Nino</i> (d.1368) in 1349. Nino is known from documents to have been active as a goldsmith and architect, but all his surviving works are sculptures in marble. He was much less distinguished as an artist than his father, but noteworthy in being one of the first sculptors to specialize in free-standing life-size statues."
"Pisano, Nicola","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pisano, Nicola</b> (d. 1278/84) and <b>Giovanni</b><div class=""content""><i>(d. after 1314).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian sculptors and architects, father and son. They were the greatest sculptors of their period and stand at the head of the tradition of Italian sculpture in the same way that <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto </span></a> stands at the head of the tradition of Italian painting. They often worked together, but their styles are distinctive. Nicola came from Apulia, where the emperor Frederick II (d. 1250) had encouraged a <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> revival, and his first known work, the pulpit in the Baptistery at Pisa (dated 1260 Pisan style, i.e. 1259) shows his brilliant adaptation of <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> forms to a new context. He transformed a Dionysus into Simeon at the Presentation of Christ, a nude Hercules into a personification of Christian Fortitude, and a Phaedra into the Virgin Mary. But instead of following the <a href=""entry://Romanesque""><span class=""links"">Romanesque</span></a> convention of separating episodes into compartments arranged in bands, he combined them into the formal unity of single pictures on each side of the pulpit with great power and dramatic effect. Several of the figures were directly inspired by ancient sarcophagi that Nicola saw in the Campo Santo in Pisa, but they are much more than simple borrowings, for he made them the vehicle for expressing richly varied human feeling. Nicola followed the Pisa pulpit with a similar but more complex work for Siena Cathedral (1265&ndash;8). The carving is deeper, the contrasts between light and shadow sharpened, the <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">reliefs</span></a> more densely packed and full of movement. By then Nicola had a large workshop, his assistants including his son Giovanni and <a href=""entry://Arnolfo di Cambio ""><span class=""links"">Arnolfo</span></a> di Cambio. His last great project was the large fountain in the public square of Perugia, which he and Giovanni finished in 1278. The dozens of reliefs are a typical medieval mixture: biblical scenes, heraldic beasts, personifications of seasons and places, and local dignitaries; but the vigour and spontaneity of the carving express a new freedom and naturalness.<br class=""nLine"" />By 1284 Nicola was dead. Between the Perugia fountain and this date, Giovanni, alone or in company with his father, had carved the sculpture for the outside of the Pisa Baptistery (now in the Museo Nazionale). Here for the first time in Tuscany a scheme of monumental statuary was incorporated into architecture. Giovanni developed this much further in Siena, where from 1284 onwards he designed the façade of the cathedral and carried out much of the sculptural decoration (some of the figures have been transferred to the cathedral museum and a magnificent fragment is in the Victoria and Albert Museum). It is the most richly decorated of all the great Italian <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> cathedral façades, and the statuary has tremendous energy and inner life. Giovanni's last two great works were pulpits for S. Andrea, Pistoia (1300&ndash;1), and Pisa Cathedral (1302&ndash;10). They are modelled on those of his father, but more elegant in style (showing French Gothic influence) and also more emotionally charged. The Pisa pulpit was damaged in a fire in 1599, then dismantled and reassembled, some parts being dispersed; several museums, including the Metropolitan Museum, New York, have fragments that are said to come from it. Giovanni also made a number of free-standing statues, the best known of which is the <i>Madonna and Child</i> on the altar of the Arena Chapel in Padua (<i>c.</i>1305). Its grandeur and humanity suggests a close kinship with Giotto, amid whose celebrated frescos it stands."
"Pissarro, Camille","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pissarro, Camille</b><div class=""content""><i>(1830&ndash;1903).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter and graphic artist. He was born in the West Indies of a Jewish father and a Creole mother, and in 1855 moved to Paris, where he was initially strongly influenced by <a href=""entry://Corot, Jean-Baptiste-Camille""><span class=""links"">Corot</span></a>. In 1859 he met <a href=""entry://Monet, Claude""><span class=""links"">Monet</span></a>, and with him became a central figure of the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> group. Pissarro in fact was the only artist who exhibited at all eight Impressionist exhibitions and was a much-respected father figure to other members of the group. His talents as a teacher made him influential even among artists of greater stature than himself&mdash;*Cézanne and <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin</span></a>, for example, spoke glowingly of him. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&ndash;1, when his home at Louveciennes was overrun by the invaders and his paintings destroyed, he joined Monet in England and came under the influence of English landscape painters, particularly <a href=""entry://Turner, J. M. W.""><span class=""links"">Turner </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Constable, John""><span class=""links"">Constable</span></a>. In 1872 he settled at Pontoise, where he had lived 1866&ndash;9, and for some years painted there in close friendship with Cézanne, his neighbour at Auverssur-Oise. From 1884 he lived at Eragny, near Gisors, and there met <a href=""entry://Signac, Paul""><span class=""links"">Signac</span></a> and came to know <a href=""entry://Seurat, Georges""><span class=""links"">Seurat</span></a>. For some years during the 1880s he flirted with the <a href=""entry://pointillism""><span class=""links"">pointillist</span></a> technique and the optical methods of the <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionists</span></a> under Seurat's influence, but later reverted to his earlier style. From about 1895 deterioration of his eyesight caused him to give up painting out of doors and many of his late works are town views painted from windows in Paris. He died blind. Pissarro was extremely prolific not only as a painter but also in various graphic techniques. Many galleries have examples of his work; the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, has a fine collection of his drawings.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>Lucien Pissarro </i> (1863&ndash;1944), eldest son of Camille, was taught by his father and other leading members or associates of the Impressionist group. He exhibited in the final Impressionist exhibition (1886) and with Seurat in the Second <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> des Indépendants, adopting the pointillist technique for a time. In 1890 he settled in England, and he became a British citizen in 1916. From 1905 he was part of <a href=""entry://Sickert, Walter Richard""><span class=""links"">Sickert's </span></a> circle and he was a member of the <a href=""entry://Camden Town Group""><span class=""links"">Camden Town Group</span></a> and afterwards of the <a href=""entry://London Group""><span class=""links"">London Group</span></a>. He was a distinguished book illustrator and from 1894 to 1914 ran the Eragny Press, one of the best of the private presses that flourished at this period. A modest and unassuming character, he has been over-shadowed by his more famous father, but he was an important link between French Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism and English art. His daughter, <i>Orovida Pissarro </i> (1893&ndash;1968), was a painter and etcher, mainly of animal subjects."

<b>pointing</b>.<div class=""content"">A method of creating an exact copy of a statue or of enlarging a model into a full-size sculpture by taking a series of measured points on the original and transferring them by means of mechanical aids to the copy or enlargement. An elementary method of pointing using callipers was developed in the 1st cent. BC, when the copying of Greek statues for Roman patrons had become an industry, and various more sophisticated techniques, using for example a frame and plumb-line, have been used since the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. It was not until the early 19th cent., however, that the task was rationalized by the perfection of a pointing machine. This device consists of an upright stand carrying movable arms, each arm having attached to it an adjustable measuring rod which shows the depth to which each point must be drilled. Sometimes hundreds and even thousands of points will be taken. In the late 19th and early 20th cents. most stone sculpture was produced by this mechanical method, but modern sculptors increasingly reject it in favour of direct carving."

<b>Polidoro da Caravaggio </b>
<i>(Polidoro Caldara )</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1500&ndash;43).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, named after his birthplace, Caravaggio in Lombardy. At an early age he moved to Rome, where he assisted <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> in the decoration of the Vatican Loggie and then achieved great success painting palace façades with monochrome scenes imitating <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> sculpture. They have almost all perished (only the heavily restored decoration of the Palazzo Ricci remains <i>in situ</i>), but they became well known through engravings and drawings and were much imitated. Polidoro's other claim to fame is his decoration of the chapel of Fra Marino Fetti in S. Silvestro al Quirinale (1525) with two murals&mdash;oil not fresco&mdash;(one each from the life of St Mary Magdalene and St Catherine of Siena) in which he gave an entirely new prominence to the landscape, which dominates the figures. In this he foreshadowed the ‘heroic landscape’ of <a href=""entry://Monet, Claude""><span class=""links"">Claude</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>.

"Pollaiuolo, Antonio","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pollaiuolo, Antonio</b> (<i>c.</i>1432&ndash;98) and <b>Piero</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1441&ndash;<i>c.</i>1496).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine artists, brothers, who jointly ran a flourishing workshop. They are both recorded as being painters, sculptors, and goldsmiths, but there are considerable problems in attempting to disentangle their individual contributions. Antonio was evidently primarily a goldsmith and worker in bronze, Piero primarily a painter. Several documented paintings by Piero are known, all of fairly mediocre quality, but none by Antonio, and as certain pictures from the studio of the two brothers are so much better than Piero's independent work, Antonio's collaboration, at least, has usually been assumed. The most important of these pictures is the <i>Martyrdom of St Sebastian</i> in the National Gallery, London, probably painted in 1475. The figures of the archers in the foreground reveal a mastery of the nude paralleled in certain bronzes generally accepted as Antonio's (e.g. the <i>Hercules and Antaeus</i> in the Bargello, Florence, <i>c.</i>1475&ndash;80), in his only surviving engraving (<i>The Battle of the Nude Men</i>,<i>c.</i>1460), and in his numerous pen drawings in which his typically wiry figures are seen in vigorous and expressive movement. His main contribution to Florentine painting lay in his searching analysis of the anatomy of the body in movement or under conditions of strain, but he is also important for his pioneering interest in landscape, seen in the National Gallery <i>St Sebastian</i> and other works. He is said to have anticipated <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a> in dissecting corpses in order to study the anatomy of the body. Antonio's two principal public works were the bronze tombs of Pope Sixtus IV (signed and dated 1493) and Pope Innocent VIII (<i>c.</i>1492&ndash;8), both in St Peter's, Rome. The latter contains the first sepulchral effigy that simulated the living man."
"Pollock, Jackson","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pollock, Jackson</b><div class=""content""><i>(1912&ndash;56).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, the commanding figure of the <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionist</span></a> movement. In 1929&ndash;31 he studied at the <a href=""entry://Art Students League of New York""><span class=""links"">Art Students League</span></a> under Thomas Hart <a href=""entry://Benton, Thomas Hart""><span class=""links"">Benton </span></a> and was influenced not only by Benton 's restlessly energetic style, but also by his image as a virile, hard-drinking macho-man (Pollock began treatment for alcoholism in 1937 and in 1939 he started therapy with Jungian psychoanalysists, using his drawings in sessions with them). During the 1930s he painted in Benton's <a href=""entry://Regionalism""><span class=""links"">Regionalist</span></a> vein, and he was influenced also by the work of the Mexican muralists (see <a href=""entry://Orozco, José Clemente""><span class=""links"">OROZCO </span></a>; <a href=""entry://Rivera, Diego""><span class=""links"">RIVERA </span></a>; <a href=""entry://Siqueiros, David Alfaro""><span class=""links"">SIQUEIROS </span></a>) and by certain aspects of <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>, particularly the use of mythical or totemic figures as archetypes of the unconscious. From 1935 to 1942 he worked for the <a href=""entry://Federal Art Project""><span class=""links"">Federal Art Project</span></a>, and in 1943 he was given a contract by Peggy <a href=""entry://Guggenheim, Solomon R.""><span class=""links"">Guggenheim </span></a>; his first one-man show was held at her Art of this Century gallery in that year. A characteristic work of this time is <i>The She-Wolf</i> (MOMA, New York, 1943), a semi-abstract picture with vehemently handled paint and ominous imagery recalling the monstrous creatures of <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso's </span></a>
<i>Guernica</i> period. By the mid-1940s Pollock was painting in a completely abstract manner, and the ‘drip and splash’ style for which he is best known emerged with some abruptness in 1947. Instead of using the traditional easel, he laid his canvas on the floor and poured and dripped his paint from a can (using commercial enamels and metallic paint because their texture was better suited to the technique); instead of using brushes, he manipulated the paint with ‘sticks, trowels or knives’ (to use his own words), sometimes obtaining textured effects by the admixture of ‘sand, broken glass or other foreign matter’. In line with Surrealist theories of <a href=""entry://automatism""><span class=""links"">automatism</span></a>, this method of <a href=""entry://Action painting""><span class=""links"">Action painting</span></a> was supposed by artists and critics alike to result in a direct expression or revelation of the subconscious mind of the painter. Pollock's technique was bound up with the creation of the <a href=""entry://All-over painting""><span class=""links"">All-over method of painting</span></a>, which avoids any points of emphasis and abandons the traditional idea of composition in terms of relation among parts. The design of the painting had no relation to the size or shape of the canvas&mdash;indeed in the finished work the canvas was sometimes docked or trimmed to suit the image. These characteristics were important for the development of American abstract painting in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and when the drip paintings were first publicly shown, at Betty <a href=""entry://Parsons, Betty""><span class=""links"">Parsons's </span></a> New York gallery in 1948, Willem <a href=""entry://de Kooning, Willem""><span class=""links"">de Kooning </span></a> commented ‘Jackson's broken the ice.’<br class=""nLine"" />Pollock's drip period lasted only from 1947 to 1951 (in the 1950s he went back to quasi-figurative work), but it is on the paintings of these four years that his enormous reputation rests. Among the most celebrated are <i>Autumn Rhythm</i> (MOMA, New York, 1950) and <i>Lavender Mist</i> (NG, Washington, 1950), which Robert <a href=""entry://Hughes, Robert""><span class=""links"">Hughes </span></a> describes as ‘his most ravishingly atmospheric painting’. Pollock was supported by advanced critics, particularly Clement <a href=""entry://Greenberg, Clement""><span class=""links"">Greenberg </span></a> and Harold <a href=""entry://Rosenberg, Harold""><span class=""links"">Rosenberg </span></a>, and in 1949 the French painter Georges <a href=""entry://Mathieu, Georges""><span class=""links"">Mathieu </span></a> said that he considered him the ‘greatest living American painter’. However, he was also subject to much abuse as the leader of a still little comprehended movement (in 1956 <i>Time</i> magazine called him ‘Jack the Dripper’). By 1960 he was generally recognized as the most important figure in the most important movement in the history of American painting, but a movement from which artists were already in reaction. His unhappy personal life and his premature death in a car crash contributed to his status as one of the legends of modern art; he was the first American painter to become a ‘star’.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1945 Pollock married Lee Krasner (1908&ndash;84), who was an Abstract Expressionist painter of some distinction, although it was only after her husband's death that she received serious critical recognition. She was also an important source of encouragement and support to Pollock, whose attitude to his work fluctuated from supreme confidence to dismal uncertainty."

<b>Pompidou Centre</b><div class=""content"">(in full, Centre National d'Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou). Cultural centre in Paris named after Georges Pompidou (1911&ndash;74), the President of France from 1967 to 1974. In 1969 he expressed a ‘passionate wish’ for ‘a place where the plastic arts, music, cinema, literature, audio-visual research, etc. would find a common ground’. The site chosen for the Centre was the Plateau Beaubourg (hence its colloquial name ‘Beaubourg Centre’), a once thriving area near the centre of Paris that had become derelict between the World Wars. An international competition for the building produced almost 700 submissions, including bizarre ideas such as a giant egg and an enormous hand extended towards the sky, each finger being intended to house a separate department. The winning design was submitted by the Italian-British team of Renzo Piano and Richard (later Sir Richard ) Rogers. Their huge building was constructed in 1971&ndash;7 and soon became one of the most famous sights of the city. A leading example of ‘high-tech’ architecture, it has been described as looking like a ‘crazy oil refinery’ and has attracted extremes of praise and censure. The large plaza in front of the building is conceived as part of the Centre and is the main forum for the city's street performers. Also outside the building is the ebullient Beaubourg Fountain (1980) by Jean <a href=""entry://Tinguely, Jean""><span class=""links"">Tinguely </span></a> and Niki de <a href=""entry://Saint Phalle, Niki de""><span class=""links"">Saint Phalle </span></a>. The Centre is divided into various departments, including a library, an industrial design centre, and an institute for the development and promotion of avant-garde music. The largest of the departments and the main reason for the Centre's popularity is the national collection of modern art&mdash;the Musée National d'Art Moderne&mdash;which was formerly housed in the Palais de Tokyo. It was opened there in 1947, but its origins are much older, for it is the heir to the Musée du Luxembourg, opened in 1818 as a showcase for the work of living artists.

<b>Pontormo</b>
<i>(Jacopo Carucci )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1494&ndash;1556).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, born in the Tuscan village of Pontormo, near Empoli, and active in and around Florence. According to <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>, he studied successively with <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo da Vinci </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Albertinelli, Mariotto""><span class=""links"">Albertinelli</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Piero di Cosimo ""><span class=""links"">Piero di Cosimo </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Andrea del Sarto ""><span class=""links"">Andrea del Sarto </span></a>, whose workshop he is said to have entered in 1512. Andrea was certainly a major influence on his early work. Pontormo was precocious (he was praised by <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> whilst still a youth) and by the time he painted his <i>Joseph in Egypt</i> (NG, London) in about 1515 he had already created a distinctive style&mdash;full of restless movement and disconcertingly irrational effects of scale and space&mdash;that put him in the vanguard of <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerism</span></a>. The emotional tension apparent in this work reaches its peak in Pontormo's masterpiece, the altarpiece of the <i>Entombment</i> (<i>c.</i>1526&ndash;8) in the Capponi Chapel of Sta Felicità, Florence. Painted in extraordinarily vivid colours and featuring deeply poignant figures who seem lost in a trance of grief, this is one of the key works of Mannerism. Pontormo was primarily a religious painter, but he was also an outstanding portraitist (he was a major influence on his pupil and adopted son <a href=""entry://Bronzino, Agnolo""><span class=""links"">Bronzino</span></a>) and in 1520&ndash;1 for the <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici</span></a> villa at Poggio a Caiano he painted a memorable mythological work (<i>Vertumnus and Pomona</i> according to Vasari, but the identification is disputed) in which an apparently idyllic scene reveals a strong undercurrent of neurosis. In Pontormo's later work his style was enriched by the study of Michelangelo and <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer's </span></a> prints, but this stage of his career is known mainly through his superb drawings (best represented in the Uffizi), as the great fresco scheme in S. Lorenzo, Florence, that occupied him from 1546 until his death, was destroyed in the 18th cent. Pontormo's diary for part of 1554&ndash;6 remains, giving a day-to-day account of his progress. It tells us much of his neurotic character&mdash;melancholy and introspective, dismayed by the slightest illness."
"Pop art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pop art</b>.<div class=""content"">A movement based on the imagery of consumerism and popular culture, flourishing from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, chiefly in the USA and Britain. The term was coined <i>c.</i>1955 by Lawrence <a href=""entry://Alloway, Lawrence""><span class=""links"">Alloway </span></a>. Comic books, advertisements, packaging, and images from television and the cinema were all part of the iconography of the movement, and it was a feature of Pop art in both the USA and Britain that it rejected any distinction between good and bad taste. In the USA Pop art was initially regarded as a reaction from <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a> because its exponents brought back figural imagery and made use of <a href=""entry://Hard Edge painting""><span class=""links"">Hard Edge techniques</span></a>. It was seen as a descendant of <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada</span></a> (in fact Pop art is sometimes called <a href=""entry://Neo-Dada""><span class=""links"">Neo-Dada</span></a>) because it debunked the seriousness of the art world and embraced the use or reproduction of commonplace subjects (comic strips, soup tins, highway signs) in a manner that had affinities with <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp's</span></a>
<a href=""entry://ready-made""><span class=""links"">ready-mades</span></a>. The most immediate inspiration, however, was the work of Jasper <a href=""entry://Johns, Jasper""><span class=""links"">Johns </span></a> and Robert <a href=""entry://Rauschenberg, Robert""><span class=""links"">Rauschenberg </span></a>, both of whom began to make an impact on the New York art scene in the mid-1950s. They opened a wide new range of subject matter with Johns's paintings of flags, targets, and numbers and his sculptures of objects such as beer cans and Rauschenberg's <a href=""entry://collage""><span class=""links"">collages</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Combine painting""><span class=""links"">combine paintings</span></a> with Coca-Cola bottles, stuffed birds, and photographs from magazines and newspapers. While often using similar subject matter, Pop artists generally favoured commercial techniques in preference to the painterly manner of Johns and Rauschenberg. Examples are Andy <a href=""entry://Warhol, Andy""><span class=""links"">Warhol's </span></a> silkscreens of soup tins, heads of Marilyn Monroe, and so on, Roy <a href=""entry://Lichtenstein, Roy""><span class=""links"">Lichtenstein's </span></a> paintings in the manner of comic strips, and Mel <a href=""entry://Ramos, Mel""><span class=""links"">Ramos's </span></a> brash pinups. Claes <a href=""entry://Oldenburg, Claes""><span class=""links"">Oldenberg </span></a>, whose subjects include ice-cream cones and hamburgers, has been the major Pop art sculptor. John Wilmerding (<i>American Art</i>, 1976) writes that Pop art ‘cannot be separated from the culmination of affluence and prosperity during the post-World-War-II era. America had become a ravenously consuming society, packaging art as well as other products, indulging in commercial manipulation, and celebrating exhibitionism, self-promotion, and instant success
Pop's mass-media orientation may further be related to the acceleration of uniformity in most aspects of national life, whether restaurants or regional dialects. Shared by all Americans were the principal preoccupations of Pop art&mdash;sex, the automobile, and food.’<br class=""nLine"" />In Britain, too, Pop art revelled in a new glossy prosperity following years of postwar austerity. British Pop was nurtured by the <a href=""entry://Independent Group""><span class=""links"">Independent Group</span></a> and the work that is often cited as the first fully-fledged Pop art image was produced under its auspices&mdash;Richard <a href=""entry://Hamilton, Richard""><span class=""links"">Hamilton's </span></a> collage <i>Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing</i>? (Kunsthalle, Tübingen, 1956). However, British art first made a major impact at the <a href=""entry://Young Contemporaries""><span class=""links"">Young Contemporaries</span></a> exhibition in 1961 (at about the same time that American art became a force). The artists in this exhibition included Derek <a href=""entry://Boshier, Derek""><span class=""links"">Boshier </span></a>, David <a href=""entry://Hockney, David""><span class=""links"">Hockney </span></a>, Allen <a href=""entry://Jones, Allen""><span class=""links"">Jones </span></a>, R. B. <a href=""entry://Kitaj, Ron B.""><span class=""links"">Kitaj </span></a>, and Peter <a href=""entry://Phillips, Peter""><span class=""links"">Phillips </span></a>, who had all been students at the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a>. In the same year the BBC screened Ken Russell's <i>Monitor</i> film ‘Pop goes the easel’, in which Peter <a href=""entry://Blake, Peter""><span class=""links"">Blake </span></a> was one of the featured artists. Although there are exceptions (notably the erotic sculptures of Allen Jones ), British Pop was generally less brash than American, expressing a more romantic view of the subject matter in a way that can now strike a note of nostalgia. Much of the imagery, however, came directly from the American world of pin-ups and pin-ball machines. Richard Hamilton defined Pop art as ‘popular, transient, expendable, low-cost, mass produced, young, witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, and Big Business’, and it was certainly a success on a material level, getting through to the public in a way that few modern movements do and attracting big money collectors. However, it was scorned by many critics. Harold <a href=""entry://Rosenberg, Harold""><span class=""links"">Rosenberg </span></a>, for example, described Pop as being ‘Like a joke without humour, told over and over again until it begins to sound like a threat
Advertising art which advertises itself as art that hates advertising.’"

After working in a provincial style at the very start of his career (his master is unknown and <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> says he was self-taught), by the beginning of the second decade of the 16th cent. he had come close to the contemporary Venetian (specifically <a href=""entry://Giorgione ""><span class=""links"">Giorgionesque</span></a>) manner of painting. In the second half of the decade, however, he was in central Italy, and his style changed under the impact particularly of <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, acquiring great weight and solidity. Pordenone was influenced also by <a href=""entry://Mantegna, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Mantegna's </span></a> illusionism and by German prints, and the style he forged from these diverse influences was highly distinctive and original. He always retained something of provincial uncouthness&mdash;at times vulgarity&mdash;but he was, in Vasari's words, ‘very rich in invention
bold and resolute’, and he excelled at dramatic spatial effects. These qualities are seen at their most forceful in his fresco of the <i>Crucifixion</i> (1520&ndash;1) in Cremona Cathedral; the densely packed, bizarrely expressive figures are seen as if on a stage through a painted proscenium arch and they lunge violently out into the spectator's space. From 1527 Pordenone was based in Venice and for a while he was a serious rival to <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a>. His major works in Venice have been destroyed, however. Pordenone died in Ferrara, where he had gone to design tapestries for Ercole II d'<a href=""entry://Este""><span class=""links"">Este</span></a>."

<b>Post, Frans</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1612&ndash;80).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch landscape painter, born in Leiden and active mainly in Haarlem. In 1637&ndash;44 he was a member of the Dutch West India Company's voyage of colonization to Brazil and became the first European to paint landscapes in the New World. He observed the unfamiliar flora and fauna with an appropriate freshness, creating scenes of remarkable vividness and charm, and he continued to paint Brazilian landscapes after his return to the Netherlands (indeed he is not known to have painted any other type of picture). Because of his *‘<a href=""entry://naïve art""><span class=""links"">naïve</span></a>’ style, he has been called the Douanier <a href=""entry://Rousseau, Henri""><span class=""links"">Rousseau </span></a> of the 17th cent., and he was virtually forgotten or regarded as a curiosity until the 20th cent. Examples of his fairly rare work are in the Louvre, the National Gallery of Ireland, and Ham House, London. His brother <i>Pieter</i> (1608&ndash;69) was one of the outstanding Dutch architects of the 17th cent. (the Huis ten Bosch near The Hague is his most famous work) and also occasionally painted."
"Post-Impressionism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Post-Impressionism</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to various trends in painting, particularly in France, that developed from <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a> or in reaction against it in the period <i>c.</i>1880&ndash;<i>c.</i>1905. Roger <a href=""entry://Fry, Roger""><span class=""links"">Fry </span></a> coined the term as the title of an exhibition, ‘Manet and the Post-Impressionists’, which he organized at the Grafton Galleries, London, in 1910&ndash;11. The exhibition was dominated by the work of <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin</span></a>, and van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a>, who are considered the central figures of Post-Impressionism. These three artists varied greatly in their response to Impressionism: Cézanne, who wished ‘to make of Impressionism something solid and enduring, like the art of the museums’, was preoccupied with pictorial structure; Gauguin renounced ‘the abominable error of naturalism’ to explore the symbolic use of colour and line; and van Gogh's uninhibited emotional intensity was the fountainhead of <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a>. Georges <a href=""entry://Seurat, Georges""><span class=""links"">Seurat </span></a>, a figure of almost equal importance, concentrated on a more scientific analysis of colour (see <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">NEO-IMPRESSIONISM</span></a>). The general drift of Post-Impressionism was to lead away from the naturalism of Impressionism towards the series of avant-garde movements (such as <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauvism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>) that revolutionized European art in the decade leading up to the First World War. (Some writers extend the notion of Post-Impressionism to cover these developments, making the term embrace the period <i>c.</i>1880&ndash;<i>c.</i>1914, but this makes an already broad concept less rather than more useful.)<br class=""nLine"" />Fry organized his first Post-Impressionist exhibition at short notice and in an almost casual atmosphere, but he brought together a highly impressive (if far from balanced) collection of pictures, mainly loaned by leading French dealers. The exhibition created what the <i>Daily Mail</i> called ‘an altogether unprecedented artistic sensation’ or what <a href=""entry://Sickert, Walter Richard""><span class=""links"">Sickert </span></a> more succinctly described as a ‘rumpus’. The reviews were mainly unpleasant, sometimes viciously so. Some visitors were angry (Duncan <a href=""entry://Grant, Duncan""><span class=""links"">Grant </span></a> recalled people shaking their umbrellas at the pictures) and others mocked. The prevailing opinion was that the pictures on show were childish, crude, and the product of moral degeneracy or mental derangement. Duncan Grant, however, said that he and Vanessa <a href=""entry://Bell, Vanessa""><span class=""links"">Bell </span></a> were ‘widly enthusiastic’ about the exhibition, and it powerfully affected the work of several of the painters in Sickert's circle (see <a href=""entry://Camden Town Group""><span class=""links"">CAMDEN TOWN GROUP</span></a>), in general encouraging the use of strong, flat colours."
"Post-Painterly Abstraction","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Post-Painterly Abstraction</b>.<div class=""content"">A term coined by the critic Clement <a href=""entry://Greenberg, Clement""><span class=""links"">Greenberg </span></a> to characterize a broad trend in American painting, beginning in the 1950s, in which abstract painters reacted in various ways against the <a href=""entry://Gestural painting""><span class=""links"">Gestural</span></a> ‘painterly’ qualities of <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a>. Greenberg used the term as the title of an exhibition he organized at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1964. He took the word ‘painterly’ (in German <i>malerisch</i>) from Heinrich <a href=""entry://Wölfflin, Heinrich""><span class=""links"">Wölfflin </span></a>, who had discussed it in his book <i>Principles of Art History</i>. By it he understood ‘the blurred, broken, loose definition of colour and contour’; Post-Painterly Abstractionists, in contrast, moved towards ‘physical openness of design, or toward linear clarity, or toward both’. The characterization was never a very exact one, but essentially it described a rejection of expressive brushwork in favour of broad areas of unmodulated colour. The term thus embraces more precisely defined types of abstract art including <a href=""entry://Colour Field painting""><span class=""links"">Colour Field painting</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Hard Edge painting""><span class=""links"">Hard-Edge painting</span></a>.

His best-known work, the life-size <i>Young Bull</i> (Mauritshuis, The Hague, 1647), was in the 19th cent. one of the most famous paintings in Dutch art.

<b>Poussin, Nicolas</b><div class=""content""><i>(1594&ndash;1665).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, active mainly in Rome. He is regarded not only as the greatest French painter of the 17th cent., but also as the mainspring of the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> tradition in French painting. His interest in painting was aroused by the visit to his home town, Les Andelys, in 1611 of Quentin Varin (<i>c.</i>1570&ndash;1634), a mediocre late <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> painter, and in 1612 he settled in Paris, where his early years are obscure. Between commissions of various kinds&mdash;the most notable being for work for the Luxembourg palace, with Philippe de <a href=""entry://Champaigne, Philippe de""><span class=""links"">Champaigne</span></a> (<i>c.</i>1621)&mdash;Poussin made two unsuccessful attempts to go to Rome. He was also commissioned by the Italian poet Marino to make drawings to illustrate Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> (Royal Library, Windsor, <i>c.</i>1623), and these are the first surviving works certainly by him. In 1623 he once more set out for Rome; travelling via Venice, he arrived early in 1624. Through Marino he came to the notice of Cardinal Francesco <a href=""entry://Barberini""><span class=""links"">Barberini </span></a> and his secretary Cassiano dal Pozzo, who became his patrons. He worked for a time in the studio of <a href=""entry://Domenichino ""><span class=""links"">Domenichino </span></a> and under the influence of Cassiano, who had a keen interest in antiquity, he studied Roman sculpture. With the predominance of these interests his style began to shed earlier Mannerist influences, becoming more restrained and classical. He was never at home with the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> style that was coming to the fore in Rome, and the only public picture he painted in Rome, the altarpiece of <i>The Martyrdom of St Erasmus</i>, commissioned by Cardinal Barberini for St Peter's (Vatican Pinacoteca, 1628), was coolly received. His most personal work during this period is the <i>Inspiration of the Poet</i> (Louvre, Paris, <i>c.</i>1628), classical in design but Venetian in its rich colouring.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1629&ndash;30 Poussin was seriously ill and was nursed back to health by the family of Jacques Dughet, a French chef working in Rome, whose daughter he married. The illness coincided with a change of direction in his work. Abandoning the competition for public commissions and rivalry with the current Baroque, he gave himself up to his dominating passion for the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a>. Instead of religious subjects he painted themes from ancient mythology seen through the eyes of Ovid or Torquato Tasso, which he treated in a pastoral and poetic mood. Until about 1633 the influence of <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a> was paramount. During the latter part of the 1630s he turned to Old Testament and historical subjects which afforded scope for more elaborate pageantry (<i>The Worship of the Golden Calf</i>, NG, London, <i>c.</i>1635). In the paintings of these years the influence of Titian waned and be moved towards a more austere classicism which echoed the later Raphael and <a href=""entry://Giulio Romano ""><span class=""links"">Giulio</span></a> Romano. He was preoccupied with the depiction of emotion by the gestures, pose, and facial expression of his figures, and pondered a literary and psychological conception of painting which he elaborated in a letter sent to his friend Paul Fréart de Chantelou, a civil servant, with the picture <i>The Gathering of the Manna</i> (Louvre, 1639).<br class=""nLine"" />His reputation was very high by the end of the 1630s and in 1640 he reluctantly succumbed to strong pressure and returned to Paris. He was commissioned to superintend the decoration of the Grande Galerie of the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a> (work wholly alien to his temperament), to paint altarpieces, and to design frontispieces for the royal press. His visit was ruined by jealousy and intrigue, and in September 1642 he left again for Rome, remaining there for the rest of his life. The most important outcome of the visit for Poussin was that he had come into contact with the intellectual bourgeoisie of Paris, the public of Pierre Corneille and René Descartes, who patronized him for the remainder of his life. During the next decade he painted for such patrons the works that in his own day were considered to be his finest achievement and are still recognized as the purest exemplification of the classical spirit. The emphasis is on clarity of conception, moral solemnity, and obedience to rule. Poussin made it his endeavour to achieve a rational unity of mood in each picture and developed a theory of <i>modes</i> (later taken up by the Académie) akin to the current theory of musical ‘modes’ supposed to be derived from antiquity. According to this theory the subject of the picture and the emotional situations depicted dictate the appropriate treatment, which can be worked out rationally and consistently according to principles expressible in language. His working procedure was as methodical as his theoretical approach, for he not only made numerous drawings but also employed wax models on a kind of miniature stage-set so he could study the composition and lighting with great deliberateness. The series of paintings on the <i>Seven Sacraments</i> (Earl of Ellesmere Coll., on loan to NG, Edinburgh, 1644&ndash;8), painted for Chantelou, show the solemnity and rational economy of his work at this time, and make a fascinating comparison with an earlier, more sensuous series on the same subjects, painted for Cassiano dal Pozzo in 1636&ndash;40 (five in collection of Duke of Rutland, Belvoir; one in NG, Washington; one destroyed).<br class=""nLine"" />During the second half of the 1640s Poussin displayed a new interest in landscape, applying to animate and inanimate nature the principles of quasi-mathematical lucidity and order he sought elsewhere. He achieved an impression of monumental simplicity and calm, exemplified in two great works of 1648 illustrating the story of Phocion (Earl of Plymouth Coll., on loan to National Mus. of Wales; and Walker Art Gal., Liverpool). Together with the work of his friend <a href=""entry://Claude Gellée ""><span class=""links"">Claude</span></a> and his brother-in-law <a href=""entry://Dughet, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Dughet</span></a>, Poussin's paintings in the genre were the basis for <a href=""entry://ideal""><span class=""links"">ideal</span></a> landscape for the next two centuries. By 1650 Poussin had become something of a hermit, but he had achieved European fame and his position in the world of art was unique. Between 1653 and his death in 1665 his style underwent yet a further development. Psychological expression, even if rationally controlled, was underplayed and his compositions took on a timeless allegorical quality. A motionless solemnity took the place of action and gesture and his pictures became symbols of eternal truths instead of representations of historical events. In some of the works figures attain a superhuman grandeur (<i>The Holy Family</i>, Hermitage, St Petersburg, <i>c.</i>1655), and in others nature takes on a new wildness and splendour, as in his last great works, <i>The Four Seasons</i> (Louvre, 1660&ndash;4). The cold rationalism of his earlier works was left behind, and a poetical, imaginative, almost mystical approach took its place.<br class=""nLine"" />Poussin's example was the basis of <a href=""entry://Lebrun, Charles""><span class=""links"">Lebrun's</span></a> academic doctrine and has been of enormous influence on the development of French art. In the later 17th cent. Poussin's name was used in the Académie to give support to those who believed in the superior importance of design in painting (Poussinistes) in opposition to that of <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens</span></a>, who stood for the importance of colouring, and although the Rubensistes won the day, Poussin continued to be the inspiration of classically minded artists right into the early 19th cent. In the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> era his influence declined, but his spirit was revived again by <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne</span></a>, who declared that he wanted ‘to do Poussin again, from Nature’."

If this is so, it can be claimed as the only surviving original statue by a Greek sculptor of the first rank. Certainly it has a delicacy in the modelling of forms and a subtlety of finish far removed from the workmanship seen in most Roman copies, and it shows the sensuous charm and gentle grace for which he was renowned. In antiquity his most famous work was the <i><a href=""entry://Aphrodite of Cnidus""><span class=""links"">Aphrodite of Cnidus</i></a></span>, known through several copies.

The other four original brethren were James <a href=""entry://Collinson, James""><span class=""links"">Collinson </span></a>, the sculptor Thomas <a href=""entry://Woolner, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Woolner </span></a>, and the art critics W. M. Rossetti (1829&ndash;1919) and F. G. Stephens (1828&ndash;1907). Ford Madox <a href=""entry://Brown, Ford Madox""><span class=""links"">Brown </span></a> was closely allied with them, though not at any time a member of the Brotherhood. The movement had a strong literary flavour from the start, and the members published a journal called <i>The Germ</i>. They chose religious or other morally uplifting themes and had a desire for fidelity to nature that they expressed through detailed observation of flora, etc., and the use of a clear, bright, sharp-focus technique. The kind of pictures they hated were academic ‘machines’ and trivial <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes. The initials PRB were first used on Rossetti's picture <i>The Girlhood of Mary Virgin</i> (Tate, London), exhibited in 1849, and were adopted by the other members of the Brotherhood. When their meaning became known in 1850 the group was subjected to violent criticism and abuse. Charles Dickens led the attack in his periodical <i>Household Words</i>, calling Millais's <i>Christ in the House of His Parents</i> (Tate) ‘mean, odious, revolting and repulsive’. He was outraged by the implied rejection of Raphael (still unquestioningly thought of by many critics as the greatest painter who ever lived), and he regarded the claim to go behind Raphael as an antiprogressive reversion to primitivism and ugliness. The fortunes of the Pre-Raphaelites improved after they were publicly defended by <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a> in 1851, and they attracted numerous followers, including <a href=""entry://Deverell, Walter Howell""><span class=""links"">Deverell</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Hughes, Arthur""><span class=""links"">Hughes</span></a>. By 1853, however, the group had virtually dissolved. Apart from their youthful revolutionary spirit (they were very young in 1848) and their romantic if uninformed medievalism, the prime movers had little in common as artists and they went their separate ways. Of the original members only Hunt remained true to PRB doctrines. Millais adopted a much looser style and went on to become the most popular and successful painter of the day. Curiously, however, it was Rossetti, the least committed to PRB ideals (he never cultivated painstaking detail), who continued the name. Although his later work, made up principally of languorous depictions of <i>femmes fatales</i>, is entirely different from his Pre-Raphaelite pictures, the name stuck to him and to his followers such as <a href=""entry://Morris, William""><span class=""links"">Morris</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Burne-Jones, Sir Edward Coley""><span class=""links"">Burne-Jones</span></a>. Thus in the popular imagination the term ‘Pre-Raphaelite’ conjures up pictures of medieval romance, and ironically a movement that began as a rebellion against artificiality and sentimentality is now itself identified with a kind of escapism. This second wave of pseudomedieval Pre-Raphaelitism began in the 1860s and survived into the 20th cent., in the work, for example, of Evelyn <a href=""entry://De Morgan, Evelyn""><span class=""links"">De Morgan </span></a>."
"Precisionism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Precisionism</b>.<div class=""content"">A movement in American painting, originating <i>c.</i>1915 and flourishing in the inter-war period, particularly the 1920s, in which urban and especially industrial subjects were depicted with a very smooth, and precise technique, creating clear, sharply defined, sometimes quasi-<a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a> forms. The terms ‘Cubist-Realists’, ‘Immaculates’, and ‘Sterilists’ have also been applied to Precisionist painters. They were not a formal group, but they often exhibited together. <a href=""entry://Demuth, Charles""><span class=""links"">Demuth </span></a>, <a href=""entry://O'Keeffe, Georgia""><span class=""links"">O'Keeffe </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Sheeler, Charles R.""><span class=""links"">Sheeler </span></a> were among the leading figures. In Precisionist painting the light is often brilliantly clear (although George Ault (1891&ndash;1948) was best known for his night scenes) and frequently forms are chosen for their geometric interest. Human presence is excluded and there is no social comment. Rather, the American industrial and technological scene is endowed with an air of epic grandeur. The degree of Cubist influence varied greatly. Some of Sheeler's paintings are in an almost photographically realistic style, whereas other works are semi-abstract. Precisionism was influential in both imagery and technique on American <a href=""entry://Magic(al) Realism""><span class=""links"">Magic Realism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a>."

He was a Bostonian and spent much of his career travelling and painting abroad, and it was only in the last few years of his life that he lived in New York, the centre of the Eight's activities. The main thing he had in common with the other members was a desire to move American art away from academic stagnation, and his work is notable for its brilliant decorative colour. His paintings were often of people enjoying themselves in innocent pleasures (Central Park in 1903, Met. Mus., New York, 1903). He was one of the first American artists to be influenced by <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionism</span></a>, notably in the way in which he emphasized flat pattern rather than illusionistic space.

<i>(also called II Cavaliere Calabrese )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1613&ndash;99).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> painter. He came from Taverna in Calabria (hence his nickname) and his prolific career took him to many different parts of Italy (and according to an early biographer to Spain and Flanders). His early work includes groups of musicians and card-players, strongly <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggesque</span></a> in style, but later he excelled mainly in frescos on religious subjects. In this field his main model was <a href=""entry://Lanfranco, Giovanni""><span class=""links"">Lanfranco</span></a>, whom he succeeded in the decoration of S. Andrea della Valle in Rome (1650&ndash;1). After the plague of 1656 carried off virtually a whole generation of artists in Naples, Preti worked with great success there, gaining many important commissions. They included a series of seven frescos commemorating the plague for the city gates; they no longer survive, but two <a href=""entry://modello""><span class=""links"">modelli</span></a> for them are in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples and give some idea of how powerful the huge frescos must have been. In 1661 Preti moved to Malta, where he lived for the rest of his life. Several churches on the island, including the cathedral of Valletta, have decorations by him."

He was born in Bologna and developed his all-round skills as <a href=""entry://Giulio Romano ""><span class=""links"">Giulio</span></a> Romano's assistant in Mantua. In 1532 he was called to France by Francis I and worked with <a href=""entry://Rosso, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Rosso </span></a> at Fontainebleau.

"primitive","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>primitive</b>.<div class=""content"">Term used with various meanings in the history and criticism of the arts. In its widest sense it is applied to art of societies outside the great Western, Near Eastern, and Oriental civilizations, even though much of it was produced by highly sophisticated peoples. Pre-Columbian art, North American Indian art, African art south of the Sahara, and Oceanic art are the main areas embraced by the term. By extension it has been applied to other fields of art that appear unsophisticated relative to some particular standard. Thus the term was once widely used of pre-<a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> European painting, particularly of the Italian and Netherlandish schools, but this usage (as in the expression ‘the Flemish primitives’) is now much less common and no longer has derogatory implications. The term ‘primitive’ is also used more or less as a synonym for <a href=""entry://naïve art""><span class=""links"">naïve</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />In the context of 20th-cent. art the term ‘primitivism’ refers to the use by Western modernist artists of forms or imagery derived from the art of so-called primitive peoples (in the first sense mentioned above), especially those who had been colonized by Western countries. For centuries such art was valued mainly for its ethnographic interest or (in the case of articles made from precious materials) for its monetary worth. However, in the 1890s <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin</span></a> had tried to escape ‘the disease of civilization’ among the natives of Tahiti, and in the next generation many avant-garde artists followed his example in cultivating primitive art as a source of inspiration, finding in it a vitality and sincerity that they thought had been polished out of Western art. Usually they followed Gauguin in spirit rather than body, although <a href=""entry://Nolde, Emil""><span class=""links"">Nolde</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Pechstein, Max""><span class=""links"">Pechstein</span></a>, for example, visited Oceania. Many artists collected African works, notably <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso</span></a>, and their influence is clear in his <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i>. Other artists studied primitive art in museums&mdash;Henry <a href=""entry://Moore, Henry""><span class=""links"">Moore </span></a>, for example, was impressed by the powerful block-like forms of Mayan sculpture he saw in the British Museum."
"print","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>print</b>.<div class=""content"">A picture or design made (usually on paper) from an inked impression of an engraved metal plate, wooden block, etc. Prints are made by a great variety of processes, which fall into three main groups.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>(a) Relief Methods</i>. In these, the parts of the wood block or metal plate that are to print black are left in relief and the remainder is cut away. The principal methods are <a href=""entry://woodcut""><span class=""links"">woodcut</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Wood, Christopher""><span class=""links"">wood</span></a> engraving, and <a href=""entry://linocut""><span class=""links"">linocut</span></a>.

In intaglio printing the principle is the reverse of that which operates in the relief methods, for the surface of the plate does not print, the ink being held only in the engraved furrows. The techniques are: <a href=""entry://line engraving""><span class=""links"">line engraving</span></a>, in which the design is engraved on the metal plate with a <a href=""entry://burin""><span class=""links"">burin</span></a>; <a href=""entry://drypoint""><span class=""links"">drypoint</span></a>, where the lines are drawn by scratching the plate with a strong steel needle; <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etching</span></a>, <a href=""entry://soft-ground etching""><span class=""links"">soft-ground etching</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://aquatint""><span class=""links"">aquatint</span></a>, where the designs are bitten into the plate by means of acid.

These are <a href=""entry://lithography""><span class=""links"">lithography</span></a> and its variants. Lithographs are neither incised nor raised in relief, but are printed from a perfectly flat slab of limestone or from prepared metal plates. The process utilizes the antipathy of grease and water to separate those areas which receive and those areas which reject the printing ink.<br class=""nLine"" />The <a href=""entry://stencil""><span class=""links"">stencil</span></a> is related to printmaking, and two other processes which cannot be classified with the rest may be added, namely the <a href=""entry://monotype""><span class=""links"">monotype</span></a>, and the <a href=""entry://glass prints""><span class=""links"">glass print</span></a>.

<b>Prud'hon, Pierre-Paul</b><div class=""content""><i>(1758&ndash;1823).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French portrait and historical painter. He was trained at the Dijon Academy and in 1784 went to Rome, where he was a friend of <a href=""entry://Canova, Antonio""><span class=""links"">Canova</span></a> and formed his style on the example of the <a href=""entry://Sfumato""><i><span class=""links"">sfumato</i></span></a> and sensuous charm of <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Correggio ""><span class=""links"">Correggio </span></a>. In 1787 he returned to Paris and after working in obscurity for some time he became a favourite of both empresses of the French, Josephine and Marie-Louise, designing the decorations for the bridal suite of the latter. His friendship with the statesman Talleyrand enabled him to remain in favour even after the fall of Napoleon in 1815, but he painted little in his final years. He had a neurotic personality and the shock of the suicide of his mistress&mdash;his pupil Constance Mayer&mdash;in 1821 led to his own death. Prud'hon belongs both to the 18th and to the 19th cents. In his elegance, his grace, and his exquisite fancy he is akin to the epoch of Louis XVI&mdash;<a href=""entry://David, Jacques-Louis""><span class=""links"">David</span></a> referred to him slightingly as ‘the <a href=""entry://Boucher, François""><span class=""links"">Boucher</span></a> of his time’.

<b>Puget, Pierre</b><div class=""content""><i>(1620&ndash;94).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The greatest French sculptor of the 17th cent. He worked mainly in his native Marseilles and in Toulon, for although he sought success at court, his work was much too impassioned to fit into the scheme of <a href=""entry://Lebrun, Charles""><span class=""links"">Lebrun's</span></a> artistic dictatorship. Moreover, he was arrogant and headstrong in temperament and he fell victim to the intrigues of fellow artists.

Subsequently he made several journeys to Genoa, where he established a considerable reputation. His first major work was a pair of <a href=""entry://atlas""><span class=""links"">atlas</span></a> figures for the entrance to Toulon Town Hall (1656) and in these he showed the physical vigour and emotional intensity that were the hallmarks of his style. They occur most memorably in his celebrated <i>Milo of Crotona</i> (Louvre, Paris, 1671&ndash;82), which was one of his few works accepted for the palace at Versailles. Puget spent his final years embittered by his failures. He worked as a painter, architect, and decorator of ships as well as a sculptor, and was an outstanding draughtsman. His son <i>François</i> (1651&ndash;1707) was a painter, working mainly in Toulon and Marseilles. He did a few religious works but was mainly a portraitist; a portrait by him of his father is in the Louvre."
"Purism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Purism</b>.<div class=""content"">A movement in French painting linked with the new aesthetic of ‘machine art’ and flourishing <i>c.</i>1918&ndash;25. Its founders and protagonists were Amédée <a href=""entry://Ozenfant, Amédée""><span class=""links"">Ozenfant</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Le Corbusier ""><span class=""links"">Le Corbusier</span></a>, who met in Paris in 1918. Feeling that <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> had missed its path and was degenerating into an art of decoration, they regarded their association as ‘a campaign for the reconstitution of a healthy art’, and held that emotion and expressiveness should be strictly excluded apart from the ‘mathematical lyricism’ which is the proper response to a well-composed picture. Their characteristic paintings are still lifes&mdash;cool, clear, and impersonally finished. Despite the anti-emotionalism of this functionalist outlook, it was advocated by Ozenfant with passionate missionary fervour. The Purist aesthetic was expounded in the books <i>Après le Cubisme</i> (1918) and <i>La Peinture Moderne</i> (1925), joint works of Ozenfant and Le Corbusier, and in the journal <i>L'Esprit Nouveau</i>, which they ran from 1920 to 1925. It won a considerable measure of support from artists and writers of widely different persuasions, but Purism did not establish a continuing school of painting. Both the main protagonists seemed to realize that it represented something of a dead end pictorially and moved in to much looser styles. Its main sequel is to be found in the architectural theories and achievements of Le Corbusier and more generally in the field of design."

<b>Purser, Sarah</b><div class=""content""><i>(1848&ndash;1943).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Irish painter, designer, patron, collector, and administrator. She was a successful society portraitist, who in her own words ‘went through the British aristocracy like the measles’, but she is more important for her other roles in Irish art. She knew everyone who mattered (from 1911 she held regular social gatherings for Dublin's intelligentsia at her home, Mespil House) and in 1924 she founded the Friends of the National Collections of Ireland. One of its aims was to campaign for the return of Sir Hugh <a href=""entry://Lane, Sir Hugh""><span class=""links"">Lane 's</span></a> pictures from London to Dublin and she helped to secure Charlemont House as the home for what became the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art. Perhaps most importantly, she was the founder of the stained-glass workshop An Túr Gloine (The Tower of Glass), which operated in Dublin from 1903 to 1944; the work it produced, which can be seen in so many Irish churches, is her finest memorial.

<b>Quellin </b>
<i>(or Quellinus ), Artus I (Arnoldus)</i><div class=""content""><i>(1609&ndash;68).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The most distinguished member of a family of Flemish sculptors. He was born in Antwerp and was a pupil of François <a href=""entry://Duquesnoy, François""><span class=""links"">Duquesnoy </span></a> in Rome. He was back in Antwerp <i>c.</i>1640, then moved to Amsterdam, where from <i>c.</i>1650 to 1664 he directed the sumptuous sculptural decoration of the Town Hall. His dignified style was singularly appropriate for van <a href=""entry://Campen, Jacob van""><span class=""links"">Campen's </span></a> great building, and the decoration forms the most impressive sculptural ensemble of the time in northern Europe. The high quality of his portrait busts can be seen in the Rijksmuseum. His collaborators at Amsterdam Town Hall included his cousin, <i>Artus II Quellin </i> (1625&ndash;1700), whose independent work was more <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> in style. The commanding figure of <i>God the Father</i> (1682) for the rood screen at Bruges Cathedral is perhaps his finest work. <i>Artus III Quellin </i> (1653&ndash;86), usually called Arnold, son of Artus II, settled in England about 1678. By 1684 he was working with Grinling <a href=""entry://Gibbons, Grinling""><span class=""links"">Gibbons </span></a>, and the drop in quality of Gibbons's large-scale figure work (not his forte) after Quellin's death indicates that the latter was probably the dominant personality in producing such fine statues as the bronze <i>James II</i> (1686) outside the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square. Quellin's outstanding independent work is the tomb of Thomas Thynne (Westminster Abbey, 1682), which features a <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> of Thynne's murder in his coach in Pall Mall. Other artist members of the Quellin family included <i>Erasmus I</i> (<i>c.</i>1584&ndash;1639/40), father of Artus I and likewise a sculptor, and Artus I's two brothers, <i>Erasmus II</i> (1607&ndash;78), a painter who was a pupil and collaborator of <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>, and <i>Hubert</i> (1619?&ndash;87), an engraver."

He was one of the outstanding figures of his generation in Italian sculpture, alongside <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti</span></a>, but his career is difficult to follow, as he worked in numerous places and sometimes left one commission unfinished while he took up another elsewhere. Contrary to <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari's </span></a> assertions that he led a ‘well-ordered life’, he seems to have been inveterately dilatory. He is first firmly documented in 1401, unsuccessfully competing for the commission (won by Ghiberti ) for the Baptistery doors in Florence. His first surviving work is usually considered to be the tomb of Ilaria del Carretto, wife of the ruler of Lucca, Paolo Guinigi (Cathedral, Lucca, <i>c.</i>1406), which was eulogized by <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a>. There are Renaissance <a href=""entry://putto""><span class=""links"">putti</span></a> and swags round the sides of the coffin, but the serene and graceful effigy is in the northern manner and suggests Quercia had knowledge of work done in the circle of Claus <a href=""entry://Sluter, Claus""><span class=""links"">Sluter </span></a> in Burgundy. His major work for his native city was a fountain called the <i>Fonte Gaia</i> (commissioned in 1409, executed in 1414&ndash;19), which is now&mdash;much damaged&mdash;in the loggia of the Palazzo Pubblico. Its <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> carvings include some beautifully draped female figures and a terribly battered but still awesomely powerful panel of <i>The Expulsion from Paradise</i>. Between 1417 and 1431 he worked together with Donatello and Ghiberti on reliefs for the font in the Baptistery at Siena, and in 1425 he received the commission for his last great work (left unfinished at his death), a series of relief panels decorating the main doorway of S. Petronio, Bologna; the subjects are taken from Genesis and the nativity of Christ. The figures&mdash;usually only three to a relief, in contrast to the crowded panels of Ghiberti&mdash;have a directness and strength which won the admiration of <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, who visited Bologna in 1494.

<b>Raeburn, Sir Henry </b><div class=""content""><i>(1756&ndash;1823)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. The leading Scottish portrait painter of his period, active mainly in his native Edinburgh. On leaving school he was apprenticed to a goldsmith, then worked as a <a href=""entry://miniature""><span class=""links"">miniaturist</span></a>, and appears to have been largely self-taught as a painter in oils. Between 1784 and 1787 he had periods in London (where he met <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a>) and Italy, but his distinctive style was by this time already formed&mdash;one of his finest works, the <i>Rev.</i> Robert Walker Skating (NG, Edinburgh), is traditionally said to have been painted in 1784. He painted directly on to the canvas without preliminary drawings, and his vigorous, bold handling&mdash;sometimes called his ‘square touch’&mdash;could be extraordinarily effective in conveying the character of rugged Highland chiefs or bluff legal worthies. He also had a penchant for vivid and original lighting effects (<i>William Glendonwyn</i>, Fitzwilliam Mus., Cambridge, <i>c.</i>1795) and could be remarkably sensitive when painting women (<i>Isabella McLeod, Mrs James Gregory</i>, National Trust for Scotland, Fyvie Castle, Aberdeenshire, <i>c.</i>1798). At times, however, his technical facility can degenerate into empty virtuosity. In 1822, on the occasion of George IV's visit to Edinburgh, he was knighted and in 1823 he was appointed His Majesty's <a href=""entry://limner""><span class=""links"">Limner</span></a> for Scotland.

Ramsay studied in London, in Rome, and in Naples (under <a href=""entry://Solimena, Francesco""><span class=""links"">Solimena</span></a>), and when in 1739 he settled in London he brought a cosmopolitan air to British portrait painting. His portraits of women have a decidedly French grace (<i>The Artist's Wife</i>, NG, Edinburgh, <i>c.</i>1755) and in this field he continued to be a serious rival to Reynolds, who was upset when Ramsay was appointed Painter-in-Ordinary to George III in 1760. Ramsay, however, gradually gave up painting during the 1760s to devote himself to his other interests. He was the son of Allan Ramsay the poet, and inherited his father's literary bent. Political pamphleteering, classical archaeology (he revisited Rome in 1754&ndash;7), and conversation took up much of his later years.

<b>Raphael</b>
<i>(Raffaello Sanzio )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1483&ndash;1520).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, architect, and designer, the artist in whose works the ideals of the High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> find their most complete expression. He was born in Urbino, where in the court of Federico da <a href=""entry://Montefeltro""><span class=""links"">Montefeltro</span></a> Italian culture had one of its most distinguished settings, and his father, Giovanni <a href=""entry://Santi, Giovanni""><span class=""links"">Santi </span></a>, was a writer as well as a painter, who would have introduced his son to humanist ideas. <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> says that ‘Raphael came to be of great help to his father in the numerous works that Giovanni executed in the state of Urbino’, but Santi died in 1494, when Raphael was only 11, and the overwhelming influence on his early work was <a href=""entry://Perugino, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Perugino</span></a>. It is often said that Raphael was Perugino's pupil, but this is probably not strictly true. He was highly precocious and working as an independent artist by 1500; his close contact with Perugino came a little later (<i>c.</i>1502&ndash;3), when he was probably his colleague rather than assistant. That he soon completely outstripped Perugino is best seen by comparing Raphael's <i>Marriage of the Virgin</i> (Brera, Milan 1504) with Perugino's painting of the same subject (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Caen). The two compositions are closely similar in many ways, but Raphael far surpasses Perugino in lucidity and grace.<br class=""nLine"" />In his early career Raphael worked in various places in Tuscany and Umbria. From 1504 to 1508 he worked much in Florence, and this is usually referred to as his Florentine period, although he never took up permanent residence in the city. Under the influence particularly of <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> his work became grander and more sophisticated. To the Florentine period belong many of his most celebrated depictions of the Virgin and Child. In these and his paintings of the Holy Family he showed his developing mastery of composition and expression. He paints the sacred figures as splendid, healthy human beings, but with a serenity, a sense of some deep inner integrity, that removes any doubt as to the holiness of the subject. This sense of well-being distinguishes the art of Raphael from the more disturbingly intellectual work of Leonardo or the overwhelmingly powerful creations of Michelangelo, and evidently reflects his own balanced nature. Unlike his two great contemporaries, he was not a solitary genius but a sociable and approachable figure, whom Vasari describes as ‘so gentle and so charitable that even animals loved him’. In 1508, though he was only 25 years old, his reputation was sufficiently established for him to be summoned to Rome by Pope Julius II and entrusted with the frescos for one of the papal rooms in the Vatican, the Stanza della Segnatura. He continued to work in Rome till his death in 1520 although he is known to have returned briefly to Florence in 1515.<br class=""nLine"" />The Stanza della Segnatura is based on a complex theological programme of the relationship between classical learning and the Christian revelation. On one main wall, in the celebrated painting known as <i>The School of Athens</i>, are shown the ancient philosophers, led by Plato and Aristotle, enclosed in a majestic architectural setting, a masterpiece of <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a> drawing. Opposite, is the painting called the <i>Disputà</i> (the Disputation over the Sacrament); the doctors of the church adore the Sacrament, while above the Trinity is surrounded by the saints and martyrs. Here the setting is a wide open space. They are works in which grandeur and gracefulness seem effortlessly combined and they have had a profound and continuing influence on European art. After the completion of the Stanza della Segnatura in 1511 Raphael was entrusted with three other apartments in the Vatican, but by the time he had completed the first of these&mdash;the Stanza d'Eliodoro&mdash;in 1514, his services were so much in demand that he had to rely increasingly on assistants (of whom <a href=""entry://Giulio Romano ""><span class=""links"">Giulio</span></a> Romano was the most distinguished) for the execution of his work. The <a href=""entry://cartoon""><span class=""links"">cartoons</span></a> for tapestries in the Sistine Chapel (Royal Coll., on loan to V&amp;A, London, 1515&ndash;16), for example, rank among his noblest designs, but probably comparatively little of the execution is from his own hand. In addition to the tapestries Raphael supervised various other great decorative schemes in Rome: the Villa Farnesina with its ceiling showing the story of Psyche, and a wall fresco, <i>Galatea</i> (1511&ndash;12), which is from Raphael's own hand at its most expert; the Chigi Chapel in Sta Maria del Popolo (begun <i>c.</i>1512), where he designed the entire scheme, comprising architecture, sculpture, painting, mosaic, stuccowork, and marble inlay; and the ceiling and wall arabesques of the Vatican Loggie (<i>c.</i>1515 onwards), which left a permanent imprint on European interior decoration. The richness of effect in the Chigi Chapel was an important source for similar works in the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> era, and it is fitting that the chapel was in fact completed by <a href=""entry://Bernini, Gianlorenzo""><span class=""links"">Bernini </span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />Raphael also painted many portraits and it is in these that the quality of his own workmanship in his later years is best seen. They rival Leonardo in subtlety of characterization and <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a> in richness of colouring, show great inventiveness in creating psychological situations, and provide a remarkable record of the intellectual circles in which he moved (<i>Baldassare Castiglione</i>, Louvre, Paris, <i>c.</i>1515). Other important commissions from his Roman period that are largely from his own hand are the <i>Sistine Madonna</i> (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, <i>c.</i>1512&ndash;14), his most famous painting of the Virgin and Child, and the great altarpiece of the <i>Transfiguration</i> (Vatican Gal.), on which he was working at his death, and which presages the <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> style. From about 1512 he began to work as an architect, and he also embarked on an archaeological survey of ancient Rome, although little evidence of his scheme survives. After the death of <a href=""entry://Bramante, Donato""><span class=""links"">Bramante</span></a> in 1514 he became architect to St Peter's, and Raphael ranks second only to him among High Renaissance architects.

Many Rayonist paintings are very similar in style to those of the Futurists, with particular emphasis on breaking up the subject into bundles of slanting lines. In other works the subject virtually or completely disappears. The movement was short-lived, as both Goncharova and Larionov virtually abandoned easel painting after 1914 and they founded no school."

After serving with distinction in the army in the First World War he worked at the Treasury, then in the ceramics department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1922&ndash;31, before becoming Watson Gordon Professor of Fine Arts at Edinburgh University, 1931&ndash;3. By this time he had published several collections of his verse as well as various art-historical studies (including <i>English Stained Glass</i>, 1926, still a standard work), critical works on English literature, and the first of his philosophical works on art, <i>The Meaning of Art</i> (1931). In 1933 he returned to London as editor (1933&ndash;9) of <i>The Burlington Magazine</i>, Britain's foremost scholarly art journal, and his attention turned increasingly to contemporary art; in 1933 he published <i>Art Now</i>, the first comprehensive defence in English of modern European art, and in 1934 he edited the modernist manifesto <a href=""entry://Unit One""><span class=""links"">Unit One</span></a>.

His other books include <i>A Concise History of Modern Painting</i> (1959) and <i>A Concise History of Modern Sculpture</i> (1964), much used as introductory surveys by students. By the time he wrote them he was becoming disenchanted with contemporary artistic developments, but he was known as ‘The Pope of Modern Art’ and was regarded as ‘an international authority and indeed something of a sage.

<b>ready-made</b>.<div class=""content"">A name given by Marcel <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a> to a type of work he invented consisting of a mass-produced article selected at random and displayed as a work of art. His first ready-made (1913) was a bicycle wheel, which he mounted on a kitchen stool, and this was soon followed by others, notably <i>Bottle Rack</i> (1914), <i>In Advance of the Broken Arm</i> (a snow shovel, 1915), and the celebrated <i>Fountain</i> (a urinal signed R. Mutt, 1917); most of the originals have disappeared, but several replicas exist. Duchamp himself distinguished the ready-made from the <a href=""entry://objet trouvé""><i><span class=""links"">object trouvé</i></span></a> (found object), pointing out that whereas the <i>objet trouvé</i> is discovered and chosen because of its interesting aesthetic qualities, its beauty and uniqueness, the ready-made is one&mdash;any one&mdash;of a large number of indistinguishable massproduced objects. Therefore the <i>objet trouvé</i> implies the exercise of taste in its selection, but the ready-made does not. When <i>Fountain</i> was rejected by the hanging committee of the <a href=""entry://Society of Independent Artists""><span class=""links"">Society of Independent Artists</span></a>, Duchamp defended his creation by writing: ‘Whether Mr Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance.

[he] created a new thought for that object.’ The ready-made was one of <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada's</span></a> most enduring legacies to modern art.

"realism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>realism</b>.<div class=""content"">Term used with various meanings in the history and criticism of the arts. In its broadest sense the word is used as vaguely as <a href=""entry://naturalism""><span class=""links"">naturalism</span></a>, implying a desire to depict things accurately and objectively. Often, however, the term carries with it the suggestion of the rejection of conventionally beautiful subjects, or of idealization, in favour of a more down-to-earth approach, often with a stress on low life or the activities of the common man. In a more specific sense the term (usually spelled with a capital R) is applied to a movement in 19th-cent. (particularly French) art characterized by a rebellion against the traditional historical, mythological, and religious subjects in favour of unidealized scenes of modern life. The leader of the Realist movement was <a href=""entry://Courbet, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Courbet </span></a>, who said ‘painting is essentially a concrete art and must be applied to real and existing things’. Since the 1950s the term has also been used in a contrasting sense, of art which eschews representation and depiction altogether and avoids all forms of illusionism. In this sense art is called ‘Realist’ when the materials or objects from which the work is constructed are presented for exactly what they are and are known to be. This usage is found particularly in the terms <a href=""entry://New Realism""><span class=""links"">New Realism</span></a> and Nouveau Réalisme. The term <a href=""entry://Social Realism""><span class=""links"">Social Realism</span></a> has been applied to 19th- and 20th-cent. works that are realistic in the second sense described above and make overt social or political comment. It is to be distinguished from <a href=""entry://Socialist Realism""><span class=""links"">Socialist Realism</span></a>, the name given to the officially approved style in the USSR and some other Communist countries; far from implying a critical approach to social questions, it involves toeing the Party line in an academic style. <a href=""entry://Magic(al) Realism""><span class=""links"">Magic Realism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Superrealism""><span class=""links"">Superrealism</span></a> are names given to two 20th-cent. styles in which extreme realism&mdash;in the sense of acute attention to detail&mdash;produces a markedly unrealistic overall effect.

He led a retiring life, first in his native Bordeaux, then from 1870 in Paris, and until he was in his fifties he worked almost exclusively in black and white&mdash;in charcoal drawings and lithographs. In these he developed a highly distinctive repertoire of weird subjects&mdash;strange amoeboid creatures, insects, and plants with human heads and so on, influenced by the writings of Edgar Allen Poe. He remained virtually unknown to the public until the publication of J. K. Huysmans's celebrated novel <i>A Rebours</i> in 1884; the book's hero, a disenchanted aristocrat who lives in a private world of perverse delights, collects Redon's drawings, and with his mention in this classic expression of decadence, Redon too became associated with the movement. During the 1890s Redon turned to painting and revealed remarkable powers as a colourist that had previously lain dormant. Much of his early life had been unhappy, but after undergoing a religious crisis in the early 1890s and a serious illness in 1894&ndash;5, he was transformed into a much more buoyant and cheerful personality, expressing himself in radiant colours in visionary subjects, flower paintings, and mythological scenes (<i>The Chariot of Apollo</i> was one of his favourite themes). He showed equal facility in oils and pastel. His flower pieces, in particular, were much admired by <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a>, and the <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealists</span></a> regarded Redon as one of their precursors.

<b>Regionalism</b>.<div class=""content"">A movement in American painting, flourishing chiefly in the 1930s, concerned with the depiction of scenes and types from the American Midwest. The term is often used more or less interchangeably with <a href=""entry://American Scene painting""><span class=""links"">American Scene painting</span></a>, but Regionalism can be more precisely thought of as the Midwestern branch of this broader category. Like all American Scene painters, the Regionalists were motivated by a patriotic desire to establish a genuinely American art by using local themes and repudiating avant-garde styles from Europe. Specifically they were moved by a nostalgic desire to glorify, or at least to record, rural and small-town America, and it was on this that their widespread popularity depended. The period when they flourished coincided with the Great Depression, and at this time of profound national doubt, they reasserted America's faith in itself, giving the public pictures with which they could readily identify. Their work was often produced under the auspices of the <a href=""entry://Federal Art Project""><span class=""links"">Federal Art Project</span></a> and it was supported by the fanatically patriotic critic Thomas Craven. The three major Regionalists were Thomas Hart <a href=""entry://Benton, Thomas Hart""><span class=""links"">Benton </span></a>, John Steuart <a href=""entry://Curry, John Steuart""><span class=""links"">Curry </span></a>, and Grant <a href=""entry://Wood, Grant""><span class=""links"">Wood </span></a>, who were all Midwesterners but differed greatly in temperament and style. They scarcely knew one another personally, but the idea of a group identity was skilfully promoted by Maynard Walker, a Kansas art dealer. Walker got a Benton self-portrait on to the cover of the Christmas 1934 issue of <i>Time</i> magazine and this largely created the image of Regionalism in the public eye; as Benton put it, ‘A play was written and a stage erected for us. Grant Wood became the typical Iowa small towner, John Curry the typical Kansas farmer, and I just an Ozark hillbilly. We accepted our roles.’ On the fringes of the Regionalist movement were Charles <a href=""entry://Burchfield, Charles""><span class=""links"">Burchfield </span></a> and Ben <a href=""entry://Shahn, Ben""><span class=""links"">Shahn </span></a>. Burchfield's work has a streak of fantasy absent from that of the others, and Shahn was driven by a spirit of social protest.

<b>Rembrandt </b>
<i>(Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1606&ndash;69).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter, etcher, and draughtsman, his country's greatest artist. He was born in Leiden, the son of a prosperous miller. After attending a Latin school he registered at the city's university in 1620, but probably never actually studied there. At about this time he was apprenticed to the mediocre local painter Jacob van Swanenburgh (<i>c.</i>1571&ndash;1638), with whom he is said to have studied for about three years. However, much more important for Rembrandt's development were six months spent in Amsterdam with Pieter <a href=""entry://Lastman, Pieter""><span class=""links"">Lastman </span></a>, <i>c.</i>1624. From Lastman he took not only his predilection for mythological and religious subject, but also his manner of treating them, with dramatic gestures and expressions, vivid lighting effects, and a meticulous, glossy finish, as in his earliest dated work&mdash;<i>The Stoning of St Stephen</i> (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyons, 1625). <a href=""entry://Houbraken, Arnold""><span class=""links"">Houbraken</span></a> says that Rembrandt also studied with Jacob <a href=""entry://Pynas, Jan""><span class=""links"">Pynas </span></a> and Joris van Schooten (1587&ndash;1651), but this can have been only briefly, for by 1625 he was working as an independent master in Leiden. There he had a close association with Jan <a href=""entry://Lievens, Jan""><span class=""links"">Lievens </span></a>, and both artists were highly praised by the scholar and diplomat Constantin Huygens, who visited them in 1629. Rembrandt's paintings of his Leiden period (which lasted until he settled permanently in Amsterdam in 1631/2) are mainly figure subjects, often involving old men depicted as philosophers or biblical characters. He also did portraits of himself and of members of his family, but it is not until 1631 that he painted his earliest known formal commissioned portrait. The sitter was Nicolaes Ruts, a prosperous Amsterdam merchant (Frick Coll., New York), and Rembrandt no doubt realized that here he had a recipe for success, as this type of work dominated his output in his early years in Amsterdam. It was the busiest period of his life, as he quickly established himself as the leading portraitist in the city&mdash;about fifty of his paintings are dated 1632 or 1633 and all but a handful are portraits. The most important&mdash;the work that most clearly demonstrated his superiority to rivals such as Thomas de <a href=""entry://Keyser, Hendrick de""><span class=""links"">Keyser</span></a>&mdash;is the <i>Anatomy Lesson of Dr Tulp</i> (Mauritshuis, The Hague, 1632), which brought a wholly new vitality to the group portrait. Rembrandt's great energy in his early years in Amsterdam comes out also in his religious works. The most important commission he received during the 1630s was from the Stadholder Prince Frederick Henry of Orange for five pictures depicting scenes of the Passion (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), and the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> tendencies of his work at this time are even more emphatically expressed in his sensational, life-size <i>Blinding of Samson</i> (Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt, 1636). Rembrandt presented this painting to Huygens, who probably had secured the commission from the Stadholder. Rembrandt's success in the 1630s was personal as well as professional. In 1634 he married Saskia van Uylenburgh, cousin of a picture-dealer associate, and from the evidence of his marvellously tender portraits of her it must have been a blissful union. In 1639 he bought an imposing house (now a Rembrandt museum), and he spent lavishly on works of art and anything else that took his fancy or looked as if it might be useful as a prop&mdash;armour, old costumes, etc. His domestic happiness was, however, marred by a succession of infant deaths; of the four children Saskia bore him, only his son Titus (1641&ndash;68), who became one of his favourite models, lived longer than two months.<br class=""nLine"" />Saskia died in 1642, and in this year Rembrandt painted his most famous picture, <i>The Night Watch</i> (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), which Jacob Rosenberg, in his standard monograph on the artist, calls ‘a thunderbolt of genius’. The erroneous title dates from the late 18th cent. when the painting was so discoloured with dirty varnish that it looked like a night scene. Its correct title is <i>The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch</i>, and it is the culminating work of the Dutch tradition of civic guard portraits (a genre particularly associated with Frans <a href=""entry://Hals, Frans""><span class=""links"">Hals </span></a>). Rembrandt showed remarkable originality in making a pictorial drama out of an insignificant event. To do this he subordinated the individual portraits to the demands of the composition, and according to popular legend the sitters who had paid for the picture were appalled at this and demanded that Rembrandt make radical changes, paint a new picture, or refund their money. Rembrandt's refusal is supposed to have been his downfall and to have led him into penniless obscurity. There is, however, no basis in fact for the story, which is a 19th-cent. invention; indeed all the available evidence suggests that the picture was well received by contemporaries. Samuel van <a href=""entry://Hoogstraten, Samuel van""><span class=""links"">Hoogstraten </span></a>, for example, wrote ‘It is so painter-like in thought, so dashing in movement, and so powerful’ that the pictures beside which it hung were made to seem ‘like playing cards’.<br class=""nLine"" />Nevertheless, in the 1640s Rembrandt's worldly success did decline as the direction of his art changed. Formal portraiture took up much less of his time and he concentrated more on religious painting, while his style grew less flamboyant and more introspective. The change has been explained as a response to the death of Saskia (and of his mother in 1640), and religion may well have been a solace to him in this difficult period. At the same time, some of his market in portraiture must have gone to pupils such as <a href=""entry://Bol, Ferdinand""><span class=""links"">Bol</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Flinck, Govert""><span class=""links"">Flinck</span></a>, who imitated his style so well. It seems just as likely, however, that Rembrandt was tired of routine portraiture and wanted to return to his first love&mdash;painting subjects from the Bible. In the 1640s Rembrandt also developed an interest in landscape and it has been suggested that he spent more time in the countryside during this period to escape from the domestic problems he encountered after Saskia's death. A widow called Geertge Dircx was employed as Titus's nurse, and she sued Rembrandt for breach of promise after his affections turned to Hendrickje Stoffels, a servant some 20 years his junior who entered the household in about 1645. After some unpleasant legal action Rembrandt succeeded in having Geertge shut up in a reformatory and the litigation did not end until her death in 1656. Hendrickje remained with Rembrandt for the rest of her life and bore him two children, including a daughter, Cornelia, born in 1654, who was the only one of his children to outlive him. Rembrandt's portrayals of Hendrickje are just as loving as those of Saskia, but he was unable to marry her because of a clause in Saskia's will.<br class=""nLine"" />After he turned his back on fashionable portraiture, Rembrandt's extravagance led him into financial difficulties, which became acute by the early 1650s. In 1656 he was declared insolvent; his collections were sold and by 1660 he had to leave his house and move to lodgings in a poorer district of the city. Houbraken says that ‘in the autumn of his life he kept company mainly with common people and such as practised art’, but the romantic image of him as a pauper and a recluse is grossly exaggerated. He continued to be a respected figure who received important commissions (his patrons included the Sicilian nobleman Don Antonio Ruffo), and Hendrickje and Titus established an art firm with Rembrandt technically their employee, a device that protected him from his creditors. Indeed, with some weight thus lifted from his shoulders, Rembrandt may well have felt renewed energy, and there are more dated paintings from 1661 than from any year since the early 1630s. In 1661&ndash;2 he painted two of his greatest works&mdash;<i>The Sampling Officers of the Cloth-Makers' Guild</i> (sometimes called <i>The Syndics</i>, Rijksmuseum) and <i>The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis</i>, painted for Amsterdam Town Hall, but for unknown reasons removed in 1663 and cut down (apparently by Rembrandt himself)&mdash;the magnificent fragment is now in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. Rembrandt's final years were clouded by the deaths of Hendrickje in 1663 and Titus in 1668, but his art was in no way impaired. On the contrary, his work seemed to grow in human understanding and compassion to the very end, and his last self-portraits, the culmination of an incomparable series that began 40 years earlier, show him facing his hardships with the utmost dignity&mdash;someone who has no illusions about life, but equally no bitterness. Two self-portraits date from the last year of his life (NG, London, and Mauritshuis), but the painting that best stands as his spiritual testimony is perhaps <i>The Return of the Prodigal Son</i> (Hermitage, St Petersburg, <i>c.</i>1669), a work of the utmost tenderness and poignancy, which Kenneth <a href=""entry://Clark, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Clark </span></a> described as ‘a picture which those who have seen the original in Leningrad may be forgiven for claiming as the greatest picture ever painted’. The emotional depth and range of Rembrandt's work was matched by the total expressive mastery of his technique. Even as a young man, when surface polish and attention to detail were a necessary part of his skill as a fashionable portraitist, he had experimented boldly in his more private works, sometimes, for example, using the butt end of the brush to scrape through the paint. When he began to paint much more to please himself in the 1640s, his handling grew much broader, and Houbraken wrote that ‘in the last years of his life, he worked so fast that his pictures, when examined from close by, looked as if they had been daubed with a bricklayer's trowel.’<br class=""nLine"" />It is not only the quality of Rembrandt's work that sets him apart from all his Dutch contemporaries, but also its range. Although portraits and religious works bulk largest in his output, he made highly original contributions to other genres, including still life (<i>The Slaughtered Ox</i>, Louvre, Paris, 1655), and he painted some pictures, such as <i>The Polish Rider</i> (Frick Coll., New York, <i>c.</i>1655), that virtually defy classification. Rembrandt was prodigious, too, as an etcher and draughtsman. He is universally regarded as the greatest of all exponents of etching (and <a href=""entry://drypoint""><span class=""links"">drypoint</span></a>), capable of expressing the airy breadth of the Dutch countryside with a few quick strokes, but also prepared to radically rework a complex religious scene such as <i>The Three Crosses</i> perhaps a decade after he had begun it in 1653 to create one of the most awesome of all images of Christ's Passion. His drawings were done mainly as independent works rather than as studies for paintings and often with the thick bold strokes of the reed pen, of which he was an unsurpassed master.<br class=""nLine"" />Rembrandt was a great teacher; Gerard <a href=""entry://Dou, Gerrit""><span class=""links"">Dou </span></a> became his first pupil in 1628 and Aert de <a href=""entry://Gelder, Aert de""><span class=""links"">Gelder</span></a>, who was with him in the 1660s, continued his master's style into the 18th cent. Between these two, Rembrandt taught such illustrious names as Carel <a href=""entry://Fabritius, Carel""><span class=""links"">Fabritius </span></a> (his greatest pupil), Phillips de <a href=""entry://Koninck ""><span class=""links"">Koninck</span></a> and Nicolaes <a href=""entry://Maes, Nicolaes""><span class=""links"">Maes </span></a>, but often his pupils later abandoned his exacting standards for a more facile popularity. Rembrandt continued to have many admirers after his death, and his work often fetched high prices in the 18th cent. He was generally regarded as incomparable in his mastery of light and shade, but most critics considered him a flawed genius, whose failing was his ‘vulgarity’ and lack of decorum. It was during the age of <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a>, when it was felt that artists should give expression to their innermost feelings and flout conventions, that his reputation began to rise towards its present supremely exalted heights. In 1851 <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix</span></a> suggested that one day Rembrandt would be rated higher than <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span
class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>&mdash;‘a piece of blasphemy that will make every good academician's hair stand on end’; his prophecy came true within 50 years."

"Renaissance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Renaissance</b>.<div class=""content"">Term meaning ‘rebirth’ applied to an intellectual and artistic movement that began in Italy in the 14th cent., culminated there in the 16th cent., and influenced other parts of Europe in a great variety of ways. The notion of a rebirth refers to a revival of the values of the classical world, and the concept was used as early as the 15th cent., by Italians who thought they were living at a time when the qualities of ancient art and literature were blossoming anew after centuries of barbarism. In the following century <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> gave the idea of such a revival a systematically developed form; he thought that art had declined in the Middle Ages, had been set once again on its true path by <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto </span></a>, and had risen to its greatest heights in the work of his friend and hero <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>. To modern historians this picture seems much too simplistic, and the Renaissance is seen more as a period of gradual change than as a sudden break with the past. Nevertheless, the intellectuals of the Renaissance were the first people to coin a period identity for themselves, and this in itself gives the label a certain coherence. Scholars may debate endlessly over the exact interpretation of many aspects of the period, but in the general historical scheme of things, the Renaissance has come to represent the time when ‘Medieval’ turns into ‘Modern’ and the religion-dominated world of the Middle Ages gives way to a culture more responsive to the individual.<br class=""nLine"" />In the visual arts, the revival of the antique can be seen most clearly in architecture, for classical architecture uses a ‘vocabulary’ of forms that distinguishes it unambiguously from the Gothic style, and there can be no doubt that <a href=""entry://Brunelleschi, Filippo""><span class=""links"">Brunelleschi</span></a> is entitled to rank as the first Renaissance architect. He was interested in Roman buildings probably more for what he could learn about engineering problems than for stylistic reasons, and he was undogmatic and unarchaeological in his use of antique detail, but he had an instinctual understanding of classical design, and his buildings&mdash;based on simple mathematical ratios&mdash;have a lucidity and harmony worthy of comparison with the finest ancient models. In sculpture, the beginnings of the Renaissance are sometimes traced as far back as Nicola <a href=""entry://Pisano, Nicola""><span class=""links"">Pisano </span></a> in the late 14th cent. because he is known to have been directly influenced by Roman sarcophagi. However, it is not until <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello</span></a>, in the early 15th cent., that we find a sculptor who had thoroughly assimilated the spirit of ancient sculpture, rather than simply borrowing motifs from it. In painting, it is harder to define the Renaissance in terms of antique influence, as very little ancient painting survived compared with the fairly abundant remains of Roman architecture and sculpture to be found in Italy. From the writings of ancient authors, however, classical painters were known to have excelled in fidelity to nature, so this quality was seen as a keynote of Renaissance painting. Because Giotto made such great advances in naturalism he is sometimes put at the head of the Renaissance tradition in painting, but it is more consistent to give this position to <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a>, who brought a new scientific rigour to the problems of representation.<br class=""nLine"" />Masaccio, like his friends Brunelleschi and Donatello, was a Florentine, and it is thus reasonable to see Florence as the cradle of the Renaissance, and the period around 1425, when they were producing some of their most innovative works, as a major turning point in European art. Florence continued to be of pre-eminent importance throughout the 15th cent., but in the 16th cent. Rome and Venice were equally significant centres for the arts. The culmination of the Renaissance came in the period from about 1500 to 1520&ndash;a time which is now known as the High Renaissance. During this time the three most famous artists of the age&mdash;<a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, Michelangelo, and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>&mdash;produced works that have for centuries been regarded as touchstones of perfection and the fulfilment of all the ideals that artists had pursued since Giotto. In architecture, <a href=""entry://Bramante, Donato""><span class=""links"">Bramante</span></a> represents a similar peak, and his noble and grave designs were regarded in his own time as having truly recaptured the majesty of Roman buildings.<br class=""nLine"" />The ideals and imagery of the Italian Renaissance did not generally begin to spread to the rest of Europe until about 1500. Albrecht <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a> was the outstanding artist of the ‘Northern Renaissance’, making it his mission to transplant the new Italian ideas onto German soil. His work was of enormous importance in spreading Italian ideas, and during the 16th cent. it became a normal part of the career of ambitious young artists from northern Europe to follow in his footsteps across the Alps. By this time, however, Italian art had entered the phase called <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerism</span></a>, and much Italian-inspired art of this period in Germany, France, and the Netherlands can be classified as Mannerist rather than Renaissance. Most northern artists imitated only the superficial characteristics of Italian art, and only a few&mdash;such as Jan van <a href=""entry://Scorel, Jan van""><span class=""links"">Scorel </span></a>&mdash;absorbed something of the order, poise, and dignity associated with the High Renaissance. In England, Renaissance ideas made only superficial impact during the 16th century, Italian influence being mainly confined to decorative motifs (and many of these were used in debased or misunderstood forms). It was not until the 17th century that there emerged an English artist&mdash;Inigo <a href=""entry://Jones, Inigo""><span class=""links"">Jones </span></a>&mdash;who thoroughly understood Renaissance ideals, and by this time Italian art had progressed through Mannerism to the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a>."
"Reni, Guido","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Reni, Guido</b><div class=""content""><i>(1575&ndash;1642).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Bolognese painter. From about 1584 to 1593 he was a pupil of <a href=""entry://Calvaert, Denys""><span class=""links"">Calvaert</span></a>, then he entered the <a href=""entry://Carracci""><span class=""links"">Carracci</span></a> academy, where he inherited their tradition of clear, firm draughtsmanship. Reni's style was also strongly influenced by the several visits he made to Rome, the first of them soon after 1600. He flirted briefly with the <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggesque</span></a> manner (<i>Crucifixion of St Peter</i>, Vatican, 1603), but <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> and the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> were the main inspiration for his graceful classical style, as is seen in his most celebrated work, <i>Aurora</i> (1613&ndash;14), a captivatingly beautiful ceiling fresco in the Casino Rospiglioso in Rome. After Ludovico Carracci's death in 1619, Reni became the most important painter in Bologna, running a large and prosperous studio, whose products (mainly religious works) were sent all over Europe. He cut an impressive, aristocratic figure, always fashionably and expensively dressed and usually attended by servants, but he was noted for his modesty and hated profanities and obscenities. According to his biographer <a href=""entry://Malvasia, Count Carlo""><span class=""links"">Malvasia</span></a> ‘It was generally thought that he was a virgin
When observing the many lovely young girls who served as his models, he was like marble.’ (He was, however, addicted to gambling.) His fame in his lifetime was great and in the 18th and early 19th cents. many critics went into raptures, ranking him second only to Raphael. <a href=""entry://Winckelmann, Johann Joachim""><span class=""links"">Winckelmann </span></a>, for example, compared him to <a href=""entry://Praxiteles ""><span class=""links"">Praxiteles</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a> wrote that ‘his idea of beauty
is acknowledged superior to that of any other painter.’ He fell from favour under the scornful attacks of <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin</span></a> (who detested the Bolognese painters in general), and until well into the 20th cent. a just appreciation of his stature was prevented by the failure to distinguish between his own works and those by his countless (often extremely insipid) imitators. The great exhibition devoted to him in Bologna in 1954 was a turning point in his critical fortunes, and his status as one of the greatest Italian painters of the 17th cent. is now firmly re-established. His late works in particular show an ethereal beauty of colouring that sets him apart from any of his contemporaries. The best collection of his work is in the Pinacoteca in Bologna."

It is a large bowl supported on ten (originally twelve) oxen (a reference to the ‘sea of cast metal

"Renoir, Pierre-Auguste","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Renoir, Pierre-Auguste</b><div class=""content""><i>(1841&ndash;1919)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. French <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> painter, born at Limoges. In 1854 he began work as a painter in a porcelain factory in Paris, gaining experience with the light, fresh colours that were to distinguish his Impressionist work and also learning the importance of good craftsmanship. His predilection towards light-hearted themes was also influenced by the great <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> masters, whose work he studied in the Louvre. In 1862 he entered the studio of <a href=""entry://Gleyre, Charles""><span class=""links"">Gleyre</span></a> and there formed a lasting friendship with <a href=""entry://Monet, Claude""><span class=""links"">Monet</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Sisley, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Sisley</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Bazille, Frédéric""><span class=""links"">Bazille</span></a>. He painted with them in the <a href=""entry://Barbizon School""><span class=""links"">Barbizon</span></a> district and became a leading member of the group of Impressionists who met at the Café Guerbois. His relationship with Monet was particularly close at this time, and their paintings of the beauty spot called La Grenouillère done in 1869 (an example by Renoir is in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm) are regarded as the classic early statements of the Impressionist style. Like Monet, Renoir endured much hardship early in his career, but he began to achieve success as a portraitist in the late 1870s and was freed from financial worries after the dealer Paul <a href=""entry://Durand-Ruel, Paul""><span class=""links"">Durand-Ruel </span></a> began buying his work regularly in 1881. By this time Renoir had ‘travelled as far as Impressionism could take me’, and a visit to Italy in 1881&ndash;2 inspired him to seek a greater sense of solidity in his work. The change in attitude is seen in <i>The Umbrellas</i> (NG, London), which was evidently begun before the visit to Italy and finished afterwards; the two little girls on the right are painted with the feathery brush-strokes characteristic of his Impressionist manner, but the figures on the left are done in a crisper and drier style, with duller colouring. After a period of experimentation with what he called his ‘manière aigre’ (harsh or sour manner) in the mid 1880s, he developed a softer and more supple kind of handling. At the same time he turned from contemporary themes to more timeless subjects, particularly nudes, but also pictures of young girls in unspecific settings. As his style became grander and simpler he also took up mythological subjects (<i>The Judgement of Paris</i>, Hiroshima Museum of Art, <i>c.</i>1913&ndash;14), and the female type he preferred became more mature and ample. In the 1890s Renoir began to suffer from rheumatism, and from 1903 (by which time he was world-famous) he lived in the warmth of the south of France. The rheumatism eventually crippled him (by 1912 he was confined to a wheelchair), but he continued to paint until the end of his life, and in his last years he also took up sculpture, directing assistants (usually Richard Guino, a pupil of <a href=""entry://Maillol, Aristide""><span class=""links"">Maillol </span></a>) to act as his hands (<i>Venus Victorious</i>, Tate, London, 1914).<br class=""nLine"" />Renoir is perhaps the best-loved of all the Impressionists, for his subjects&mdash;pretty children, flowers, beautiful scenes, above all lovely women&mdash;have instant appeal, and he communicated the joy he took in them with great directness. ‘Why shouldn't art be pretty?’, he said, ‘There are enough unpleasant things in the world.’ He was one of the great worshippers of the female form, and he said ‘I never think I have finished a nude until I think I could pinch it.’ One of his sons was the celebrated film director <i>Jean Renoir </i> (1894&ndash;1979), who wrote a lively and touching biography published in both French and English (<i>Renoir, My Father</i>) in 1962."

His <i>Volga Boatmen</i> (Russian Mus., St Petersburg), exhibited in Vienna in 1873, made him internationally famous. Repin excelled at scenes from Russian history, such as <i>Ivan the Terrible with the Body of his Son</i> (Tretyakov Gal., Moscow, 1885), painted in a colourful, full-blooded (sometimes melodramatic) style. He could also handle modern social themes, however, as in <i>They Did Not Expect Him</i> (Tretyakov Gal., 1884), showing the unexpected return of a political exile from Siberia. But it is as a portraitist that he is now most highly regarded. He painted Tolstoy several times and numerous other distinguished contemporaries. Repin became professor of history painting at the St Petersburg Academy in 1894 and was an influential teacher. After the 1917 Revolution he retired to his country home at Kuokkala (now in Finland), but he continued to be regarded as a figure of massive authority.

"Reynolds, Sir Joshua","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Reynolds, Sir Joshua</b><div class=""content""><i>(1723&ndash;92).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter and writer on art, the first President of the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a>, the leading portraitist of his day, and perhaps the most important figure in the history of British painting. Reynolds was born at Plympton in Devonshire, the son of a scholarly clergyman, and he was brought up in an atmosphere of learning. He studied painting in London under <a href=""entry://Hudson, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Hudson</span></a> (another Devonshire man) 1740&ndash;3, but set up independently in Devon as a portraitist before his apprenticeship was officially ended. In 1750&ndash;2 he was in Italy, where he made an intensive study of the great masters of the 16th and 17th cents. and also of the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> (it was while copying <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> in the cold of the Vatican that he contracted his deafness). He not only absorbed the formal language of his models, but also developed a deliberate cult of learning and classical allusion that coloured his whole approach to art. In tune with established art theory, he thought that <a href=""entry://history painting""><span class=""links"">history painting</span></a> was the highest branch of art, but he believed that portraiture could rise above its traditional status as mere ‘face-painting’ by improving on the deficiencies of nature and using poses and gestures that allude to the great art of the past. Thus, in the work that established his reputation after he settled in London in 1753&ndash;<i>Commodore Keppel</i> (National Maritime Mus., London, 1753&ndash;4)&mdash;the sitter's heroic pose is based directly (albeit in reverse) on that of the <i><a href=""entry://Apollo Belvedere""><span class=""links"">Apollo Belvedere</i></a></span>, then regarded as the matchless ideal of male beauty.<br class=""nLine"" />Reynolds quickly achieved a leading position in his profession. He had 150 sitters a year by 1758, and by 1764 was earning the enormous sum of £6,000 a year. His success was achieved through hard work and careful business management as well as talent; on the day he was knighted (21 April 1769) his visit to St James's Palace was fitted in between two sittings with clients. Moreover, although he always retained traces of his provincial origins (notably his Devonshire accent), he was completely at home with his eminent sitters. His pupil James <a href=""entry://Northcote, James""><span class=""links"">Northcote </span></a> said that ‘His general manner, deportment and behaviour were amiable and prepossessing; his disposition was naturally courtly. He
contrived to move in a higher sphere of society than any other English artist had done before. Thus he procured for the Professors of the Arts a consequence, dignity and reception which they never possessed in this country.’ Reynolds's elevation of the status of the artist depended, then, not only on the intellectual quality of his work, but also on his social acceptability, and it is significant that his friends were mainly men of letters&mdash;notably Dr Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith&mdash;rather than other painters (James Boswell dedicated his celebrated <i>Life of Johnson</i> to Reynolds). On the foundation of the Royal Academy in 1768, he was the obvious choice for President, and he arranged for Johnson and Goldsmith to be appointed to the honorary positions of Professors of Ancient History and Literature. For the next twenty years, until his blindness stopped him painting in 1790, his authority in the Academy was paramount and his fifteen <i>Discourses</i> delivered over that period have become the classic expression of the academic doctrine of the <a href=""entry://Grand Manner""><span class=""links"">Grand Manner</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />As a portraitist Reynolds is remarkable above all for his versatility&mdash;his inexhaustible range of response to the individuality of each sitter, man, woman, or child. The celebrated remark of his rival <a href=""entry://Gainsborough, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Gainsborough</span></a>, ‘Damn him! How various he is!’, is echoed in the praise of <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin</span></a>: ‘Considered as a painter of individuality in the human form and mind, I think him the prince of portrait painters. <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a> paints nobler pictures and van <a href=""entry://Dyck, Sir Anthony van""><span class=""links"">Dyck </span></a> had nobler subjects, but neither of them entered so subtly as Sir Joshua did into the minor varieties of human heart and temper.’ In spite of his impressive weight of learning Reynolds could at times be utterly direct, and although his huge output necessitated the employment of assistants and drapery painters, and his experimentation with <a href=""entry://bitumen""><span class=""links"">bitumen</span></a> has resulted in some of his pictures being in poor condition, there is much beauty of handling in his work. His finest pictures undoubtedly take their place among the great masterpieces of British portraiture. On the other hand, his history paintings, dating mainly from the end of his career, are generally considered failures. Reynolds's work is in numerous public collections, great and small, in Britain and elsewhere, and many of his finest pictures are still in the possession of the families for which they were painted. His work was so varied that no single collection can be regarded as fully representative.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>Frances Reynolds</i> (1729&ndash;1807), Joshua's sister and for many years his housekeeper, was an amateur painter, but evidently not a very good one, for he said of her copies of his work: ‘They make other people laugh and me cry.’"

He was probably trained at the <a href=""entry://Escorial""><span class=""links"">Escorial</span></a> and during most of the 1580s and 1590s he worked in Madrid. His earlier paintings are <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> in character, notably his first known work, <i>The Nailing to the Cross</i> (Hermitage, St Petersburg, 1582). By 1599 he was settled in Valencia and there his style became much more sombre and naturalistic. According to <a href=""entry://Palomino y Velasco, Antonio""><span class=""links"">Palomino </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Ribalta, Francisco""><span class=""links"">Ribalta </span></a> had studied in Italy and he is known to have made a copy of <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio's</span></a>
<i>Martyrdom of St Peter</i>, but his late <a href=""entry://tenebrism""><span class=""links"">tenebrist</span></a> style may have been influenced more by <a href=""entry://Ribera, José""><span class=""links"">Ribera</span></a> than by direct knowledge of painting in Rome. In their turn, Ribalta's dramatically lit and powerfully austere mature works (<i>Christ Embracing St Bernard</i>, Prado, Madrid) had considerable influence on Spanish painting, notably on <a href=""entry://Zurbarán, Francisco de""><span class=""links"">Zurbarán</span></a>. His son <i>Juan</i> (1596/7&ndash;1628) was also an able painter in the Caravaggesque manner, but died young."
"Ribera, José","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ribera, José</b>
<i>(or Jusepe) de</i><div class=""content""><i>(1591&ndash;1652)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. Spanish painter, etcher, and draughtsman, active for all his known career in Italy, where he was called ‘Lo Spagnoletto’ (the Little Spaniard). Little is known of his life before he settled in Naples (at the time a Spanish possession) in 1616. Naples was then one of the main centres of the Caravaggesque style, and Ribera is often described as one of <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio's</span></a> followers. However, although his early work is markedly <a href=""entry://tenebrism""><span class=""links"">tenebrist</span></a>, it is much more individual than that of most Caravaggesque artists, particularly in his vigorous and scratchy handling of paint. Similarly, his penchant for the typically Caravaggesque theme of bloody martyrdom has been overplayed, enshrined as it is in Byron's lines: ‘Spagnoletto tainted/His brush with all the blood of all the sainted’ (<i>Don Juan</i>, xiii. 71). He undoubtedly painted some powerful pictures of this type, notably the celebrated <i>Martyrdom of St Bartholomew</i> (Prado, Madrid, <i>c.</i>1630), but he was equally capable of great tenderness, as in <i>The Adoration of the Shepherds</i> (Louvre, Paris, 1650), and his work is remarkable for his feeling for individual humanity. Indeed, he laid the foundation of that respect for the dignity of the individual which was so important a feature of Spanish art from <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez</span></a> to <a href=""entry://Goya, Francisco de""><span class=""links"">Goya</span></a>. This feature of his work is evident also in the secular subjects, such as <i>The Clubfooted Boy</i> (Louvre, 1642). He was the first to breach the traditional Spanish dislike for mythological themes (<i>Apollo and Marsyas</i>, Musées Royaux, Brussels, 1637), and he broadened the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> repertory by his series of philosophers depicted as beggars or vagabonds (<i>Archimedes</i>, Prado, 1630). Ribera gradually moved away from his early tenebrist style, and his late works are often rich in colour and soft in modelling. He was the leading painter in Naples in his period (Velázquez visited him during his second visit to Italy and probably during his first) and his work was influential in Spain (where much of it was exported) as well as in Italy. His reputation has remained high, and until the Napoleonic Wars he and <a href=""entry://Murillo, Bartolomé Esteban""><span class=""links"">Murillo</span></a> were virtually the only Spanish painters who were widely known outside their native country."
"Ricci, Sebastiano","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ricci, Sebastiano</b><div class=""content""><i>(1659&ndash;1730).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian decorative painter. He was born at Belluno and is considered a member of the Venetian school, but before he settled in Venice in 1717 he led a peripatetic life, working in numerous Italian cities and also in England, Flanders, France, and Germany. His unsettled existence is a reflection not only of the demand for his talents but also of his penchant for illicit love affairs, which often led to his having to move in haste, and once almost resulted in his execution. In view of this it is not surprising that his work is uneven and sometimes shows signs of carelessness, but he had a gift for vivid, fresh colouring, and his itinerant career was important in spreading knowledge of Italian decorative painting. Little of the decorative work he did in England survives except the <i>Resurrection</i> in the apse of the Chelsea Hospital Chapel and some large but damaged canvases on the staircase at Burlington House (now the Royal Academy). He is, however, extremely well represented in the Royal Collection. <i>Marco Ricci </i> (1676&ndash;1729), Sebastiano's nephew, was also born in Belluno and travelled extensively. He made two visits to England, and worked there in partnership with his uncle, the collaboration continuing after they returned to Venice in 1717. Examples of their joint works are in the Royal Collection. He was primarily a landscape painter, working in a freely handled style that owed something to <a href=""entry://Magnasco, Alessandro""><span class=""links"">Magnasco</span></a>."

Italian sculptor, born in Trento, and active in and around Padua, where he was probably trained by Bartolommeo Bellano (<i>c.</i>1440&ndash;96/7), who in turn is assumed to have been one of <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello's</span></a> assistants. His nickname means ‘curly head’. Riccio was a virtuoso bronze-worker and his masterpiece is the great bronze Easter candlestick in the Santo (S. Antonio ) at Padua (1507&ndash;16), which with its relief scenes of classically draped figures, its satyrs, sphinxes, and decorative conceits, is an endlessly inventive work. He is best known, however, for his small bronze figures, which are done in an <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> manner and greatly appealed to humanist circles in Padua and Venice (he was on intimate terms with leading scholars). They were much imitated, but works from Riccio's own hand are distinguished by a vivacity and delicacy of surface that none of his rivals could match."

British painter and maker of <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">reliefs</span></a>, born at Dunvant, near Swansea, of a Welsh-speaking family. He was an artist of great versatility, able to absorb many influences without sacrificing his originality. From 1933, under the influence of <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>, he worked on a series of relief constructions and <a href=""entry://assemblage""><span class=""links"">assemblages</span></a> which were described by John <a href=""entry://Rothenstein, Sir William""><span class=""links"">Rothenstein </span></a> as ‘original creations of a rare order, and unlike anything else done in Britain at the time’. He was influenced by the London <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealist</span></a> Exhibition of 1936, which in his own words ‘helped me to be aware of the mystery, even the “unreality”, of ordinary things’. After the Second World War his painting drew inspiration from the large exhibition of Picasso and <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a> at the Victoria and Albert Museum (1945). His love of music showed itself in the many pictures with musical themes done during this time&mdash;e.g. <i>Cold Light, Deep Shadow</i> (Tate, London, 1950)&mdash;culminating in his <i>Cathédrale Engloutie</i> series illustrating Debussy's music on this theme. He was also inspired by Dylan Thomas and one of his finest paintings&mdash;<i>‘Do not go gentle into that good night’</i> (Tate, 1956)&mdash;is based on his poem of that name. Richards also did work for churches, designed for the stage, and made murals for ships of the Orient Line."

She had a traditional training as a carver, working under <a href=""entry://Bourdelle, Émile-Antoine""><span class=""links"">Bourdelle</span></a> from 1925 to 1929, but from about 1940 she began to create a distinctive type of bronze sculpture. Her figures became long and thin, combining human with animal or insect (and sometimes vegetal) forms. The surfaces of these powerful and disquieting works have a tattered and lacerated effect, creating a macabre feeling of decomposition, and she was one of the pioneers of an open form of sculpture in which enclosed space becomes as important and alive as the solid material. Such figures were often extremely difficult to cast and she showed great technical resourcefulness in bringing them to completion. The public sometimes found her work shocking, especially her <i>Crucified Christ</i> (church of Nôtre-Dame-de-Toute-Grâce, Assy, 1950), which caused a storm of controversy. Nevertheless, her international prestige grew steadily in the years after the Second World War."

<b>Ricketts, Charles</b><div class=""content""><i>(1866&ndash;1931).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter, designer, sculptor, collector, and writer on art. In 1882 he began studying wood engraving at Lambeth School of Art and there met fellow student Charles Shannon (1863&ndash;1937), a painter and engraver who became his lifelong companion. Kenneth <a href=""entry://Clark, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Clark </span></a> writes that ‘Ricketts did most of the talking. Shannon was quiet and recessive, but his rare interpolations showed good sense and considerable learning. One could see that Ricketts turned to him as to a reasonable wife.’ Ricketts initially made his mark in book production, first as an illustrator, then as the driving force behind the Vale Press (1896&ndash;1904), one of the finest private presses of the day, for which he designed founts, initials, borders, and illustrations. After the closure of the Press (following a disastrous fire), Ricketts turned to painting and occasional sculpture, and in 1906 he began to make designs for the theatre. His paintings&mdash;typically rather melodramatic, heavy-handed figure subjects&mdash;have not worn well, but his colourful stage designs are still much admired. He had a great reputation as an art connoisseur and in 1915 turned down the offer of the directorship of the National Gallery. Later he regretted this decision, but he served on various committees and put much energy into trying to combat modernism in art. Most of the highly varied collection he made with Shannon was bequeathed to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, although the gem of the collection&mdash;<a href=""entry://Piero di Cosimo ""><span class=""links"">Piero di Cosimo's </span></a>
<i>Fight Between Lapiths and Centaurs</i>&mdash;went to the National Gallery. Ricketts's main books were <i>The Prado and its Masterpieces</i> (1903), <i>Titian</i> (1910), and <i>Pages on Art</i> (1913); <i>Self-Portrait</i> (taken from his letters and journals) was posthumously published in 1939."

His style was intricate, but also balanced and harmonious, with none of the extreme emotionalism often seen in German art of the period. He held various offices in city government, and in 1525 he was tortured and briefly imprisoned because he was one of the councilmen who refused to support the use of force against the rebels in the Peasants' War. Much of Riemenschneider's work is still in the churches for which it was carved, but he is also well represented in the Mainfränkisches Museum in Würzburg.

He was born in Perpignan and after working in Montpellier he settled in Paris in 1681. His reputation was established in 1688 with a portrait (now lost) of Monsieur, Louis XIV's brother, and he became the outstanding court painter of the latter part of Louis's reign, retaining his popularity after the king's death. He was less interested in showing individual character than in depicting the rank and condition of the sitter by nobility of attitude and expressiveness of gesture. These qualities are seen most memorably in his celebrated state portrait of Louis XIV (Louvre, Paris, 1701), one of the classic images of royal majesty. Louis so admired this portrait that, although he had intended it as a present to Philip V of Spain, he kept it himself. Rigaud's unofficial portraits are much more informal and show a debt to <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a> (<i>The Artist's Mother</i>, Louvre, 1695), several of whose works he owned.

Her interest in optical effects came partly through her study of <a href=""entry://Seurat, Georges""><span class=""links"">Seurat's</span></a> technique of <a href=""entry://pointillism""><span class=""links"">pointillism</span></a>, but when she took up Op art in the early 1960s she worked initially in black and white. She turned to colour in 1966. By this time she had attracted international attention (one of her paintings was used for the cover to the catalogue of the exhibition ‘The Responsive Eye’ at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1965, the exhibition that gave currency to the term ‘Op art’), and the seal was set on her reputation when she won the International Painting Prize at the <a href=""entry://Biennale""><span class=""links"">Venice Biennale</span></a> in 1968. Her work shows a complete mastery of the effects characteristic of Op art, particularly subtle variations in size, shape, or placement of serialized units in an all-over pattern. It is often on a large scale and she frequently makes use of assistants for the actual execution. Although her paintings often create effects of vibration and dazzle, her decorative scheme for the interior of the Royal Liverpool Hospital (1983) uses soothing bands of blue, yellow, pink, and white and is reported to have caused a drop in vandalism and graffiti. She has also worked in theatre design, making sets for a ballet called <i>Colour Moves</i> (first performed at the Edinburgh Festival in 1983). Unusually, the sets preceded the composition of the music and the choreography. Riley has travelled widely (a visit to Egypt in 1981 was particularly influential on her work, as she was inspired by the colours of ancient Egyptian art) and she has studios in London, Cornwall, and Provence."

He was generally more successful painting men than women (he was no rival to Lely in depicting fine clothes and soft complexions) and his unassuming sincerity of presentation exemplifies a typically English approach to portraiture that he passed on to his pupil <a href=""entry://Richardson, Jonathan the Elder""><span class=""links"">Richardson </span></a>."
"Rimmer, William","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Rimmer, William</b><div class=""content""><i>(1816&ndash;79).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English-born American sculptor, painter, teacher, and writer. His family emigrated in the year he was born and eventually settled in Boston, which with New York was his main place of work. Rimmer was an off-beat character and had an eccentric career. He believed he was the heir to the French throne and taught himself medicine, being licensed as a physician in 1855. As an artist too he was self-taught, and although he showed brilliantly precocious talent with his gypsum figure of <i>Despair</i> (Mus. of Fine Arts, Boston, <i>c.</i>1830), he struggled for recognition, and for years earned his living mainly as a sign and scenery painter and as a cobbler. In his later years, however, he became famous as a teacher, notably for his instructional books, <i>Elements of Design</i> (1864) and <i>Art Anatomy</i> (1877). Rimmer's output as an artist was very small, but he was the most powerful and original American sculptor of his time; his work excels in dramatic force and vividly displays his anatomical mastery (<i>Falling Gladiator</i>, Mus. of Fine Arts, 1861). As a painter, his best-known work is the nightmarish <i>Flight and Pursuit</i> (Mus. of Fine Arts, 1872), which, like his sculptures, shows the freshness and unconventionality of his approach and the richness of his imagination."

He is considered the leading Canadian abstract painter of his generation, although since 1947 he has lived in Paris. Riopelle's early abstracts were in a lyrical manner, but in the 1950s his work became tauter, denser, and more powerful, often with paint applied with the palette-knife creating a rich mosaic-like effect. International recognition came with pictures such as the huge <a href=""entry://triptych""><span class=""links"">triptych</span></a>

<b>Rivera, Diego</b><div class=""content""><i>(1886&ndash;1957).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Mexican painter, the most celebrated figure in the revival of monumental fresco painting that is Mexico's most distinctive contribution to modern art. He visited Paris in 1909 and after a brief return to Mexico he settled there from 1911 to 1920. During this time he became one of the lions of café society and was friendly with many leading artists. He became familiar with modern movements, but although he made some early experiments with <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> for example, his mature art was firmly rooted in Mexican tradition. At about the time of the Russian Revolution he had become interested in politics and in the role art could play in society. In 1920&ndash;1 he visited Italy to study Renaissance frescos (already thinking in terms of a monumental public art), then returned to his homeland, eager to be of service to the Mexican Revolution. In 1920 Alvaro Obregón, an art lover as well as a reformist, had been elected President of Mexico, and Rivera, who was an extremely forceful personality, swiftly emerged as the leading artist in the programme of murals he initiated glorifying the history and people of the country in a spirit of revolutionary fervour. Many examples of his work are in public buildings in Mexico City, and they are often on a huge scale, a tribute to his enormous energy. His most ambitious scheme, in the National Palace, covering the history of Mexico, was begun in 1929; it was still unfinished at his death, but it contains some of his most magnificent work. Rivera's murals were frankly didactic, intended to inspire a sense of nationalist and socialist identity in a still largely illiterate population; their glorification of creative labour or their excoriation of capitalism can be crude, but his best work has astonishing vigour. His skill in choreographing his incident- and figure-packed compositions, in combining traditional and modern subject matter, and in blending stylized and realistic images is formidable.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1927 Rivera visited the Soviet Union and in 1930&ndash;4 he worked in the USA, painting several frescos that were influential on the muralists of the <a href=""entry://Federal Art Project""><span class=""links"">Federal Art Project</span></a>. His main work in American was a series on <i>Detroit Industry</i> (1932&ndash;3) in the Detroit Institute of Arts (commissioned by William <a href=""entry://Valentiner, William""><span class=""links"">Valentiner </span></a>); another major mural, <i>Man at the Crossroads</i> (1933), in the Rockefeller Center, New York, was destroyed before completion because he included a portrait of Lenin. It was replaced by a mural by <a href=""entry://Brangwyn, Sir Frank""><span class=""links"">Brangwyn</span></a>. Throughout his career he also painted a wide range of easel pictures, in some of which he experimented with the encaustic (wax) technique. Rivera was an enormous man (standing over 6 feet and weighing over 20 stones), and although he was notoriously ugly he was irresistibly attractive to women. He had numerous love affairs and was married three times, his second wife (and his third, for they divorced and remarried) being the painter Frida <a href=""entry://Kahlo, Frida""><span class=""links"">Kahlo </span></a>."

His work of the early and mid-1950s continued the vigorous painterly handling associated with Abstract Expressionism, but was very different in character. Some of his paintings were fairly straightforwardly naturalistic, but others looked forward to <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a> in their quotations from well-known advertising or artistic sources, their use of lettering, and their deadpan humour. An example is <i>Washington Crossing the Delaware</i> (MOMA, New York, 1953), based on the picture by <a href=""entry://Leutze, Emanuel Gottlieb""><span class=""links"">Leutze </span></a>. In the late 1950s and 1960s his work came more clearly within the orbit of Pop, sometimes incorporating cut-out cardboard or wooden forms, electric lights, and so on, but his sensuous handling of paint set him apart from other Pop artists. Rivers has also made sculpture, collages, and prints, designed for the stage, acted, and written poetry."

<b>Robbia, Luca della</b><div class=""content""><i>(1399/1400&ndash;82).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine sculptor, the most famous member of a family of artists. Nothing is known of his early career, and he was a mature artist by the time of his first documented work&mdash;a <i>Cantoria</i> (Singing Gallery, 1431&ndash;8) for Florence Cathedral, now in the Cathedral Museum. It is a work of considerable originality as well as enormous charm, antedating by a year or two the companion gallery by <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello</span></a> (now also in the Cathedral Museum). Its marble <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">reliefs</span></a> of angels and children singing, dancing, and making music reflect <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> prototypes, but conceived in a more cheerful, less heroic spirit than Donatello's figures. In his own time Luca had the reputation of being one of the leaders of the modern (i.e. <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>) style, comparable to Donatello and <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti</span></a> in sculpture and <a href=""entry://Masaccio ""><span class=""links"">Masaccio </span></a> in painting, but he is now remembered mainly for his development of coloured, glazed <a href=""entry://terracotta""><span class=""links"">terracotta</span></a> as a sculptural medium&mdash;in particular for his highly popular invention of the type of the half-length Madonna and Child in white on a blue ground. The family workshop seems to have kept the technical formula a secret and it became the basis of a flourishing business; among the major works by Luca in the medium are the roundels of Apostles (<i>c.</i>1444) in <a href=""entry://Brunelleschi, Filippo""><span class=""links"">Brunelleschi's </span></a> Pazzi Chapel in Sta Croce. Luca's business was carried on by his nephew <i>Andrea</i> (1435&ndash;1525), and later by Andrea 's five sons, of whom <i>Giovanni</i> (1469&ndash;after 1529) was the most important. The famous roundels of infants on the façade of the Foundling Hospital in Florence (1463&ndash;6) were probably made by Andrea . His successors tended to sentimentalize Luca's warm humanity, and in course of time the artists' studio became a potters' workshop-industry."

He made a vast quantity of drawings in Italy, on which he based his pictures after his return to Paris. His particular interest was in ruins and he was the first to make them the main theme of a picture rather than to use them as <a href=""entry://Picturesque""><span class=""links"">Picturesque</span></a> accessories. He romanticized the vision of <a href=""entry://Panini ""><span class=""links"">Panini</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Piranesi, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Piranesi</span></a>, whom he knew in Rome, and often set his ruins in idealized surroundings (although he also painted topographical views).

Under Louis XVI Robert became Keeper of the King's Pictures and one of the first curators of the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a>, but he was imprisoned during the Revolution.

The only picture reasonably certainly his is the altarpiece with a <i>Madonna Enthroned with Saints</i> (1480) painted for Sta Maria in Poroto at Ravenna and now in the Brera, Milan. Other works, however, can be confidently given to him because of his distinctive style. He inherited the tradition of Tura and Cossa with their precise line and metallic colours against elaborately fanciful ornamentation, but he developed this manner with great originality, modifying it with a subtlety of handling that seems to derive from Giovanni <a href=""entry://Bellini""><span class=""links"">Bellini </span></a>.

Often his paintings showed groups of figures in everyday settings, his most famous work being <i>The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel: Spring</i> 1915, Tate Gallery, London, 1961&ndash;2), an imaginative reconstruction of his former colleagues celebrating at a favourite rendezvous to mark the publication of the first issue of <i>Blast</i>. In response to the exhibition ‘Wyndham <a href=""entry://Lewis, Wyndham""><span class=""links"">Lewis </span></a> and the Vorticists’ at the Tate Gallery in 1956, Roberts wrote a series of pamphlets (1956&ndash;8) disputing Lewis's claim (in the catalogue introduction) that ‘Vorticism, in fact, was what I, personally, did, and said, at a certain period.’ However, Roberts later altered his views."

He also worked for many other publications. Rockwell's subjects were drawn from everyday American life and his style was anecdotal, sentimental, and lovingly detailed; he described his pictorial territory as ‘this best-possible-world, Santa down-the-chimney, lovely-kids-adoring-their-kindly-grandpa sort of thing’. Such work brought him immense popularity, making him something of a national institution. For most of his career critics dismissed his work as corny, but he began to receive serious attention as a painter late in his career.

"Rococo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Rococo</b>.<div class=""content"">Style of art and architecture, characterized by lightness, grace, playfulness, and intimacy, that emerged in France <i>c.</i>1700 and spread throughout Europe in the 18th cent. The Rococo was both a development from and a reaction against the weightier <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> style. It shared with the Baroque a love of complexity of form, but instead of a concern for solidity and mass, there was a delicate play on the surface, and sombre colours and heavy gilding were replaced with light pinks, blues, and greens, with white also often being prominent. Elegance and convenience were the qualities demanded by a society tired of the excessive grandiloquence of Louis XIV's court at Versailles, and the Rococo style was intially mainly one of decoration. The word is said to derive from a combination of <i>barocco</i> (Baroque) and <a href=""entry://rocaille""><span class=""links"">rocaille</span></a>; like many stylistic labels in the history of art, it was originally a term of abuse, meaning ‘tastelessly florid or ornate’, but it is now used without any pejorative connotations.<br class=""nLine"" />In painting, the first great master of the Rococo style was <a href=""entry://Watteau, Jean-Antoine""><span class=""links"">Watteau</span></a> and the painters who most completely represent the lighthearted (often gently erotic) spirit of the mature Rococo style are <a href=""entry://Boucher, François""><span class=""links"">Boucher</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Fragonard, Jean-Honoré""><span class=""links"">Fragonard</span></a>. <a href=""entry://Falconet, Étienne-Maurice""><span class=""links"">Falconet</span></a> is perhaps the best representative of the style in French sculpture, but generally the Rococo spirit is seen more clearly in small porcelain figures than in large-scale statues (Falconet himself was Director of the famous porcelain factory at Sèvres). In architecture the Rococo style was much more suitable for interior decoration, with asymmetrical curves and pretty decorative motifs prevailing, than for exteriors, but something of the Rococo spirit&mdash;of its refinement and charm&mdash;can be seen even in such a regular and relatively unadorned building as Ange-Jacques Gabriel's Petit Trianon (1763&ndash;9) at Versailles.<br class=""nLine"" />From Paris the Rococo was disseminated by French artists working abroad and by engraved publications of French designs. It spread to Germany, Austria, Russia, Spain, and northern Italy (<a href=""entry://Tiepolo, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Tiepolo</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Longhi, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Longhi</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Guardi, Francesco""><span class=""links"">Guardi</span></a>). In England it had somewhat less of a vogue, although a substantial exhibition of English Rococo art was held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1984 and there are clear reflections of the style even in the work of so xenophobic an artist as <a href=""entry://Hogarth, William""><span class=""links"">Hogarth</span></a>. <a href=""entry://Gainsborough, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Gainsborough's</span></a> delicacy of characterization and sensitivity of touch (although completely personal) are also thoroughly in the Rococo spirit. In each country the style took on a national character and in addition many local variants may be distinguished. Outside France, it had its finest flowering in Germany and Austria, where it merged with a still vigorous Baroque tradition. In churches such as Vierzehnheiligen (1743&ndash;72) by Balthasar Neuman, the Baroque qualities of spatial variety and of architecture, sculpture, and painting working together are taken up in a breathtakingly light and exuberant manner. The Rococo flourished in central Europe until the end of the century (as in the work of <a href=""entry://Maulbertsch ""><span class=""links"">Maulbertsch</span></a>), but in France and elsewhere the tide of taste had begun to turn from frivolity and lightheartedness towards the sternness of <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a> by the 1760s."
"Rodchenko, Alexander","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

His output was prolific and his artistic evolution was rapid, as he moved from <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionistic</span></a> pictures in 1913 to pure abstracts, made with a ruler and compass, in 1916. He was influenced by <a href=""entry://Malevich, Kasimir""><span class=""links"">Malevich's </span></a>
<a href=""entry://Suprematism""><span class=""links"">Suprematism</span></a>, his <i>Black on Black</i> (Met. Mus., New York, 1918) being a response to Malevich's <i>White on White</i> paintings. Rodchenko, however, was without Malevich's mystical leanings, and he coined the term *‘<a href=""entry://Non-Objective art""><span class=""links"">Non-objective</span></a>’ to describe his own more scientific approach. In 1917 he began making three-dimensional constructions under the influence of <a href=""entry://Tatlin, Vladimir""><span class=""links"">Tatlin </span></a>, and some of these developed into graceful hanging sculptures. Like Tatlin and other Constructivists, however, Rodchenko came to reject pure art as a parasitical activity, and after 1922 he devoted his energies to industrial design, typography, film and stage design, propaganda posters, and photography. It was perhaps in photography that his originality was most evident. In sharp reaction from his abstract work, his photography was geared towards reportage and a pictorial record of the new Russia. But much of this work was outstanding for its exploitation of unusual angles and viewpoints, and his innovative use of light and shadow influenced, for example, the great Soviet film director Sergei Eisenstein. In the mid 1930s Rodchenko returned to easel painting, and in the early 1940s he produced a series of abstract canvases in an expressionist vein."
"Rodin, Auguste","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Rodin, Auguste</b><div class=""content""><i>(1840&ndash;1917).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French sculptor and graphic artist, one of the greatest and most influential European artists of his period. He was the first sculptor since the heyday of <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a> to occupy a central position in public attention and he opened up new possibilities for his art in a manner comparable to that of his great contemporaries in painting&mdash;<a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin</span></a>, and van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a>. His beginnings, however, were not auspicious. He came from a poor background, was rejected by the École des <a href=""entry://Beaux-Arts, École Nationale Supérieure des""><span class=""links"">Beaux-Arts</span></a> three times and for many years worked as an ornamental mason. In 1875 he went to Italy, where (as he later wrote to <a href=""entry://Bourdelle, Émile-Antoine""><span class=""links"">Bourdelle</span></a>) ‘<a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> freed me from academism.’ Michelangelo was the inspiration for his first major work, <i>The Age of Bronze</i>, which was exhibited in 1878. (Like many of Rodin's statues, this exists in several casts; the Rodin Museum in Paris has examples of virtually all his work. There is also a Rodin museum in Philadelphia.) It caused a sensation because the <a href=""entry://naturalism""><span class=""links"">naturalistic</span></a> treatment of the naked figure was so different from the idealizing conventions then current that he was accused of having cast it from a live model. Two years later, in 1880, his reputation now established, Rodin was commissioned by the state to make a bronze door for a proposed Musée des Arts Décoratifs. Rodin never finished the huge work&mdash;<i>The Gates of Hell</i>&mdash;in a definitive form (he worked on it intermittently until 1900 and the museum never came into being in its proposed form), but he poured some of his finest creative energy into it, and many of the nearly 200 figures that are part of it formed the basis of famous independent sculptures, most notably <i>The Thinker</i>. The several casts of the complete structure that exist were made after Rodin's death. The overall design is a kind of <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> reworking of <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti's</span></a>
<i>Gates of Paradise</i> for the Florence Baptistery, the twisted and anguished figures, irregularly arranged, reminiscent of Michelangelo's <i>Last Judgement</i> and Gustav <a href=""entry://Doré, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Doré's </span></a> illustrations for the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. His modelling is often rough and ‘unfinished’ and anatomical forms are exaggerated or simplified in the cause of intensity of expression.<br class=""nLine"" />These traits were taken further in some of Rodin's monuments, for example the famous group of <i>The Burghers of Calais</i> (1885&ndash;95), commissioned by the city of Calais for a site in front of the town hall (another cast is in Victoria Tower Gardens, London). In the figures of the six hostages who face the threat of death Rodin created a profound image of a variety of responses to an extreme emotional crisis. The civic authorities had wanted something in a more traditional heroic-patriotic vein, and the monument was eventually unveiled only after years of wrangling. Even worse hostility was aroused a few years later by his statue of Balzac. This was commissioned by the Société des Gens de Lettres in 1891, but Rodin's design was so radical&mdash;an expression of the elemental power of genius rather than a portrait of an individual&mdash;that it was rejected. The monument, which ranks as the most original piece of public statuary created in the 19th cent., and which Rodin said was ‘the sum of my whole life’, was not finally cast and set up&mdash;at the intersection of the Boulevards Raspail and Montparnasse&mdash;until 1939. In spite of this kind of controversy, by 1900 Rodin was widely regarded as the greatest living sculptor, and in that year a pavilion was devoted to his work at the Paris World Fair. Apart from his monuments, he did a large number of portraits of eminent personalities and he was a prolific graphic artist, some of his later work especially being notably erotic. Although the literary and symbolic significance he attached to his work has been out of keeping with the conception of ‘pure’ sculpture that has predominated in the 20th cent., Rodin's influence on the development of modern art has been immense, for single-handedly he rescued sculpture from a period of stagnation and made it once again a vehicle for intense personal expression."

<i>Ballets Russes</i>, notably for Stravinsky's <i>Rite of Spring</i> (1913), for which Roerich created the scenario with the composer. A man of immense energy, Roerich combined his career as an artist with one as an archaeologist and anthropologist. In 1925&ndash;8 he made a 16,000-mile expedition in Central Asia; his ‘investigation of the cultures of the region [is] still the bedrock of anthropological studies of Central Asia’ (<i>The Times Atlas of World Exploration</i>, 1991). From 1928 until his death he directed a Himalayan research station at Kulu in India, and many of his later paintings feature mountain landscapes. He had a deep interest in esoteric religions and the mysteries of nature, and he developed a philosophy in which art should unite humanity. There are Roerich museums in Moscow and New York (he lived in the USA, 1920&ndash;3), but the best collection of his work is in the Russian Museum, St Petersburg."

"Romanesque","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Romanesque</b>.<div class=""content"">Style of art and architecture prevailing throughout most of Europe in the 11th and 12th cents., the first style to achieve such international currency. The dominant art of the Middle Ages was architecture, and ‘Romanesque’, like ‘<a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a>’, is primarily an architectural term that has been extended to the other arts of the period. As the name suggests, it indicates a derivation from Roman art, and sometimes ‘Romanesque’ is used to cover all the developments from Roman architecture in the period from the collapse of the Roman Empire until the flowering of the Gothic&mdash;roughly AD 500&ndash;1200. More usually, however, it is applied to a distinctive style that emerged, almost simultaneously, in several countries&mdash;France, Germany, Italy, Spain&mdash;in the 11th cent. It is characterized most obviously by a new massiveness of scale, reflecting the greater political and economic stability that followed a period when Christian civilization seemed in danger of extinction. Romanesque painting and sculpture are generally strongly stylized, with little of the <a href=""entry://naturalism""><span class=""links"">naturalism</span></a> and humanistic warmth of <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> or later Gothic art. The forms of nature are freely translated into linear and sculptural designs which are sometimes majestically calm and severe and at others are agitated by a visionary excitement that can become almost delirious. Because of its expressionistic distortion of natural form, Romanesque art, as with other great non-naturalistic styles of the past, has had to wait for the revolution in sensibility brought about by the development of modern art in order to be widely appreciated."

"Romanticism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Romanticism</b>.<div class=""content"">Movement in the arts flourishing in the late 18th and early 19th cents. Romanticism is so varied in its manifestations that a single definition is impossible, but its keynote was a belief in the value of individual experience. In this it marked a reaction from the rationalism of the Enlightenment and the order of the <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> style. The Romantic artist explored the values of intuition and instinct, exchanging the public discourse of Neoclassicism, the forms of which had a common currency, for a more private kind of expression. Romanticism is commonly seen as the antithesis of <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classicism</span></a>, and the two concepts are sometimes used in a very general sense to designate polarities in attitude that may be seen in the art of any age&mdash;thus <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> might be described as a ‘classical’ artist, whereas his contemporary <a href=""entry://Giorgione ""><span class=""links"">Giorgione</span></a> is a ‘romantic’ one. However, the exponents of both Romanticism and classicism share a concern with the <a href=""entry://ideal""><span class=""links"">ideal</span></a> rather than the real, and that there is sometimes no firm dividing line between the two approaches is shown by the use of the term ‘Romantic Classicism’ to describe certain works that show a Romantic response to antiquity. Both Romanticism and classicism embrace concepts of nobility, grandeur, virtue, and superiority. But where the classical seems a possible ideal which will adapt man to his society and mould that society into an orderly setting for him, the Romantic envisages the unattainable, beyond the limits of society and human adaptability. The classical hero accepts the fate over which he has no control and triumphs nobly in this acquiescence, otherwise he would not be a hero. The Romantic hero pits himself against a hostile environment and at no time comes to terms with it even if he reaches his goal, otherwise he would not be Romantic.<br class=""nLine"" />Romanticism represents an attitude of mind rather than a set of particular stylistic traits and involves the expression of an idea that tends to have a verbal rather than a visual origin. It lends itself more easily to expression through music and literature than through the visual arts, as a sense of the infinite and the transcendental, of forces exceeding the boundaries of reason, must necessarily be vague&mdash;suggestive rather than concrete, as it must be in painting and even more so in sculpture. Almost by definition, the leading Romantic artists differ widely from one another&mdash;<a href=""entry://Blake, William""><span class=""links"">Blake</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Turner, J. M. W.""><span class=""links"">Turner </span></a> in Britain, <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Géricault, Théodore""><span class=""links"">Géricault</span></a> in France, <a href=""entry://Friedrich, Caspar David""><span class=""links"">Friedrich</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Runge, Philipp Otto""><span class=""links"">Runge </span></a> in Germany. The movement of which they were a part died out in the mid 19th cent., but in a broader sense the Romantic spirit has lived on, representing a revolt against conservatism, moderation, and insincerity and an insistence on the primacy of the imagination in artistic expression."

His posthumous reputation was once almost the equal of theirs, but has faded greatly. Much of his work is now considered facile and he was probably at his best with portraits of young people, when his delicate colour sense and graceful line were used to good effect. As with many successful portraitists, his heart lay elsewhere and he had aspirations to be a history painter. His visit to Italy in 1773&ndash;5 made a lasting effect on him, but his plans for grandiose literary and historical works rarely advanced beyond his sepia drawings (a large collection is in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge), although he painted for <a href=""entry://Boydell, John""><span class=""links"">Boydell's</span></a> Shakespeare Gallery. Introspective and nervous by temperament, Romney was attracted to literary circles and associated little with his fellow artists, never exhibiting at the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a>. His friends among artists tended to be others of literary temperament, such as <a href=""entry://Flaxman, John""><span class=""links"">Flaxman </span></a>. In about 1781 Romney became infatuated with Emma Hart, later Lady Hamilton, Nelson's mistress, and he painted her many times in various guises. He retired to Kendal in 1798 and died insane.

<b>Rossetti, Dante Gabriel</b><div class=""content""><i>(1828&ndash;82).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter and poet. He came from a remarkable and talented family: his father was an exiled Italian patriot and Dante scholar, his sister the poet Christina Rossetti, and his brother the critic William Michael Rossetti. Growing up in modest circumstances but a strongly literary environment, he at first found it hard to decide whether he should devote himself to poetry or painting. Although painting became his profession (following the advice given to him by the poet and critic Leigh Hunt: ‘If you paint as well as you write, you may be a rich man’), he continued to write poetry and make translations from the Italian, and he is accorded a distinguished position as a literary figure. In 1848 he formed the <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</span></a> with <a href=""entry://Hunt, William Holman""><span class=""links"">Hunt</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Millais, Sir John Everett""><span class=""links"">Millais </span></a>, and others. His <i>Girlhood of Mary Virgin</i> (Tate, London, 1849), the first picture to be exhibited bearing the Brotherhood's initials, was warmly praised and sold well, but the subsequent abuse that the Pre-Raphaelites received hurt him so much that he rarely again exhibited in public. In the 1850s he virtually gave up oils and concentrated on watercolours of medieval subjects. These found ready buyers (often contacts of <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin</span></a>, whom Rossetti met in 1854), and Rossetti, who was a hard and skilful businessman, proved Leigh Hunt's prediction true&mdash;by the 1860s he was earning the very substantial sum of £3,000 a year.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1860 Rossetti married the beautiful but sickly Elizabeth Siddal, the archetypal Pre-Raphaelite ‘stunner’, after a long and sometimes vexed liaison. Her melancholy face haunted his imagination, and he portrayed ‘Guggums’ (as he called her) again and again&mdash;‘It is like a monomania with him’, wrote Ford Madox <a href=""entry://Brown, Ford Madox""><span class=""links"">Brown </span></a> in 1855. Rossetti immortalized her mainly in drawings, for in spite of the hatred for academic discipline that made him so disdainful of the official art world, he was an outstanding draughtsman. Elizabeth died from an overdose of laudanum, possibly deliberate, in 1862, and Rossetti was devastated; as a gesture of his grief he had the only complete manuscript of his poems placed in her coffin, but he was persuaded to have them exhumed in 1869 and they were published the following year. Rossetti also painted the intensely spiritual <i>Beata Beatrix</i> (Tate) as a memorial to Elizabeth, expressing his love for her as a parallel to Dante's for Beatrice (the picture is dated 1864, but was worked on over a period of several years). By the time of Elizabeth's death Rossetti had returned to oil painting, and in the last two decades of his life, his subject matter was confined almost exclusively to beautiful women, portrayed in a richly sensuous manner and often evoking literary or mythological references. Elizabeth was replaced as his favourite model by William <a href=""entry://Morris, William""><span class=""links"">Morris's </span></a> wife Janey, who became in Rossetti's pictures one of the archetypal <i>femmes fatales</i>&mdash;all cascading curls, pouting lips, and smouldering eyes. Rossetti had met Morris and <a href=""entry://Burne-Jones, Sir Edward Coley""><span class=""links"">Burne-Jones</span></a> in 1856 and entered into partnership with them in 1861 (in the decorative arts firm later known as Morris &amp; Co.), but both business and personal relationships became strained; Rossetti was in love with Janey and he and Morris parted amid rancour in 1875. In his later years Rossetti became an eccentric recluse (he had a menagerie of unusual animals, including a wombat, the death of which occasioned a poem); he fought a losing battle against drugs and alcohol and he died paralysed and prematurely aged. Rossetti was nevertheless a commanding personality and his work was highly influential; his romantic medievalism inspired the second wave of Pre-Raphaelitism associated with Burne-Jones and other followers, and his <i>femmes fatales</i> appealed to the <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolists</span></a> and had a legion of descendants during the turn-of-the-century taste for ‘decadence’."

His work was highly sophisticated and varied in mood, ranging from the refined elegance of the <i>Marriage of the Virgin</i> (S. Lorenzo, Florence, 1523) to the violent energy of <i>Moses and the Daughters of Jethro</i> (Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1523) and to the disquieting intensity of the <i>Deposition</i> (Galleria Pittorica, Volterra, 1521). In 1523 Rosso left Florence for Rome, where he worked until the sack of 1527, and he then worked briefly in several Italian towns until 1530 when he was invited to France by Francis I. With <a href=""entry://Primaticcio, Francesco""><span class=""links"">Primaticcio </span></a> he was the most important artist to work on the decoration of the royal palace at Fontainebleau and one of the creators of the distinctive style of French Mannerism associated with the School of <a href=""entry://Fontainebleau, School of""><span class=""links"">Fontainebleau</span></a>. Rosso's principal work there is the Gallery of Francis I. Many engravings were made from his designs and his influence on French art was great. Vasari, whose biography of Rosso also includes an entertaining story about his pet baboon, says that he killed himself in remorse after falsely accusing a friend of stealing money from him, but this may well be apocryphal."
"Rosso, Medardo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Rosso, Medardo</b><div class=""content""><i>(1858&ndash;1928).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian sculptor. In his early career he was a painter, and was virtually self-taught as a sculptor&mdash;he was dismissed from the Brera Academy in Milan in 1883 after only a few months' training when he appealed for drawing to be taught from the live model rather than casts of statues. He went to Paris in 1884, where he worked in the studio of <a href=""entry://Dalou, Aimé-Jules""><span class=""links"">Dalou</span></a> and knew <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a>, and from 1889 he spent most of his career there. It is indeed with French rather than with Italian art that his work has affinity, for in reaction from the Italian <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> tradition of three-dimensional solidity, Rosso applied to sculpture the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> aesthetic by which atmospheric effects and transitory conditions of light break up the permanent identity of the object. He was essentially a modeller rather than a carver and he made subtle use of his preferred medium of wax to express his view that matter was malleable by atmosphere: ‘We are mere consequences of the objects which surround us.’ He also anticipated later trends by his occasional incorporation of real objects in a sculptural work. His subjects included portraits and single figures and groups in contemporary settings (<i>The Bookmaker</i>, MOMA, New York, 1894; <i>Conversation in a Garden</i>, Gal. Nazionale d'Arte Contemporanea, Rome, 1893).<br class=""nLine"" />At the turn of the century Rosso enjoyed an international reputation second only to that of Rodin. Then after a period of neglect he was ‘rediscovered’ by the <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurists</span></a>, who took over and developed many of his ideas. In his 1912 manifesto of Futurist sculpture <a href=""entry://Boccioni, Umberto""><span class=""links"">Boccioni </span></a> called him ‘the only great modern sculptor who has attempted to open up a larger field to sculpture, rendering plastically the influences of an ambiance and the atmospheric ties which bind it to the subject’. Today he is regarded as a sculptor of remarkable originality (not even Rodin challenged so decisively the traditional preoccupations of his art) and one of the precursors of the modern movement because of the emphasis he gave to the direct representation of visual experience and his realization that the ordinary and commonplace could have sculptural expressiveness. His output was fairly small; replicas of several of his works, together with a collection of his drawings, are in the Museo Medardo Rosso at Barzio in Italy."

His best works are generally considered to be his early Whistlerian paintings such as <i>The Doll's House</i> (Tate, London, 1899), which shows Augustus <a href=""entry://John, Augustus""><span class=""links"">John </span></a> and Rothenstein's wife as characters in a tense scene from Ibsen's play <i>A Doll's House</i>. From about 1898, however, he specialized in portraits of the celebrated and those who later became celebrated. In the latter part of his career he was much more renowned as a teacher than a painter. His outlook was conservative (he regarded pure abstraction as ‘a cardinal heresy’) and as Principal of the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a>, 1920&ndash;35, he exercised an influence second only to that of <a href=""entry://Tonks, Henry""><span class=""links"">Tonks</span></a> at the Slade School in earlier decades.

"Rothko, Mark","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Rothko, Mark</b><div class=""content""><i>(1903&ndash;70).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Russian-born American painter, one of the outstanding figures of <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a> and one of the creators of <a href=""entry://Colour Field painting""><span class=""links"">Colour Field painting</span></a>. He emigrated to the USA as a child in 1913. After dropping out of Yale University in 1923 he moved to New York and studied at the <a href=""entry://Art Students League of New York""><span class=""links"">Art Students League</span></a> under Max <a href=""entry://Weber, Max""><span class=""links"">Weber </span></a>, but he regarded himself as essentially self-taught as a painter. In the 1930s and 1940s he went through phases influenced by <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>, but from about 1947 he began to develop his mature and distinctive style. Typically his paintings feature large rectangular expanses of colour arranged parallel to each other, usually in a vertical format. The edges of these shapes are softly uneven, giving them a hazy, pulsating quality as if they were floating on the canvas. The paintings are often very large and the effect they produce is one of calmness and contemplation, but in spite of their tranquillity, they cost Rothko enormous emotional effort: ‘I'm not an abstract artist
I'm not interested in the relationship of colour or form or anything else. I'm interested only in expressing basic human emotions&mdash;tragedy, ecstasy, doom and so on. And the fact that a lot of people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures shows that I can communicate these basic human emotions
The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience as I had when I painted them.’<br class=""nLine"" />Rothko was poor for much of his career (from 1929 to 1959 he earned at least part of his living by teaching art), but his reputation grew in the 1950s and in 1961 he was given a major retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, that sealed his success. In spite of his soaring fame (and the money it brought), Rothko was plagued by depression. He had a prickly temperament, drank heavily, took barbiturates to excess, was fearful and suspicious of younger artists, had two unhappy marriages, and felt he was misunderstood (he disliked having his paintings discussed in <a href=""entry://formalism""><span class=""links"">formalist</span></a> terms). His early works had often been bright and vivid in colour, but from the 1950s they became increasingly sombre, typically employing blacks, browns, and maroon. He regarded his fourteen paintings for a non-denominational chapel in Houston, Texas (now known as the Rothko Chapel), 1967&ndash;9, as his masterpieces. His last paintings were a series of stark black on grey canvases that evoke his painful state of mind leading up to his suicide (he slashed his veins in his studio)."

<b>Rouault, Georges</b><div class=""content""><i>(1871&ndash;1958).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, graphic artist, and designer who created a personal kind of <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> that gives him a highly distinctive place in modern art. In his youth he was apprenticed in a stained-glass workshop, his work including the restoration of medieval glass; the vivid colours and strong outlines characteristic of the medium left a strong imprint on his work. In 1892 he became a fellow pupil of <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Marquet, Albert""><span class=""links"">Marquet </span></a> under Gustave <a href=""entry://Moreau, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Moreau </span></a> at the École des <a href=""entry://Beaux-Arts, École Nationale Supérieure des""><span class=""links"">Beaux-Arts</span></a>. He was Moreau's favourite pupil and in 1898 became the first curator of the Musée Moreau in Paris. At about the same time he underwent a psychological crisis and although he continued to associate with the group of artists around Matisse who were later known as <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauves</span></a>, he did not adopt their brilliant colour or characteristic subjects; instead he painted clowns, prostitutes, outcasts, and judges in sombre but glowing tones. These subjects expressed his hatred of cruelty, hypocrisy, and vice, depicting the ugliness and degradation of humanity with passionate conviction. Initially they disturbed the public, but during the 1930s he gained international popularity. From about 1940 he devoted himself almost exclusively to religious art. He was a prolific painter, and his work also included numerous book illustrations, ceramics, designs for tapestry and stained glass and for <a href=""entry://Diaghilev, Sergei""><span class=""links"">Diaghilev's </span></a> ballet <i>The Prodigal Son</i> (1929).

<b>Roubiliac, Louis-François</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1705&ndash;62).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> French-born sculptor, active in England for virtually his entire career. Little is known of his life before he settled in London in the early 1730s, although he is said to have trained under Balthasar <a href=""entry://Permoser, Balthasar""><span class=""links"">Permoser </span></a> in Saxony and Nicolas <a href=""entry://Coustou, Guillaume I""><span class=""links"">Coustou </span></a> in Paris. He made his reputation with a full-length seated statue of the composer Handel (V&amp;A, London, 1738), remarkable for its lively informality, and quickly became recognized as the most brilliant portrait sculptor of the day. His busts have great vivacity, stressing small forms and rippling movement in a manner very different from the broader treatment of his contemporary Michael <a href=""entry://Rysbrack, John Michael""><span class=""links"">Rysbrack </span></a>. He was especially successful with portraits of old and ugly men, and in his series of busts at Trinity College, Cambridge, and the celebrated statue of Newton (1755) there, he showed a remarkable gift for producing lively portraits of men long dead. Roubiliac was also outstanding as a tomb sculptor, several notable examples being in Westminster Abbey, including the marvellously dramatic tomb of Lady Elizabeth Nightingale (1761), who is shown being attacked with a spear by Death (a hideous skeleton emerging from a vault), while her husband vainly tries to keep him at bay (the skeleton was carved by Roubiliac 's assistant Nicholas Read, <i>c.</i>1733&ndash;87). The Nightingale monument clearly shows the influence of <a href=""entry://Bernini, Gianlorenzo""><span class=""links"">Bernini </span></a>, whose work so impressed Roubiliac when he visited Rome in 1752; he said that compared to Bernini's his own sculptures looked ‘meagre and starved, as if made of nothing but tobacco pipes’. Roubiliac is generally regarded as one of the greatest sculptors ever to work in England, certainly the greatest of his period. He had a vivid imagination, he was a superb craftsman, and, as Gerald Randall observes (<i>Church Furnishing and Decoration in England and Wales</i>, 1980), ‘Unlike even the best of his rivals, Roubiliac seems to have been incapable of indifferent work, and even his most modest commissions are designed and executed with a master's touch.’"

<b>Rousseau, Henri</b>
<i>(known as Le Douanier Rousseau )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1844&ndash;1910).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, the most celebrated of <a href=""entry://naïve art""><span class=""links"">naïve</span></a> artists. His nickname refers to the job he held with the Paris Customs Office (1871&ndash;93), although he never actually rose to the rank of ‘Douanier’ (Customs Officer). Before this he had served in the army, and he later claimed to have seen service in Mexico, but this story seems to be a product of his imagination. He began to paint as a hobby, self-taught, when he was about 40, and from 1886 he exhibited regularly at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> des Indépendants. In 1893 he took early retirement so he could devote himself to art. His character was extraordinarily ingenuous and he suffered much ridicule (although he sometimes interpreted sarcastic remarks literally and took them as praise) as well as enduring great poverty. However, his faith in his own abilities never wavered. He tried to paint in the academic manner of such traditionalist artists as <a href=""entry://Bouguereau, Adolphe-William""><span class=""links"">Bouguereau</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Gérôme, Jean-Léon""><span class=""links"">Gérôme</span></a>, but it was the innocence and charm of his work that won him the admiration of the avant-garde. He was ‘discovered’ by <a href=""entry://Vollard, Ambroise""><span class=""links"">Vollard</span></a> and members of his circle in about 1906&ndash;7, and in 1908 <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a> gave a banquet, half serious half burlesque, in his honour. Rousseau is now best known for his jungle scenes, the first of which was <i>Tiger in a Tropical Storm (Surprised</i>!) (NG, London, 1891) and the last <i>The Dream</i> (MOMA, New York, 1910). These two paintings are works of great imaginative power, in which he showed his extraordinary ability to retain the utter freshness of his vision even when working on a large scale and with loving attention to detail. He claimed such scenes were inspired by his experiences in Mexico, but in fact his sources were illustrated books and visits to the zoo and botanical gardens in Paris. His other work ranges from the jaunty humour of <i>The Football Players</i> (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1908) to the mesmeric, eerie beauty of <i>The Sleeping Gypsy</i> (MOMA, 1897). Rousseau was buried in a pauper's grave, but his greatness began to be widely acknowledged soon after his death."

He created an instantly recognizable gallery of social types, such as the old maid, the hack writer and the crabbed antiquarian, and his buxom wenches have their descendants in the fat ladies of today's saucy seaside postcards. His repertory of themes was inexhaustible and his <i>œuvre</i> has been termed the English equivalent of Balzac's <i>Comédie humaine</i>. He was a friend of George <a href=""entry://Morland, George""><span class=""links"">Morland </span></a> and travelled about England and also in France, Germany, and the Low Countries making rapid and brilliantly illuminating sketches of country life. In addition he produced series of illustrative drawings for publishers, notably <i>The Comforts of Bath</i> (1798) and the series on <i>The Tours of Dr Syntax</i> (1812&ndash;20). Rowlandson's output was huge, but it was only towards the end of his career that the quality of his work suffered because of overproduction."

<b>Royal Academy of Arts</b>, London.<div class=""content"">The national art <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">academy</span></a> of England, founded in 1768. Membership was limited to forty Academicians, who had to be artists by profession, and thirty-six were named in the Instrument of Foundation, signed by George III. Their motive in founding the Academy was to raise the status of their profession by establishing a sound system of training and expert judgement in the arts and to arrange for the free exhibition of works attaining an appropriate standard of excellence. Behind this conception was the desire to foster a national school of art and to encourage appreciation and interest in the public based on recognized canons of good taste. The <a href=""entry://Society of Artists""><span class=""links"">Society of Artists</span></a> was a forerunner in those aims.<br class=""nLine"" />The Royal Academy was first based in Pall Mall. Its annual summer exhibition, to which anyone can submit works, has been held every year since 1769 and the RA Schools have also existed from the beginning. The Academy transferred to Somerset House in 1780, shared with the <a href=""entry://National Gallery""><span class=""links"">National Gallery</span></a> its premises in Trafalgar Square 1837&ndash;69, and moved to the present site of Burlington House in 1869. The first President of the Academy was Sir Joshua <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a>, who held the office until his death in 1792. His famous <i>Discourses</i>, delivered over the period 1769&ndash;90, laid down the basic conception of the Academy as a body of professional men which, ‘besides furnishing able men to direct the student’, was to form ‘a repository for the great examples of the Art’. The latter function was important, since until the foundation of the National Gallery in 1824 there was no public collection of masterpieces available to students and schools. Although the most celebrated work owned by the Academy is a marble <a href=""entry://tondo""><span class=""links"">tondo</span></a> by <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> of the Virgin and Child with St John the Baptist (the Taddei Tondo, <i>c.</i>1505), the collections are chiefly important for their representation of work by Academicians, the custom being that each new Academician deposits a work (called a Diploma Work) on admission.<br class=""nLine"" />Regarding itself as the main repository of national tradition in the arts and the safeguard of sound standards of professional competence in execution, the Royal Academy, in common with other official establishments, has been cautious of innovation. During the latter decades of the 19th cent. the reputation of the Academy sank very low and it began to be regarded as the bulwark of orthodox mediocrity in opposition to creative and progressive art. The <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School and the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a> became more important as teaching institutions, and organizations, such as the <a href=""entry://New English Art Club""><span class=""links"">New English Art Club</span></a>, and later the <a href=""entry://London Group""><span class=""links"">London Group</span></a>, were formed to accommodate progressive trends. Since the presidency (1944&ndash;9) of <a href=""entry://Munnings, Sir Alfred""><span class=""links"">Munnings</span></a>, who was notorious for his opposition to modern art, its policy has become more liberal and the conflict between official ‘Academy’ art and creative art has narrowed.

His fairly undistinguished masters were three painters of Antwerp, Tobias <a href=""entry://Verhaecht, Tobias""><span class=""links"">Verhaecht </span></a>, Adam van <a href=""entry://Norrt, Adam van""><span class=""links"">Noort </span></a>, and Otto van <a href=""entry://Veen, Otto van""><span class=""links"">Veen </span></a>. The first two could teach him no more than the local tradition, but van Veen was a man of some culture, who had spent about five years in Rome, and he no doubt inspired his pupil with a desire to visit Italy. Rubens became a master in the Antwerp painters' guild in 1598, and after working with van Veen for two more years he set out for Italy in 1600. Very little of Rubens's early work survives, and his style was largely formed in Italy, where he was based until 1608. He worked for Vincenzo <a href=""entry://Gonzaga""><span class=""links"">Gonzaga </span></a>, Duke of Mantua, visiting most of the principal art centres of Italy to make copies for the ducal collection and also in 1603&ndash;4 travelling to Spain when he accompanied gifts from Vincenzo to Philip III. The most important centres of Rubens's activity in Italy, however, were Genoa and Rome. In Genoa he painted some stately aristocratic portraits (<i>Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria</i>, NG, Washington, 1606) that inspired van <a href=""entry://Dyck, Sir Anthony van""><span class=""links"">Dyck </span></a> when he worked in the city, and in Rome he found the basis of his own grandiose style in the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique, the</span></a> great masters of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, and Annibale <a href=""entry://Carracci""><span class=""links"">Carracci </span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />On learning that his mother was seriously ill, Rubens returned to Antwerp in 1608, but she died before he arrived. Italy had become Rubens's spiritual home (he usually signed himself ‘Pietro Pauolo’) and he considered returning for good, but his success in Antwerp was so immediate and great that he remained there, and in spite of his extensive travels later in his career he never saw Italy again. In 1609 Rubens was appointed court painter to the Archduke Albert and his wife the Infanta Isabella, the Spanish Viceroys in the Netherlands, and in the same year he married the 17-year-old Isabella Brant, the daughter of an eminent Antwerp lawyer. The portrait of himself and his wife (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) that he painted presumably to mark the occasion gives a marvellous picture of Rubens on the threshold of his great career&mdash;handsome, vigorous, and dashingly self-confident. In the next few years he established his reputation as the pre-eminent painter in northern Europe, his first two resounding successes being the huge <a href=""entry://triptych""><span class=""links"">triptychs</span></a> of the <i>Raising of the Cross</i> and the <i>Descent from the Cross</i> (Antwerp Cathedral, 1610&ndash;11 and 1611&ndash;14), which showed his mastery of history painting in the <i><a href=""entry://Grand Manner""><span class=""links"">Grand Manner</i></a></span> and the immense vigour of his style.<br class=""nLine"" />The demand for Rubens's work was extraordinary, and he was able to meet it only because he ran an extremely efficient studio. It is not known how many pupils or assistants he had because as court painter he was exempt from registering them with the guild. The idea of his running a sort of picture factory has been exaggerated, but even a man of his seemingly inexhaustible intellectual and physical stamina (he habitually rose at 4 a.m.) could not carry out all the work involved in his massive output with his own hands. Rubens both collaborated with established artists (‘Velvet’ <a href=""entry://Brueghel, Jan""><span class=""links"">Brueghel </span></a>, van Dyck, <a href=""entry://Jordaens, Jacob""><span class=""links"">Jordaens </span></a>, Daniel <a href=""entry://Seghers, Daniel""><span class=""links"">Seghers </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Snyders, Frans""><span class=""links"">Snyders </span></a>, and others) and retouched pictures by pupils, the degree of his intervention being reflected in the price. Generally his assistants did much of the work between the initial oil sketch and the master's finishing touches. Modern taste has tended to admire these sketches and his drawings (in which his personal touch is evident in every stroke of brush, chalk, or pen) more than the large-scale works, but Rubens himself would surely have found this attitude hard to comprehend, for the sheer scale and grandeur of the finished paintings gives them an extra, symphonic dimension.<br class=""nLine"" />Rubens not only painted virtually every type of subject, but also designed tapestries, book illustrations, and decorations of festivals, as well as giving visual directives for sculptors, metalworkers, and architects. ‘My talents are such’, he wrote in 1621, ‘that I have never lacked courage to undertake any design, however vast in size or diversified in subject.’ So huge was his output, indeed, that it is difficult to put a figure on it; the <i>Corpus Rubenianum</i>, the first attempt in the 20th cent. at a complete scholarly catalogue of his work, began publication in 1968 and is expected to fill about thirty volumes. His biggest commission in Flanders was for the decoration of the Jesuit Church in Antwerp (a building he may also have had a hand in designing), but almost all his work there was destroyed by fire in 1718. From outside Flanders, those who sought his services included the royal families of France, England, and Spain. For Marie de' <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Médicis</span></a> (mother of Louis XIII of France) he did a series of twenty-five enormous paintings on her life (Louvre, Paris, 1622&ndash;5); for Charles I of England he painted a series of canvases representing the reign of his father James I (completed 1635) for the ceiling of the Banqueting House in London (the only one of his major decorative schemes still in the position for which it was painted); and for Philip IV of Spain he embarked in 1636 on a series of more than a hundred mythological pictures for his hunting lodge, the Torre de la Parada (the series was incomplete when Rubens died and most of the finished paintings&mdash;executed by assistants from his <i><a href=""entry://modello""><span class=""links"">modelli</i></a></span>&mdash;were destroyed in 1710 when the building was sacked during the War of the Spanish Succession).<br class=""nLine"" />After the death of the Archduke Albert in 1621, Rubens became a trusted adviser to the Infanta Isabella, and he was employed in negotiations to try to gain peace in the Netherlands. In 1628&ndash;9 Isabella sent him on a diplomatic mission to Spain (where he met <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez</span></a>) and this led to him going to England on behalf of the Spanish King, Philip IV, in 1629&ndash;30. He played an important part in the arrangement of a peace settlement between England and Spain, and Charles I knighted him. In his diplomatic role his polished manners and his prodigious linguistic skills were put to good advantage&mdash;apart from Flemish and Italian, he knew French, German, Latin, and Spanish. Rubens's wife died in 1626 and in 1630 he remarried; his bride was the 16-year-old Hélène Fourment, daughter of a rich silk merchant and the niece of his first wife. The second marriage was as happy as the first, and Rubens's love of his family shines through many of his late paintings (<i>Hélène Fourment with Two of her Children</i>, Louvre, <i>c.</i>1637). In 1635 he bought a country house, the Château de Steen, between Brussels and Malines, and in his final years he developed a new passion for painting landscapes&mdash;marvellously ripe works that led <a href=""entry://Constable, John""><span class=""links"">Constable</span></a> to declare ‘In no branch of the art is Rubens greater than in landscape.’ Superb examples are in the National Gallery and the Wallace Collection, London.<br class=""nLine"" />Rubens's influence in 17th-cent. Flanders was overwhelming, and it was spread elsewhere in Europe by his journeys abroad and by pictures exported from his workshop, and also through the numerous engravings he commissioned of his work. In later centuries, his influence has also been immense, perhaps most noticeably in France, where <a href=""entry://Watteau, Jean-Antoine""><span class=""links"">Watteau </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir </span></a> were among his greatest admirers. Because of the unrivalled variety of his work, artists as different in temperament as these three could respond to it with equal enthusiasm."
"Rublev, Andrei","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Rublev, Andrei</b><div class=""content""><i>(1360?&ndash;1430).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The most famous of Russian <a href=""entry://icon""><span class=""links"">icon</span></a> painters. The 600th anniversary of his birth was celebrated by Soviet Russia in 1960, but there is some evidence that he may have been born a decade later and there is little secure knowledge of his life or works. In 1405 he worked as assistant to <a href=""entry://Theophanes the Greek""><span class=""links"">Theophanes</span></a> in the Cathedral of the Annunciation in the Kremlin at Moscow, but it has not been possible to distinguish his share there or in the Cathedral of the Dormition at Vladimir, where he is also said to have painted murals. The work that stands at the centre of his <i>œuvre</i> is the celebrated icon of the Old Testament Trinity (that is, the three angels who appeared to Abraham) in the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow (<i>c.</i>1411). In its gentle lyrical beauty this marks a move away from the hieratic <a href=""entry://Byzantine art""><span class=""links"">Byzantine </span></a> tradition, and other icons in a similar style have been attributed to Rublev."
"Rude, François","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Rude, François</b><div class=""content""><i>(1784&ndash;1855).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> sculptor. He was a fervent admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte and his emotionally charged work expresses the martial spirit of the Napoleonic era more fully than that of any other sculptor. In 1812 he won the <a href=""entry://Prix de Rome""><span class=""links"">Prix de Rome</span></a>, but he was unable to take it up because of the Napoleonic Wars, and when Napoleon abdicated in 1814 he went into exile in Brussels with <a href=""entry://David, Jacques-Louis""><span class=""links"">David</span></a>. On his return to Paris in 1827 he became highly successful with public monuments, most notably his celebrated high <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> on the Arc de Triomphe, <i>Departure of the Volunteers in</i> 1792, popularly known as <i>The Marseillaise</i> (1833&ndash;6). None of Rude's other works matches the fire, dynamism, and heroic bravura of this glorification of the French Revolution, but he created another strikingly original work in his monument <i>The Awakening of Napoleon</i> (1845&ndash;7) in a park at Fixin, near his native Dijon, which shows the emperor casting off his shroud. In spite of the dramatic movement of his work, it always has a solidity that reveals his classical training and his lifelong admiration of the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a>."
"Ruisdael, Jacob van","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ruisdael, Jacob van</b><div class=""content""><i>(1628/9&ndash;82).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The greatest and most versatile of all Dutch landscape painters. He was born in Haarlem, where he probably received training from his father <i>Isaac</i>, who was a painter as well as a frame-maker and picture-dealer (no works by him are known to survive). His uncle Salomon van <a href=""entry://Ruysdael, Salomon van""><span class=""links"">Ruysdael </span></a> (this distinction in spelling occurs consistently in their own signatures) presumably also played a part in his artistic education. Ruisdael was extremely precocious, however; his earliest known paintings date from 1646 and already reveal a mature and distinctive artistic personality. He was also versatile and prolific (about 700 paintings are reasonably attributed to him); he painted forests, grain fields, beaches and seascapes, watermills and windmills, winter landscapes and Scandinavian torrents influenced by Allart van <a href=""entry://Everdingen, Allart van""><span class=""links"">Everdingen </span></a>; he could conjure poetry from a virtually featureless patch of duneland as well as from a magnificent panoramic view. Even more than his range, however, it is the emotional force of his work that distinguishes him from his contemporaries. He moved away decisively from the ‘tonal’ phase of Dutch landscape represented by his uncle; in place of subtle atmospheric effects he favoured strong forms and dense colours and his brushwork is vigorous and <a href=""entry://impasto""><span class=""links"">impasted</span></a>. His emotional, subjective approach found its most memorable expression in <i>The Jewish Cemetery</i> (versions in the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Gemäldegalerie in Dresden, <i>c.</i>1660), where tombstones and elegiac ruins, symbols of man's transitory and ephemeral existence, are contrasted with nature's power of renewal.<br class=""nLine"" />Ruisdael travelled to the Dutch/German border with his friend Nicolaes <a href=""entry://Berchem, Nicolaes""><span class=""links"">Berchem </span></a> in the early 1650s, and one of the pictures that resulted was the celebrated <i>Bentheim Castle</i> (Beit Coll., Blessington, Ireland, 1653), in which the castle heroically crowns the top of a steep, rugged hill, transformed by Ruisdael's imagination from the mild slope it is in actuality. In about 1656 he moved to Amsterdam, where he lived for the rest of his life (although he was buried in St Bavo's Cathedral in Haarlem). He evidently had a reasonably prosperous career, but little is known about his life and it was long thought he had died insane in the workhouse at Haarlem, a fate that is now known to have befallen his cousin and near-name-sake Jacob van <a href=""entry://Ruysdael, Salomon van""><span class=""links"">Ruysdael </span></a>. There is still uncertainty, however, concerning the story, reported by <a href=""entry://Houbraken, Arnold""><span class=""links"">Houbraken</span></a> and supported by other tantalizing evidence, that Ruisdael practised as a surgeon. It seems unlikely that he could have found the time for this (he is said to have taken a medical degree at Caen in Normandy in 1676, when he was in his late 40s), but other prolific Dutch painters, for example <a href=""entry://Steen, Jan""><span class=""links"">Steen</span></a> (who ran a tavern), managed to pursue two careers. Ruisdael's only documented pupil was <a href=""entry://Hobbema, Meindert""><span class=""links"">Hobbema</span></a>, but his influence was resounding, both on his Dutch contemporaries and on artists in other countries in the following two centuries&mdash;<a href=""entry://Gainsborough, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Gainsborough</span></a>, *Constable, and the <a href=""entry://Barbizon School""><span class=""links"">Barbizon School</span></a> for example.

Scottish painters, brothers, who painted religious, literary, and historical subjects in a proto-<a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> manner. John, the more brilliantly gifted, died young during a sojourn by both brothers in Italy. His masterpiece, <i>King Lear in the Storm</i> (NG, Edinburgh, 1767), has freshness and originality, with nothing of the staginess of most 18th-cent. Shakespearian pictures. Alexander's major work, the decoration of Penicuik House near Edinburgh with romantically treated subjects from Ossian and the history of Scotland, ranked with <a href=""entry://Barry, James""><span class=""links"">Barry's </span></a> paintings in the Society of Arts as the most ambitious British decorative scheme of the time, but it was destroyed by fire in 1899.

"Runge, Philipp Otto","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Runge, Philipp Otto</b><div class=""content""><i>(1777&ndash;1810).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German painter and draughtsman. Although he made a late start to his career and died young, he ranks second only to <a href=""entry://Friedrich, Caspar David""><span class=""links"">Friedrich</span></a> among German <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> artists. He studied under Jens <a href=""entry://Juel, Jens""><span class=""links"">Juel </span></a> at the Copenhagen Academy (1799&ndash;1801), then moved to Dresden, where he knew Friedrich. In 1803 he settled in Hamburg. Runge was of a mystical, pantheistic turn of mind and in his work he tried to express notions of the harmony of the universe through symbolism of colour, form, and numbers. To this end he planned a series of four paintings called <i>The Times of the Day</i>, designed to be seen in a special building and viewed to the accompaniment of music and poetry. He painted two versions of <i>Morning</i> (Kunsthalle, Hamburg, 1808 and 1809), but the others did not advance beyond drawings. Runge was also one of the best German portraitists of his period; several examples are in Hamburg. His style was rigid, sharp, and intense, at times almost <a href=""entry://naïve art""><span class=""links"">naïve</span></a>. In 1810 he published <i>Die Farbenkugel</i> (The Colour Sphere) after doing several years of research on colour, during which he corresponded with <a href=""entry://Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von""><span class=""links"">Goethe </span></a>."

His father was a ship's carpenter and Rush worked mainly in wood, progressing from ships' figureheads to free-standing figures, such as the <i>Nymph of the Schuylkill</i> (1812), a work which almost perished through exposure to the elements in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, and was preserved only when it was belatedly cast in bronze. His work is vigorous and naturalistic and he marks the transition from the unselfconscious folk carver to the professional artist. He was one of the prime movers in the foundation of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, which has many examples of his work. Thomas <a href=""entry://Eakins, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Eakins </span></a>, another native of Philadelphia, greatly admired Rush's work."
"Ruskin, John","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ruskin, John</b><div class=""content""><i>(1819&ndash;1900).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The most influential English art critic of his time, also a talented watercolourist. His output of writing was enormous and he had a remarkable hold over public opinion, as he showed when he successfully defended the <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelites</span></a> against the savage attacks to which they were being subjected. He was the son of a wealthy wine merchant and his artistic education was gained through frequent travel in Britain and on the Continent. Ruskin belonged to the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> School in his conception of the artist as an inspired prophet and teacher. He advocated a revival of the <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> style, his rejection of the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> tradition following from his assumption that art and architecture should mirror man's wonder and delight before the visual creation of God and that this demanded a freely inspired and <a href=""entry://naturalism""><span class=""links"">naturalistic</span></a> style to which he felt that Gothic alone was really suited. Although his worship of beauty for its own sake brought him into affinity with the advocates of ‘art for art's sake’ (see <a href=""entry://Aestheticism""><span class=""links"">AESTHETICISM</span></a>), his strong interest in social reform and ever-increasing concern with economic and political questions during the second half of his life (he used much of his large inheritance for philanthropic work) kept him from accepting a doctrine of the autonomy of the arts in divorce from questions of social morality. His eloquence in linking art with the daily life of the workman had affinities with the views of William <a href=""entry://Morris, William""><span class=""links"">Morris </span></a> and his insistence on regarding the state of the arts as a ‘visible sign of national virtue’ and his constant emphasis on their moral function have sometimes been regarded as a conspicuous instance of the ‘moral fallacy’ in aesthetics and criticism. He set himself obstinately and short-sightedly against the effects of the Industrial Revolution in supplanting the older craftsmanship and opposed all efforts to raise the standard of design in industry and to institute schools for the application of good principles of design to mass-production.<br class=""nLine"" />Ruskin's personal life was deeply unhappy. His marriage was annulled in 1854 on the grounds of non-consummation (his ex-wife married <a href=""entry://Millais, Sir John Everett""><span class=""links"">Millais</span></a> in the following year) and in middle and old age he made many young girls the objects of his unhealthy affection. He proposed to one of them, the 18-year-old Rose La Touche, in 1866, but was refused; she died mad in 1875. In 1878 he lost a famous libel case against <a href=""entry://Whistler, James Abbott McNeill""><span class=""links"">Whistler </span></a>, whom he had accused of ‘flinging a pot of paint in the public face’, and soon after showed the first signs of the mental illness that made his final years wretched. After 1889, living in isolation in the Lake District, where he was cared for by his cousin, John Severn, Ruskin wrote nothing and rarely spoke.<br class=""nLine"" />Ruskin's complete works were edited in thirty-nine volumes (1903&ndash;12). His most important works of art criticism are: <i>Modern Painters</i> (5 vols., 1843&ndash;60, epilogue 1888), which began as a defence of <a href=""entry://Turner, J. M. W.""><span class=""links"">Turner </span></a> and expanded into a general survey of art; <i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</i> (1849); and <i>The Stones of Venice</i> (3 vols., 1851&ndash;3). He is accorded a distinguished place amongst English prose writers of the 19th cent., and his finest flights of rhetoric, such as his descriptions of the <a href=""entry://Tintoretto ""><span class=""links"">Tintorettos</span></a> in the Scuola di San Rocco in Venice, are classics of their kind."

By 1910 he was devoting himself increasingly to painting, and in 1911 he met Macdonald-Wright, with whom he developed theories about the analogies between colours and musical patterns. In 1913 they launched Synchromism, and Russell's <i>Synchromy in Orange: To Form</i> (Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, 1913&ndash;14) won him considerable renown in Paris. His later work, in which he reintroduced figurative elements, was much less memorable than were his pioneering abstract paintings. He lived in Paris until 1946, then returned to the USA."

<b>Russolo, Luigi</b><div class=""content""><i>(1885&ndash;1947).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter and musician. He was one of the signatories of the <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurist</span></a> painters' manifestos in 1910, but he is remembered mainly as ‘the most spectacular innovator among the Futurist musicians (<i>New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</i>, 1980). In 1913 he published a manifesto, of <i>L'arte dei Rumari (The Art of Noises</i>, expanded in book form in 1916), and later in the same year he demonstrated the first of a series of <i>intonarumori</i> (‘noise-makers’), which produced a startling range of sounds. In 1913&ndash;14, he gave noise concerts in Milan (causing a riot), Genoa, and London. Others followed after the First World War. Several leading composers, notably Ravel and Stravinsky, thought they opened up interesting possibilities, and Russolo has been regarded as a pioneer of today's electronic music. Unfortunately his compositions and machines have been destroyed. As a painter Russolo made rather crude use of the Futurist device of ‘lines of force’ in his early work; after the war his style became more naturalistic."

<b>Ruysdael, Salomon van</b><div class=""content""><i>(1600/3?&ndash;70).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch landscape painter, active in his native Haarlem, where he became a member of the painters' guild in 1623. His earliest works show the influence of Esaias van de <a href=""entry://Velde, Esaias van de""><span class=""links"">Velde</span></a> and in the 1630s he was so close in style to Jan van <a href=""entry://Goyen, Jan van""><span class=""links"">Goyen </span></a> that it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between the work of the two artists. They both excelled in atmospheric, virtually monochromatic river scenes and are the leading masters of this type of picture. In the 1640s his landscapes became somewhat more solid and colourful, perhaps reflecting influence from his nephew, Jacob van <a href=""entry://Ruisdael, Jacob van""><span class=""links"">Ruisdael </span></a>. Late in his career he occasionally painted still lifes. He was immensely prolific and many galleries have examples of his work. His son <i>Jacob Salomonsz. van Ruysdael </i> (1629/30&ndash;81) was also a landscape painter. An example of his rare work is <i>A Waterfall by a Cottage</i> (NG, London), which shows he worked in a style similar to that of his illustrious cousin and near-namesake, with whom he has sometimes been confused in documentary references."
"Ryder, Albert Pinkham","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ryder, Albert Pinkham</b><div class=""content""><i>(1847&ndash;1917).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter of imaginative subjects. He lived and worked most of his life as a solitary and dreamer in New York, and his methods and approach were largely self-taught. His pictures reflect a rich inner life, with a haunting love of the sea (he was born at the fishing port of New Bedford, Mass.) and a constant search to express the ineffable: ‘Have you ever seen an inch worm crawl up a leaf or twig, and then clinging to the very end, revolve in the air, feeling for something to reach something? That's like me. I am trying to find something out there beyond the place on which I have a footing.’ This imaginative quality and eloquent expression of the mysteriousness of things is expressed typically through boldly simplified forms and eerie lighting (<i>The Race Track</i> or <i>Death on a Pale Horse</i>, Cleveland Museum of Art). In spite of his self-imposed isolation Ryder's works became well known in his lifetime and he has been much imitated and faked. His own paintings have often deteriorated because of unorthodox technical procedures. He was greatly admired by Jackson <a href=""entry://Pollock, Jackson""><span class=""links"">Pollock </span></a>."

<b>Rysbrack, John Michael</b><div class=""content""><i>(1694&ndash;1770).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish-born sculptor, a member of an Antwerp family of artists, who settled in England about 1720. He soon achieved success and in the 1730s was the leading sculptor in the country. The highpoint of his career was winning the commission for the monument to William III in Queen Square, Bristol (1735), in preference to <a href=""entry://Scheemakers, Peter""><span class=""links"">Scheemakers</span></a>. This is generally regarded as the finest equestrian statue made in England in the 18th cent. However, from about 1740 (the year of Scheemakers's acclaimed Shakespeare monument in Westminster Abbey), Rysbrack began to lose ground to Scheemakers and also to <a href=""entry://Roubiliac, Louis-François""><span class=""links"">Roubiliac</span></a>. He was a versatile and prolific artist, hard-working and popular. His output included tombs, statues, and portraits (often in the form of busts in the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> manner, a fashion he introduced to England), and he also made architectural elements such as chimneypieces. His style was vigorous and dignified, less sombre than that of Scheemakers. He did not match the brilliant vivacity that characterizes Roubiliac's work, but he could sometimes rival him in beauty of handling. Rysbrack's best-known work is perhaps the monument to Sir Isaac Newton (designed by <a href=""entry://Kent, William""><span class=""links"">Kent </span></a>) in Westminster Abbey (1731), with its eloquent reclining figure of the great scientist."

Sacchi's ideas were more immediately influential, but his ponderous ceiling fresco of <i>Divine Wisdom</i> (1629&ndash;33) in the Palazzo Barberini in Rome is completely outshone by Cortona 's exhilarating ceiling of the Gran Salone in the same building. Sacchi, indeed, was at his best on a much smaller scale&mdash;in altarpieces such as the grave, introspective <i>Vision of St Romuald</i> (Vatican, <i>c.</i>1631) and in portraits. His most important pupil was <a href=""entry://Maratta ""><span class=""links"">Maratta </span></a>.

<b>Saint-Gaudens, Augustus</b><div class=""content""><i>(1848&ndash;1907).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The leading American sculptor of his period. Born in Dublin of a French father and an Irish mother, Saint-Gaudens was brought to America in infancy. He began his career as a <a href=""entry://cameo""><span class=""links"">cameo</span></a>-cutter in New York, then studied for three years in Paris (1867&ndash;70) and three in Rome (1870&ndash;3), returning to America in 1874. His first important commission was the <i>Admiral Farragut Monument</i> (1878&ndash;81) in Madison Square Park, New York, and following its successful reception he quickly achieved a leading reputation among American sculptors and retained this throughout his life. Saint-Gaudens was an energetic artist and he produced a large amount of work in spite of the high standards of craftsmanship he set himself. His preferred material was bronze and he excelled particularly at memorials. Although his style is generally warmly naturalistic, his most celebrated work, the Adams Memorial (1891) in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington, is a powerful allegorical figure. It is a monument to a wife of a friend of Saint-Gaudens who had committed suicide, and the mysterious female figure, swathed in magnificent voluminous draperies, has been interpreted as ‘Grief’, although the sculptor himself saw the elegiac work as embodying ‘the Peace of God’. Saint-Gaudens was a highly important figure in the development of American sculpture; he turned the tide against <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neo-classicism</span></a> and made Paris, rather than Rome, the artistic mecca of his countrymen."

Their frequency was originally somewhat irregular (though with stretches when they were held annually or biennially); from 1849 they were annual. The jury system of selection was introduced in 1748. As these were the only public exhibitions in Paris the official academic art obtained through them a stranglehold on publicity, and in the 19th cent. a number of rival Salons were organized by progressive artists. In 1881 the government withdrew official sponsorship and a group of artists organized the Société des Artistes Français to take responsibility for the show with a jury elected from each previous year's exhibitors.

<b>Sansovino, Andrea</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1467/70&ndash;1529).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian sculptor and architect, named after his birthplace near Monte San Savino, his real name being Contucci. He called himself a Florentine, but although Florence contains much of his sculpture his fame rests on what he did elsewhere, notably in Rome, where the companion tombs of Cardinals Sforza and Basso (Sta Maria del Popolo, between 1505 and 1509) and the group of <i>The Virgin and Child with St Anne</i> (S. Agostino, 1512) display classical grace combined with human tenderness. Sansovino spent much of the period 1513&ndash;27 in Loreto in charge of the sculpture (and for part of the time the architecture also) of the shrine of the Holy House, originally designed by <a href=""entry://Bramante, Donato""><span class=""links"">Bramante </span></a>. <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> says that Andrea also worked in Portugal, but his statement is doubted by some scholars.

<b>Sansovino, Jacopo</b>
<i>(Jacopo Tatti )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1486&ndash;1570).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine sculptor and architect, active mainly in Venice. He trained under Andrea <a href=""entry://Sansovino, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Sansovino </span></a>, whose name he adopted as a sign of his admiration. In 1505/6 he followed Andrea to Rome, where he moved in the circle of <a href=""entry://Bramante, Donato""><span class=""links"">Bramante </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> and worked on the restoration of ancient sculpture. From 1511 to 1517 he was again in Florence, where he shared a studio with <a href=""entry://Andrea del Sarto ""><span class=""links"">Andrea del Sarto </span></a>, and he then returned to Rome until the Sack of 1527, when he moved to Venice. There he was appointed state architect (1529), formed a close friendship with <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a> and became a dominant figure in the art establishment. Sansovino played a major role in introducing the High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> style to Venice in both architecture and sculpture, and his sculptures are often important decorative elements of his buildings. His most celebrated work, one of Venice's most familiar sights, is the glorious Library of San Marco (begun 1537). As a sculptor he is best known for the colossal figures of <i>Mars</i> and <i>Neptune</i> (commissioned 1554) on the staircase of the Doges' Palace. Sansovino's sculptural style was firmly rooted in his study of antiquity, but it was in no way academic and possessed great vitality. He studied assiduously from the life as well as from the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a>, and legend has it that the model for his <i>Bacchus</i> (Bargello, Florence, 1511&ndash;12) went mad through being made to pose for hours on end with his arm raised and one day was found in this position standing naked on top of a chimney. Sansovino's son <i>Francesco</i> (1521&ndash;86) was a scholar of diversified interests. His <i>Venetia città nobilissima</i> (Venice, most noble city), published in 1581, is an important source-book&mdash;the first attempt to give a systematic account of a city's artistic heritage."
"Santi, Giovanni","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Santi, Giovanni</b><div class=""content""><i>(d. 1494).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, the father of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>, active mainly in Urbino, where he worked for the court. He was ‘a mediocre painter but an intelligent man’ (<a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>) and no doubt gave his illustrious son his introduction to humanist culture. Santi is now remembered less for his paintings than for his verse chronicle in twenty-three books recounting the exploits of the dukes of Urbino, which he dedicated to the young Duke Guidobaldo da <a href=""entry://Montefeltro""><span class=""links"">Montefeltro </span></a>. This work is interesting to the art historian because it includes incidental comments on the reputations of contemporary artists. Santi's house in Urbino is now a museum&mdash;the Casa di Raffaello. It contains a small fresco of the Virgin and Child that some authorities consider to be Santi's portrayal of Raphael and his mother, and others claim as a very early work by Raphael himself."
"Saraceni, Carlo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Saraceni, Carlo</b><div class=""content""><i>(1579&ndash;1620).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter. He was born and died in Venice but spent almost all his career in Rome. There he formed his style under the influence of <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Elsheimer, Adam""><span class=""links"">Elsheimer</span></a>, painting small luminous pictures of figures in landscapes as well as much larger altarpieces, including the replacement for Caravaggio's <i>Death of the Virgin</i> (Louvre, Paris), which the church of Sta Maria della Scala had rejected in 1606. Saraceni's picture is still <i>in situ</i>. He painted several other smaller variants or versions of the picture, so the design was evidently popular. His style was sensitive and poetic, showing a delicate feeling for colour and tone. His liking for turbans, tasselled fringes, and stringy drapery folds, and his richly <a href=""entry://impasto""><span class=""links"">impasted</span></a> paint may have influenced Dutch artists in Rome such as <a href=""entry://Lastman, Pieter""><span class=""links"">Lastman</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Pynas, Jan""><span class=""links"">Pynas</span></a>, and through them <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt</span></a>. He also possibly had some influence in Lorraine, through his pupil, the French Caravaggesque painter Jean Le Clerc (<i>c.</i>1587&ndash;1633). Le Clerc was also an engraver; his prints include one of his master's <i>Death of the Virgin</i> (after a small version on copper, now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, rather than the large altarpiece in Rome)."
"Sargent, John Singer","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Sargent, John Singer</b><div class=""content""><i>(1856&ndash;1925).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, chiefly famous as the outstanding society portraitist of his time: <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a> called him ‘the van <a href=""entry://Dyck, Sir Anthony van""><span class=""links"">Dyck </span></a> of our times’. He was born in Florence, the son of wealthy parents, and he had an international upbringing and career&mdash;indeed, he has been described as ‘an American born in Italy, educated in France, who looks like a German, speaks like an Englishman, and paints like a Spaniard’ (William Starkweather, ‘The Art of John S. Sargent ’, <i>Mentor</i>, October 1924). His ‘Spanishness’ refers to his deep admiration for <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez</span></a>, for although he was encouraged to paint directly by his teacher <a href=""entry://Carolus-Duran, Charles""><span class=""links"">Carolus-Duran </span></a> in Paris (1874&ndash;6), the virtuoso handling of paint that characterized his style derived more particularly from Old Masters such as Velázquez and <a href=""entry://Hals, Frans""><span class=""links"">Hals </span></a> (he visited Madrid and Haarlem to study their work in 1879&ndash;80). In 1884 he became famous when his portrait of Madame Gautreau (Met. Mus., New York) caused a sensation at the Paris <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> because of what was felt to be its provocatively erotic character. It was exhibited as <i>Madame X</i>, but the sitter, a society beauty of strikingly unconventional looks, was unmistakable, and her mother wrote to Sargent imploring him to withdraw the picture, which she said had made her daughter a laughing-stock. The scandal persuaded Sargent to move to London, and he remained based there for the rest of his life; he continued to travel extensively, however, and often visited America. The lavish elegance of his work brought him unrivalled success, and his portraits of the wealthy and privileged convey with brilliant bravura the glamour and opulence of high society life. Even in his lifetime he was deprecated by critics and artists (who no doubt found it easy to be jealous of his success) for superficiality of characterization, but although psychological penetration was certainly not his strength, he was admirably varied in his response to each sitter's individuality. As with many successful portraitists, Sargent's heart lay elsewhere (he called portraiture ‘a pimp's profession’), and after about 1907 he took few commissions. Despite his sophistication and charm and the entrée to high society that his success gave him, he was a very private person, who never married and led a quiet life. He loved painting landscape watercolours, showing a technique as dashing in this medium as in his oil paintings, and from the 1890s he devoted much of his energies to ambitious allegorical murals in the Public Library and Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (as models for the <i>Danaides</i> in one of these he used dancing girls from the chorus line of the Ziegfeld Follies). The most unexpected side to his talents is revealed in the enormous <i>Gassed</i> (Imperial War Mus., London, 1918), which he painted as an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a>. It has remarkable tragic power and is one of the greatest pictures inspired by the First World War. Sargent's reputation plummeted after his death but has soared again since the 1970s."
"Sarrazin, Jacques","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Sarrazin, Jacques</b><div class=""content""><i>(1588&ndash;1660).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The leading French sculptor of the mid-17th cent.

On his return to Paris he established himself as head of his profession, running an important workshop through which passed many of the leading sculptors of the following generation (those who worked at Versailles). Much of Sarrazin's best work was done as architectural decoration, the finest example being his <a href=""entry://caryatid""><span class=""links"">caryatids</span></a> (1641) on the Pavillon de l'Horloge at the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a>. Sarrazin also supervised the decoration (1652&ndash;60) of the Château de Maisons, the masterpiece of François Mansart, the greatest French architect of the 17th cent. Although it does not rank on the same level, Sarrazin's dignified work forms a kind of sculptural parallel to the architecture of Mansart or the paintings of <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>."

His work continues Sienese tradition in its beautiful colouring and elegant line, but he was also influenced by the <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a> style and by contemporary Florentine developments, combining them into a highly personal manner expressive of his mystical imagination. His most important work was the St Francis altarpiece (1437&ndash;44) painted for the church of S. Francesco at Borgo San Sepolcro and now dispersed. The central panel, <i>St Francis in Ecstasy</i> (Berenson Coll., Florence), has a monumental dignity that must have impressed <a href=""entry://Piero della Francesca ""><span class=""links"">Piero della Francesca </span></a> (a native of Borgo), and some of the other panels (seven are in the National Gallery, London) show him at his most lyrical."

He did some portraits, but specialized in religious works painted in an extremely sweet, almost <a href=""entry://Perugino, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Peruginesque</span></a> style.

Little is known of his life (in the 18th cent. it was evidently generally believed he was a contemporary of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>) and few of his pictures are dated or datable; they seem to have been in great demand, however, as his compositions often exist in numerous very similar versions. Most of them were presumably done for private collectors, as few are in churches. Examples of his work are in many galleries (for example, the National Gallery and Wallace Coll., London), and a fine collection of his drawings (virtually his entire surviving output as a draughtsman) is in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle."

After his return to Spain, however, Saura quickly abandoned Surrealism and worked in a semi-abstract <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">expressionist</span></a> vein, his powerful, stormy, and thickly textured figures creating a feeling of tortured humanity (<i>Great Crucifixion</i>, Boymans Mus., Rotterdam, 1963).

"Savery, Roelandt","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Savery, Roelandt</b><div class=""content""><i>(1576?&ndash;1639).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish painter and etcher of landscapes, animal subjects, and still life, the best-known member of a family of artists. He was born in Cambrai, grew up in Amsterdam, and in 1619 settled in Utrecht, but he is best known for his association with Prague, where he worked for the emperor Rudolf II from 1603 to 1613. Rudolf's famous menagerie allowed him to study in detail the exotic animals that became the trademark of his work. He painted and drew creatures such as pelicans, ostriches, camels, and the now extinct dodo, and was one of the first artists in the Netherlands to do pictures of animals alone. His favourite subjects, however, were Orpheus and the Garden of Eden, which allowed him to include any number of colourful beasts. Savery's bright and highly finished style is similar to that of Jan ‘Velvet’ <a href=""entry://Brueghel, Jan""><span class=""links"">Brueghel</span></a>, but is somewhat more archaic. His rare flower paintings are sometimes of outstanding quality, and with <a href=""entry://Bosschaert, Ambrosius""><span class=""links"">Bosschaert</span></a> he was an influential Flemish exponent of this genre in Holland. <a href=""entry://Houbraken, Arnold""><span class=""links"">Houbraken </span></a> says that Savery died insane."

His output was small and his career is said to have been unsuccessful, but he is now remembered as a highly attractive minor master whose work stands somewhat apart from the main Venetian tradition. His forté was night scenes, in which he gave his lyrical sensibility and liking for unusual light effects full play. One of the best-known examples is <i>Mary Magdalen Approaching the Sepulchre</i>, of which several versions exist, one in the National Gallery, London. The writer Pietro Aretino described Savoldo as ‘decrepit’ in 1548 and he is not heard of thereafter."

His style was <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> (he knew <a href=""entry://Canova, Antonio""><span class=""links"">Canova </span></a> in Italy), but retained a degree of <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> liveliness. He was active mainly as a portraitist and tomb sculptor, but his best-known work is the <i>quadriga</i> (four-horse chariot) (1793) surmounting the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, which was badly damaged in the Second World War. His finest achievement is perhaps the charming and sensitive group of <i>The Princesses Luise and Frederika of Prussia</i> (Staatliche Mus., Berlin, 1795&ndash;7). From the 1820s his sight deteriorated and he turned more to graphic work (he was a draughtsman, engraver, and lithographer) and to writing on art theory. He had three artist sons; <i>Felix Schadow </i> (1819&ndash;61), <i>Rudolf Schadow </i> (1786&ndash;1822) and, most importantly, <i>Wilhelm von Schadow </i> (1788&ndash;1862).

<b>Scheemakers, Peter</b><div class=""content""><i>(1691&ndash;1781).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish sculptor, active mainly in England, where he settled around 1720.

In the 1730s he became the main rival to <a href=""entry://Rysbrack, John Michael""><span class=""links"">Rysbrack</span></a>, whose prices he undercut. Rysbrack defeated him in competition for the equestrian statue of William III in Bristol, but Scheemakers gained a great success in 1740 with his Shakespeare monument in Westminster Abbey and thereafter received numerous commissions and controlled a large studio with many assistants. He was, indeed, perhaps the most prolific of mid 18th-cent. sculptors, particularly as a maker of monuments, ranging from small tablets to large multi-figure compositions. Rysbrack also made portrait busts, and these, like his monuments, are often severely classical, reflecting his love of the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a>.

He painted portraits, landscapes, and semi-allegorical works, but he is best known for his drawings of nudes (including self-portraits), which have a disturbing and explicit erotic power&mdash;in 1912 he was briefly imprisoned on indecency charges, and several of his drawings were burnt. The figures he portrays are typically lonely or anguished, their bodies emaciated and twisted, expressing an aching intensity of feeling. His work was much exhibited, and he was beginning to receive international acclaim when he died (three days after his wife) in the influenza epidemic of 1918.

He continued working as a stage designer until the 1830s, and in this field ranks among the greatest artists of his period.

Schlemmer had a mystical temperament and his ideas on art were complex. Some of his early work was influenced by <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> and he showed a deep concern for pictorial structure; characteristically his paintings represent rather mechanistic human figures, seen in strictly frontal, rear, or profile attitudes set in a mysterious space (<i>Group of Fourteen Figures in Imaginary Architecture</i>, Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, 1930). He rejected what he considered the soullessness of pure abstraction, but he wished to submit his intuition to rational control. His cool, streamlined forms are seen also in his sculpture. Schlemmer did much work for the theatre, notably designs for the <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivist</span></a>

In 1905 he was one of the founders of Die <a href=""entry://Brücke, Die""><span class=""links"">Brucke</span></a>. His style was harsher than that of the other members of the group, and it was particularly forceful in his superb woodcuts. Their abrupt manner was reflected in his paintings with their flat ungraduated planes of contrasting colours. In 1906 he stayed with <a href=""entry://Nolde, Emil""><span class=""links"">Nolde</span></a> on the island of Alsten, Norway, and in 1907 he painted with <a href=""entry://Heckel, Erich""><span class=""links"">Heckel </span></a> at Dangast on the coast north-west of Bremen. Apart from landscapes such as the ones he painted in these places, his work included portraits, figure compositions, and still lifes. In 1911, with the other members of Die Brücke, Schmidt-Rottluff moved to Berlin, where he lived for most of the rest of his life. In the 1910s and 1920s he was influenced by the stylized forms of African sculpture (<i>Dr Rosa Schapire</i>, Tate, London, 1919). Later his style became somewhat more naturalistic. His work was declared <a href=""entry://degenerate art""><span class=""links"">degenerate</span></a> by the Nazis and in 1941 he was forbidden to paint. In 1947 he became a professor at the Berlin Hochschule für Bildende Künste. The Brücke-Museum in Berlin was founded on his initiative in 1967 and he gave sixty of his own works to the collection. There are good collections of his graphic work in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Leicestershire Museum and Art Gallery, Leicester."

His work was strongly influenced by Netherlandish art, above all by Rogier van der <a href=""entry://Weyden, Rogier van der""><span class=""links"">Weyden </span></a>, but Schongauer had a powerful imagination of his own. He concentrated on religious subjects and about 115 plates by him are known. In them he brought a new richness and maturity to engraving, expanding the range of tones and textures, so that an art that had previously been the domain of the goldsmith took on a more painterly quality.

The word was first applied to collages made from refuse, but Schwitters came to use it of all his activities, including poetry. He used the word as a verb as well as a noun: a fellow artist was once nonplussed when Schwitters asked him to <i>merz</i> with him. In his early work Schwitters was influenced by <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, but after the First World War (in which he served for a time as a draughtsman) he became the chief (indeed, virtually only) representative of Dada in Hanover. In 1918 he began making collages from refuse such as bus tickets, cigarette wrappers, and string, and in 1919 he invented Merz. The name was reached by chance: whilst he was fitting the word ‘Commerzbank’ (from a business letter-head) into a collage, Schwitters cut off some letters and used what was left. He called the collages Merzbilden (Merz pictures) and in about 1923 began to make a sculptural or architectural variant&mdash;the Merzbau (Merz building)&mdash;in his house in Hanover (it was destroyed by bombing in 1943). From 1923 to 1932 he published a magazine called <i>Merz</i> and in this period he was much occupied with typography. In 1937 his work was declared <a href=""entry://degenerate art""><span class=""links"">degenerate</span></a> by the Nazis and in the same year he fled to Norway, where at Lysaker he began a second Merzbau (destroyed by fire in 1951). When the Germans invaded Norway in 1940, he moved to England, where he lived for the rest of his life&mdash;in London (after release from an internment camp) from 1941 to 1945, and then at Ambleside in the Lake District. Here, in an old barn in Langdale, he began work on his third and final Merzbau, with financial aid from the Museum of Modern Art, New York. It was unfinished at his death and is now in the Hatton Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne. The day before he died Schwitters received British citizenship."

His subjects were mainly scenes of modern Rome, painted with violent brushwork and a feeling of visionary intensity.

"Scopas of Paros","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Scopas of Paros</b>.<div class=""content"">One of the most celebrated Greek sculptors, active in the mid 4th cent. BC.

Sculptural remains from all three buildings have survived, and although none of them can be certainly associated with Scopas, it is likely that he is the author of certain pieces that show a distinctive style and are of a quality consonant with his elevated reputation. Among them are three slabs from the Mausoleum (BM, London) showing the Battle of Greeks and Amazons, which display the intensity of expression and the characteristically deep-set eyes that are considered typical of his work. Several other pieces have been associated with him on stylistic grounds.

He was born in Schoorel near Alkmaar, and after a varied artistic training worked in Utrecht with <a href=""entry://Gossaert, Jan""><span class=""links"">Gossaert </span></a>, who probably encouraged him to visit Italy. Scorel set out in 1519: stopping at Speyer, Strasburg, Basle, and Nuremberg, he eventually reached Venice, where he joined a group of pilgrims and sailed to Cyprus, Rhodes, Crete, and on to Jerusalem. He returned to Venice the following year and finally made his way to Rome, where he found favour with Pope Adrian VI, a native of Utrecht. By 1524 Scorel was back in Utrecht, where he spent most of his life. His countrymen immediately ranked him as one of their leading artists, and he had contact with the courts of France, Spain, and Sweden. Most of Scorel's great altarpieces have been lost or destroyed, but enough of his work survives to show how he had studied <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> sculpture and the works of <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> while he lived in Rome.

Unlike the works of many other Netherlandish masters, however, his pictures are no mere jumble of Renaissance motifs. The <i>Presentation in the Temple</i> (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) is set in a <a href=""entry://Scorel, Jan van""><span class=""links"">Bramantesque</span></a> building and the proportion, movement, and drapery of the figures indicate that he understood what his Italian contemporaries were trying to achieve. On the other hand, his interest in atmospheric effects, in the play of light and shadow, and his fine landscape drawings are part of his Netherlandish heritage. The degree to which he was able to synthesize northern and southern elements in his figure compositions varies, but the quality of his portraits is uniformly high."

He was not simply a mechanical imitator, however, and had a feeling for the English atmosphere that is lacking in Canaletto, who brought the Venetian light with him to England. Scott also could achieve a distinctive grandeur of design, as in <i>An Arch of Westminster Bridge</i> (Tate, London, <i>c.</i>1750), which is often considered his masterpiece.

Although forms such as circles and squares feature in his work, they are not geometrically exact but bounded by sensitive, painterly lines. In the later 1960s and 1970s his paintings became more austere. Although his work was restricted in range, Scott was regarded as one of the leading British painters of his generation."

All four painters knew each other, and they once exhibited together as ‘Les Peintres de L'Écosse Moderne’, at the Galerie Barbazanges, Paris, in 1924, but they did not function as a group. They have been described as the first ‘modern’ Scottish artists; certainly they were the main channel through which <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionism</span></a> reached their country.

<b>Sebastiano del Piombo </b>
<i>(Sebastiano Luciani )</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1485&ndash;1547).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Venetian painter, active mainly in Rome. According to <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>, he trained with Giovanni <a href=""entry://Bellini""><span class=""links"">Bellini </span></a>, but his early work was most strongly influenced by <a href=""entry://Giorgione ""><span class=""links"">Giorgione </span></a>, whose <i>Three Philosophers</i> (Kunsthistorisches Mus., Vienna) Sebastiano is said to have completed after the master's death. Their styles, indeed, can be so close as to cause paintings to be disputed between them, most notably the unfinished <i>Judgement of Solomon</i> (National Trust, Kingston Lacy). This large and impressive work was attributed to Giorgione by <a href=""entry://Ridolfi, Carlo""><span class=""links"">Ridolfi </span></a>, but scholarly opinion now increasingly tends towards giving it to Sebastiano. The half-length <i>Salome</i> (or <i>Judith</i>?) (NG, London, 1510) shows the magnificent painterly skills of an undoubted work of Sebastiano at this date; it has a sensuous beauty reminiscent of Giorgione, but also a statuesque grandeur that is Sebastiano's own. In 1511 Sebastiano moved to Rome on the invitation of the banker Agostino Chigi, and he remained there for the rest of his life apart from a visit to Venice in 1528&ndash;9 after the Sack of Rome. For Chigi he painted mythological frescos at the Villa Farnesina, where <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> also worked. It was with <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> rather than Raphael, however, that Sebastiano formed a friendship and a professional relationship. Michelangelo not only recommended him to people of influence, but also made drawings for him to work from, as with <i>The Raising of Lazarus</i> (NG, London, 1517&ndash;19). This was painted in competition with Raphael's <i>Transfiguration</i> (Vatican), both being intended for Norbonne Cathedral, and Vasari suggests that Michelangelo helped Sebastiano in order to discredit the Raphael faction, who had denigrated his powers as a colourist. Under Michelangelo's guidance Sebastiano's work became grander in form whilst losing much of its beauty of handling, the lack of sensuous appeal being accentuated when he began experimenting with painting on slate, as in <i>The Flagellation</i> (S. Pietro in Montorio, Rome). Some of the finest works of Sebastiano's Roman years are his portraits, and after Raphael's death (1520) he had no rival in the city in this field, his work attaining a distinctive sombre grandeur. Clement VII (Giulio de' <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici </span></a>), the subject of one of Sebastiano's finest portraits (Museo di Capodimonte, Naples 1526), appointed him keeper of the papal seals in 1531 and after this he was less active as a painter. The seals were made of lead, ‘piombo’ in Italian, hence Sebastiano's nickname."
"secco","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

"Segal George","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Segal George </b><div class=""content""><i>(1924&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American sculptor. His career was slow to mature. He studied at various art colleges and took a degree in art education at New York University in 1950, but until 1958 he worked mainly as a chicken farmer, painting <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">expressionist</span></a> nudes in his spare time. In 1958 he made his first sculpture and in 1960 he began producing the kind of work for which he has become famous&mdash;life-size unpainted plaster figures, usually combined with real objects to create strange ghostly tableaux. Examples are: <i>The Gas Station</i> (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, 1963); <i>Cinema</i> (Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, 1963); <i>The Restaurant Window</i> (Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, 1967). The figures are made from casts taken from the human body; he uses his family and friends as models. In the 1970s he began to incorporate sound and lighting effects in his work. Segal has been classified with <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a> and <i><a href=""entry://environment art""><span class=""links"">Environment art</i></a></span>, but his work is highly distinctive and original, his figures and groups dwelling in a lonely limbo in a way that captures a disquieting sense of spiritual isolation."

<b>Seghers, Daniel</b><div class=""content""><i>(1590&ndash;1661).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The leading Flemish flower painter of the generation after Jan <a href=""entry://Brueghel, Jan""><span class=""links"">Brueghel </span></a>, who was his master. He worked in his native Antwerp, where he joined the Jesuit Order in 1614. The words ‘Society of Jesus’ usually follow his signature and in 1625&ndash;7 he stayed with the Order in Rome. The records of his community in Antwerp, which still survive, give an account of his considerable fame and the distinguished persons who visited him&mdash;among them the future Charles II of England. His works could not be sold like those of an ordinary artist, but were presented as gifts by the Order, and the princely patrons in return sent lavish treasures including holy relics and a gold palette and brushes. Seghers's work consists mainly of garlands or ‘swags’ (festoons) of flowers, often painted around a Madonna and Child or a <a href=""entry://Pietà""><i><span class=""links"">Pietà</i></span></a> by another artist. He collaborated with his friend <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a> in this way. Much rarer are his bouquets of flowers in a glass vase, where brilliant colours stand out against a dark background. Their simplicity makes it easier to appreciate his lovely creamy touch (his brushwork was broader than Brueghel's but unerringly sure) and they rank among the most beautiful flower pieces ever painted."

"Seghers, Hercules","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Seghers, Hercules</b><div class=""content""><i>(1589/90&ndash;1633/8).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter and etcher of landscapes, one of the most original and most enigmatic figures in the history of Dutch art. Few details of his life are known. He was born in Haarlem, studied with Gillis van <a href=""entry://Coninxloo, Gillis van""><span class=""links"">Coninxloo </span></a> in Amsterdam, and worked also in Utrecht and The Hague, where he is last mentioned in 1633. The woman who was evidently his second wife is described as a widow in 1638. Hardly more than a dozen surviving paintings can be securely attributed to him, although contemporary documents show he certainly painted more. None of the paintings are dated and his chronology is difficult to reconstruct. He painted almost exclusively mountainous scenes, fantastic or <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> in conception but advanced in the naturalistic treatment of light and atmosphere. They are usually fairly small, but they suggest vast distances, and with their jagged rocks, shattered tree trunks, and menacing skies convey a sense of almost tragic desolation. Only <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Ruisdael, Jacob van""><span class=""links"">Ruisdael </span></a> among Dutch artists attained a similar degree of emotional intensity in landscape painting, and Seghers certainly influenced Rembrandt, who owned no less than eight of his paintings. Seghers's etchings, are also rare (the latest catalogue lists 54, with 183 known impressions) and are perhaps even more original than his paintings. He experimented with coloured inks and dyed papers, so that extraordinarily different impressions could be made from the same plate, a dark paper printed with pale ink transforming a daylight scene into a haunting nocturnal view. Sometimes he printed on linen, which emphasized the vigorous and grainy quality of his work. Every print was an individual work rather than an item in a standardized commercial edition: <a href=""entry://Hoogstraten, Samuel van""><span class=""links"">Hoogstraten </span></a> said that he ‘printed paintings’. They are unique in European art of the time, and it is often pointed out that some of them have a strange spiritual kinship with Chinese art. The best collection of his etchings is in the Print Room at Amsterdam. In 1678 Hoogstraten published a highly coloured account of Seghers's unhappy career, his desperate experiments with etchings, and his eventual poverty and drunkenness, adding that he was killed by falling downstairs when intoxicated. Although the account may be exaggerated, Seghers certainly had financial problems (he was forced to sell his house in Amsterdam in 1631), and it seems likely that he was little appreciated in his day."

<b>Sergel, Johan Tobias</b><div class=""content""><i>(1740&ndash;1814).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German-born Swedish sculptor, active mainly in Stockholm.

<b>Serov, Valentin</b><div class=""content""><i>(1865&ndash;1911).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Russian painter and graphic artist, son of the composer Alexander Serov . He studied privately under <a href=""entry://Repin, Ilya""><span class=""links"">Repin </span></a> and then in 1880&ndash;5 at the Academy in St Petersburg, where he became a friend of <a href=""entry://Vrubel, Mikhail""><span class=""links"">Vrubel </span></a>. His work includes landscapes, genre pictures, and historical scenes, as well as book illustrations, but he is best known as a portraitist. In this field he was the greatest Russian painter of his time and a match for any artist in the world. Like <a href=""entry://Sargent, John Singer""><span class=""links"">Sargent </span></a>, he was a cosmopolitan figure, used to moving in high society, and he brought to his work something of the same quality of aristocratic authority and poise associated with the American's portraits. Like Sargent, too, he painted with superb technical freedom and finesse, and he was just as good with informal portraits as with grand showpieces. His two most famous paintings (both in the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow) are intimate early works, the breathtakingly beautiful <i>Girl with Peaches</i> (1887) and the almost equally lovely <i>Girl in the Sunshine</i> (1888); later, as his fame grew, he painted many of the leading Russian celebrities of his time, particularly artists, musicians, and writers. Serov was a member of the <a href=""entry://World of Art""><span class=""links"">World of Art</span></a> group and some of his later work shows a tendency towards flat <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a> stylization. The most remarkable example is a nude, almost monochromatic portrait of the dancer Ida Rubinstein (Russian Museum, St Petersburg), painted in Paris in 1910.

"Seurat, Georges","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Seurat, Georges</b><div class=""content""><i>(1859&ndash;91).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter, the founder and greatest exponent of <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionism</span></a>. Seurat was the son of comfortably-off parents and his career took an unusual course; he never had to worry about earning a living and pursued his artistic researches with single-minded dedication. In 1878 he entered the École des <a href=""entry://Beaux-Arts, École Nationale Supérieure des""><span class=""links"">Beaux-Arts</span></a> in Paris, but his studies were interrupted by military service in 1879. He returned to Paris in 1880 and for the next 2 years devoted himself to drawing (he was one of the subtlest and most original draughtsmen of the 19th cent., typically working with very broad, velvety areas of tone, using a <a href=""entry://conté crayon""><span class=""links"">conté crayon</span></a> on textured paper). In spite of this mastery of black and white, as a painter he turned for inspiration to artists in the colourist tradition&mdash;notably <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>. In addition to studying the work of such painters, Seurat read aesthetic and scientific treatises, and he made it his aim to establish a rational system for achieving the kind of vibrant colour effects that the Impressionists in particular had arrived at instinctively. The method he evolved was to place small touches of unmixed colour side by side on the canvas, producing an effect of greater vibrancy and luminosity by this ‘optical mixture’ than if the colours had been physically mixed together on the palette. In his first major painting, <i>Bathers, Asnières</i> (NG, London, 1883&ndash;4, reworked, 1887), Seurat was still experimenting with his technique, but his next large work, <i>Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte</i> (Art Institute of Chicago, 1884&ndash;6), is a completely mature statement of his ideals. <i>La Grande Jatte</i> was shown at the final Impressionist exhibition in 1886 and led to the recognition of Seurat as a leader of the avant-garde. The critic Félix Fénéon coined the term <a href=""entry://pointillism""><span class=""links"">pointillism</span></a> in reference to this painting to describe the technique of using a myriad of tiny dots of colour, but Seurat preferred the term <a href=""entry://divisionism""><span class=""links"">divisionism</span></a>. From 1887 Seurat began to turn his attention to the significance of line in painting, believing that certain directions of lines could express specific emotions; horizontal lines represented calmness, for example, while upward- and downward-sloping lines represented happiness and sadness respectively. He embodied his beliefs in paintings such as <i>Le Chahut</i> (Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, 1890), in which the raised legs of the dancers performing ‘Le Chahut’ (a sort of can-can) express ‘happiness’. Seurat died very suddenly at the age of 31, apparently from meningitis, although his friend <a href=""entry://Signac, Paul""><span class=""links"">Signac </span></a> said that he ‘killed himself by overwork’. He was so dedicated to his work and kept himself to himself to such an extent that until his death few people knew he had a mistress and son. His mistress, Madeleine Knobloch, is represented in <i>Woman Powdering Herself</i> (Courtauld Inst., London, 1890). Seurat's work was highly influential, but his disciples rarely approached his skill, and even less his level of inspiration, in applying his theories; their paintings often look mechanical and lack his gently satirical humour. In power of composition Seurat stands above not only his followers, but also virtually all other painters of his period. He planned his pictures with extraordinary care, and they have nothing of the sense of the passing moment associated with Impressionism. Rather, they have a highly formalized quality and a conscious grandeur that has caused Seurat to be compared with such revered masters as <a href=""entry://Piero della Francesca ""><span class=""links"">Piero della</span></a> Francesca and <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>."

He was influenced by theories of mathematical proportion and in 1921 published a book on the subject, <i>Du Cubisme au Classicisme</i>. In the 1920s his style became more traditional and he carried out several decorative commissions, including murals for churches in Switzerland. He also worked as a theatrical designer. Severini returned to Italy in 1935, but in 1946 he settled in Paris again. In the later 1940s his style once again became semi-abstract."

His family emigrated to the USA in 1906 and settled in New York. Shahn's background (his father had been sent to Siberia for revolutionary activities and he grew up in a Brooklyn slum) gave him a hatred of cruelty and social injustice, which he expressed powerfully in his work. He first made a name with a series of pictures (1931&ndash;2) on the Sacco and Vanzetti case (these two Italian immigrants had been executed for murder in 1927 on very dubious evidence, and many liberals believed that they had really been condemned for their anarchist political views). Shahn's paintings are in a deliberately awkward, caricature-like style that vividly expresses his anger and compassion. In 1933 he was assistant to Diego <a href=""entry://Rivera, Diego""><span class=""links"">Rivera </span></a> on the latter's murals for the Rockefeller Center, New York, and subsequently he painted a number of murals himself, notably for the Bronx Post Office, New York (1938&ndash;9), and the Social Security Building, Washington (1940&ndash;1). From 1935 to 1938 he worked as an artist and photographer for the Farm Security Administration, a government agency that documented rural poverty. During the Second World War his work included designing posters for the Office of War Information. After the war he returned to easel painting and was also active as a book and magazine illustrator and as a designer of mosaics and stained glass. His later work tended to be more fanciful and reflective and less concerned with social issues. From the 1950s he gave more time to teaching and lecturing and in 1956&ndash;7 he was Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University. His lectures there were published as <i>The Shape of Content</i> (1957), in which he summarized his humanistic, anti-abstract artistic philosophy."

"shaped canvas","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>shaped canvas</b>.<div class=""content"">A term that began to be used in the 1960s for paintings on <a href=""entry://support""><span class=""links"">supports</span></a> that departed from the traditional rectangular format. Non-rectangular pictures were of course not new at this time; <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> altarpieces often had irregular pointed tops, the oval was particularly popular in the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> periods, and so on. The phrase ‘shaped canvas’, however, usually alludes particularly to a type of abstract painting that emphasizes the ‘objecthood’ of the work, proclaiming it as something that exists entirely in its own right and not as a reference to, or reproduction of, something else. Various artists have been claimed as the ‘inventor’ of the shaped canvas in this sense, but its most prominent exponent has undoubtedly been Frank <a href=""entry://Stella, Frank""><span class=""links"">Stella </span></a>, who has used such shapes as Vs, lozenges, and fragments of circles. The leading British exponent has been Richard Smith (1931&ndash; ), who has sometimes used a kite-shaped format in which the canvas is stretched on rods that are part of the visual structure of the picture. He was one of the artists represented in an exhibition entitled ‘The Shaped Canvas’, organized by Lawrence <a href=""entry://Alloway, Lawrence""><span class=""links"">Alloway </span></a> at the Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 1974. The shaped canvas has also occasionally been used by modern figurative painters, for example Anthony <a href=""entry://Green, Anthony""><span class=""links"">Green </span></a>."

Between 1904 and 1909 he made several trips to Europe, and gradually abandoned the bravura handling of <a href=""entry://Chase, William Merritt""><span class=""links"">Chase</span></a> (his teacher at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts) for a manner influenced by European modernism&mdash;the paintings he exhibited at the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a> of 1913, for example, were much indebted to <a href=""entry://Cézanne, Paul""><span class=""links"">Cézanne</span></a>. In 1912 Sheeler took up commercial photography for a living while continuing to paint. He worked for a while in fashion photography, but his shy and undemonstrative personality was not suited to this world, and he concentrated more on very mundane subjects such as plumbing fixtures. The clarity needed in such work helped to transform his style of painting to a meticulous smooth-surfaced manner that was the antithesis of his early approach. He began to paint urban subjects in about 1920 and over the next decade shifted from simplified compositions influenced by <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> (on ‘the borderline of abstraction’ in his own words) to highly detailed photographic-like images. In 1927 he was commissioned to take a series of photographs of the Ford Motor Company's plant at River Rouge, Michigan. His powerful photographs, presenting a pristine view of American industry, were widely reproduced and brought him international acclaim. Increasingly, also, he was recognized as the finest painter in the Precisionist style, his work standing out as much for its formal strength as for its technical polish. Sheeler's paintings continued in this realistic vein in the 1930s, but in the mid-1940s his style changed dramatically; he began using multiple viewpoints and bold unnaturalistic colours, although his brushwork remained immaculately smooth. In 1959 he suffered a stroke and had to abandon painting and photography."

<b>Sickert, Walter Richard</b><div class=""content""><i>(1860&ndash;1942).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter, printmaker, teacher, and critic, one of the most important figures of his time in British art. He was born in Munich of a Danish-German father and an Anglo-Irish mother and he remained cosmopolitan. The family settled in London in 1868. Both his father and his grandfather were painters, but Sickert&mdash;after a good classical education&mdash;initially trained for a career on the stage, 1877&ndash;81. He toured with Sir Henry Irving's company but never progressed beyond small parts and in 1881 he abandoned acting and became a student at the <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School. In the following year he became a pupil of <a href=""entry://Whistler, James Abbott McNeill""><span class=""links"">Whistler </span></a>, and in 1883 he worked in Paris with <a href=""entry://Degas, Edgar""><span class=""links"">Degas </span></a>. Between 1885 and 1905 Sickert spent much of his time in Dieppe, living there 1899&ndash;1905, and also visited Venice several times. From 1905, when he returned to England, he became the main channel for influence from avant-garde French painting in British art&mdash;the inspiration for the <a href=""entry://Camden Town Group""><span class=""links"">Camden Town Group</span></a>. In 1918&ndash;22 he again lived in Dieppe, then settled permanently in England, living in London and Brighton before moving to Broadstairs, Kent (1934), and finally to Bathampton, near Bath (1938).<br class=""nLine"" />Sickert took the elements of his style from various sources but moulded them into a highly distinctive <i>œuvre</i>. From Whistler he derived his subtle modulations of tone, although his effects were richer than the characteristically delicate harmonies of Whistler. To Degas he was indebted particularly for his method of painting from photographs and for the informality of composition this encouraged. His favourite subjects were urban scenes and figure compositions, particularly pictures of the theatre and music-hall and drab domestic interiors. Sickert himself wrote in 1910 that ‘The more our art is serious, the more will it tend to avoid the drawing-room and stick to the kitchen.’ This attitude permeates his most famous painting, <i>Ennui</i>, a compelling image of a stagnant marriage, of which he painted at least four versions, that in the Tate Gallery, London (<i>c.</i>1914), being the largest and most highly finished. From the 1920s Sickert received many honours. His later works&mdash;often based on press photographs or Victorian illustrations&mdash;are very broadly handled, painted in a rough, vigorous technique, with the canvas often showing through the paint in places. The colour is generally much higher keyed than in his earlier work and sometimes almost <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionist</span></a> in its boldness. The prevailing critical opinion for many years was that these late works marked a significant decline, but major claims have recently been made for them, particularly following the 1981 <a href=""entry://Arts Council of Great Britain""><span class=""links"">Arts Council</span></a> exhibition ‘Late Sickert: Painting 1927 to 1942’.<br class=""nLine"" />As well as painting, Sickert was an outstanding etcher (he learnt the technique from Whistler) and a great teacher (he opened seven private art schools, each of brief duration, and also taught part-time at Westminster School of Art, 1908&ndash;12 and 1915&ndash;18). He was celebrated for his wit and charm and was a stimulating talker and an articulate writer on art; Osbert Sitwell edited a posthumous collection of his writings entitled <i>A Free House!</i> (1947). Sickert was married three times; his third wife (from 1926) was the painter Thérèse Lessore (1884&ndash;1945). His brother <i>Bernard Sickert </i> (1862/3&ndash;1932) was a landscape painter and etcher. He was a member of the <a href=""entry://New English Art Club""><span class=""links"">New English Art Club</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />One of the more eccentric theories about the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888 has it that Sickert (against his will) was part of a team that carried out the killings to cover up a scandal about an illegitimate child born to the Duke of Clarence (Queen Victoria's grandson); see Stephen Knight, <i>Jack the Ripper</i>: <i>The Final Solution</i> (1976, revised edition, 1984) and Jean Overton Fuller, <i>Sickert &amp; the Ripper Crimes</i> (1990)."

The book was, however, more in the nature of a manifesto in defence of the movement than an objectively accurate history. It reflected changes which had taken place in Signac's own style since 1890 towards greater brilliance of colour, and his best works are generally considered to be those in which he moved away from the scientific precision advocated by Seurat towards a freer and more spontaneous manner.

According to <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> (who was related to him and ‘as a child of eight’ met ‘this good old man’), Signorelli was a pupil of <a href=""entry://Piero della Francesca ""><span class=""links"">Piero della</span></a> Francesca and this seems highly probable on stylistic grounds, for his solid figures and sensitive handling of light echo the work of the master. Signorelli differed from Piero, however, in his interest in the representation of action, which put him in line with contemporary Florentine artists such as the <a href=""entry://Pollaiuolo, Antonio""><span class=""links"">Pollaiuolo</span></a> brothers. He must have had a considerable reputation by about 1483, when he was called on to complete the cycle of frescos on the walls of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, left unfinished by <a href=""entry://Botticelli, Sandro""><span class=""links"">Botticelli </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Ghirlandaio, Domenico""><span class=""links"">Ghirlandaio </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Perugino, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Perugino </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Rosselli, Cosimo""><span class=""links"">Rosselli </span></a>. (It is not known why these four artists abandoned the work in 1482, but it has been suggested that they simply downed tools because of slow payment.) Signorelli completed the scheme with distinction, but his finest works are in Orvieto Cathedral, where he painted a magnificent series of six frescos illustrating the end of the world and the Last Judgement (1499&ndash;1504). In these grand and dramatic scenes he displayed a mastery of the nude in a wide variety of poses surpassed at that time only by <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>. Vasari says that ‘Luca's works were always highly praised by Michelangelo’ and several instances of close similarity between the work of the two men can be cited; perhaps most interesting is the enigmatic seated nude youth in Signorelli's <i>Last Acts and Death of Moses</i> in the Sistine Chapel, which is remarkably close to some of the <i>Ignudi</i> painted by Michelangelo on the ceiling of the chapel a quarter of a century later. By the end of his career, however, Luca had become a conservative artist, working in provincial Cortona, where his large workshop produced numerous altar-pieces. Several examples of his work are in the National Gallery, London."

The word silhouette derives from Etienne de Silhouette (1706&ndash;67), French finance minister under Louis XV, who was notorious for his parsimony and cut shadow portraits as a hobby; hence the phrase ‘à la silhouette’ came to mean ‘on the cheap’. In Britain silhouette portraits were generally called ‘shades’ or ‘profiles’ up to the end of the 18th cent."

Gil's extant work includes two royal tombs (1489&ndash;93) in the monastery of Miraflores, Burges: the first of John II of Castile and his wife Isabella of Portugal, the second of their son Prince Alfonso . Diego presumably trained with his father, but he formed his style in Italy, where he collaborated with Bartolomé <a href=""entry://Ordóñez, Bartolomé""><span class=""links"">Ordóñez </span></a>. By 1519 he had returned to Burgos, where he carried out several important commissions in the cathedral.

He was probably trained in Duccio's circle, and he developed further the decorative use of outline, colour, and patterning that were the marks of Duccio's work. The main features of his style are present in his earliest surviving work, the large fresco of the <a href=""entry://Maestà""><i><span class=""links"">Maestà</i></span></a> (1315; reworked 1321) in Siena Town Hall: the sumptuous materials and the aloofness of the Madonna derive from the <a href=""entry://Byzantine art""><span class=""links"">Byzantine</span></a> style of the older generation; the decorative line, gesture, and expression are informed by the gracious <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> fashion that was now current in Siena; and the use of foreshortening to create depth shows the awakening desire for more lifelike effects. In 1317 Simone was in Naples, where he executed for Robert of Anjou (king of Naples, 1309&ndash;43) a painting (Museo di Capodimonte, Naples) showing his elder brother St Louis of Toulouse, newly canonized, resigning his crown to him. The <a href=""entry://predella""><span class=""links"">predella</span></a> scenes of this altarpiece contain the boldest compositions in <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a> that had been produced up to that date. The next major work associated with Simone is a fresco, dated 1328, on the wall opposite his <i>Maestà</i> in Siena Town Hall, commemorating the <i>condottiere</i> Guidoriccio da Fogliano, who in that year had won a great victory for the Sienese and liberated the towns of Montemassi and Sassoforte, shown in the background. This highly original work, which shows the general riding in stately but solitary triumph, is generally regarded as one of the first equestrian portraits since antiquity; however, since the late 1970s it has been the subject of great controversy, some scholars considering that it is not by Simone and appreciably later than assumed (this opinion is based on technical evidence allegedly showing that part of the fresco lies on top of another fresco known to date from 1363). The work that is generally regarded as the epitome of Simone's style is the <i>Annunciation</i> (Uffizi, Florence, 1333), although this is jointly signed with his brother-in-law Lippo <a href=""entry://Memmi, Lippo""><span class=""links"">Memmi </span></a>. It is a ravishing blend of fragile grace and sweet sentiment and for sheer beauty of craftsmanship is unsurpassed in its age. Simone's work is more fully Gothic in spirit than that of any other major Italian painter and it is not surprising that he was appreciated in France. In 1340/1 he went to Avignon to serve the papal court, where he painted the unusual subject <i>Christ Reproved by his Parents</i> (Walker Art Gal., Liverpool, 1342) and the frontispiece to a Virgil manuscript belonging to the poet Petrarch (Ambrosiana Lib., Milan). He also did a portrait of Petrarch's beloved Laura; it is lost, but mentioned in one of the poet's sonnets. Simone's style and compositions were taken over by <a href=""entry://illuminated manuscripts""><span class=""links"">illuminators</span></a> from France and Flanders and generations of Italian <a href=""entry://panel""><span class=""links"">panel</span></a> and fresco painters copied him too.

Mexican art. He was a political activist from his youth and in 1914 abandoned his studies at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City to join the revolutionary army fighting against President Huerta. His services were appreciated by the victorious General Carranza, who in 1919 sponsored him to continue his studies in Europe, where he was friendly with Rivera (later they became rivals). On returning to Mexico in 1922 he took a leading part in the artistic revival fostered by President Alvaro Obregón . Siqueiros was active in organizing the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters and Sculptors and was partly responsible for drafting its manifesto, which set forth the idealistic aims of the revolutionary artists: ‘our own aesthetic aim is to socialize artistic expression, to destroy bourgeois individualism
We proclaim that this being the moment of social transition from a decrepit to a new order, the makers of beauty must invest their greatest efforts in the aim of materializing an art valuable to the people, and our supreme object in art, which today is an expression for individual pleasure, is to create beauty for all, beauty that enlightens and stirs to struggle.’<br class=""nLine"" />Siqueiros's political activities led to his imprisonment or self-imposed exile several times; from 1925 to 1930 he completely abandoned painting for political activity and he later fought in the Spanish Civil War. It was not until 1939 that he eventually completed a mural in Mexico&mdash;<i>Portrait of the Bourgeoisie</i> for the headquarters of the Union of Electricians in Mexico City (his slow start had prompted Rivera to retort in answer to criticism from him: ‘Siqueiros talks: Rivera paints!’). Thereafter, however, Siqueiros's output was prodigious. He painted many easel pictures as well as murals, and though he insisted they were subordinate to his wall paintings, they were important in helping to establish his international reputation. His murals are generally more spectacular even than those of Orozco and Rivera&mdash;bold in composition, striking in colour, freely mixing realism with fantasy, and expressing a raw emotional power. In contrast with the sense of disillusionment and foreboding sometimes seen in Orozco's work, Siqueiros always expressed the dynamic urge to struggle; his work can be vulgar and bombastic, but its sheer energy is astonishing. He often experimented technically&mdash;working on curved surfaces and using air-brushes and synthetic pigments&mdash;and his last major work, the Polyforum Siqueiros in Mexico City (completed 1971), is a huge auditorium integrating architecture, sculpture, and painting. In his late years Siqueiros was showered with honours from his own country and elsewhere; he received the Lenin Peace Prize in 1967, for example, and in the following year became the first President of the newly founded Mexican Academy of Arts."

<b>Sisley, Alfred</b><div class=""content""><i>(1839&ndash;99).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> painter of English parentage. He was intended by his parents to have a commercial career, but he turned to painting. In 1862 he entered the studio of <a href=""entry://Gleyre, Charles""><span class=""links"">Gleyre </span></a> and there met <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Monet, Claude""><span class=""links"">Monet </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Bazille, Frédéric""><span class=""links"">Bazille </span></a>, his friendship with Monet providing particularly important. Like Monet, Sisley devoted himself almost exclusively to landscape, but his work was much less varied. He made several visits to England, but otherwise rarely travelled, and most of his pictures are of scenes in and around Paris. The best are among the most lyrical and gently harmonious works of Impressionism, delicate in touch and with a beautiful feeling for tone. Sisley was given a generous allowance by his wealthy father and his early life was happy: Renoir described him as ‘a delightful human being’ and said he ‘could never resist a petticoat’. However, after the family business failed in 1871 because of the Franco-Prussian War, his father was unable to support him and thereafter he spent much of his life in poverty, never winning the success or renown of his former colleagues. He still remains something of a Cinderella among the Impressionists, claimed as their own by neither the French nor the English. His work is in many public collections, including the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery, and the Courtauld Institute in London."

His loose handling of paint, bold effects of light, and energetic sense of movement give his work great dash, and he was much in demand as a decorative artist. He also made a name for himself as a book illustrator. As a painter his work included landscapes, portraits, and scenes of contemporary life; he loved the theatre and is perhaps best known for portrayals of the singer Francisco d'Andrade in the role of Don Juan.

In 1904 he settled permanently in New York, where he and Henri were among the members of The <a href=""entry://Eight, The""><span class=""links"">Eight</span></a>. Sloan was the most political member of the Eight and as well as finding his most characteristic subjects among everyday lower-class New York life, he did illustrations for socialist periodicals, including <i>The Masses</i>, of which he was editor from 1912 to 1916. However, he was not interested in using his art for what he called ‘socialist propaganda’ and he resigned from the magazine after a dispute over policy. His paintings are generally marked by a warm humanity, but he could also be sharply satirical and occasionally expressed himself in a totally different vein, as in <i>Wake of the Ferry</i> (Phillips Coll., Washington, 1907), which has a romantic, melancholy mood. He taught at the <a href=""entry://Art Students League of New York""><span class=""links"">Art Students League</span></a> 1914&ndash;30 and 1930&ndash;8, his students including such distinguished figures as Alexander <a href=""entry://Calder, Alexander""><span class=""links"">Calder </span></a>, Barnett <a href=""entry://Newman, Barnett""><span class=""links"">Newman </span></a>, and David <a href=""entry://Smith, David""><span class=""links"">Smith </span></a>.

"Sluter, Claus","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Sluter, Claus</b><div class=""content""><i>(d. 1405/6).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Netherlandish sculptor, active mainly in Dijon. He was the greatest sculptor of his time in northern Europe and a figure of enormous importance in the transition from <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a> to a more weighty and naturalistic style. Sluter is first mentioned in Brussels (<i>c.</i>1379) in a document that says he came from Haarlem. In 1385 he entered the service of Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, in his capital, Dijon. All of Sluter's surviving work was done for Philip, and almost all of it remains in Dijon. For the Chartreuse de Champmol, a monastery founded by Philip, Sluter carved figures for the portal of the chapel in the early 1390s, and made a fountain group, the only part of which to survive intact is the base, known as the <i>Well of Moses</i> (1395&ndash;1403). The monastery was destroyed during the French Revolution, and the portal and the <i>Well of Moses</i> are now part of the psychiatric hospital that occupies its site. The Well features six full-length figures of prophets of monumental dignity; they convey an intense sense of physical presence, and as character studies rival the prophets of <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello </span></a>, which they preceded by about 20 years. Originally Sluter's figures were painted (by <a href=""entry://Malouel, Jean""><span class=""links"">Malouel </span></a>) and the figure of Jeremiah is known to have worn copper spectacles, the record of payment for which still survives. Of the Calvary group that surmounted the Well (symbolizing the ‘Fountain of Life’) only fragments survive in the Archaeological Museum in Dijon; they include the head and torso of the figure of Christ&mdash;one of Sluter's noblest works, in which the expression of suffering stoically endured is deeply moving. Sluter's last work was the tomb of Philip the Bold, begun in 1404 and unfinished at the sculptor's death (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon). Most of the work on it was carried out by Sluter 's nephew and assistant Claus de Werve, but the figures of <i>pleurants</i> (weepers or mourners) that form a frieze around the sarcophagus are from the master's own hand, and although they are only about 40 cm. high they possess massive solemnity. They show Sluter's extraordinary ability to use the heavy folds of drapery for expressive effect; indeed some of the mourners are so completely enveloped in their voluminous cowls that they are in effect nothing else but drapery. Sluter's influence was enormous&mdash;on painters as well as sculptors. The emphatic plasticity of the <a href=""entry://Master of Flémalle""><span class=""links"">Master of Flémalle's</span></a> figures, for example, has Sluter as its source, and in his <i>Entombment</i> (Courtauld Inst., London, <i>c.</i>1410/20), which stands at the head of the Early Netherlandish tradition of painting, the angel that wipes away a tear with the back of his hand is a quotation from the <i>Well of Moses</i>."

He began to study art at Ohio University in 1924 but soon dropped out of the course and in the summer of 1925 worked at the Studebaker motor plant at South Bend, Indiana, where he acquired the skills in metalwork that stood him in good stead later in his career. From 1926 to 1930 he studied painting at the <a href=""entry://Art Students League of New York""><span class=""links"">Art Students League</span></a>, New York, while supporting himself by a variety of jobs. Among his friends were Arshile <a href=""entry://Gorky, Arshile""><span class=""links"">Gorky </span></a> and Willem <a href=""entry://de Kooning, Willem""><span class=""links"">de Kooning </span></a>. He turned to sculpture in the early 1930s, making his first welded iron sculpture in 1933, although he always maintained that there was no essential difference between painting and sculpture and that although he owed his ‘technical liberation’ to Julio <a href=""entry://González, Julio""><span class=""links"">González </span></a>, his aesthetic outlook was more influenced by <a href=""entry://Kandinsky, Wassily""><span class=""links"">Kandinsky </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Mondrian, Piet""><span class=""links"">Mondrian </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>. During the 1930s he was already doing sculpture of considerable originality, constructing compositions from steel and ‘found’ scrap, parts of agricultural machinery, etc. He had a love of technology, and wrote: ‘The equipment I use, my supply of material, comes from factory study, and duplicates as nearly as possible the production equipment used in making a locomotive
What associations the metal possesses are those of this century: power, structure, movement, progress, suspension, destruction, brutality.’<br class=""nLine"" />Smith settled at Bolton Landing, New York, in 1940. In the same year he exhibited a set of fifteen bronze <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> plaques entitled <i>Medals of Dishonour</i> stigmatizing the prevalence of violence and greed throughout the world. After being employed as a welder on defence work, he returned to sculpture <i>c.</i>1945. His sculpture during the 1940s and 1950s was open and linear, like three-dimensional metal calligraphy. Perhaps the most noted work in this style is <i>Hudson River Landscape</i> (Whitney Mus., New York, 1951). From the end of the 1950s up to his death in a car accident he did the more structural and massive work for which he is best known, often working in series such as <i>Zig, Tank Totem, Agricola, Cubi, Voltri</i>. Although monumental and intended to be seen in the open, these last works&mdash;characteristically consisting of boxes and cylinders of polished metal&mdash;were not heavy but had an unstable, dynamic quality which contradicted their sense of density. They initiated a new era in American sculpture, ushering in the sort of objectivity that characterized <a href=""entry://Post-Painterly Abstraction""><span class=""links"">Post-Painterly Abstraction</span></a>."

<b>Socialist Realism</b>.<div class=""content"">The name of the officially approved style of art in Soviet Russia and other Communist countries, involving in theory a faithful and objective reflection of real life and in practice the compulsory and uncritical glorification of the State. Socialist Realism was an aspect of the dictatorship of Stalin, who was leader of the Soviet Union from the death of Lenin in 1924 until his own death in 1953. Alan Bird (<i>A History of Russian Painting</i>, 1987) writes that ‘He saw all aspects of avant-garde culture, including painting, as subversive infiltrations of the purity of Soviet life’ and that his minister Andrei Zhdanov ‘made himself responsible for imposing an iron control on artistic expression’. The principles of Socialist Realism began to take shape in the late 1920s and were proclaimed in the 1932 decree ‘On the Reconstruction of Literary and Art Organizations’ (before this, the term ‘Heroic Realism’ had often been used, but ‘Socialist Realism’ now became the official label). In its early days it saw expression in some outstanding works, notably the paintings of Alexander Deineka (1899&ndash;1969), but increasingly it became associated with stereotyped images painted in a conventional academic manner. In the 1930s there were four main types of Socialist Realist paintings: domestic scenes, portraits, industrial and urban landscapes, and scenes on collective farms. During the Second World War, patriotic scenes from Russian history were added to the list. After the death of Stalin there was some relaxation of strictures, but the system still remained stifling to creativity, and any form of experiment remained extremely difficult. In the West, Socialist Realism remained synonymous with repression, and its products were generally regarded as morally tragic and aesthetically comic, although the merits of painters such as Arkady Plastov (1893&ndash;1972), a specialist in farm scenes, are now being recognized."

<b>Society of Independent Artists</b>.<div class=""content"">An American association formed in 1916 to succeed the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, which was dissolved after the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a>. Its object was to hold annual exhibitions in rivalry with the <a href=""entry://National Academy of Design""><span class=""links"">National Academy of Design</span></a> and to afford progressive artists an opportunity to show their works. It was organized on the model of the French <a href=""entry://Salon des Indépendants""><i><span class=""links"">Salon des Indépendants</i></span></a> without jury or prizes, giving anyone the right to exhibit on payment of a modest fee. The first President was William <a href=""entry://Glackens, William James""><span class=""links"">Glackens </span></a>, followed by John <a href=""entry://Sloan, John""><span class=""links"">Sloan </span></a>. The first exhibition, in the spring of 1916, comprised more than 2,000 exhibits and included both American and European artists. Although the Society continued to arrange exhibitions until the mid 1940s, subsequent exhibitions were smaller and inferior in quality and its importance diminished. It is now perhaps best remembered for an incident in 1917, when Marcel <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a>, who was one of the Society's officials, resigned after the refusal to exhibit his <a href=""entry://ready-made""><span class=""links"">ready-made</span></a> in the form of a urinal signed ‘R.

Although much recondite aesthetic theory has been read into this gesture, it is likely that the main purpose of it was to demonstrate the artistic incongruity of a Society with the professed purpose of allowing anyone to exhibit anything."
"Société Anonyme, Inc","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Société Anonyme, Inc</b>. <i>(or a Museum of Modern Art)</i>.<div class=""content"">An association founded in 1920 by Katherine <a href=""entry://Dreier, Katherine S.""><span class=""links"">Dreier </span></a>, Marcel <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Man Ray ""><span class=""links"">Man Ray </span></a> for the promotion of contemporary art in America by lectures, publications, travelling exhibitions, and the formation of a permanent collection. In French the term ‘société anonyme’ means ‘limited company’, so the name&mdash;suggested by Man Ray&mdash;was intended as a tautological <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada</span></a> jest; as Miss Dreier loved to explain, it meant ‘incorporated corporation’. However, the work of the society was serious and trail blazing. Its museum, which opened at 19 East 47th Street, New York, on 30 April 1920, was the first in the USA, and one of the earliest anywhere, to be devoted entirely to modern art. Between 1920 and 1940 the Société organized 84 exhibitions, through which such artists as <a href=""entry://Klee, Paul""><span class=""links"">Klee </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Malevich, Kasimir""><span class=""links"">Malevich </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Miró, Joan""><span class=""links"">Miro, </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Schwitters, Kurt""><span class=""links"">Schwitters </span></a> were first exhibited in America. To some extent, therefore, the Société carried on the tradition that had been started by the 291 Gallery of <a href=""entry://Stieglitz, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Stieglitz </span></a> in the years before the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a>, and to some extent also it prepared the way for the <a href=""entry://Museum of Modern Art""><span class=""links"">Museum of Modern Art</span></a>, which was founded in 1929. The Museum of Modern Art soon eclipsed the Société Anonyme and Miss Dreier's finances were in any case badly hit by the Depression, but she continued officially as President (as Duchamp did as Secretary) until the Société officially closed in 1950. Nine years earlier, in 1941, they had presented the superb permanent collection that the Société had built up (over 600 works) to Yale University Art Gallery."
"Sodoma, Il","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Sodoma, Il</b>
<i>(Giovanni Antonio Bazzi )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1477&ndash;1549).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, born at Vercelli and active chiefly in and around Siena, where he settled in 1501. <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>, who disliked him, explains the origin of his nickname&mdash;‘the sodomite’&mdash;in this fashion: ‘His manner of life was licentious and dishonourable, and as he always had boys and beardless youths about him of whom he was inordinately fond, this earned him the nickname of Sodoma; but instead of feeling shame, he gloried in it, writing stanzas and verses on it, and singing them to the accompaniment of the lute.’ Sodoma (who was married and had children) himself used the name in his signature, and Vasari's story has been questioned. Vasari also tells us that Sodoma kept a menagerie of strange animals ‘so that his home resembled a veritable Noah's ark’. He was a prolific painter of frescos and easel pictures, and he drew on a variety of sources that were not always fully digested; consequently his work often has incongruous juxtapositions and a general air of uncoordination, but it also possesses charm and a flair for decoration. His fresco of the <i>Marriage of Alexander and Roxane</i> (1516&ndash;17), painted for the Sienese banker Agostino Chigi in his Villa Farnesina in Rome, is often cited as his finest work. In his time Sodoma was considered the leading artist in Siena, but later critics have come to rank <a href=""entry://Beccafumi, Domenico""><span class=""links"">Beccafumi </span></a> above him."
"Soft art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Soft art</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to sculpture using non-rigid materials, a vogue of the 1960s and 1970s. The materials employed have been very diverse: rope, cloth, rubber, leather, paper, canvas, vinyl&mdash;anything in fact which offers a certain persistence of form but lacks permanent shape or rigidity. Perhaps the earliest example of ‘Soft art’ in this century was the typewriter cover which Marcel <a href=""entry://Duchamp, Marcel""><span class=""links"">Duchamp </span></a> mounted on a stand and exhibited in 1916. But this belongs rather to the category of <a href=""entry://ready-made""><span class=""links"">ready-mades</span></a>, which he introduced. ‘Soft art’ as a movement is usually traced to Claes <a href=""entry://Oldenburg, Claes""><span class=""links"">Oldenburg 's</span></a> giant replicas of foodstuffs (ice-cream sundaes, hamburgers, pieces of cake, etc.) made from stuffed vinyl and canvas.

"soft-ground etching","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>soft-ground etching</b>.<div class=""content"">A method of <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etching</span></a>, invented in the late 18th cent., that produces prints characterized by softness of line or a grainy texture. The <a href=""entry://ground""><span class=""links"">ground</span></a> used to coat the etching plate is softer and stickier than in normal etching, so that it adheres to anything pressed into it. Over this ground was laid a sheet of paper on which the artist drew with a pencil. Under the pressure of the pencil strokes the ground stuck to the back of the paper, so that when it was lifted the wax immediately underneath the lines came away with it, while the rest remained in place. The plate was then immersed in acid, and printed in the normal way. The printed lines were granular, coarse, or fine according to the texture of the paper used for the drawing: thus if the paper had been smooth, the lines resembled pencil, but if rough, they were more like chalk. Soft-ground etchings bear a strong likeness to prints in the <a href=""entry://crayon""><span class=""links"">crayon</span></a> manner, but are generally a little softer and less regular. Although the technique was used in the late 18th and early 19th cents. chiefly for reproduction, a number of excellent original soft-ground etchings were produced by <a href=""entry://Gainsborough, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Gainsborough </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Cotman, John Sell""><span class=""links"">Cotman </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Girtin, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Girtin </span></a>.

<b>Soutine, Chaïm</b><div class=""content""><i>(1893&ndash;1943)</i><br class=""nLine"" />.

Soutine suffered from depression and lack of confidence in his own work (he was reluctant to exhibit and sometimes destroyed his own pictures), and he endured years of desperate poverty until the American collector Dr Albert C. <a href=""entry://Barnes, Dr Albert C.""><span class=""links"">Barnes </span></a> bought a number of his paintings in 1923. Thereafter he had a prosperous career. Soutine's work included landscapes, portraits, and figure studies of characters such as choirboys and page-boys. His style is characterized by thick, convulsive brush-work, through which he could express tenderness as well as turbulent psychological states. There is something of an affinity with van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a>, although Soutine professed to dislike his work and felt more kinship with the Old Masters whose work he studied in the Louvre; his pictures of animal carcasses, for example, are inspired by <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt's </span></a>
<i>Flayed Ox</i>. However, the gruesome intensity of works such as <i>Side of Beef</i> (Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, 1925) was not gained simply through study of similar pictures, for Soutine visited abattoirs and even brought a carcass into the studio. His neighbours complained of the smell of the rotting meat and called the police, whom Soutine harangued on the subject of how much more important art was than sanitation. The filthy state in which he lived was notorious: the poet André Salmon recalled that Soutine once consulted a specialist about earache and that ‘In the canal of the painter's ear the doctor discovered, not an abscess, but a nest of bed bugs’"

"Spazialismo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Spazialismo</b>
<i>(or Spatialism).</i><div class=""content"">A movement founded by Lucio <a href=""entry://Fontana, Lucio""><span class=""links"">Fontana </span></a> in Milan in 1947 in which he grandiosely intended to synthesize colour, sound, space, movement, and time into a new type of art. The main ideas of the movement were anticipated in his <i>Manifesto Blanco</i> (White Manifesto) published in Buenos Aires in 1946. In it he spoke of a new ‘spatial’ art in keeping with the spirit of the post-war age. On the negative side it repudiated the illusory or ‘virtual’ space of traditional easel painting; on the positive side it was to unite art and science to project colour and form into real space by the use of up-to-date techniques such as neon lighting and television. Five more manifestos followed; they were more specific in their negative than their positive aspects, and carried the concept of Spazialismo little further than the statement that its essence consisted in ‘plastic emotions and emotions of colour projected upon space’. In 1947 Fontana created a ‘Black Spatial Environment’, a room painted black, which was considered to have foreshadowed <i><a href=""entry://environment art""><span class=""links"">environment art</i></a></span>. His holed and slashed canvases (beginning in 1949 and 1959 respectively) are also considered to embody Spatialism. An example of the slashed type (the slash made with a razer blade) is <i>Spatial Concept Waiting</i> (Tate, London, 1960)."
"Spencer, Sir Stanley","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Spencer, Sir Stanley</b><div class=""content""><i>(1891&ndash;1959).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, one of the most original figures in 20th-cent. British art. He was born in Cookham in Berkshire and lived for most of his life in the village, which played a large part in the imagery of his paintings. His education was fairly elementary, but he grew up in a family in which literature, music, and religion were dominant concerns and his imaginative life was extremely rich. He said he wanted ‘to take the inmost of one's wishes, the most varied religious feelings
and to make it an ordinary fact of the street’, and he is best known for his pictures in which he set biblical events in his own village; his visionary attitude has been compared to that of William <a href=""entry://Blake, William""><span class=""links"">Blake </span></a>. Spencer was a prize-winning student at the <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School (1908&ndash;12) and served in the army from 1915 to 1918, first at the Beaufort War Hospital in Bristol, then in Macedonia. He was appointed an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a> in 1918, but his experiences during the war found their most memorable expression a decade later when he painted a series of murals for the Sandham Memorial Chapel at Burghclere in Hampshire (1927&ndash;32), built to commemorate a soldier who had died from an illness contracted in Macedonia. The arrangement of the murals consciously recalls <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto's</span></a> Arena Chapel in Padua, but Spencer painted in oil, not fresco, and he concentrated not on great events, but on the life of the common soldier, which he depicted with deep human feeling. There is no violence, and Spencer said that the idea for one of the scenes&mdash;<i>The Dug-Out</i>&mdash;occurred to him ‘in thinking how marvellous it would be if one morning, when we came out of our dugouts, we found that somehow everything was peace and the war was no more’. By this time Spencer was a celebrated figure, his greatest public success having been <i>The Resurrection: Cookham</i> (Tate, London, 1924&ndash;6), which when exhibited in 1927 was hailed by the critic of <i>The Times</i> as ‘the most important picture painted by any English artist in the present century’. He continued: ‘What makes it so astonishing is the combination in it of careful detail with modern freedom of form. It is as if a <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelite</span></a> had shaken hands with a <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a>.’<br class=""nLine"" />.Spencer was again an Official War Artist during the Second World War, when he painted a series of large canvases showing shipbuilding on the Clyde (Imperial War Mus.) that memorably capture the heroic teamwork that went into the war effort. His career culminated in a knighthood in the year of his death, but his life was not a smooth success story, and in the 1930s he somewhat alienated his public with the expressive distortions and erotic content of his work. In 1935 he resigned as an Associate of the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> when two of his pictures, considered caricature-like and poorly drawn, were rejected for the annual summer exhibition, but he rejoined the Academy in 1950. In 1937 he divorced his first wife, Hilda Carline, and married Patricia Preece, but Hilda continued to play a large part in his life, and he painted pictures in memory of her and even wrote letters to her after her death. Some of his nude paintings of Patricia vividly express not only the sexual tensions of his life, but also his belief in the sanctity of human love; the best known is the double nude portrait of himself and Patricia known as <i>The Leg of Mutton Nude</i> (Tate, 1937). In his later years Spencer acquired a reputation as a landscapist as well as a figure painter. He also occasionally did portraits. There is a gallery devoted to Spencer at Cookham, containing not only paintings, but also memorabilia such as the pram that the eccentric figure used for pushing his painting equipment around the village. His younger brother <i>Gilbert Spencer </i> (1892&ndash;1979) was also a painter of imaginative subjects and landscapes, working in a style close to that of Stanley."
"Spinario","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Spinario</b><div class=""content"">(Latin: spina, a thorn). Ancient bronze statue of a seated boy extracting a thorn from his left foot (Capitoline Museum, Rome). It is recorded in Rome as early as the 12th cent. and during the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> it was one of the most influential and copied of ancient sculptures. Its fame endured and it was one of the ancient works taken by Napoleon to Paris, where it remained from 1798 to 1815. Various stories grew up from the Renaissance onwards to explain the subject, the most popular being that the statue commemorates a shepherd boy called Martius who delivered an important message to the Roman Senate and only when his task was accomplished stopped to remove a thorn from his foot. It is now generally thought that the <i>Spinario</i> is a Roman pastiche of about the 1st cent. BC, combining a <a href=""entry://Hellenistic""><span class=""links"">Hellenistic</span></a> body with a head of earlier date (the way in which the hair falls indicates that the head was meant to be in an upright position rather than looking down as it is now)."

<b>Squarcione, Francesco</b><div class=""content""><i>(1397&ndash;<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1468).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, active in Padua. He is an enigmatic figure, who is important in terms of the pupils he trained, rather than for his own work. A Paduan writer of 1560 patriotically described him as a famous and benevolent master, with many pupils and a large collection of <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> sculpture gathered on youthful journeys through Greece and Italy. More recent research, however, gives a picture of a tailor who, turning painter in his middle thirties, was for many years discreditably involved in a series of lawsuits with pupils who, resentful of his exploitation of their talents, had broken their apprenticeships with him (<a href=""entry://Mantegna, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Mantegna </span></a> was the most famous litigant). No traces of his collection remain, but it is likely that something of the antiquarian erudition of the university town of Padua rubbed off on the young men who spent time in his workshop. It is impossible to assess any stylistic debt to Squarcione himself, however, as so little is known about his work, and his traditional role as the founder of a distinctive ‘Paduan style’ is highly questionable."
"St Ives School","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>St Ives School</b>.<div class=""content"">A loosely structured group of artists, flourishing particularly from the late 1940s to the early 1960s, who concentrated their activities in the Cornish fishing village of St Ives. Like <a href=""entry://Newlyn School""><span class=""links"">Newlyn</span></a>, St Ives had been popular with artists long before this, but it did not become of more than local importance in painting and sculpture until Barbara <a href=""entry://Hepworth, Dame Barbara""><span class=""links"">Hepworth </span></a> and Ben <a href=""entry://Nicholson, Ben""><span class=""links"">Nicholson </span></a> moved there in 1939, two weeks before the outbreak of the Second World War. They were anxious that their children should be safely outside London, and their friend Adrian <a href=""entry://Stokes, Adrian""><span class=""links"">Stokes </span></a>, who lived at Corbis Bay (virtually a suburb of St Ives), invited the family to stay with him. Hepworth lived in St Ives for the rest of her life (her studio is now a museum of her work) and Nicholson (who had discovered Alfred <a href=""entry://Wallis, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Wallis </span></a> on a day-trip to St Ives in 1928) lived there until 1958. They formed the nucleus of a group of avant-garde artists who made the town an internationally recognized centre of abstract art, and it is to these artists that the term ‘St Ives School’ is usually applied, even though many of them had little in common stylistically, apart from an interest in portraying the local landscape in abstract terms. The one with the greatest international prestige was Naum <a href=""entry://Gabo, Naum""><span class=""links"">Gabo </span></a>, who lived in St Ives from 1939 to 1946. After the war a number of abstract painters settled in or near the town or made regular visits. The residents included Terry <a href=""entry://Frost, Terry""><span class=""links"">Frost </span></a> and Patrick <a href=""entry://Heron, Patrick""><span class=""links"">Heron </span></a>; the visitors included Roger <a href=""entry://Hilton, Roger""><span class=""links"">Hilton </span></a> (who eventually settled in St Ives in 1965), Adrian <a href=""entry://Heath, Adrian""><span class=""links"">Heath </span></a>, and Victor <a href=""entry://Pasmore, Victor""><span class=""links"">Pasmore </span></a>. Peter Lanyon (1918&ndash;64) was the only notable abstract artist to be born in St Ives. The heyday of the St Ives School was over by the mid-1960s, but the town continued to be an artistic centre. In 1993 the Tate Gallery opened a branch museum there (The Tate Gallery St Ives), housing changing displays of the work of 20th-cent. artists associated with the town. The building includes a stained-glass window commissioned from Patrick Heron ."

They were founded in 1720 and 1735 respectively and each was a drawing and painting class rather than a professional institution.

<b>staffage</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to small figures and animals in a painting that are not essential to the subject but are used to animate the composition.

"stained glass","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stained glass</b>.<div class=""content"">Glass that has been given translucent colour in any of various ways, used particularly for creating pictorial designs in church windows. The art began in the service of the Christian Church and is of Byzantine origin, but in its most characteristic development and its highest achievements it is essentially an art of Western Christendom, practised most splendidly in the west and north of Europe as an adjunct to <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> architecture. Its early history is obscure, and the first surviving complete windows&mdash;in Augsburg Cathedral and dated <i>c.</i>1050&ndash;1150&mdash;show an art already nearly perfect in technique. Medieval windows are generally made up of hundreds of small pieces of glass of varied colours and shapes held together by strips of lead&mdash;somewhat like a jigsaw puzzle with dark outlines around the pieces. Windows of any size were made up of several panels so treated, and these were set in a framework of iron (‘armature’) that served not only as a support against wind pressure, but also to accentuate the main lines of the design of the window. The period from roughly 1150 to 1250 was the greatest age of stained glass: colours were strong and simple; designs were bold and fresh; and the feelings conveyed were lofty and awe-inspiring. From the 15th cent. stained glass tended towards a greater pictorialism, imitating the effects of oil painting, and this trend reached its height in the 18th cent., when some artists painted on glass more or less as they would on canvas. With the Gothic Revival in the 19th cent. there came a return to medieval principles, and William <a href=""entry://Morris, William""><span class=""links"">Morris </span></a> and his associates (notably <a href=""entry://Burne-Jones, Sir Edward Coley""><span class=""links"">Burne-Jones </span></a>) were among the foremost designers in this spirit.

<b>Stanfield, Clarkson</b><div class=""content""><i>(1793&ndash;1867).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, best known for his marine subjects. From 1808 to 1818 he was a sailor, first in the merchant service and then, after being press-ganged in 1812, in the Royal Navy. He was invalided after being disabled in a fall from the rigging, and took up painting as a career on the advice of his captain at the time, the novelist Frederick Marryat . His initial success came as a scene painter (he won renown for his spectacular <a href=""entry://diorama""><span class=""links"">dioramas</span></a> at the Drury Lane Theatre), but from the 1830s he concentrated on easel paintings.

"state","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>state</b>.<div class=""content"">Term applied to any of the stages through which a <a href=""entry://print""><span class=""links"">print</span></a> may pass as an artist alters the design. The first state is represented by the first proof taken from the plate. If no alterations are made this can also be described as the ‘only state’.

"Staël, Nicolas de","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Staël, Nicolas de</b><div class=""content""><i>(1914&ndash;55).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Russian-French painter, born in St Petersburg, son of Baron Vladimir Ivanovich de Staël-Holstein . In 1919 his family was forced to leave Russia (he would later become incensed if anyone suggested they had ‘fled’) and moved to Poland. Both parents had died by 1922 and Nicolas and his two sisters were adopted by a family of rich Russian expatriates in Brussels, where he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts, 1932&ndash;6. In the next two years he travelled widely (France, Italy, Spain, North Africa), then in 1938 settled in Paris, where he studied briefly with <a href=""entry://Léger, Fernand""><span class=""links"">Leger. </span></a>. On the outbreak of war in 1939 he joined the Foreign Legion and was sent to Tunisia. He was demobilized in 1941 and moved to Nice, where he turned from figurative to abstract art, although the forms he used were usually suggested by real objects. In 1943 he returned to Paris and after the war he quickly gained a reputation as one of the leading abstract painters of the School of <a href=""entry://Paris, School of""><span class=""links"">Paris</span></a>, his work showing a sensuous delight in handling paint that was unrivalled at the time. Typically his works feature luscious blocks or patches of thick paint (often applied with a knife), subtly varied in colour and texture. In 1951 he began to reintroduce figurative elements into his work, his subjects including landscapes and still life. From 1952 he spent much of his time working in the bright light of the South of France, and his late works are often very intense in colour. In spite of critical and financial success, de Staël felt that he had failed to reach a satisfactory compromise between abstraction and figuration, and he committed suicide."
"Steen, Jan","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Steen, Jan</b><div class=""content""><i>(1625/6&ndash;79).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter. He is best known for his humorous <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes, warm-hearted and animated works in which he treats life as a vast comedy of manners. In Holland he ranks next to <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Vermeer, Jan""><span class=""links"">Vermeer </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Hals, Frans""><span class=""links"">Hals </span></a> in popularity and a ‘Jan Steen household’ has become an epithet for an untidy house. But Steen, one of the most prolific Dutch artists, has many other facets. He painted portraits, historical, mythological, and religious subjects (he was a Catholic), and the animals, birds, and still lifes in his pictures rival those by any of his specialist contemporaries. As a painter of children he was unsurpassed. Steen was born in Leiden and is said to have studied with Adriaen van <a href=""entry://Ostade, Adriaen van""><span class=""links"">Ostade </span></a> in Haarlem and Jan van <a href=""entry://Goyen, Jan van""><span class=""links"">Goyen </span></a> (who became his father-in-law) in The Hague. He worked in various towns&mdash;Leiden, The Hague, Delft, Warmond, and Haarlem&mdash;and in 1672 he opened a tavern in Leiden. His father had been a brewer, and in the popular imagination Steen was a drunken profligate, but there is nothing in the known facts of his life to justify this reputation. Many of his pictures represent taverns and festive gatherings, but they often feature moralizing allusions, and he also painted scenes of impeccable genteelness. Apart from his versatility, richness of characterization, and inventiveness in composition, Steen is remarkable also for his skill as a colourist, his handling of salmon-red, rose, pale yellow, and blue-green being highly distinctive. He had no recorded pupils, but his work was widely imitated."

"Steer, Philip Wilson","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Steer, Philip Wilson</b><div class=""content""><i>(1860&ndash;1942).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, son of a portrait painter <i>Philip Steer </i> (1810&ndash;71). With <a href=""entry://Sickert, Walter Richard""><span class=""links"">Sickert </span></a> (his friend and exact contemporary), Steer was the leader in his generation of those progressive British artists who looked to France for inspiration. He trained in Paris 1882&ndash;4 (revisiting France four times between 1887 and 1891), and was a founder member of the <a href=""entry://New English Art Club""><span class=""links"">New English Art Club</span></a> in 1886. In 1892 the Anglo-Irish novelist George Moore wrote ‘it is admitted that Mr Steer takes a foremost place in what is known as the modern movement’ and around this time Steer was indeed at his peak, producing the beach scenes and seascapes that are regarded not only as his finest works but also as the best <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> pictures painted by an Englishman. They are remarkable for their great freshness and their subtle handling of light, and unlike Sickert's paintings they are devoid of any social or literary content. After about 1895 his work became more conventional and more closely linked to the English tradition of <a href=""entry://Gainsborough, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Gainsborough </span></a> (especially in his portraits), <a href=""entry://Turner, J.

"Stein, Gertrude","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Stein, Gertrude</b><div class=""content""><i>(1874&ndash;1946).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American writer, collector, hostess, eccentric, and self-styled genius. She settled in Paris in 1903 and her home at 27 rue de Fleurus became famous as a literary and artistic salon; many distinguished American visitors to Paris found it their introduction to modern French painting. With her brother, the art critic <i>Leo Stein </i> (1872&ndash;1947), who lived with her from 1903 to 1912, she was one of the first collectors of the work of <a href=""entry://Braque, Georges""><span class=""links"">Braque </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a> (who painted a well-known portrait of Gertrude, 1905&ndash;6, Metropolitan Museum, New York); another brother, <i>Michael</i>, and his wife Sarah, were also collectors. Gertrude's writings, which she claimed to be a literary counterpart to <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, are largely unintelligible, concerned with the rhythm and sound of words rather than their meaning. The best-known and most approachable of her many books is <i>The Autobiography of Alice B.

Alfred H. <a href=""entry://Barr, Alfred H., jun.""><span class=""links"">Barr </span></a> writes that Leo Stein was ‘the critic who first felt that Matisse <i>and</i> Picasso were the two important artists of his time’, but Stein later turned his back on their work, describing Cubism as ‘godalmighty rubbish’.

"Stella, Frank","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Stella, Frank</b><div class=""content""><i>(1936&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, a leading figure of <a href=""entry://Post-Painterly Abstraction""><span class=""links"">Post-Painterly Abstraction</span></a>. In his early work he was influenced by <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a>, but after settling in New York in 1958 he was impressed by the flag and target paintings of Jasper <a href=""entry://Johns, Jasper""><span class=""links"">Johns </span></a> and the direction of his art changed completely. He began to emphasize the idea that a painting is a physical object rather than a metaphor for something else, saying that he wanted to ‘eliminate illusionistic space’ and that a picture was ‘a flat surface with paint on it&mdash;nothing more’. These aims were first given expression in a series of black ‘pinstripe’ paintings in which regular black stripes were separated by very thin lines. They made a big impact when four of them were shown at the Museum of Modern Art's ‘16 Americans’ exhibition in 1959, inspiring a mixture of praise and revulsion. To identify the patterning more completely with the shape of the picture as a whole he began&mdash;from the beginning of the 1960s&mdash;to use notched and <a href=""entry://shaped canvas""><span class=""links"">shaped canvases</span></a>, often painting in flat bands of bright colour. In the 1970s he began to experiment with paintings that included cut-out shapes in relief and he abandoned his impersonal handling for a spontaneous, almost graffiti-like manner.

He was particularly influenced by <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a> and he became the leading American exponent of the style. His first and most famous Futurist painting was <i>Battle of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras</i> (Yale University Art Gallery, 1913&ndash;14), a densely fragmented portrayal of a crowded amusement park at night. In such paintings Stella gave a romanticized image of the industrialized townscape of New York. In particular he was obsessed with Brooklyn Bridge, which he described as ‘a shrine containing all the efforts of the new civilization of America’ (<i>Brooklyn Bridge</i>, Yale University Art Gallery, 1917&ndash;18). He soon abandoned the Futurist idiom, but industrial and urban themes continued to inspire him. Stella was active in the administration of two leading avant-garde associations&mdash;the <a href=""entry://Society of Independent Artists""><span class=""links"">Society of Independent Artists</span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Société Anonyme, Inc""><span class=""links"">Société Anonyme</span></a>&mdash;and in the early 1920s he experimented with various styles, including <a href=""entry://Precisionism""><span class=""links"">Precisionism</span></a>.

With the assistance of the Rector of Blandford, Stevens was sent to study in Italy when he was 15 and remained there until 1842. He worked with <a href=""entry://Thorvaldsen ""><span class=""links"">Thorvalden </span></a> in Rome, and laid the foundations of his style in the study of the masters of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, above all <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>. After his return to England he taught at the Board of Trade's School of Design, and worked as chief artist to a firm of bronze and metal-workers in Sheffield, then settled in London in 1852. In 1856 he entered the competition for the Wellington Monument to be erected in St Paul's Cathedral, and although his design was placed sixth, he was eventually awarded the commission. It occupied him for the rest of his life and was plagued with bureaucratic delays and misunderstandings. It was not finally completed until 1912, when the equestrian group at the top was cast from Stevens's model. Nevertheless, it is not only Stevens's masterpiece (indeed, the only one of his large schemes to come to fruition and survive), but also the greatest piece of sculpture produced in England in the 19th cent. The architectural elements form a splendid, bold composition, and the two bronze groups <i>Valour and Cowardice</i> and <i>Truth and Falsehood</i> have an almost <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelesque</span></a> grandeur and vigour.<br class=""nLine"" />Apart from the Wellington Monument, Stevens's finest work was the decoration for the Dining Room at Dorchester House, London (<i>c.</i>1856), a sumptuous residence built for the millionaire R. S. Holford . It was demolished in 1929 (the Dorchester Hotel now occupies the site), but a fireplace is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and many of the fittings are in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, which has an outstanding Stevens collection. He was a masterful craftsman in numerous media&mdash;marble, bronze, silver, porcelain&mdash;and was also a painter, although he destroyed much of his work because it did not satisfy him. His unexecuted designs included schemes for the decoration of the interior of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral and the Reading Room at the British Museum, recorded in his superb drawings, which are particularly well represented in Cambridge (Fitzwilliam), Liverpool (Walker), London (Tate), Oxford (Ashmolean), and Sheffield (Mappin). These drawings are very much in the High Renaissance tradition, and it is to this era that Stevens belonged in spirit."

He was a friend and supporter of <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a> and influenced <a href=""entry://Whistler, James Abbott McNeill""><span class=""links"">Whistler </span></a>, with whom he was one of the first enthusiasts for Japanese art.

His brother <i>Joseph</i> (1819&ndash;92) was also a painter, mainly of animals, and in his day was almost as famous and successful as Alfred (both brothers received the Legion of Honour). Another brother, <i>Arthur</i>, was an art critic and dealer."
"Stieglitz, Alfred","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Stieglitz, Alfred</b><div class=""content""><i>(1864&ndash;1946).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American photographer, editor, and art dealer who, during the first two decades of the 20th cent., did more than anyone else to bring the works of the European avant-garde before the American public. The son of a German immigrant, he spent most of the 1880s in Berlin and returned to the USA in 1890 with an international reputation as a photographer. His 291 Gallery (at 291 Fifth Avenue, New York), which he opened in 1905, presented the first American exhibitions of <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a> (1908), <a href=""entry://Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri de""><span class=""links"">Toulouse-Lautrec </span></a> (1909), the Douanier <a href=""entry://Rousseau, Henri""><span class=""links"">Rousseau </span></a> (1910), <a href=""entry://Picabia, Francis""><span class=""links"">Picabia </span></a> (1913), <a href=""entry://Severini, Gino""><span class=""links"">Severini </span></a> (1917), and the first one-man exhibition of <a href=""entry://Brancusi, Constantin""><span class=""links"">Brancusi </span></a> anywhere (1914). It also gave the first major exhibition of African art in America. Stieglitz also championed American artists, among them Georgia <a href=""entry://O'Keeffe, Georgia""><span class=""links"">O'Keeffe </span></a>, whom he married in 1924. From 1903 to 1917 Stieglitz edited the journal <i>Camera Work</i>, which he published from the 291 Gallery. At first devoted to photography, it was later extended to cover all the visual arts, including reviews and criticisms, and opened its pages to avant-garde American writers. The 291 Gallery was closed in 1917 when the building was pulled down, but Stieglitz continued his work with the Intimate Gallery (1925&ndash;9) and An American Place (1929&ndash;46), both of which promoted American artists of what had come to be known as the Stieglitz group. Stieglitz was a brilliant innovative artist in his own medium of photography. Learning from the avant-garde paintings which he exhibited, he experimented with various modes of abstraction and his work went a long way to revolutionize the concept of the photographic image and to establish photography as an independent art form. He formed a fine collection of art, much of which was donated to the Art Institute of Chicago."
"Stifter, Adalbert","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Stifter, Adalbert</b><div class=""content""><i>(1805&ndash;68).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Austrian writer and painter. He is now regarded as one of the outstanding Austrian novelists of the 19th cent., but he enjoyed little success in his lifetime, and full recognition of his stature came only after the First World War. For much of his career he worked as a tutor, then an educational administrator. His later years were clouded by the suicide of an adopted daughter in 1859 and he took his own life, cutting his throat with his razor, whilst suffering agonizing pain from what was thought to be cancer. As a painter he was self-taught, and as in his writing eschewed heroic events in favour of simple, everyday happenings. His sensitive perception of nature comes out in his remarkably fresh landscapes. There is a museum devoted to his work in Vienna."
"Stijl, De","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Stijl, De</b><div class=""content"">(Dutch: ‘the style’). The name of a group of Dutch artists founded in Leiden in 1917 and of the journal they published to set forth their ideas. Members of the group included painters (most notably <a href=""entry://Mondrian, Piet""><span class=""links"">Mondrian </span></a> and van <a href=""entry://Doesburg, Theo van""><span class=""links"">Doesburg </span></a>), sculptors (Georges <a href=""entry://Vantongerloo, Georges""><span class=""links"">Vantongerloo </span></a>), the architect and designer Gerald Rietveld (1888&ndash;1964), and the poet Antony Kok . They sought laws of equilibrium and harmony that would be applicable to life and society as well as art, and their style was one of austere abstract clarity (see <a href=""entry://Neo-Plasticism""><span class=""links"">NEO-PLASTICISM</span></a>). The journal was founded by van Doesburg and Mondrian in 1917 and van Doesburg continued to edit it until 1928 (it appeared roughly monthly, but irregularly; the place of publication also varied). A final issue (number 90) was published in 1932 by Mme van Doesburg in memory of her husband, after whose death in 1931 the group disbanded. At first the journal was devoted exclusively to Neo-Plasticism, but a <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dadaist</span></a> element crept in. Mondrian ceased to contribute to <i>De Stijl</i> after 1924 and in 1926 van Doesburg published the manifesto of a splinter movement that he called <a href=""entry://Elementarism""><span class=""links"">Elementarism</span></a>. Despite this lack of cohesion, <i>De Stijl</i> was probably the most influential of the many avant-garde publications in Europe between the two wars on both ideas and artistic practice. It was, however, in architecture and the applied arts (including furniture design and typography), rather than painting and sculpture, that it had its greatest influence&mdash;notably at the <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a> and in the clean-lined architectural style known as ‘International Modern’, of which Rietveld's Schröder House in Utrecht (1924) is an early and famous example."
"Still, Clyfford","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Still, Clyfford</b><div class=""content""><i>(1904&ndash;80).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter, one of the major figures of <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a> but the one least associated with the New York art scene. After working in war industries in California, 1941&ndash;3, he taught for two years at the Richmond Professional Institute, Richmond, Virginia. He then lived briefly in New York (1945&ndash;6), where he had a one-man exhibition at Peggy <a href=""entry://Guggenheim, Solomon R.""><span class=""links"">Guggenheim's </span></a> Art of This Century gallery in 1946. Although he stood somewhat apart from the other Abstract Expressionists, he was friendly with Mark <a href=""entry://Rothko, Mark""><span class=""links"">Rothko </span></a> (they had met in 1943), the two men sharing a sense of almost mystical fervour about their work. In 1946&ndash;50 he taught at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, then lived in New York, 1950&ndash;61. By the time he returned to New York Still had created his mature style and had a rapidly growing reputation. He was one of the pioneers of the very large, virtually monochromatic painting. But unlike <a href=""entry://Newman, Barnett""><span class=""links"">Newman </span></a> and Rothko, who used fairly flat, unmodulated pigment, Still used heavily loaded, expressively modulated impasto in jagged forms. His work can have a raw aggressive power, but in the 1960s it became more lyrical. In 1961 Still moved to Maryland to work in tranquillity away from the art world. Scorning galleries, dealers, and critics, and rarely exhibiting, he considered himself something of a visionary who needed solitude to give expression to his high spiritual purpose, and he gained a reputation for cantankerousness and pretentiousness&mdash;his comment on his painting <i>1953</i> (Tate Gallery, London, 1953) is typical of his high-flown prose: ‘there was a conscious intention to emphasize the quiescent depths of the blue by the broken red at its lower edge while expanding its inherent dynamic beyond the geometries of the constricting frame
In addition, the yellow wedge at the top is a re-assertion of the human context&mdash;a gesture of rejection of any authoritarian rationale or system of politico-dialectical dogma.’ Still presented large groups of his paintings to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and the San Francisco Museum of Art, and his work is represented in many other major collections."

<b>Stone, Nicholas</b><div class=""content""><i>(1587&ndash;1647).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English sculptor, mason, and architect. The son of a Devonshire quarryman, he trained in London, then in 1606 he went as a journeyman to the Amsterdam workshop of Hendrik de <a href=""entry://Keyser, Hendrick de""><span class=""links"">Keyser </span></a>, whose daughter he married. On his return to London in 1613 he quickly established himself as the outstanding tomb sculptor in the country. He surpassed his contemporaries in technical skill as a marble cutter and outdid them in introducing new ideas: the monument to Francis Holles (d. 1622; Westminster Abbey) has the first English example of a figure in Roman armour, and that to John Donne (made from Donne's own design, St Paul's Cathedral, 1631) shows the great preacher and poet standing erect in his shroud. In 1619 Stone became Master Mason for Inigo <a href=""entry://Jones, Inigo""><span class=""links"">Jones's </span></a> Banqueting House at Whitehall, and in 1632 Master Mason to the Crown. His contact with the court gave him a knowledge of the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> sculpture in Charles I's collection and his work after <i>c.</i>1630 shows a change in style, marked by an attempt to imitate antique drapery (Lyttelton Monument, Magdalen Coll., Oxford, 1634). His large workshop produced monuments of many types, and we are unusually well informed about its activities, as an office notebook covering the period 1614&ndash;41 and an account book for the period 1631&ndash;42 still survive (Soane Mus., London). Much less of his work as an architect is extant (and it is sometimes not clear whether he was the designer as well as the mason of the buildings on which he worked), but he is recognized as the creator of ‘a vernacular classical architecture of considerable charm and accomplishment’ (H. M. Colvin, <i>A Bio-graphical Dictionary of British Architects 1600&ndash;1840</i>, 1978). The youngest of Stone's three sons, <i>John Stone </i> (1620&ndash;67), ran the family practice after his father's death, even though he does not appear to have been a sculptor himself."

He is first recorded in 1477, when he moved from Nuremberg to Cracow in Poland. There he carved his largest work, the huge altarpiece for St Mary's Church (1477&ndash;89), and also made the red marble tomb of King Casimir IV in the cathedral (1492). In 1496 he returned to Nuremberg, where his successful career was blighted when (in an attempt to recoup some money he regarded as having been misappropriated in an investment) he forged a document in 1503 and was convicted and branded through both cheeks. He was also confined to the city limits of Nuremberg (he fled but returned), and although he was to some extent rehabilitated, he never regained his former position. He died a wealthy man, but his old age was embittered by disputes with the city authorities.<br class=""nLine"" />A good many documented and signed works by Stoss survive and his style is distinctive&mdash;bold and powerfully characterized, with exaggerated gestures and expressions and draperies rendered in an ornate, almost calligraphic manner. Indeed, Stoss's work is so individual that the famous figure of <i>St Roch</i> in SS. Annuziata, Florence, is almost universally accepted as his, even though it is undocumented and was attributed by <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> to ‘Janni Francese’ (Janni the Frenchman). Vasari wrote eloquently of the virtuosity of the carving, describing the draperies as ‘cut almost to the thinness of paper, and with a beautiful flow in the arrangement of the folds, so that nothing more wonderful is to be seen’. Stoss sometimes, as here, left his figures unpainted, but otherwise his work is entirely in the late <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> spirit. He is recorded as being a painter and engraver as well as a sculptor and he also declared himself competent as a civil engineer. His work had great influence in Germany."

In the words of Sir Ellis <a href=""entry://Waterhouse, Sir Ellis""><span class=""links"">Waterhouse </span></a>, ‘he left no branch of painting untried and would have been a universal genius had he been endowed with the requisite talent.’ The most important of his few surviving works is the allegorical ceiling painting representing <i>The Triumph of Truth and the Arts</i> (1668&ndash;9) in the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford.

In about 1610 he was allowed to leave his community to look after his sick and widowed mother, and after she died in 1630 he is said to have been pressurized to return, this accounting for his move in 1631 to Venice (where he spent the rest of his life). Strozzi was successful and prolific in both Genoa and Venice, painting portraits and allegorical and <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes (often of musicians) as well as religious works.

With <a href=""entry://Copley, John Singleton""><span class=""links"">Copley </span></a> he was the outstanding American portraitist of his period and he is regarded as the creator of a distinctively American style of portraiture. Much of his early career was spent in Scotland (<i>c.</i>1771&ndash;2), England (1775&ndash;87), and Ireland (1787&ndash;92). After he settled permanently in America in 1792, he worked briefly in New York City, then moved to Philadelphia, and finally settled in Boston in 1805. He quickly established himself as the outstanding portraitist in the country and painted many of the notables of the new republic. His portraits of George Washington are his most famous works&mdash;he created three types, all of which were endlessly copied: the ‘Vaughan’ type (NG, Washington, 1795), the ‘Lansdowne’ type (Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, 1796), and the ‘Athenaeum’ type (Mus. of Fine Arts, Boston, 1796), which is one of the most famous images in American art, being used on the country's one-dollar bill. Stuart's style is notable for its strength of characterization (Benjamin <a href=""entry://West, Benjamin""><span class=""links"">West </span></a> said he ‘<i>nails</i> the face to the canvas’) and its fluent brushwork.

"Stubbs, George","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Stubbs, George</b><div class=""content""><i>(1724&ndash;1806).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English animal painter and engraver, celebrated as the greatest of all horse painters. He was born in Liverpool, the son of a currier and leather-seller, and his life up to his mid-30s (which is poorly documented) was spent mainly in the north of England. Virtually self-taught as a painter and engraver, he seems to have earned his living mainly as a portraitist early in his career, and he also made the illustrations (based on his own dissections) for Dr John Burton's treatise on midwifery (1751). In 1754 he visited Rome, then spent 18 months dissecting and drawing horses in preparation for a book on equine anatomy. He moved to London in about 1758 and, unable to find an engraver to do the work, he made the plates himself, and in 1766 published his famous book&mdash;<i>The Anatomy of the Horse</i>. It was a great success, prized for its beauty as well as its scientific accuracy and Stubbs was soon in demand as a painter, not only for his ‘portraits’ of horses with their owners or grooms, but also for his conversation pieces in which the sitters were grouped in and around a carriage. His command of anatomy was matched by his ability to depict the beauty and grace of his equine subjects without sentimentalizing them and his range of feeling was wide, extending from the lyrical calm of <i>Mares and Foals in a River Landscape</i> (Tate, London, <i>c.</i>1763&ndash;8) to the full-blooded <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a> of his series of pictures on the theme of a horse attacked by a lion (the largest&mdash;<i>c.</i>1762&mdash;is in the Yale Center for British Art). Stubbs is said to have derived his fascination for the subject from having witnessed a lion attacking a horse in Morocco on his way back from Italy, but he may also have been familiar with a much copied <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> statue on the theme. Stubbs painted many other animals apart from horses&mdash;among them a moose, a rhinoceros, and a zebra. At his death he was working on <i>A Comparative Anatomical Exposition of the Structure of the Human Body with that of a Tiger and a Common Fowl</i>, the drawings for which are in the Yale Center for British Art. His scientific curiosity extended to the materials he used and he experimented with painting in <a href=""entry://enamel""><span class=""links"">enamel</span></a> on earthenware panels manufactured for him by the great potter Josiah Wedgwood. Stubbs's work became less popular during the 1780s and by the end of his life he was in financial difficulties. He kept his great powers until the end, however, and one of his finest works, painted when he was 75, is the enormous <i>Hambletonian, Rubbing Down</i> (National Trust, Mount Stewart, 1799), showing the champion horse looking strained and exhausted after winning a race in which it was ‘much cut with the whip’ and ‘shockingly goaded’ with the spur. It is a magnificent, heroic, almost tragic image. Stubbs was for long classified as a superior sporting painter, but his reputation now stands very high; indeed he is placed alongside <a href=""entry://Gainsborough, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Gainsborough </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a> in the front rank of English painters of his age."

In Europe it was exploited most fully from the 16th cent. to the 18th cent., notable exponents being the artists of the School of <a href=""entry://Fontainebleau, School of""><span class=""links"">Fontainebleau</span></a> and Giacomo <a href=""entry://Serpotta, Giacomo""><span class=""links"">Serpotta </span></a>. By adding large quantities of glue and colour to the stucco mixture <i>stuccatori</i> were able to produce a material that could take a high polish and assume the appearance of marble. Indeed, sometimes it is difficult to distinguish from real marble without touching it (stucco feels warmer)."

"Sublime","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Sublime</b>.<div class=""content"">Term that came into general use in the 18th cent. to denote a new <a href=""entry://Aestheticism""><span class=""links"">aesthetic</span></a> concept that was held to be distinct from the beautiful and the <a href=""entry://Picturesque""><span class=""links"">Picturesque</span></a> and was associated with ideas of awe and vastness. The outstanding work on the concept of the Sublime in English was Edmund Burke's <i>A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</i> (1757). This book was one of the first to realize (in contrast with the emphasis on clarity and precision during the Age of Enlightenment) the power of suggestiveness to stimulate imagination. Speaking of painting Burke says that ‘a judicious obscurity in some things contributes to the effect of the picture’, because in art as in nature ‘dark, confused, uncertain images have a greater power on the fancy to form the grander passions than those which are more clear and determinate.’ The cult of the Sublime had varied expressions in the visual arts, notably the taste for the ‘savage’ landscapes of Salvator <a href=""entry://Rosa, Salvator""><span class=""links"">Rosa </span></a> and the popularity among painters of subjects from Homer, John Milton, and Ossian (the legendary Gaelic warrior and bard, whose verses&mdash;actually fabrications&mdash;were published in the 1760s to great acclaim). In literature, the ‘Gothic novel’, in which mystery and horror were the essential ingredients, appealed to the same sentiments. The first Gothic novel was Horace <a href=""entry://Walpole, Horace""><span class=""links"">Walpole's </span></a>
<i>The Castle of Otranto</i> (1764), and when crossing the Alps in 1739 Walpole expressed the essence of the imaginative appeal of the Sublime in his memorable exclamation: ‘Precipices, mountains, torrents, wolves, rumblings&mdash;Salvator Rosa .’ The vogue for the Sublime, with that for the Picturesque, helped shape the attitudes that led to <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a>."

Suger commissioned several items of furnishing and sacred vessels for the abbey, some of which survive, notably an antique porphyry vase he had converted into the shape of an eagle (Louvre, Paris)."

"Superrealism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Superrealism</b>.<div class=""content"">Style of painting (and to a lesser extent sculpture), popular from the late 1960s, particularly in the USA and Britain, in which subjects are depicted with a minute and impersonal exactitude of detail. Hyperrealism and Photographic Realism (or Photorealism) are alternative names, and some artists who practise the style do indeed work from photographs (sometimes using colour slides projected on the canvas); sharpness of detail is evenly distributed over the whole picture (except where out-of-focus effects in the photograph are faithfully recorded), but the scale is sometimes greatly enlarged. (Some critics prefer to use the terms ‘Photographic Realism’ or ‘Photorealism’ only when a picture has been painted direct from a photograph, but most are not so restrictive.) The immediate progenitor of Superrealism was <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a>; banal subject-matter from the consumer society was common to both, and certain artists, such as Malcolm <a href=""entry://Morley, Malcolm""><span class=""links"">Morley </span></a> (who coined the word Superrealism) and Mel <a href=""entry://Ramos, Mel""><span class=""links"">Ramos </span></a>, overlap both fields. The kind of humour found in Pop is very rare in Superrealism, however, which tends to be cool and impersonal, with subjects often chosen because they are technically challenging (involving multiple reflections, for example). Like Pop, Superrealism was a hit commercially, but it was less well received critically. Some critics, indeed, regard it as involving a great deal of painstaking work but very little else; others think that its exponents can achieve a strange kind of intensity, the effect of the indiscriminate attention to detail being&mdash;somewhat paradoxically&mdash;to create a strong feeling of unreality.<br class=""nLine"" />The leading American Superrealist painters include: Chuck Close (1940&ndash; ), whose speciality is giant portrait heads; Don Eddy (1944&ndash; ), notable for scenes involving reflections in shop windows; Richard Estes (1936&ndash; ), most of whose work is devoted to the urban landscape; and Audrey Flack (1931&ndash; ), who is unusual in that she aims for emotional effect in her still lifes of religious symbols and images of vanity and death. Philip <a href=""entry://Pearlstein, Philip""><span class=""links"">Pearlstein </span></a> is sometimes labelled a Superrealist but stands somewhat apart. British Superrealist painters include Graham Dean (1951&ndash; ), Michael English (1943&ndash; ), and Michael Leonard (1933&ndash; ), whose work includes highly detailed portrait drawings in a style mimicking the Old Masters. The leading Superrealist sculptors are the Americans John <a href=""entry://De Andrea, John""><span class=""links"">De Andrea </span></a> and Duane <a href=""entry://Hanson, Duane""><span class=""links"">Hanson </span></a>, who often use real clothes or props and attend to minutiae such as body hair."

His Suprematist paintings were the most radically pure abstract works created up to that date, for he limited himself to basic geometric shapes&mdash;the square, rectangle, circle, cross, and triangle&mdash;and a narrow range of colours, reaching the ultimate distillation of his ideas in a series of paintings of a white square on a white ground (<i>c.</i>1918) after which he announced the end of Suprematism. In constrast to <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivism</span></a>, where the stress was on the utilitarian function of art, Suprematism was a vehicle for Malevich's spiritual ideas; he wrote that ‘The Suprematists have deliberately given up the objective representation of their surroundings in order to reach the summit of the “unmasked” art and from this vantage point to view life through the prism of pure artistic feeling.’ Although Malevich's direct followers in Russia were of minor account, Suprematism had great influence on the development of art and design in the West."

"Surrealism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Surrealism</b>.<div class=""content"">Movement in art and literature flourishing in the 1920s and 1930s, characterized by a fascination with the bizarre, the incongruous, and the irrational. It was closely related to <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada</span></a>, its principal source; several artists figured successively in both movements, each of which was conceived as a revolutionary mode of thought and action&mdash;a way of life rather than a set of stylistic attitudes. Both were strongly antirationalist and much concerned with creating effects that were disturbing or shocking, but whereas Dada was essentially nihilist, Surrealism was positive in spirit. Surrealism originated in France. Its founder and chief spokesman was the writer André <a href=""entry://Breton, André""><span class=""links"">Breton </span></a>, who officially launched the movement with his first <i>Manifeste du surréalisme</i>, published in 1924. The central idea of the movement was to release the creative powers of the subconscious mind, or as Breton put it, ‘to resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality’. Within this general aim Surrealism embraced a large number of different and not altogether coherent doctrines and techniques, characteristically aimed at breaching the dominance of reason and conscious control by methods designed to release primitive urges and imagery. Breton and other members of the movement drew liberally on Freud's theories concerning the subconscious and its relation to dreams. The way in which Surrealist artists set about exploration of submerged impulses and imagery varied greatly (in spite of Breton's demands there was little doctrinal unity, and defections, expulsions, and personal attacks are a feature of the history of the movement). Some artists, for example <a href=""entry://Ernst, Max""><span class=""links"">Ernst </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Masson, André""><span class=""links"">Masson </span></a>, cultivated various spontaneous techniques such as <a href=""entry://frottage""><i><span class=""links"">frottage</i></span></a> in an effort to eliminate conscious control. At the other extreme, <a href=""entry://Dalí, Salvador""><span class=""links"">Dali </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Magritte, René""><span class=""links"">Magritte </span></a>, and others painted in a scrupulously detailed manner to give a hallucinatory sense of reality to scenes that make no rational sense.<br class=""nLine"" />Paris remained the centre of Surrealism until the Second World War, when the emigration of many European artists to the USA made New York the new hub of its activity. However, it became the most widely disseminated and controversial aesthetic movement of the 1920s and 1930s, spread partly by a series of major international exhibitions. Two of the most important took place in 1936: the International Surrealist Exhibition at the New Burlington Galleries in London, and ‘Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism’ at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Surrealism did not take root in Germany (Ernst, the major German Surrealist, lived mostly in France and the USA), but it flourished vigorously in Belgium&mdash;in the work particularly of Magritte, the most inspired of all Surrealist painters, and <a href=""entry://Delvaux, Paul""><span class=""links"">Delvaux </span></a>, the most long-lived upholder of the tradition. Many artists who were not in sympathy with the political aims of Surrealism (for a time it was associated with the French Communist Party), and who were never formal members of the movement, nevertheless found its ideas stimulating and were influenced by its imagery. In Britain, Henry <a href=""entry://Moore, Henry""><span class=""links"">Moore </span></a> and Paul <a href=""entry://Nash, Paul""><span class=""links"">Nash </span></a> were among the major artists who went through a Surrealist phase. The English Surrealist Group was founded in 1936, but it was social rather than revolutionary in its aims.<br class=""nLine"" />Although it broke up as an organized movement during the war and by this time had spent its main force, the spirit of Surrealism lived on. With its stress on the marvellous and the poetic, Surrealism offered an alternative approach to the formalism of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> and various types of abstract art, and its methods and techniques continued to influence artists in many countries. It was, for example, a fundamental source for <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a>."
"Sutherland, Graham","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Sutherland, Graham</b><div class=""content""><i>(1903&ndash;80).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, graphic artist, and designer. He abandoned an apprenticeship as a railway engineer to study engraving and etching, 1921&ndash;6, and up to 1930 worked exclusively as a graphic artist. His etchings of this period are in the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> and visionary tradition of Samuel <a href=""entry://Palmer, Samuel""><span class=""links"">Palmer </span></a>. In the early 1930s he began experimenting with oils (following a decline in the market for prints), and by 1935 he had turned mainly to painting. His paintings of the 1930s show a highly subjective response to nature, inspired mainly by visits to Pembrokeshire. He had a vivid gift of visual metaphor and his landscapes are not scenic, but semi-abstract patterns of haunting and monstrous shapes rendered in his distinctively acidic colouring (<i>Entrance to a Lane</i>, Tate, London, 1939). During the war years he was employed as an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a> to record the effects of bombing, and his work matured as he wrestled with the problems of finding a visual surrogate for the devastation and the destruction of man-made things. Soon after the war he took up religious painting, with a <i>Crucifixion</i> (1946) for St Matthew's, Northampton (he received the commission at the dedication of Henry <a href=""entry://Moore, Henry""><span class=""links"">Moore's </span></a>
<i>Madonna and Child</i> in this church), and also portraiture, with <i>Somerset Maugham</i> (Tate, 1949). It was in these two fields that he chiefly made his mark in his later career. The Maugham portrait has an almost <a href=""entry://caricature""><span class=""links"">caricature</span></a> quality (Maugham's friend Sir Gerald <a href=""entry://Kelly, Sir Gerald""><span class=""links"">Kelly </span></a> said it made him look ‘like an old Chinese madam in a brothel in Shanghai’), and his most famous portrait, that of Winston Churchill (1954), was so hated by the sitter that Lady Churchill destroyed it. Sutherland's most celebrated work, however, has become widely popular&mdash;it is the immense tapestry of <i>Christ in Glory</i> (completed 1962) in Coventry Cathedral. Sutherland continued to paint landscapes&mdash;his first love&mdash;often inspired by the French Riviera, where he lived for part of every year from 1947. Apart from paintings and graphic art, his work included ceramics and designing posters and stage costumes and decor. He was one of the most famous British artists of the 20th cent. and received many honours, notably the Order of Merit in 1960."

<b>Sweerts, Michiel</b><div class=""content""><i>(1618&ndash;64).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Flemish painter, an enigmatic and exceedingly attractive artist. Nothing is known of his training or early career. From about 1646 to about 1656 he was in Rome, where he came into contact with the <i>Bamboccianti</i> (see <a href=""entry://Laer, Pieter van""><span class=""links"">LAER, PIETER VAN</span></a>). He painted <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes in their manner, but his work is in a class apart because of the quiet, melancholy dignity of his figures and his exquisite silvery tonality. His other pictures in Rome included views of artists' studios (an example dated 1652 is in the Detroit Institute of Arts). By 1656 Sweerts had returned to his native Brussels, where in 1659 he became a member of the painters' guild. In 1661 he was in Amsterdam, where he joined a missionary group, and he sailed from Marseilles to the Orient in the following year. Sweerts was found quarrelsome and unsuitable, however, and was dismissed; he died at Goa in India. Towards the end of his career, Sweerts seemed to have worked mainly as a portraitist. Like his genre scenes, his portraits are distinguished by delicate and subdued colour harmonies and great sensitivity of expression and handling. They have often been compared with the work of <a href=""entry://Vermeer, Jan""><span class=""links"">Vermeer </span></a>, to whom Sweerts's <i>Portrait of a Girl</i> (Leicestershire Museum and Art Gallery, Leicester) was once attributed."
"Symbolism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Symbolism</b>.<div class=""content"">A loosely organized movement in literature and the visual arts, flourishing <i>c.</i>1885&ndash;<i>c.</i>1910, characterized by a rejection of direct, literal representation in favour of evocation and suggestion. It was part of a broad anti-materialist and anti-rationalist trend in ideas and art towards the end of the 19th cent. and specifically marked a reaction against the naturalistic aims of <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a>. Symbolist painters tried to give visual expression to emotional experiences, or as the poet Jean Moréas put it in a Symbolist Manifesto published in <i>Le Figaro</i> on 18 September 1886, ‘to clothe the idea in sensuous form’. Just as Symbolist poets thought there was a close correspondence between the sound and rhythm of words and their meaning, so Symbolist painters thought that colour and line in themselves could express ideas. Symbolist critics were much given to drawing parallels between the arts, and <a href=""entry://Redon, Odilon""><span class=""links"">Redon's </span></a> paintings, for example, were compared with the poetry of Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe and with the music of Claude Debussy. Many painters were inspired by the same kind of imagery as Symbolist writers (the <i>femme fatale</i> is a common theme), but <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin </span></a> and his followers (see <a href=""entry://Synthetism""><span class=""links"">SYNTHETISM</span></a>) chose much less flamboyant subjects, often peasant scenes. Religious feeling of an intense, mystical kind was a feature of the movement, but so was an interest in the erotic and the perverse&mdash;death, disease, and sin were favourite subjects. Stylistically, Symbolist artists varied greatly, from a love of exotic detail to an almost primitive simplicity in the conception of the subject, and from firm outlines to misty softness in the delineation of form. A general tendency, however, was towards flattened forms and broad areas of colour&mdash;in tune with <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionism</span></a> in general. By freeing painting from what Gauguin called ‘the shackles of probability’ the movement helped to create the aesthetic premisses of much 20th-cent. art. Although chiefly associated with France, Symbolism had international currency, and such diverse artists as <a href=""entry://Hodler, Ferdinand""><span class=""links"">Hodler </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Munch, Edvard""><span class=""links"">Munch </span></a> are regarded as part of the movement in its broadest sense.

The term ‘synchromism’ means literally ‘colours together’ and both Russell and Macdonald-Wright were much concerned with the purely abstract use of colour; in 1912 Russell said that he wished to do ‘a piece of expression solely by means of colour and the way it is put down, in showers and broad patches, distinctly separated from each other, or blended
but with force and clearness and large geometric patterns’. Synchromism was very close to <a href=""entry://Orphism""><span class=""links"">Orphism</span></a> and the two Americans protested in manifestos that they had primacy.

The religious works he painted after this date are unexceptional, but as a still-life painter he ranks with the great names of European painting. Characteristically he depicts a few simple fruits or vegetables, arranged on a ledge or shelf with an almost geometric clarity and standing out against a dark background (<i>Quince, Cabbage, Melon, Cucumber</i>, San Diego Museum of Art, 1602). Each form is scrutinized with such intensity that the pictures take on a mystical quality, conveying a feeling of wonder and humility in front of the humblest items in God's creation.

Her pictures are mainly fantastic, minutely detailed compositions of fruit, leaves, and flowers. She was intensely devout and painted in a trance-like state of religious ecstasy, regarding her works as offerings to the Virgin Mary. In the late 1920s her reason began to fail and she became obsessed with visions of the end of the world. She died in a home for the aged at Clermont."

He became the principal theorist of the group, and after visiting the school of religious painting at the Benedictine monastery at Beuron in Germany in 1897 and 1903 his ideas were permeated with concepts of religious symbolism. His theories were set out in his influential book <i>ABC de la Peinture</i> (1921), which deals with colour relationships and systems of proportion. Sérusier's paintings, which largely feature Brittany peasants and after about 1900 religious subjects, are generally considered of less interest than his writings."

"Tachisme","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Tachisme</b>.<div class=""content"">A style of abstract painting popular in the late 1940s and 1950s characterized by irregular dabs or splotches of colour (<i>tache</i> is French for spot or blotch). The term was given wide currency by the French critic Michel Tapié in his book <i>Un Art autre</i> (1952). Tachisme had affinities with <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a> (although it initially developed independently of it) in that it strove to be completely spontaneous and instinctive, excluding deliberation and formal planning, and the term is often used as a generic label for any European painting of the time that parallels the American movement. However, Tachisme was primarily a French phenomenon (Jean <a href=""entry://Fautrier, Jean""><span class=""links"">Fautrier </span></a>, Georges <a href=""entry://Mathieu, Georges""><span class=""links"">Mathieu </span></a>, and the German-born but Paris-based <a href=""entry://Wols ""><span class=""links"">Wols</span></a> were among the leading exponents), and Tachiste paintings are characteristically more elegant and less aggressive than the work of the American Abstract Expressionists. The terms ‘<i>abstraction lyrique</i>’ (<a href=""entry://lyrical abstraction""><span class=""links"">lyrical abstraction</span></a>) <a href=""entry://Art Autre""><span class=""links"">‘Art Autre’</span></a> (other art), and <i><a href=""entry://Art Informel""><span class=""links"">‘Art Informel’</i></a></span> (art without form) are sometimes used synonymously with Tachisme, although certain critics use them to convey different nuances, sometimes corresponding with niceties of theory rather than with observable differences in practice. To add to the confusion of terminology, the word ‘tachisme’ was used differently in the 19th cent., being applied pejoratively to the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Macchiaioli""><span class=""links"">Macchiaioli</span></a>."

"Tate Gallery","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Tate Gallery</b>, London.<div class=""content"">The national collection of British art and of modern art from <i>c.</i>1870 to the present day. It is named after Sir Henry Tate (1819&ndash;99), the millionaire inventor of the sugar cube, who in 1890 offered his collection, consisting mainly of the work of Victorian contemporaries, to the nation on condition that the Government found a suitable site for a gallery. After many difficulties the Tate Gallery was opened at Millbank in 1897 in an undistinguished neo-Baroque building designed by Sidney R. J. Smith . On formation, however, it was not an independent gallery of British art as had been envisaged by Henry Tate . It was subordinate to the <a href=""entry://National Gallery""><span class=""links"">National Gallery</span></a> and it was intended only for modern British art. It began to be established as a historical collection of British art in 1910 when a collection of works by Alfred <a href=""entry://Stevens, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Stevens </span></a> was added and a wing was opened to accommodate most of the paintings left in <a href=""entry://Turner, J. M. W.""><span class=""links"">Turner's </span></a> studio at his death, which had previously been housed (but in the main unexhibited) at the National Gallery. In 1916 the Tate was given the additional responsibility of forming the national collection of modern art. It was not until 1954, however, that it became completely independent of the National Gallery (although transfers are still made between the two institutions). There have been several extensions to the building (some of them paid for by Sir Joseph and Lord <a href=""entry://Duveen, Joseph""><span class=""links"">Duveen </span></a>), and in 1987 a new gallery&mdash;the Clore Gallery (named after Sir Charles Clore, 1904&ndash;79, a businessman and philanthropist who was one of the Tate's greatest benefactors)&mdash;was opened to house works by Turner, including not only the oil paintings already at the Tate, but also watercolours and drawings previously in the <a href=""entry://British Museum""><span class=""links"">British Museum</span></a>. In 1988 a new branch of the Tate Gallery was opened in Liverpool and in 1993 another one in <a href=""entry://St Ives School""><span class=""links"">St Ives</span></a>. The creation of these two outstations reflected not only a desire to share the Tate's collections with regional audiences, but also the fact that the gallery had outgrown its site in London. In 1994 the Tate Trustees announced a decision to create a new museum&mdash;the Tate Gallery of Modern Art&mdash;in the decommissioned Bankside Power Station, a huge and impressive building designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, occupying a prime site on the Thames opposite St Paul's Cathedral. It is expected to open to the public in the year 2000. The original Tate Gallery at Millbank will then become the Tate Gallery of British Art."
"Tatlin, Vladimir","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Tatlin, Vladimir</b><div class=""content""><i>(1885&ndash;1953)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. Russian painter, designer, and maker of abstract constructions, the founding figure of <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivism</span></a>. He ran away to sea at the age of 18 and until 1914 combined painting with the life of a merchant seaman: many of his earlier pictures are of maritime subjects, notably <i>The Sailor</i> (Russian Mus., St Petersburg, 1911&ndash;12), a self-portrait. From 1910 he exhibited at several avant-garde exhibitions in Russia and worked in close association with <a href=""entry://Goncharova, Natalia""><span class=""links"">Goncharova </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Larionov, Mikhail""><span class=""links"">Larionov </span></a>, who had known him as a boy. In 1914 (not 1913 as long believed) Tatlin visited Berlin and Paris, and met <a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a>, who inspired his revolutionary <i>Painted Reliefs</i>, <i>Relief Constructions</i>, and <i>Corner Reliefs</i> of 1914 onwards. Only one or two of these survive and most are known only from photographs. It appears that he used a variety of materials&mdash;tin, glass, wood, plaster, etc.&mdash;with the object of doing away with pictorial illusion. After the October Revolution of 1917 Tatlin's constructions from real materials in real space were felt to be in accordance with the new doctrines and he threw himself whole-heartedly into support of the demand for socially oriented art. In 1919 he was commissioned by the Revolutionary Department of Fine Arts to design the <i>Monument to the Third International</i> (i.e. the Third International Communist Congress, to be held in Moscow in 1921). The huge monument was intended for a position in the centre of Moscow; it was to be in glass and iron, and the central glass cylinder was to revolve. A model was exhibited in December 1920 at the exhibition of the VIIIth Congress of the Soviets. The design was condemned by <a href=""entry://Gabo, Naum""><span class=""links"">Gabo </span></a> as impracticable and it was never executed (it was intended to be much bigger than the Eiffel Tower), but it is recognized as the outstanding symbol of Soviet Constructivism. The <i>Monument</i> was the culmination of Tatlin's artistic career, and the rest of it is something of an anticlimax. He taught and was active in the Soviet programme for the organization of museums, schools, etc. for the propagation of modern artistic culture. His own work was mainly in the field of <a href=""entry://applied art""><span class=""links"">applied art</span></a>, designing furniture, workers' clothes, etc. In the late 1920s and early 1930s he devoted his energies to designing a glider, which he called <i>Letatlin</i> (a compound of his name and the Russian word for ‘to fly’). From the 1930s his main activity was theatre design, and his later years were spent in lonely obscurity. There has even been some suspicion that he lived for some years after his official death date."

In 1651 he was appointed court painter to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, Governor of the Austrian Netherlands in Brussels, and was also made custodian of the Archduke's art collection. Teniers was an unusual curator. He not only compiled a first-rate catalogue of the Archduke's pictures but he also made paintings of the galleries in which the works of art were installed, and painted small copies of some of the pictures (examples of the latter are in the Courtauld, Inst. and Wallace Coll., London). Teniers' father, <i>David the Elder</i> (1582&ndash;1649), was primarily a painter of religious scenes. Few pictures are known that are certainly by him, and many formerly attributed to him are now given to his son, with whom he may have collaborated. David the Younger's son, <i>David III</i> (1638&ndash;85), was one of the many artists who imitated his father's work. Other members of the family were <i>Julien I</i> (1572&ndash;1615), the brother of David I, <i>Julien II</i> (1616&ndash;79), the brother of David II, and <i>Abraham</i> (1629&ndash;70), the brother of David III."

A highly precocious artist&mdash;his earliest dated drawing (in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) is from 1625&mdash;Terborch studied with his father, <i>Gerard the Elder</i> (1584&ndash;1662), in his native Zwolle, and with Pieter de <a href=""entry://Molyn, Pieter de""><span class=""links"">Molyn </span></a> in Haarlem. Unlike most of the Dutch artists of his time he travelled extensively. In 1635 he was in London, and from <i>c.</i>1636 to 1640 he was in Italy. From Italy he probably went to Spain and then to Flanders. In 1648 he was in Germany, where he painted <i>The Swearing of the Oath of Ratification of the Treaty of Münster</i> (NG, London, 1648), a group portrait of the signatories to the treaty that gave the Dutch independence from the Spanish. In 1654 he finally settled in Deventer, where he won both professional and social success. After beginning his career with guardroom scenes, he turned to pictures of elegant society, to which his gifts for delicate characterization and exquisite depiction of fine materials were ideally suited. His best-known work, the subject of a charming passage by <a href=""entry://Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von""><span class=""links"">Goethe </span></a>, is the so-called <i>Parental Admonition</i> (versions in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and the Staatliche Museen, Berlin).

Terbrugghen was chiefly a religious painter, but he also produced some remarkable <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> works, notably a pair of paintings of <i>Flute Players</i> (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kassel, 1621), which in their subtle tonality&mdash;with dark figures placed against a light background&mdash;anticipated by a generation the achievement of painters of the Delft School such as <a href=""entry://Fabritius, Carel""><span class=""links"">Fabritius </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Vermeer, Jan""><span class=""links"">Vermeer </span></a>. Although he was praised by <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>, who visited Utrecht in 1627, Terbrugghen was neglected by 18th- and 19th-cent. collectors and historians. The rediscovery of his sensitive and poetic paintings has been part of the reappraisal of Caravaggesque art during the 20th cent."
"terracotta","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>terracotta</b><div class=""content"">(Italian: baked earth). Clay baked to become hard and compact. Figures and architectural ornaments have been made of it since very early times and it is to these, rather than pottery vessels, that the word ‘terracotta’ usually refers. Clay is found all over the world in many different colours and qualities. Coloured clay is commoner than white. The presence of certain chemicals, such as iron oxide, affects the colour of the baked product, so terracotta works are not necessarily of the reddish-brown colour that is normally associated with the word. Firing may produce a wide range of colour from light buff to deep red or black. The hardness and strength of the baked clay vary according to the temperature at which it has been fired. During the firing the clay shrinks by about one-tenth of its volume, sometimes more, sometimes less, according to its quality and the amount of moisture."

He is said to have been a prolific decorator of churches, but only one fresco cycle survives that is certainly from his own hand, in the church of the Transfiguration at Novgorod (1378). This is one of the outstanding monuments of Russian medieval art, showing the highly personal version of the <a href=""entry://Byzantine art""><span class=""links"">Byzantine</span></a> style that Theophanes brought to Russia; his figures are vigorous and strongly characterized, and his brushwork has an almost impressionistic freedom and dash. Theophanes is known to have carried out major commissions in Moscow between 1395 and 1405, but none of his work there survives except some <a href=""entry://icon""><span class=""links"">icons</span></a> for the Cathedral of the Annunciation, which were painted with the help of assistants and are poorly preserved. According to a contemporary source Theophanes was also famous as a book-<a href=""entry://illuminated manuscripts""><span class=""links"">illuminator</span></a>.

<b>Theophilus</b>.<div class=""content"">The pseudonym adopted by the author of a medieval treatise on arts and crafts entitled <i>De Diversis Artibus</i> (The Various Arts). It has been variously dated from the 9th to the 13th cent. C. R. Dodwell, who made the standard English translation (1961), assigns it to a date between 1110 and 1140. It is the most important source of information on medieval arts and techniques and is unusual for its time in its references to the artist's attitude to his work. Various medieval manuscripts are extant, but the treatise did not become generally known until the late 18th cent. <a href=""entry://Lessing, Gotthold Ephraim""><span class=""links"">Lessing </span></a> produced the first printed edition, posthumously published in 1781, and an English edition, made from another manuscript, appeared in the same year. Little or nothing is known with certainty about the writer, but internal evidence suggests that he was a German Benedictine monk and also a practising craftsman whose primary interest lay in metalwork. He has been plausibly identified with Roger of Helmarshausen, a goldsmith and monk at the abbey of Helmarshausen, who is documented as the maker of a portable altar (Paderborn Cathedral Treasury, 1100) for Bishop Henry of Werl. Other works have been attributed to him."

Most of his career was spent as a commercial artist in Toronto, and it was only in 1914 that he was able to take up painting full time. Much of his painting was done out of doors, notably the fluently spontaneous oil sketches he produced in Algonquin Park. Among his more finished paintings, the most famous is the bold and brilliantly coloured <i>Jack Pine</i> (NG, Ottawa, 1917), which has become virtually a national symbol of Canada.

Early in his career he concentrated on idealized figures in which he expressed a ‘poetic mood’ praised by the critic Edmund Gosse; the best-known example is probably <i>The Mower</i> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, 1884; there are also several small-scale versions). From the 1890s, however, he was increasingly preoccupied with portrait sculpture and above all public monuments, becoming perhaps the most distinguished British practitioner in this field in the early 20th cent. His statues, dignified and thoughtful in tone, include those of Oliver Cromwell outside the Houses of Parliament, London (unveiled 1899), Alfred the Great in Winchester (1901), Gladstone in the Strand, London (1905), Lord Armstrong in Newcastle upon Tyne (1906), Lord Curzon in Calcutta (1912), and Edward VII in Karachi (1915). These are all in bronze, but he also worked in stone.<br class=""nLine"" />Both his father, <i>Thomas Thornycroft </i> (1816&ndash;85), and his mother, <i>Mary Thornycroft </i> (1809&ndash;95), were sculptors. They were primarily portraitists, but Thomas is now chiefly remembered for his dramatic Boadicea monument at Westminster Bridge, London, showing the fearsome warrior queen in her chariot. He began work on the group in 1856 and was encouraged by Prince Albert, who lent him horses as models. The plaster model was complete at Thornycroft's death, but it was not cast in bronze until 1897, after his son had presented it to the nation, and it was finally erected in 1902."

After five years at the Academy in his native Copenhagen, he reached Rome in 1797 on 3 March, a day which he henceforth considered as his birthday. He made his name with the statue <i>Jason</i> (Thorvaldsens Mus., Copenhagen, 1802&ndash;3), which was based on the <i>Doryphoros</i> of <a href=""entry://Polyclitus""><span class=""links"">Polyclitus </span></a>, and his growing reputation resulted in so many commissions that by 1820 he had forty assistants in his Roman workshop. In that year, when visiting Copenhagen, he began planning the decoration of the newly built church of Our Lady with marble statues and <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">reliefs</span></a>, a scheme which was to be his principal task for several years. His other major works include the tomb of Pius VII at St Peter's in Rome (1824&ndash;31) and a monument to Lord Byron (Trinity College, Cambridge, 1829). He returned finally to Denmark in 1838, a celebrity whose authority in the arts was sovereign. In Copenhagen a museum was built in his honour (1839&ndash;48), itself a remarkable piece of neo-antique architecture, the courtyard of which contains his tomb. Thorvaldsen aimed at reviving the sublimity of Greek sculpture, but he never went to Greece and (in common with other artists of his time) bestowed his admiration mainly on late <a href=""entry://Hellenistic""><span class=""links"">Hellenistic</span></a> or Roman copies. He did, however, gain close knowledge of Greek sculpture from the restorations he made to the recently excavated sculptures from the Temple of Aphaia in Aegina, which in 1816 passed through Rome on their way to Munich (they are now in the Glyptothek there); Thorvaldsen's restorations have only recently been removed. Compared with Canova he is cool and calculating; his sculptures are more logically worked out and have great precision and clarity, but they lack Canova's sensitive surfaces. Thorvaldsen was one of the outstanding collectors of his day, buying works by contemporary painters (notably the <a href=""entry://Nazarenes""><span class=""links"">Nazarenes</span></a>) as well as ancient works (now in the Thorvaldsens Museum)."

"Tiepolo, Giovanni Battista","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Tiepolo, Giovanni Battista</b>
<i>(or Giambattista)</i><div class=""content""><i>(1696&ndash;1770)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. The greatest Italian (and arguably the greatest European) painter of the 18th cent. His work sums up the splendours of Italian decorative painting, and with him the monumental fresco tradition which had begun with <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto</span></a> is brought to an end. He revived the glories of the Venetian School, especially of <a href=""entry://Veronese, Paolo""><span class=""links"">Veronese </span></a>, and enriched them with the experience of the Roman and Neapolitan <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> and the new <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a> techniques of theatre decoration. His deep pictorial culture was drawn from a wide variety of sources, including <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a>. Tiepolo trained with the history painter Gregorio Lazzarini (1655&ndash;1730), but according to his earliest biographer, Vincenzo da Canal, he soon departed from his master's ‘diligent manner, and, being all fire and spirit, adopted one which was rapid and free’. After making his name in Venice with some works in the ‘dark’ manner of <a href=""entry://Piazzetta, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Piazzetta </span></a>, he carried out his first important fresco cycle in the Archbishop's Palace in Udine (<i>c.</i>1727&ndash;8) and with the change from oil to fresco he broke away from the dark tonality of his earliest work and established the clear, sunny palette which became one of his foremost characteristics. In the 1730s much of his work was done outside his native city, and by 1736 his fame was such that he was invited to Stockholm to decorate the Royal Palace&mdash;an invitation he declined because the fee offered was too small. Between 1741 and 1750 Tiepolo was active mainly in Venice, where his chief work was the decoration of the <i>Palazzo Labia</i> (1745), in which he was assisted by his expert in <i><a href=""entry://quadratura""><span class=""links"">quadratura</i></a></span>, Gerolamo Mengozzi Colonna (<i>c.</i>1688&ndash;1766).<br class=""nLine"" />The next decade represents the peak of Tiepolo's career. In 1750&ndash;3 he was in Würzburg to decorate the Kaisersaal and the grand staircase of the Prince Archbishop's palace, and this work is the masterpiece of his maturity. Like Rubens, Tiepolo could make even the most ponderous allegory come alive, and here the unpromising task of paying tribute to the lack-lustre Prince Archbishop brought forth his most glorious work&mdash;full of light and colour and perfectly attuned to the superb architectural setting. In 1757 Tiepolo decorated a series of rooms in the Villa Valmarana near Vicenza, with scenes from Homer, Virgil, Ariosto, and Tasso, and this work gives perhaps the most immediate experience of his qualities: grandeur, rich and glowing colour, and fancifulness warmed by humanity in the narrative. His last large-scale work in Italy was the ceiling of the ballroom in the Villa Pisani at Strà. While there he was called by Charles III to Madrid, where he spent the last eight years of his life. The <i>Apotheosis of Spain</i> (1764) on the ceiling of the throne room in the royal palace was his principal commission. Intrigue and jealousy embittered these last years in Madrid, and the final blow was dealt posthumously when his seven altarpieces for the church of S. Pascal Baylon at Aranjuez were displaced by seven canvases done by <a href=""entry://Mengs, Anton Raffael""><span class=""links"">Mengs </span></a>, the champion of <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a> (Mengs is said to have fallen from a tree whilst lying in wait to attack the aged Tiepolo, but Tiepolo&mdash;with characteristic nobility&mdash;saw to it that his rival was treated in hospital). Tiepolo's altarpieces are now divided between the Prado and the Royal Palace in Madrid, and the surviving oil-sketches for them are mainly in the Courtauld Institute Galleries, London. They display a pathos and psychological intensity that was new to his art. He had painted easel pictures as well as frescos throughout his career, and a work such as the ravishing <i>Young Woman with a Macaw</i> (Ashmolean Mus., Oxford, <i>c.</i>1760) shows the masterly fluency of his brushwork. Tiepolo was as prolific a draughtsman as he was a painter (an outstanding collection of his drawings is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London) and was one of the finest etchers of his period; <a href=""entry://Goya, Francisco de""><span class=""links"">Goya </span></a> was especially indebted to his graphic work.<br class=""nLine"" />Tiepolo was married to Cecilia Guardi, the sister of the <a href=""entry://Guardi, Francesco""><span class=""links"">Guardi</span></a> brothers. They had two painter sons. <i>Giandomenico Tiepolo </i> (1727&ndash;1804) began to assist his father <i>c.</i>1745 and accompanied him to Madrid. He was so faithful to his father's work that it is sometimes impossible to say exactly where he has collaborated. In his independent work he has a clearly defined style with a marked bias towards <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> and <a href=""entry://caricature""><span class=""links"">caricature</span></a>, e.g. at the Villa Valmarana. He is noteworthy also for his etchings, especially the twenty-two variations on the theme of the <i>Flight into Egypt</i> (1753). <i>Lorenzo Tiepolo </i> (1736&ndash;before 1776) also assisted his father, but unlike his brother Giandomenico he has no individual substance as an artist."

Tiffany became famous above all for his highly distinctive glass vases and lamps, but until about 1900 his firm was better known for stained glass and mosaic work (it did interiors for many socially prominent New Yorkers as well as for clubs). Most of his architectural work, including his own mansion on Long Island, has been destroyed, but the loggia of the main entrance of his masterpiece, Laurelton Hall (1903&ndash;5), has been installed in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.

He probably trained with Giovanni <a href=""entry://Pisano, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Pisano </span></a>, but his style was more calm and reserved, with an imposing block-like massiveness. His early career was spent in Pisa and Siena, but his chief works are in Florence (where he worked 1321&ndash;4) and Naples (where he worked from 1324 until his death). In Florence his work included the tomb of Bishop Orso in the cathedral&mdash;possibly the earliest example of the seated effigy. In Naples, where he is known to have been in touch with <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto</span></a>, who was court painter there at the time, and with the Sienese painter Pietro <a href=""entry://Lorenzetti, Pietro""><span class=""links"">Lorenzetti </span></a>, his work included tabernacled tombs for the Angevin court (e.g. for Queen Mary of Hungary in Sta Maria Donnaregina).

By 1539 he was working independently, but the little that is known of his early work suggests that he was not precocious. The first work in which he announced a distinctive voice is <i>The Miracle of the Slave</i> (Accademia, Venice, 1548), in which many of the qualities of his maturity, particularly his love of foreshortening, begin to appear. To help him with the complex poses he favoured, Tintoretto used to make small wax models which he arranged on a stage and experimented on with spotlights for effects of light and shade and composition. This method of composing explains the frequent repetition in his works of the same figures seen from different angles. He was a formidable draughtsman and, according to <a href=""entry://Ridolfi, Carlo""><span class=""links"">Ridolfi </span></a>, he had inscribed on his studio wall the motto ‘The drawing of <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> and the colour of Titian’. However, he was very different in spirit from either of his avowed models&mdash;more emotive, using vivid exaggerations of light and movement. His drawings, unlike Michelangelo's detailed life studies, are brilliant, rapid notations, bristling with energy, and his colour is more sombre and mystical than Titian's.<br class=""nLine"" />Tintoretto's greatest works are the vast series of paintings he did for the Scuola di San Rocco in Venice from 1565 to 1587&ndash; scenes from the life of Christ in the upper hall and scenes from the life of the Virgin in the lower hall. The complicated scheme was probably not conceived by Tintoretto himself, but he interpreted it with a vividness and economy of colour and detail that give a wonderful cohesion to the whole scheme. Its personal conception of the sacred story overwhelmed <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a>, who devoted eloquent pages to it, and Henry James wrote of the stupendous <i>Crucifixion</i> (1565): ‘Surely no single picture in the world contains more of human life; there is everything in it, including the most exquisite beauty.’ The unorthodox rough brushwork of such paintings incurred the censure of <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a>, but later generations recognized it as a means of heightening the drama and tension. As well as religious works, Tintoretto painted mythological scenes and he was also a fine portraitist, particularly of old men (a self-portrait in old age is in the Louvre). Some of the weaker portraits that go under his name may be the product of his large workshop. His son <i>Domenico</i> (<i>c.</i>1560&ndash;1635) became his foreman and is said to have painted many portraits, although none can be attributed to him with certainty. Another son, <i>Marco</i> (1561&ndash;1637), and a daughter, <i>Marietta</i> (<i>c.</i>1556&ndash;90), were among his other assistants. The later paintings can thus be divided into those which are largely studio productions on the one hand and the visionary inspirations from Tintoretto's own hand on the other. A prime example of the latter is <i>The Last Supper</i> (S. Giorgio Maggiore, Venice, 1592&ndash;4), the culmination of a lifetime's development of this subject, from the traditional frontal arrangement of his youth to this startling diagonally viewed composition. Tintoretto had great influence on Venetian painting, but the artist who most fruitfully absorbed the visionary energy and intensity of his work was El <a href=""entry://Greco, El""><span class=""links"">Greco </span></a>."

<b>Tischbein</b>.<div class=""content"">Family of German 18th-cent. painters. The best-known of them, <i>Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein </i> (1751&ndash;1829), was most important for his engravings of classical antiquities, but is now remembered almost solely for his famous portrait <i>Goethe in the Roman Campagna</i> (Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt, 1786&ndash;7). Tischbein was <a href=""entry://Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von""><span class=""links"">Goethe's </span></a> friend and he is usually called ‘Goethe’ Tischbein. The two other leading members of the family, his uncle and cousin, were nicknamed after their main place of work: <i>Johann Heinrich the Elder</i>, ‘Kassel’ Tischbein (1722&ndash;89) and <i>Johann Friedrich </i> ‘Leipzig’ Tischbein (1750&ndash;1812). They were principally portraitists."
"Tissot, James","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Tissot, James</b><div class=""content""><i>(1836&ndash;1902).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> French painter and graphic artist. Early in his career he painted historical costume pieces, but in about 1864 he turned with great success to scenes of contemporary life, usually involving fashionable women. Following his alleged involvement in the turbulent events of the Paris Commune (1871) he took refuge in London, where he lived from 1871 to 1882. He was just as successful there as he had been in Paris and lived in some style in St John's Wood; in 1874 Edmond de <a href=""entry://Goncourt, Edmond de""><span class=""links"">Goncourt </span></a> wrote sarcastically that he had ‘a studio with a waiting room where, at all times, there is iced champagne at the disposal of visitors, and around the studio, a garden where, all day long, one can see a footman in silk stockings brushing and shining the shrubbery leaves’. His pictures are distinguished most obviously by his love of painting women's costumes: indeed, his work&mdash;which has a fashion-plate elegance and a chocolate-box charm&mdash;has probably been more often reproduced in works on the history of costume than on the history of painting. He also, however, had a gift for wittily observing nuances of social behaviour. In 1882, following the death of his mistress Kathleen Newton (the archetypal Tissot model&mdash;beautiful but rather vacant), he returned to France. In 1885 he underwent a religious conversion when he went into a church to ‘catch the atmosphere for a picture’, and thereafter he devoted himself to religious subjects. He visited the Holy Land in 1886&ndash;7 and 1889, and his illustrations to the events of the Bible were enormously popular, both in book form and when the original drawings were exhibited. For many years after his death Tissot was considered a grossly vulgar artist, but since the 1970s there has been an upsurge of interest in him, expressed in sale-room prices for his work as well as in numerous books and exhibitions devoted to him."
"Titian","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Titian </b>
<i>(Tiziano Vecellio )</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1485&ndash;1576).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> The greatest painter of the Venetian School. The evidence for his birthdate is contradictory, but he was certainly very old when he died. He was probably a pupil of Giovanni <a href=""entry://Bellini""><span class=""links"">Bellini </span></a>, and in his early work he came under the spell of <a href=""entry://Giorgione ""><span class=""links"">Giorgione </span></a>, with whom he had a close relationship. In 1508 he assisted him with the external fresco decoration of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, Venice, and after Giorgione's early death in 1510 it fell to Titian to complete a number of his unfinished paintings. The authorship of certain works (some of them famous) is still disputed between them.<br class=""nLine"" />Titian's first major independent commission was for three frescos on the life of St Antony of Padua in the Scuola del Santo, Padua (1511), noble and dignified paintings suggesting an almost central Italian firmness and monumentality. When he returned to Venice, Giorgione having died and <a href=""entry://Sebastiano del Piombo ""><span class=""links"">Sebastiano</span></a> having gone to Rome, the aged Bellini alone stood between him and supremacy, and that only until 1516 when Bellini died and Titian became official painter to the Republic. He maintained his position as the leading painter in the city until his death sixty years later. In the second decade of the century Titian broke free from the stylistic domination of Giorgione and developed a manner of his own. Something of a fusion between Titian's worldliness and Giorgione's poetry is seen in the enigmatic allegory known as <i>Sacred and Profane Love</i> (Borghese Gallery, Rome, <i>c.</i>1515), but his style soon became much more dynamic. The work that more than any other established his reputation is the huge altarpiece of <i>The Assumption of the Virgin</i> (Sta Maria dei Frari, Venice, 1516&ndash;18). It is the largest picture he ever painted and one of the greatest, matching the achievements of his most illustrious contemporaries in Rome in grandeur of form and surpassing them in splendour of colour. The soaring movement of the Virgin, rising from the tempestuous group of Apostles towards the hovering figure of God the Father looks forward to the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a>. Similar qualities are seen in his two most famous altarpieces of the 1520s: the Pesaro altarpiece (Sta Maria dei Frari, Venice, 1519&ndash;26), a bold diagonal composition of great magnificence, and <i>The Death of St Peter Martyr</i> (completed 1530), which he painted for the church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, having defeated <a href=""entry://Palma Vecchio ""><span class=""links"">Palma Vecchio </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Pordenone""><span class=""links"">Pordenone</span></a> in competition for the commission. The painting was destroyed by fire in 1867, but it is known through copies and engraving; trees and figures together form a violent centrifugal composition suited to the action, and <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> described it as ‘the most celebrated, the greatest work
that Titian has ever done’. Titian had important secular as well as ecclesiastical patrons in this energetic period of his career, one of his most important commissions being three mythological pictures (1518&ndash;23) for Alfonso d'<a href=""entry://Este""><span class=""links"">Este </span></a>&mdash;the <i>Worship of Venus</i>, the <i>Bacchanal</i> (both in the Prado, Madrid), and the <i>Bacchus and Ariadne</i> (NG, London). Outstanding among his portraits of the time is the exquisite <i>Man with a Glove</i> (Louvre, Paris, <i>c.</i>1520).<br class=""nLine"" />About 1530, the year in which his wife died, a change in Titian's manner becomes apparent. The vivacity of former years gave way to a more restrained and meditative art. He now began to use related rather than contrasting colours in juxtaposition, yellows and pale shades rather than the strong blues and reds of his previous work. In composition too he became less adventurous and used schemes which, compared with some of his earlier works, appear almost archaic. Thus his large <i>Presentation of the Virgin</i> (Accademia, Venice, 1534&ndash;8) makes use of the <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a>-like frieze composition dear to the <a href=""entry://quattrocento""><span class=""links"">quattrocento</span></a>. During the 1530s Titian's fame spread throughout Europe. In 1530 he first met the emperor Charles V (in Bologna, where he was crowned in that year) and in 1533 he painted a famous portrait of him (Prado) based on a portrait by the Austrian <a href=""entry://Seisenegger, Jacob""><span class=""links"">Seisenegger</span></a>. Charles was so pleased with it that he appointed Titian court painter and elevated him to the rank of Count Palatine and Knight of the Golden Spur&mdash;an unprecedended honour for a painter. At the same time his works were increasingly sought after by Italian princes, as with the celebrated <i>Venus of Urbino</i> (Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1538), named after its owner, Guidobaldo, Duke of Camerino, who later became Duke of Urbino. The pose is based on Giorgione's <i>Sleeping Venus</i> (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden), but Titian substitutes a direct sensual appeal for Giorgione's idyllic remoteness.<br class=""nLine"" />Early in the 1540s Titian came under the influence of central and north Italian <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerism</span></a>, and in 1545&ndash;6 he made his first and only journey to Rome. There he was deeply impressed not only by modern works such as <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo's</span></a>
<i>Last Judgement</i>, but also by the remains of antiquity. His own paintings during this visit aroused much interest, his <i>Danaë</i> (Museo di Capodimonte, Naples) being praised for its handling and colour and (according to Vasari) criticized for its inexact drawing by Michelangelo. Titian also painted in Rome the famous portrait of <i>Pope Paul III and his Nephews</i> (Museo di Capodimonte). The decade closed with further imperial commissions. In 1548 the emperor summoned Titian to Augsburg, where he painted both a formal equestrian portrait (<i>Charles V at the Battle of Mühlberg</i>, Prado) and a more intimate one showing him seated in an armchair (Alte Pinakothek, Munich). He travelled to Augsburg again in 1550 and this time painted portraits of Charles's son, the future Philip II of Spain, who was to be the greatest patron of his later career. Titian's work for Philip included a series of seven erotic mythological subjects (<i>c.</i>1550&ndash;<i>c.</i>1562): <i>Danaë</i> and <i>Venus and Adonis</i> (Prado), <i>Perseus and Andromeda</i> (Wallace Coll., London), <i>The Rape of Europa</i> (Gardner Mus., Boston), <i>Diana and Actaeon</i> and <i>Diana and Calisto</i> (Ellesmere Coll., on loan to NG of Scotland), and <i>The Death of Actaeon</i> (NG, London). Titian referred to these pictures as <i>poesie</i>, and they are indeed highly poetic visions of distant worlds, quite different from the sensual realities of his earlier mythological paintings.<br class=""nLine"" />Titian ran a busy studio, his assistants including his brother <i>Francesco Vecellio </i> (<i>c.</i>1490&ndash;1559/60), his son Orazio, and his cousin Cesare. Of these only Francesco sees to have had any individual substance as a painter, but his <i>œuvre</i> is not well defined. During the last twenty years of his life Titian's personal works, as opposed to those produced under his supervision and with his intervention, showed an increasing looseness in the handling and a sensitive merging of subdued colours, so that outlines disappear and the forms become more immaterial. With this went a growing emphasis on intimate pathos rather than external drama. His interest in new pictorial conceptions waned but his powers remained undimmed until the end, his career closing with the awe-inspiring <a href=""entry://Pietà""><i><span class=""links"">Pietà</i></span></a> (Accademia, Venice, 1573&ndash;6), intended for his own tomb and finished after his death by <a href=""entry://Palma Giovane ""><span class=""links"">Palma Giovane </span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />Titian was recognized as a towering genius in his own time (<a href=""entry://Lomazzo, Giovanni Paolo""><span class=""links"">Lomazzo </span></a> described him as ‘the sun amidst small stars not only among the Italians but all the painters of the world’) and his reputation as one of the giants of art has never been seriously questioned. He was supreme in every branch of painting and his achievements were so varied&mdash;ranging from the joyous evocation of pagan antiquity in his early mythologies to the depths of tragedy in his late religious paintings&mdash;that he has been an inspiration to artists of very different character. <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez </span></a> are among the painters who have particularly revered him. In many subjects, above all in portraiture, he set patterns that were followed by generations of artists. His free and expressive brushwork revolutionized the oil technique: Vasari wrote that his late works ‘are executed with bold, sweeping strokes, and in patches of colour, with the result that they cannot be viewed from near by, but appear perfect at a distance
The method he used is judicious, beautiful, and astonishing, for it makes pictures appear alive and painted with great art, but it conceals the labour that has gone into them.’ His greatness as an artist, it appears, was not matched by his character, for he was notoriously avaricious. In spite of his wealth and status, he claimed he was impoverished, and his exaggerations about his age (by which he hoped to pull at the heartstrings of patrons) are one of the sources of confusion about his birthdate. Jacopo <a href=""entry://Bassano, Jacopo""><span class=""links"">Bassano </span></a> caricatured him as a moneylender in his <i>Purification of the Temple</i> (NG, London). Titian, however, was lavish in his hospitality towards his friends, who included the poet Pietro Aretino and the sculptor and architect Jacopo <a href=""entry://Sansovino, Andrea""><span class=""links"">Sansovino </span></a>. These three were so close that they were known in Venice as the triumvirate, and they used their influence with their respective patrons to further each other's careers."
"Tobey, Mark","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Tobey, Mark</b><div class=""content""><i>(1890&ndash;1976).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> American painter. In 1918 he became a convert to the Baha'i faith and much of his subsequent work was inspired by an interest in Oriental art and thought. He lived mainly in Seattle, but travelled widely and from 1931 to 1938 was artist-in-residence at Dartington Hall, a progressive school in Devon, England. Following a visit to the Far East in 1934&ndash;5, he developed a distinctive style of painting that he called ‘white writing’, characterized by calligraphic white patterns overlying dimly discerned suggestions of colour beneath. Although he painted representational pictures in this style, he turned increasingly to abstractions. Their <a href=""entry://All-over painting""><span class=""links"">All-over</span></a> manner anticipated and perhaps influenced Jackson <a href=""entry://Pollock, Jackson""><span class=""links"">Pollock </span></a>, but unlike <a href=""entry://Action painting""><span class=""links"">Action painters</span></a>, Tobey believed that ‘painting should come through the avenues of meditation rather than the canals of action.’ Unusually for an American painter, he was more highly esteemed abroad than in his own country, and he was influential on French <a href=""entry://Tachisme""><span class=""links"">Tachisme</span></a> in the 1950s.

The saintly figures are shown meditating, writing, and reading (the first dated example of spectacles being worn appears here) and Tommaso shows a remarkable ability to depict intellectual activity. His reputation was such that work was commissioned from him by the emperor Charles IV in Bohemia, and two panels by Tommaso are still in Karlstein Castle, near Prague.

<b>Tonks, Henry</b><div class=""content""><i>(1862&ndash;1937).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter, draughtsman, and teacher. He was interested in art from childhood, and in 1893 he abandoned his successful medical career to become a teacher at the <a href=""entry://Slade, Felix""><span class=""links"">Slade</span></a> School. (However, he worked as a plastic surgeon during the First World War.) Tonks remained at the Slade until 1930 (as Professor from 1918), and became the most renowned and formidable teacher of his generation&mdash;‘in appearance tall, gaunt, and severe’ (<i>DNB</i>). Under him the Slade maintained its position as the dominant art school in Britain (although it was now challenged by the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a>), and he was a major influence as an upholder of traditional values and an opponent of modern ideas: ‘I don't believe I really like any modern development.’ He set high standards for his pupils, particularly in draughtsmanship (his own forte) and he got on well with them, in spite of being notorious for his sarcasm and abruptness. Because of his refusal to move with the times he was increasingly looked on as a back number by more progressive artists and students, but he remained a dominant presence in the art world. Tonks's own paintings are mainly figure subjects, often consciously (or self-consciously) poetic in spirit: Sir John <a href=""entry://Rothenstein, Sir William""><span class=""links"">Rothenstein </span></a> refers to ‘the sheer prettiness of much of his art’, but his pictures often look rather laborious, partly because of his technique of ‘Tonking’, which involved using an absorbent material to soak excess oil from the canvas after each day's work and so produce a dry surface for the next session. He was at his best in his slighter satirical works and in conversation pieces such as <i>Saturday Night in The Vale</i> (Tate Gallery, London, 1928&ndash;9), which shows the novelist and critic George Moore reading aloud to a gathering at Tonks's studio in The Vale, Chelsea. More complained that he had been made to look like a ‘flabby old cook’, whereas Tonks had depicted himself as a young and elegant ‘demi-god’."

His technique is scrupulously detailed in the manner of the Old Masters, but his subjects express the spiritual desolation and debilitating uniformity of modern life. The figures in his paintings all look more or less like one another and go through life as if on a conveyer belt, tense and drained of energy. They are physically close to one another, but emotionally distant. <i>Subway</i> (Whitney Museum, New York, 1950) is perhaps his most famous work&mdash;a terrifying vision of Kafkaesque isolation."

In 1905 he was converted to Catholicism and thereafter concentrated mainly on religious works. Toorop's prolific output included book illustrations, designs for stained glass, and posters. His daughter, <i>Charley Toorop </i> (1891&ndash;1955), trained as a musician but began to paint in about 1914.

The two sensitive effigies, made with the aid of death masks, have a <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> elegance, but the figures of angels at the corners of the tomb and the exquisite decorative work introduced a pure <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> style into England.

The mosaic in S. Giovanni in Laterano appears to have been a reworking of an earlier design and was reconstructed in the 19th cent., so Torriti's style can best be assessed from the less restored mosaic in Sta Maria Maggiore. Here, in the main scene of the <i>Coronation of the Virgin</i> and subsidiary scenes from the life of the Virgin, Torriti recaptures something of the vitality of late <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> mosaics; he was clearly influenced in his choice of colour by the pale delicate harmonies and silvery lights of the 5th-cent. mosaic on the triumphal arch of the same church.

<b>Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri de</b><div class=""content""><i>(1864&ndash;1901)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. French painter and graphic artist, one of the most colourful of 19th-cent. artists. The son of an outrageously eccentric nobleman, he grew up with a love of sport, but as a result of two falls when he was in his early teens the bones in his legs atrophied and he became permanently stunted. (Accounts of his height vary, but he was certainly not the midget of the popular imagination. He was about 5 ft tall, but his large head made him appear grotesquely misproportioned. Lautrec was stoical about his condition, never mentioning it except in jest, and it did not prevent him from attracting women as beautiful as Suzanne <a href=""entry://Valadon, Suzanne""><span class=""links"">Valadon </span></a>.) He showed an early talent for drawing (his father and uncle were amateur artists) and in 1882 he became a pupil of <a href=""entry://Bonnat, Léon""><span class=""links"">Bonnat </span></a> and in 1883 of <a href=""entry://Cormon, Fernand""><span class=""links"">Cormon </span></a>.

He met van <a href=""entry://Gogh, Vincent van""><span class=""links"">Gogh </span></a> at Cormon's school in 1886 and came into contact with <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Post-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Post-Impressionist</span></a> painters. From the age of 15 until he was 24 he painted mainly sporting subjects. From <i>c.</i>1888 he began to illustrate the theatres, music-halls (particularly the Moulin Rouge), cafés, and low life of Paris; circuses and brothels were among the subjects he returned to again and again. He collected the etchings of <a href=""entry://Goya, Francisco de""><span class=""links"">Goya </span></a> and his painting came much under the influence of <a href=""entry://Degas, Edgar""><span class=""links"">Degas </span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1888 he had come into contact with <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin </span></a> and began a continuing enthusiasm for Japanese colour prints (see <a href=""entry://Ukiyo-e""><i><span class=""links"">UKIYO-E</i></span></a>). The influence of Gauguin's flat rhythmic patterning and calligraphic use of strong outline became dominant chiefly in Lautrec's <a href=""entry://lithography""><span class=""links"">lithographs</span></a>, including his famous posters. In spite of his notoriously dissipated lifestyle, he was a dedicated craftsman, and would arrive early at the workshop&mdash;even after a hard night's drinking&mdash;to supervise the printing of his designs. His work, with its masterfully bold and arresting forms, was one of the most important influences in gaining acceptance for both lithography and the poster as major art forms. Lautrec's alcoholism and dissolute life (he had syphilis) led to a breakdown in 1899 and the paintings he produced in the brief period between his recovery and his premature death, aged 36, are more sombre in style than his earlier work. In 1922 the Lautrec family presented some 600 of his works to his native town of Albi, where the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec was created to house them. The museum houses not only works by Lautrec but also memorabilia, notably his walking stick, which ingeniously opens up to reveal a tiny glass and flask of brandy."

It was established in 1984 by the Patrons of New Art, a body founded two years earlier (as part of the Friends of the Tate Gallery) to encourage the collection of contemporary art. The regulations have changed somewhat since the prize was inaugurated. Originally it was awarded for ‘the greatest contribution to art in Britain in the previous twelve months’ and was open to critics and administrators (who were shortlisted but never won) as well as artists; since 1991 those eligible are British artists under the age of 50 who have had ‘an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work’ in the previous twelve months. The original sponsors, Drexel Burnham Lambert, suffered a financial collapse in 1990 and the prize was suspended that year; since then it has been sponsored by Channel 4 Television, which broadcasts the award ceremony live from the Tate Gallery. The Director of the Tate is on the jury that makes the award. Like the Booker Prize in literature, the Turner Prize attracts a great deal of publicity, but much of this attention has been expressed as damning criticism, as it is regarded by many as showcasing all that is most pretentious and self-regarding in contemporary art.

"Turner, J. M. W.","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Turner, J. M. W.</b>
<i>(Joseph Mallord William )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1775&ndash;1851).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter, one of the greatest and most original of all landscape painters. His family called him Bill or William, but he is now invariably known by his initials. Precociously gifted, he became a student at the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> Schools in 1789 and first exhibited a watercolour at the Academy in 1790, when he was only 15. He studied at the Academy for four years, and during this time also had lessons from Thomas Malton (1748&ndash;1804), a topographical watercolourist who specialized in neat and detailed town views. From 1791 Turner began making regular sketching tours, producing many drawings of <a href=""entry://Picturesque""><span class=""links"">Picturesque</span></a> views and architectural subjects that he later sold to engravers or worked up into watercolours. At this time his work was more polished but less inventive than that of his friend <a href=""entry://Girtin, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Girtin </span></a> (with whom he worked for Dr <a href=""entry://Monro, Dr Thomas""><span class=""links"">Monro </span></a>). Initially he painted only in watercolour, but in 1796 he first exhibited an oil at the Academy, <i>Fishermen at Sea</i> (Tate, London), a work showing his admiration for 17th-cent Dutch marine painting. Only three years later, in 1799, he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy at the youngest permitted age (24), and in 1802 he became the youngest ever full Academician. His career flourished in terms of money as well as prestige, for he was hardworking, a good businessman, and frugal by nature (he lived rather squalidly, but he was not miserly or ungenerous, as is sometimes maintained).<br class=""nLine"" />The Dutch influence in Turner's work soon gave way to that of <a href=""entry://Claude Gellée ""><span class=""links"">Claude</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Wilson, Richard""><span class=""links"">Wilson </span></a>, but already in the early 1800s it was recognized that he was introducing a new and revolutionary approach to landscape, his painting becoming increasingly <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> in its dramatic subject matter and sense of movement, as in the powerful <i>Shipwreck</i> (Tate, 1805). During these years, however, he continued exhibiting pictures in a more conventional manner and still worked for engravers (his most ambitious engraving project was his <i>Liber Studiorum</i>, conceived in emulation of Claude's <i>Liber Veritatis</i> and intended to show the range of his own work; between 1807 and 1819 he issued 71 of a projected 100 plates).<br class=""nLine"" />Turner made his first journey to the Continent in 1802, during a temporary peace in the war with France, visiting Paris like so many other artists to see pictures looted by Napoleon, which were then on exhibition. From Paris he travelled on to Switzerland. The resumption of war made Continental travel impossible for more than a decade, and Turner did not go abroad again until 1817, when he visited Belgium, Holland, and the Rhine. He first visited Italy two years later, and from then until 1845 made fairly regular journeys abroad (including three more to Italy, the last in 1840). Unlike his contemporary <a href=""entry://Constable, John""><span class=""links"">Constable</span></a>, who concentrated on painting the places he knew best, Turner was inspired to a great extent by what he saw on his travels (he lived in London all his life, but the city appears fairly infrequently in his paintings). The mountains and lakes of Switzerland and the haunting beauty of Venice, in particular, provided him with an enduring fund of subjects. On his journeys he was in the habit of making rapid pencil jottings, which he used later as reminders for imaginative compositions. He was inspired by history (especially ancient history) and literature as well as nature. Many of the paintings he exhibited at the Royal Academy were accompanied by verses printed in the catalogue, and from 1800 he added lines he had composed himself.<br class=""nLine"" />From the 1830s Turner's painting became increasingly free, with detail subordinated to general effects of colour and light. His work was often attacked by critics, one of his most celebrated pictures&mdash;<i>Snow Storm: Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth</i> (Tate, 1842)&mdash;being dismissed as ‘soapsuds and whitewash’. However, he also had many admirers, including some who regarded him as the outstanding genius of the day. His most important patron was the third Earl of Egremont (1751&ndash;1837), who was unusual among collectors of the time in buying contemporary British art (sculpture as well as painting) on a large scale. Turner had a studio at Petworth, Egremont's country house in Sussex, and several of his paintings are still to be seen there (although their ownership was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1984). Turner's other great champion was the young <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a>, who discovered his work in the 1830s and wrote eloquently of him in the first volume of <i>Modern Painters</i>, published in 1843. By this time Turner's brushwork had become breathtakingly free and some of his compositions were almost abstract, the forms dissolved in a haze of light and colour: ‘He seems to paint with tinted steam, so evanescent and so airy’, wrote Constable. Turner's originality lay not only in such handling of colour and light&mdash;in which he anticipated <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a>&mdash;but also in his use of the power, beauty, and mystery of nature to express deep human concerns. For example, <i>The Fighting Temeraire</i> (NG, London, 1839), showing a ship that had fought at Trafalgar being towed to the breaker's yard, is a poignant elegy for a passing era.<br class=""nLine"" />Turner always led a fairly solitary existence and late in life he became more and more of a recluse, sometimes calling himself Mr Booth (assuming the name of his mistress Sophia Booth ). After his death, Ruskin destroyed many erotic drawings that he found among his works, thinking that they tainted his hero's memory. In his will Turner left plans for disposing of his considerable fortune (he wanted to found an almshouse for ‘poor and decayed male artists’) and for the creation of a special gallery at the National Gallery to display certain of his paintings (he had a huge stock of his work, including not only pictures that had never been sold, but also favourite paintings that he had bought back at auction). Long-forgotten relatives contested the will (which was ambiguously worded) and won the money in 1856; at the same time the Court of Chancery awarded all the works remaining in his possession at his death to the National Gallery&mdash;about 300 oils and 19,000 drawings and watercolours. Most of these are now in Clore Gallery at the Tate Gallery, but a few of Turner's most famous oils remain in the National Gallery."

<b>typology</b>.<div class=""content"">In Christian <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">iconography</span></a> a system whereby figures and scenes from the Old Testament were thought of as prefiguring those of the New Testament. It became the custom in biblical illustration for Old Testament ‘types’ to be juxtaposed with or subordinated to New Testament ‘antitypes’, to demonstrate visually that the promise of the Old Testament was fulfilled in the New. Thus Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac was seen as foreshadowing God's sacrifice of Christ, and David was seen as a ‘type’ of Christ, his fight with Goliath prefiguring Christ's struggle with Satan. Occasionally classical myths or other secular sources were also accepted as types. Typological illustration is found not only in book illustration, but in virtually every field of art throughout the Middle Ages (the earliest examples date from the 3rd cent.), and occasionally afterwards.

<b>Uccello, Paolo</b>
<i>(Paolo di Dono )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1396/7&ndash;1475).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Florentine painter, one of the most distinctive artists of the early <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. <a href=""entry://Vasari, Giorgio""><span class=""links"">Vasari </span></a> says he got his nickname (<i>uccello</i> means ‘bird’) because he loved animals, and birds in particular, and to his contemporaries, as well as to many later critics, he appeared an eccentric figure. He is first documented <i>c.</i>1412 in the workshop of <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti </span></a>, but he is not known to have worked as a sculptor. In 1425 he moved to Venice, where he worked as a mosaicist, but nothing survives there that can be certainly associated with him. By 1432 he was back in Florence, and in 1436 he painted his first dated surviving work&mdash;a huge fresco in Florence Cathedral depicting an equestrian statue, a monument to the English <i>condottiere</i> Sir John Hawkwood (d. 1394). It demonstrated the fascination with <a href=""entry://perspective""><span class=""links"">perspective</span></a> that was central to his style. His two other large-scale works are a series of frescos on Old Testament themes (probably 1430s and 1440s) in the ‘Green Cloister’ of S. Maria Novella and a series of three panels (<i>c.</i>1455) on the <i>Battle of San Romano</i>, a minor Florentine victory against the Sienese in 1432. The pictures were painted for the Palazzo <a href=""entry://Medici ""><span class=""links"">Medici </span></a> and are now separated, with one panel each in the National Gallery, London, the Louvre, Paris, and the Uffizi, Florence. Uccello's other works include the decoration of the clock-face and designs for stained-glass windows in Florence Cathedral, and two enchanting paintings that are generally considered to date from late in his career&mdash;<i>St George and the Dragon</i> (NG, London), one of the earliest known Italian paintings on canvas, and <i>The Hunt in the Forest</i> (Ashmolean, Oxford). Vasari says that ‘he came to live a hermit's life’, and in his tax return of 1469 Uccello described himself as ‘old without means of livelihood
and unable to work’.<br class=""nLine"" />Uccello's work presents a striking&mdash;and often captivating&mdash;combination of two seemingly opposing stylistic currents: the decorative tradition of <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a> and the scientific involvement with perspective of the early Renaissance. Vasari maintained that Uccello wasted his time ‘on the finer points of perspective’ and presents him as an amiable fanatic who worked into the night and when told to come to bed by his wife would reply: ‘What a sweet mistress is this perspective!’ He undoubtedly took his enthusiasm to extraordinary lengths (in the <i>Battle of San Romano</i> the broken weapons and even the corpses recede neatly in accordance with the perspective scheme), but his effects were appropriate to his subjects and to the decorative charm of his pictures rather than mere technical exercises. In <i>The Hunt in the Forest</i>, for example, he creates not only an atmosphere of fairy-tale romance, but also, through the way in which the horses and dogs move swiftly back into space, an exhilarating sense of darting energy. Uccello's name became so identified with the subject of perspective that he was often said to have invented it: <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin </span></a>, for example, wrote in a letter to Kate <a href=""entry://Greenaway, Kate""><span class=""links"">Greenaway </span></a> ‘I believe the perfection of perspective is only recent.

In the 19th cent. the Uffizi was subjected to radical reorganization.

He began to paint in 1902 under pressure from his mother, who hoped that it would remedy the alcoholism to which he had been a victim since his boyhood (in 1934 the Tate Gallery wrongly said that he had died of drink in that year, thus bringing on the Trustees' heads a libel suit, settled out of court). Valadon gave him his first lessons, but he was largely self-taught. In the 1920s he became prosperous and critically acclaimed, and in his later years he devoted as much time to religious devotions as to painting. Utrillo was highly prolific, painting mainly street scenes in Montmartre. The period from about 1910 to 1916 is known as his ‘white period’ because of the predominance of milky tones in his pictures, and it is generally agreed that he did his best paintings during this time. They subtly convey solitude and emotional emptiness and have a delicate feeling for tone and atmosphere, even though he often worked from postcards. His later work is livelier but less touching. Utrillo's work is in many museums and (no doubt because of the deceptive simplicity of his paintings) he is among the most forged of modern artists."

From 1943 he turned to painting and <i>c.</i>1947 he adopted the method of geometrical abstraction for which he is best known, exploring methods of creating a hallucinatory impression of movement through visual ambiguity, using for this purpose alternating positive-negative shapes interrupted in such a way as to suggest underlying secondary shapes. His fascination with the idea of movement led him to experiment with <a href=""entry://Kinetic art""><span class=""links"">Kinetic art</span></a> and he also collaborated with architects in such works as his relief in aluminium for Caracas University (1954), and the French Pavilion at ‘Expo' 67’ in Montreal, hoping to create a kind of urban folk art. He has written a number of manifestos, which, together with his paintings, have been a major influence on younger artists in his field. Vasarely has lived mainly in the south of France since 1961 and there are two museums dedicated to the artist in Provence: the Fondation Vasarely at Aix-en-Provence, which he designed himself, and the Château et Musée Vasarely at Gordes.

"Vasari, Giorgio","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Vasari, Giorgio</b><div class=""content""><i>(1511&ndash;74).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, architect, and biographer, born at Arezzo and active mainly in Florence and Rome. In his day he was a leading painter, architect, and artistic impresario, but his activities in these fields have been completely overshadowed by his role as the most important of all artistic biographers. His great book, generally referred to as <i>Lives of the Artists</i>, is not only the fundamental source of information on Italian <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> art, but also a key document in shaping attitudes about the period for centuries afterwards (The book was first published in 1550 as <i>Le Vite de' più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori italiani</i>&mdash;The Lives of the Most Eminent Italian Architects, Painters, and Sculptors; in 1568 he published a second, much enlarged edition, in which the painters are mentioned first in the title.) Vasari wrote with a definite philosophy of art and art history. He believed that art is in the first instance imitation of nature and that progress in painting consists of the perfecting of the means of representation. He accepted the belief of Italian humanism that these had been taken to a high level of perfection in <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> antiquity, that art had passed through a period of decline in the Middle Ages, and that it was revived and set once more on its true path by <a href=""entry://Giotto di Bondone ""><span class=""links"">Giotto</span></a>. The main theme of the <i>Lives</i> was to set forth the revival of art in Tuscany by Giotto and <a href=""entry://Cimabue ""><span class=""links"">Cimabue </span></a>, its steady progress at the hands of such artists as <a href=""entry://Ghiberti, Lorenzo""><span class=""links"">Ghiberti </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Brunelleschi, Filippo""><span class=""links"">Brunelleschi </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello </span></a>, and its culmination with <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a>, and above all <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>, whom Vasari idolized and whose biography was the only one of a living artist to appear in the first edition of his book (the second edition includes accounts of several artists then living, as well as Vasari's own autobiography). The idea of artistic ‘progress’ he promulgated subsequently coloured most writing on the period. Although Vasari's testimony has often been impugned on particular points (see, for example, <a href=""entry://Andrea del Castagno ""><span class=""links"">Andrea del Castagno </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Andrea del Sarto ""><span class=""links"">Andrea del Sarto </span></a>), he gathered together an enormous amount of invaluable information and presented it in a lively style, full of memorable anecdotes. Moreover, his qualitative judgements have generally stood the test of time well. His book became the model for artistic biographers in other countries, such as van <a href=""entry://Mander, Karel van""><span class=""links"">Mander </span></a> in the Netherlands, <a href=""entry://Palomino y Velasco, Antonio""><span class=""links"">Palomino </span></a> in Spain, and <a href=""entry://Sandrart, Joachim von""><span class=""links"">Sandrart </span></a> in Germany.<br class=""nLine"" />As a painter, Vasari was one of the most prolific decorators of his period, but he is not now highly regarded, his work representing the most in-bred and affected kind of <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerism</span></a>. As an architect he has a higher reputation; his most important building is the <a href=""entry://Uffizi""><span class=""links"">Uffizi</span></a> in Florence. He designed and decorated his own house in Arezzo, now a Vasari museum.

<b>Vatican Museums</b><div class=""content"">Institutions housing the enormous collections of antiquities and works of art accumulated by the papacy since the beginning of the 15th cent. As the leaders of the Christian Church the popes were continually showered with gifts; as political rulers they were, paradoxically, chief guardians of the remains of pagan Rome until Italy was unified in 1870. The Vatican collections are now among the largest and most important in the world, housed in a complex of buildings in the papal palace and elsewhere in the Vatican. There are several separate museums and the visitor to them is also admitted to the exhibition rooms of the Vatican Library and to various suites of <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> painting, of which the most important are the Sistine Chapel, decorated by <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> and others, and the Stanze, decorated by <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> and others. The museums had their origin with Julius II (pontificate 1503&ndash;13), who placed some of the most famous works of <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> sculpture in the Cortile del Belvedere (Belvedere Court), accessible to artists, connoisseurs, and scholars. However, it was not until 1734 that a museum proper was set up by Clement XII.

"Velde, Willem van de the Elder","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Velde, Willem van de the Elder</b><div class=""content""><i>(1611&ndash;93).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch marine painter. He was the son of a naval captain, his brother was a skipper of merchant vessels, and he himself spent part of his youth as a sailor before devoting himself to the drawing and painting of ships. His pictures, which are frequently <a href=""entry://grisaille""><span class=""links"">grisailles</span></a>, contain faithful and detailed portraits of ships (of much value to naval historians) and for a time he was an official artist for the Dutch fleet. In 1672, when the Netherlands were at war with England, he went to London and entered the service of Charles II; why he left his country at a critical moment in its fortunes remains a mystery. <i>Willem the Younger</i> (1633&ndash;1707), his son, is one of the most illustrious of all marine painters. He was the pupil of his father and Simon de <a href=""entry://Vlieger, Simon de""><span class=""links"">Vlieger </span></a>. Like his father, he gave very accurate portrayals of ships, but is distinguished from him by his feeling for atmosphere and majestic sense of composition. He left Amsterdam for England with his father in 1672 and in 1674 Charles II gave them a yearly retaining fee of £100 each; the father received his ‘for taking and making draughts of seafights’ and the son ‘for putting the said draughts into colours for our own particular use’. They did not switch their allegiance to England completely; both subsequently painted pictures of naval battles for the Dutch as well as the English market. Willem the Younger's influence, however, was particularly great in England, where the whole tradition of marine painting stemmed from him. Adriaen (1636&ndash;72), Willem II's younger brother, was a versatile and prolific artist in spite of his short life. His father and Jan <a href=""entry://Wijnants, Jan""><span class=""links"">Wijnants </span></a> were his teachers. He painted various types of landscapes (most notably some fresh and atmospheric beach scenes) and also religious and mythological works, portraits, and animal pictures. He also did exceptionally fine etchings of landscapes with cattle and often painted the figures into the landscapes of other artists, notably <a href=""entry://Hobbema, Meindert""><span class=""links"">Hobbema </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Ruisdael, Jacob van""><span class=""links"">Ruisdael </span></a>."

<b>Velázquez </b>
<i>(or Velasquez ), Diego</i><div class=""content""><i>(1599&ndash;1660).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The greatest painter of the Spanish School. He was born in Seville, where in 1610/11 he was apprenticed to <a href=""entry://Pacheco, Francisco""><span class=""links"">Pacheco </span></a> (possibly following a brief period of study with <a href=""entry://Herrera, Francisco the Elder""><span class=""links"">Herrera </span></a> the Elder). In 1617 he qualified as a master painter and in the following year he married Pacheco's daughter. Velázquez was exceptionally precocious and while he was still in his teens he painted pictures that display commanding presence and complete technical mastery. Pacheco's style in religious pantings was Italianate, dry, and academic; Velázquez revitalized it by following his master's advice to ‘go to nature for everything’, and in works such as <i>The Immaculate Conception</i> (NG, London, <i>c.</i>1618) and <i>The Adoration of the Magi</i> (Prado, Madrid, 1619) he developed a more lifelike approach to religious art in which the figures are portraits rather than <a href=""entry://ideal""><span class=""links"">ideal</span></a> types (his young wife may be the model for the Virgin in both these pictures). The light, too, is realistically observed, even though it has a mysterious, spiritual quality. In their strong <a href=""entry://chiaroscuro""><i><span class=""links"">chiaroscuro</i></span></a> as well as their naturalism such pictures show an affinity with the work of <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio </span></a> and his followers. The clotted but supple brushwork is, however, already entirely Velázquez's own. Contemporary with these religious works were a series of <i><a href=""entry://bodegón""><span class=""links"">bodegones</i></a></span>, a type of <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scene to which he brought a new seriousness and dignity, as in <i>The Waterseller of Seville</i> (Wellington Mus., London, <i>c.</i>1620).<br class=""nLine"" />In 1622 Velázquez paid a short visit to Madrid, during which he painted a portrait of the poet Luis de Góngora (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). In the following year he was recalled to the capital by Philip IV's chief minister, the Count-Duke Olivares, and painted a portrait of the king (now lost) that pleased Philip so much that he appointed him one of his court painters and declared that now only Velázquez should paint his portrait. Thus, at the age of 24, he had suddenly become the country's most prestigious painter, and he kept his position as the king's favourite unchallenged for the rest of his life. With his appointment as court painter, the direction of Velázquez's work changed. He entirely abandoned <i>bodegones</i>, and although he painted historical, mythological, and religious pictures intermittently throughout his career, he was from now on primarily a portraitist. Technically, too, his work changed as a result of his move to Madrid, his brushwork becoming broader and more fluid under the influence particularly of the<a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links""> Titians </span></a> in the royal collection. Although his portraits of the king and his courtiers are grand and dignified, he humanized the formal tradition of Spanish court portraiture derived from <a href=""entry://Mor, Anthonis""><span class=""links"">Mor </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Coello, Claudio""><span class=""links"">Coello </span></a>, setting his models in more natural poses, giving them greater life and character, and eliminating unnecessary accessories. The king (who was six years younger than Velázquez) had an extremely high opinion of the artist's personal qualities as well as his artistic skills, and the warmth with which he treated him was considered astonishing, given the stiff etiquette for which the Spanish court was renowned. In 1627 Philip made Velázquez ‘Usher of the Chamber’, the first of a series of appointments that brought him great prestige but took up much of his time in trivial bureaucratic matters, thus partially accounting for his fairly small output as a painter. He was conscientious in his duties, however, and apparently well suited to them temperamentally.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1628&ndash;9 <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens </span></a> visited Spain on a diplomatic mission and he and Velázquez became friends. <a href=""entry://Palomino y Velasco, Antonio""><span class=""links"">Palomino </span></a> records that the contact with Rubens ‘revived the desire Velázquez had always had to go to Italy’, and the king duly gave him permission to travel there. Velázquez was in Italy from 1629 to 1631, visiting Genoa, Venice, and Naples, but spending most of his time in Rome. Two major paintings date from this period&mdash;<i>Joseph's Coat</i> (Escorial, Madrid) and <i>The Forge of Vulcan</i> (Prado), works that show how his brushwork loosened still further under the influence of the great Venetian masters and how his mastery of figure composition matured. The 1630s and 1640s (before he again left for Italy) were the most productive period of Velázquez's career. His series of royal and court portraits continued and he expanded his range in a series of glorious equestrian portraits (Prado). In these he showed an unprecedented ability to attain complete atmospheric unity between foreground and background in the landscape. Their rhetorical poses are in the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> tradition, but they are without bombast or allegorical embellishments and as portraits are characteristically direct. The same ability to look beyond external trappings to the human mystery beneath is seen in his incomparable series of portraits of the pitiful court fools (Prado)&mdash;dwarfs and idiots whom Philip, like other monarchs, kept for his amusement. Velázquez presents them without any suggestion of caricature, but with pathos and human understanding, as if they too are worthy of his respect. During the 1630s and 1640s Velázquez occasionally painted religious and mythological works, but they are all eclipsed by his great masterpiece of contemporary history painting, <i>The Surrender of Breda</i> (Prado, 1634&ndash;5), one of a series of twelve paintings by various court artists glorifying the military triumphs of Philip's reign that were executed for the new Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid. The composition is highly organized, but Velázquez creates a remarkable sense of actuality and no earlier picture of a contemporary historical event had seemed so convincing. Characteristically, he concentrates on the human drama of the situation, as Ambrogio Spinola, the chivalrous Spanish commander, receives the key of the town from Justin of Nassau, his Dutch counterpart, with a superb gesture of magnanimity.<br class=""nLine"" />Between 1648 and 1651 Velázquez paid another visit to Italy in order to purchase paintings and antiques for the royal collection (he may have been there briefly in 1636 but the evidence is inconclusive). Again, he spent most of the time in Rome, where he painted several portraits, including two of his most celebrated works&mdash;<i>Juan de Pareja</i> (Met. Mus., New York, 1650) Juan de Pareja (<i>c.</i>1610&ndash;<i>c.</i>1670), who was himself a painter, was Velázquez's mulatto slave (he granted him his freedom while they were in Rome), and Velázquez painted this portrait because he felt he needed some practice before tackling that of the pope. The <i>Innocent X</i> is by common consent one of the world's supreme masterpieces of portraiture, unsurpassed in its breathtaking handling of paint and so incisive in characterization that the pope himself said the picture was ‘troppo vero’ (too truthful). While in Rome Velázquez fathered an illegitimate son, Antonio, by a widow named Martha, but nothing is known of what became of mother or child. They may have been on Velázquez's mind when he applied for (and was refused) permission to return to Italy in 1657, but his life and work continued to unfold with the same serious dignity and the skeleton in his cupboard remained hidden until 1983, when the documentation was published.<br class=""nLine"" />In his final years in Madrid, Velázquez continued to acquire new honours (the greatest was being made a knight of the Order of Santiago in 1659) and to reach new heights as a painter. His last portraits of the royal family are mainly of the new young Queen, Mariana of Austria, and of the royal children. In these works his brushwork has become increasingly sparkling and free, and the gorgeous clothes the sitters wore (such a change from the sombre costumes of the king and male courtiers) allowed him to show his prowess as a colourist (several examples are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Velázquez never ceased to base his work on scrutiny of nature, but his means grew increasingly subtle, so that detail is entirely subordinated to overall effect. Thus in his late works space and atmosphere are depicted with unprecedented vividness, but when the pictures are looked at closely the forms dissolve into what Kenneth <a href=""entry://Clark, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Clark </span></a> called ‘a fricassee of beautiful brushstrokes’. As Palomino put it, ‘one cannot understand it if standing too close, but from a distance it is a miracle.’<br class=""nLine"" />The culmination of his career is <i>Las Meninas</i> (The Maids of Honour) (Prado, <i>c.</i>1656). It shows Velázquez at his easel, with various members of the royal family and their attendants in his studio, but it is not clear whether he has shown himself at work on a portrait of the king and queen (who are reflected in a mirror) when interrupted by the Infanta Margarita and her maids of honour or vice versa. Velázquez's prominence in the picture seems to assert his own importance and his pride in his art, but in the background he has included two pictures by Rubens showing the downfall of mortals who challenge the gods in the arts. Apparently spontaneous but in the highest degree worked out, it is both Velázquez's most complex essay in portraiture and an expression of the high claims he made for the dignity of his art. Luca <a href=""entry://Giordano, Luca""><span class=""links"">Giordano </span></a> called it ‘the Theology of Painting’ because ‘just as theology is superior to all other branches of knowledge, so is this the greatest example of painting’. Posterity has endorsed his verdict, for in a poll of artists and critics in <i>The Illustrated London News</i> in August 1985, <i>Las Meninas</i> was voted&mdash;by some margin&mdash;‘the world's greatest painting’.<br class=""nLine"" />The number of good contemporary copies of Velázquez's work indicates that he ran a busy studio, but of his pupils only his son-in-law <a href=""entry://Mazo, Juan Bautista Martínez del""><span class=""links"">Mazo </span></a> achieved any kind of distinction. As with most Spanish painters, Velázquez remained little known outside his own country until the Napoleonic Wars, but from the early 19th cent. the technical freedom of his work made him an inspiration to progressive artists, above all <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a>, who regarded him as the greatest of all painters. Most of Velázquez's work is still in Spain, and his genius can be fully appreciated only in the Prado, which has most of his key masterpieces. Outside Spain, he is best represented in London&mdash;in the National Gallery, which has his only surviving female nude, the <i>Rokeby Venus</i> (<i>c.</i>1648), in the Wellington Museum, and in the Wallace Collection."
"Venus de Milo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Venus de Milo</b>.<div class=""content"">A marble statue of Aphrodite, the best known of all ancient statues, found on the small Greek island of Melos (or Milos) in 1820 and now in the Louvre. A plinth found with the statue was signed ‘
andros [Alexandros or Agasandros] of Antioch on the Maeander’, but nothing is known of the sculptor. Originally the statue was thought to date from the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">Classical</span></a> age of Greek sculpture, but it is now put appreciably later&mdash;<i>c.</i>100 BC&mdash;and is thought to be a sophisticated combination of older styles&mdash;the goddess's head derives from the later 5th cent. BC, her nudity from the 4th cent., and her spiral, omnifacial posture from the <a href=""entry://Hellenistic""><span class=""links"">Hellenistic</span></a> age. The <i>Venus de Milo</i> arrived in the Louvre (1821) soon after the <i><a href=""entry://Medici Venus""><span class=""links"">Medici Venus</i></a></span> had been returned to Italy (1815), and its enormous fame stemmed from French determination to persuade the world that they had gained a greater treasure than they had lost; Martin Robertson (<i>A History of Greek Art</i>, 1975) writes that its ‘extraordinary reputation, which started by propaganda, has become perpetuated by habit’. Many 19th cent. critics went into raptures about the figure, which was thought to represent the apogee of female beauty, combining grandeur with gracefulness, but <a href=""entry://Renoir, Pierre-Auguste""><span class=""links"">Renoir </span></a> described it as a ‘big gendarme’. The statue's arms are missing and many conjectures have been made as to what the goddess might have been holding: it has been suggested for example that she is intended as Venus Victrix, and so would have been shown with the golden apple presented to her by Paris when he adjudged her more beautiful than her rivals Juno and Minerva ."

"Vermeer, Jan","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Vermeer, Jan</b><div class=""content""><i>(1632&ndash;75).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter. Among the great Dutch artists of the 17th cent., he is now second in renown only to <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt </span></a>, but he made little mark during his lifetime and then long languished in obscurity. Almost all of the contemporary references to him are in colourless official documents and his career is in many ways enigmatic. Apart from a visit to The Hague in 1672 (to act as an expert witness concerning a group of Italian paintings of disputed authenticity), he is never known to have left his native Delft. He entered the painters’ guild there in 1653 and was twice elected ‘hooftman’ (headman), but his teacher is not known. His name is often linked with that of Carel <a href=""entry://Fabritius, Carel""><span class=""links"">Fabritius </span></a>, but it is doubtful if he can have formally taught Vermeer, and this distinction may belong to Leonaert <a href=""entry://Bramer, Leonaert""><span class=""links"">Bramer </span></a>, although there is no similarity between their work. Only about thirty-five to forty paintings by Vermeer are known, and although some early works may have been destroyed in the disastrous Delft magazine explosion of 1654, it is unlikely that the figure was ever much larger; this is because most of the Vermeers mentioned in early sources can be identified with surviving pictures, whilst only a few pictures now attributed to him are not mentioned in these sources&mdash;thus there are few loose ends. This small output may be at least partially explained by the fact that he almost certainly earned most of his living by means other than painting. His father kept an inn and was a picture-dealer and Vermeer very likely inherited both businesses. In spite of this he had grave financial troubles (he had a large family to support&mdash;his wife bore him fifteen children, and she was declared insolvent in the year after his death).<br class=""nLine"" />Only three of Vermeer's paintings are dated&mdash;<i>The Procuress</i> (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, 1656), <i>The Astronomer</i> (Louvre, Paris, 1668), and its companion <i>The Geographer</i> (Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt, 1669). (Another signed and dated work, <i>St Praxedis mopping up the Blood of the Martyrs</i> of 1655, appeared in the 1970s, but it is of doubtful authenticity. It is in a private collection.) It is difficult to fit his other paintings into a convincing chronology, but his work nevertheless divides into three fairly clear phases. The first is represented by only two works&mdash;<i>Christ in the House of Mary and Martha</i> (NG of Scotland, Edinburgh) and <i>Diana and her Companions</i> (Mauritshuis, The Hague)&mdash;both probably dating from a year or two before <i>The Procuress</i>. They are so different from Vermeer's other works&mdash;in their comparatively large scale, their subject matter, and their handling&mdash;that <i>Diana and her Companions</i> was long attributed to the obscure Jan Vermeer of Utrecht (<i>c.</i>1630&ndash;after 1692), in spite of a genuine signature. <i>The Procuress</i> marks the transition to the middle phase of Vermeer's career, for although it is fairly large and warm in tonality&mdash;like the two history paintings&mdash;it is a contemporary life scene, as were virtually all Vermeer's pictures from now on. In the central part of his career (into which most of his work falls) Vermeer painted those serene and harmonious images of domestic life that for their beauty of composition, handling, and treatment of light raise him into a different class from any other Dutch genre painter. The majority show one or two figures in a room lit from the onlooker's left, engaged in domestic or recreational tasks. The predominant colours are yellow, blue, and grey, and the compositions have an abstract simplicity which confers on them an impact out of relation to their small size. In reproduction they can look quite smooth and detailed, but Vermeer often applies the paint broadly, with variations in texture suggesting the play of light with exquisite vibrancy&mdash;the critic Jan Veth aptly described his paint surface as looking like ‘crushed pearls melted together’. From this period of Vermeer's greatest achievement also date his only landscape&mdash;the incomparable <i>View of Delft</i> (Mauritshuis), in which he surpassed even the greatest of his specialist contemporaries in lucidity and truth of atmosphere&mdash;and his much-loved <i>Little Street</i> (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Another painting of this period is somewhat larger in scale and unusual in subject for him&mdash;<i>The Artist's Studio</i> (Kunsthistorisches Mus., Vienna), in which Vermeer shows a back view of a painter, perhaps a suitably enigmatic self-portrait. In the third and final phase of his career Vermeer's work lost part of its magic as it became somewhat harder. There are still marvellous passages of paint in all his late works, but the utter naturalness of his finest works is gone. The only one of his paintings that might be considered a failure, the <i>Allegory of Faith</i> (Met. Mus., New York), belongs to this period. His wife was a Catholic and he may well have been converted to her religion, but his rather lumbering figure shows he was not at ease with the trappings of <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> allegory. There are symbolic references in other of his paintings, but they all&mdash;except for this one&mdash;make sense on a straightforward naturalistic level.<br class=""nLine"" />No drawings by Vermeer are known and little is known of his working method. It is virtually certain, however, that he made use of a <a href=""entry://camera obscura""><i><span class=""links"">camera obscura</i></span></a>; the exaggerated perspective in some of his pictures (in which foreground figures or objects loom unexpectedly large) and the way in which sparkling highlights sometimes appear slightly out of focus are effects duplicated by unsophisticated lenses. The scientist Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632&ndash;1723), celebrated for his work with microscopes, became the executor of Vermeer's estate and it may well have been an interest in optics that brought them together.

"Vernet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Vernet</b><div class=""content"">Family of French painters, three members of which attained distinction. <i>Claude-Joseph Vernet </i> (1714&ndash;89) was one of the leading French landscape painters of his period. From 1733 to 1753 he worked in Rome, where he was influenced by the light and atmosphere of <a href=""entry://Claude Gellée ""><span class=""links"">Claude</span></a> and also by the more wild and dramatic art of Salvator <a href=""entry://Rosa, Salvator""><span class=""links"">Rosa </span></a>. With Hubert <a href=""entry://Robert, Hubert""><span class=""links"">Robert </span></a>, he became a leading exponent of a type of idealized and somewhat sentimental landscape that had a great vogue at this time. Vernet was particularly celebrated for his paintings of the sea-shore and ports, and on returning to Paris in 1753 he was commissioned by Louis XV to paint a series of the sea-ports of France. The sixteen which he did are in the Louvre. <i>Antoine-Charles-Horace</i>, known as ‘Carle’ (1758&ndash;1836), son of the foregoing, painted large battle pictures for Napoleon (<i>The Battle of Marengo; Morning of Austerlitz</i>; both at Versailles), and after the restoration of the monarchy he became official painter to Louis XVIII, for whom he did racing and hunting scenes. <i>Émile-Jean-Horace Vernet </i> (1789&ndash;1863), known as Horace Vernet, son of the foregoing, was one of the most prolific of French military painters, specializing in scenes of the Napoleonic era. A portrait of Napoleon and four battlepieces by him are in the National Gallery, London. He also did animal and Oriental subjects. From 1828 to 1835 he was Director of the French Academy in Rome."
"Veronese, Paolo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Veronese, Paolo</b>
<i>(Paolo Caliari )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1528&ndash;88).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter, born at Verona (from which his nickname derives), but active in Venice from about 1553 and considered a member of the Venetian school. With <a href=""entry://Tintoretto ""><span class=""links"">Tintoretto </span></a> he became the dominant figure in Venetian painting in the generation after <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a> and he had many major commissions, both religious and secular. He soon established a distinctive style and thereafter developed relatively little. Few of his paintings are dated or can be reliably dated, so his chronology is difficult to construct. Similarly, because he had such a highly organized studio and his output was so large, there can be problems in distinguishing the work of his own hand. Nevertheless, his status and achievement are clear. He was one of the greatest of all decorative artists, delighting in painting enormous pageant-like scenes that bear witness to the material splendour of Venice in its Golden Age. Marble columns and costumes of velvet and satin abound in his work, and he used a sumptuous but delicate palette in which pale blue, orange, silvery white, and lemon yellow predominate. In his religious works his penchant was for feast scenes from the Bible rather than incidents from Christ's Passion. His love of richness and ornament got him into trouble with the Inquisition in a famous incident when he was taken to task for crowding a painting of the <i>Last Supper</i> with such irrelevant and irreverent figures as ‘a buffoon with a parrot on his wrist
a servant whose nose was bleeding
dwarfs and similar vulgarities’. Veronese staunchly defended his right to artistic license: ‘I received the commission to decorate the picture as I saw fit. It is large and, it seemed to me, it could hold many figures.’ He was instructed to make changes, but the matter was resolved by changing the title of the picture to <i>The Feast in the House of Levi</i> (Accademia, Venice, 1573).<br class=""nLine"" />Veronese's secular works include the delightfully light-hearted frescos (including <a href=""entry://illusionism""><span class=""links"">illusionistic</span></a> architecture and enchanting landscapes) decorating the Villa Barbaro at Maser, near Treviso (<i>c.</i>1561), a series of four canvases, <i>Allegory of Love</i> (NG, London, <i>c.</i>1575), for the emperor Rudolf II in Prague, and the resplendent <i>Triumph of Venice</i> (<i>c.</i>1585) on the ceiling of the Hall of the Great Council in the Doges' Palace, Venice. He also painted portraits. His studio was carried on after his death by his brother Benedetto and sons Carletto and Gabriele. He had no significant pupils, but his influence on Venetian painting was important, particularly in the 18th cent., when he was an inspiration to the masters of the second great flowering of decorative painting in the city, above all <a href=""entry://Tiepolo, Giovanni Battista""><span class=""links"">Tiepolo </span></a>."

He was much employed by the Crown&mdash;at Whitehall Palace, Windsor Castle, and Hampton Court&mdash;and also worked at great houses such as Burghley and Chatsworth.

"Verrocchio, Andrea del","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Verrocchio, Andrea del</b>
<i>(Andrea di Cioni )</i><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1435&ndash;88)</span><br class=""nLine"" />. Florentine sculptor, painter, and metalworker, one of the outstanding Italian artists of his period. His nickname&mdash;Verrocchio means ‘true eye’&mdash;refers not to his sharpness of vision, but to the fact that as a youth he had been the protégé of an ecclesiastic of that name. He is said to have studied in <a href=""entry://Donatello ""><span class=""links"">Donatello's </span></a> workshop, but his main training was as a goldsmith, and delicacy of craftsmanship is one of the salient features of his work. Only one work in precious metal by him survives, however&mdash;a silver <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">relief</span></a> of the <i>Beheading of John the Baptist</i> (1477&ndash;80), done for the Baptistery in Florence and now in the Cathedral Museum. His major activity was as a sculptor, principally in bronze, but also in marble and <a href=""entry://terracotta""><span class=""links"">terracotta</span></a>, and his two most famous works rank with the statues of Donatello that inspired them among the great masterpieces of Italian sculpture, whilst also showing the great differences in approach between the two artists. Verrocchio's <i>David</i> (Bargello, Florence, <i>c.</i>1475) is more refined, but less broodingly intense than Donatello's <i>David</i> in the same museum, and Verrocchio's masterpiece, the equestrian statue of the <i>condottiere</i> Bartolommeo Colleoni in Venice (begun 1481, completed after Verrocchio's death), has a magnificent sense of movement and swagger, but less of the heroic dignity of Donatello's <i>Gattamelata</i> statue in Padua. It is much harder to assess Verrocchio's stature as a painter as very few works exist that can be convincingly assigned to his own hand. Nevertheless numerous paintings came from his workshop, which was the largest in Florence at this time, and he trained distinguished painters, most notably <a href=""entry://Leonardo da Vinci ""><span class=""links"">Leonardo da Vinci </span></a>, who assisted his master with the <i>Baptism of Christ</i> (Uffizi, Florence, <i>c.</i>1470), one of the few paintings indisputably by Verrocchio . Leonardo took his superb craftsmanship from Verrocchio and also shared his fascination with two contrasting types&mdash;the tough old warrior (as in the <i>Colleoni</i> monument) and the epicene youth (as in the <i>David</i>). Leonardo's enormous fame has tended to cast a shadow over Verrocchio, but he is generally regarded as the greatest Italian sculptor between Donatello and <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a>."

The Museum of Ornamental Art (as it was originally called) was opened by Queen Victoria on the present site in 1857. The nucleus of the collection consisted of objects of applied art bought from the Great Exhibition, which had been temporarily displayed in a Museum of Manufactures in Marlborough House. Albert's ideal was to improve the standard of design in Britain by making the finest models available to study. A new building on the same site was begun in 1899, designed by Sir Aston Webb, and the name of the Museum was changed to ‘The Victoria and Albert Museum’ at the ceremony of laying the foundation-stone by Queen Victoria . The building was opened by King Edward VII in 1909. At this time the scientific collections were assigned to a separate Science Museum.

The painstakingly naturalistic style he developed at this time developed in the direction of expressive stylization when he devoted himself in 1900 to the study of medieval sculpture in preparation for restoration work on Trondheim Cathedral. In the same year he made his first sketches for the massive project that occupied him for the rest of his life and which he left unfinished at his death&mdash;a series of allegorical groups at Frogner Park, Oslo. Originally only a fountain was planned, but with the help of assistants he went on to create numerous other groups, including a 17-metre-high column composed of intertwining bodies. The symbolism of the scheme is not clear, but essentially it represents ‘a statement of the doubt, disillusion, and physical decline that beset humanity in its passage through this world’ (G. H. Hamilton, <i>Painting and Sculpture in Europe</i>: 1880&ndash;1940, 1967).

On the outbreak of the Revolution she left France (1789), travelling to Italy (1789&ndash;93), Vienna (1793&ndash;4), and St Petersburg (1795&ndash;1802), before returning to Paris (1802). Disliking the Napoleonic regime she left almost immediately and stayed in England (1802&ndash;5), the Netherlands, and Switzerland (1805&ndash;9) before returning once again to Paris. She received distinguished patronage wherever she went and was admitted to several <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">academies</span></a>. Her work is graceful, charming, pleasingly sentimental, and delicately executed. There are good examples in the Louvre. Her memoirs (3 vols., 1835&ndash;7) give a lively picture of the Europe of her day as well as an account of her own works, and vividly demonstrate what a redoubtable woman she was: ‘on the day that my daughter was born I never left my studio and I went on working
in the intervals between labour pains.’"

He changed his name because of his admiration for the 15th-cent. poet François Villon. As a young man he studied law and worked as a newspaper illustrator. Most of his early work was in graphic media, but from <i>c.</i>1910 he concentrated on painting.

In the late 1920s he evolved a technique of abstraction in which he claimed to represent the essence of objects by ‘signs’ rather than by reproducing their properties. His work became more naturalistic from <i>c.</i>1934, but in the 1950s he developed a style of abstraction without relation to natural appearances. Villon lived much of his life in comparative obscurity, but after the Second World War he achieved recognition and honours."

<b>Vischer</b><div class=""content"">Family of German sculptors active in Nuremberg. <i>Hermann the Elder</i> (d. 1488) established the family bronzefoundry, and the business was inherited by his son <i>Peter the Elder</i> (<i>c.</i>1460&ndash;1529), the best-known of the Vischers. He was assisted by five sons: <i>Hermann the Younger</i> (<i>c.</i>1486&ndash;1517), <i>Peter the Younger</i> (1487&ndash;1528), <i>Hans</i> (<i>c.</i>1489&ndash;1550), <i>Jacob</i>, and <i>Paulus</i> . The masterpiece of the Vischer workshop is the spectacular bronze shrine over the sarcophagus of St Sebald in the church dedicated to him in Nuremberg. The first design by Peter the Elder (Academy, Vienna) dates from 1488, but actual work began only in 1508 and was carried on till 1519. Through journeys of the younger generation the workshop had by that time gained a good deal of knowledge of Italian bronzes and in particular the work of north Italian sculptors. Thus the Sebald tomb became a fascinating mixture of <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> styles. The canopy remained Gothic, as also the main figures of the Apostles standing before the supports; but both the base and the <a href=""entry://baldachin""><span class=""links"">baldacchino</span></a> were inhabited by biblical, mythological, and decorative figures conceived in a genuine Renaissance spirit. Peter the Elder included a celebrated self-portrait (complete with tools and leather apron) among these figures. Peter the Elder also made two splendid free-standing figures (1512&ndash;13) of Theodoric and King Arthur for the tomb of the emperor Maximilian I in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck, <i>Georg</i> (<i>c.</i>1522&ndash;92), a son of Hans, seems to have specialized in small decorative bronzes such as ink-wells."

Only one Vorticist exhibition was held, in 1915, and the movement did not survive the First World War (an attempt to revive it in 1920 as Group X proved abortive).

<b>Vouet, Simon</b><div class=""content""><i>(1590&ndash;1649).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> The leading French painter in the first half of the 17th cent. He spent the years 1613&ndash;27 in Italy (mainly in Rome) and achieved a considerable reputation, being made President of the Roman Academy of St Luke in 1624. His early work in Italy was much influenced by <a href=""entry://Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da""><span class=""links"">Caravaggio</span></a>, but he later developed an <a href=""entry://eclectic""><span class=""links"">eclectic</span></a> style in which <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> tendencies were tempered by the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classicism</span></a> of Guido <a href=""entry://Reni, Guido""><span class=""links"">Reni </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Domenichino ""><span class=""links"">Domenichino </span></a>. In 1627 Louis XIII recalled Vouet to Paris and made him his court painter, launching him on an extremely busy and prosperous career. His compromise style proved exactly to the taste of a French public brought up in the <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a> tradition and seeking something new, but unprepared for the dramatic naturalism of the Caravaggesque or the full emotionalism of the Baroque. Only when <a href=""entry://Poussin, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Poussin </span></a> returned from Rome to Paris in 1640&ndash;2 was Vouet's dominance threatened. He painted religious and allegorical works and portraits and was employed on many important decorative schemes, sometimes in conjunction with Jacques <a href=""entry://Sarrazin, Jacques""><span class=""links"">Sarrazin </span></a>. Little of his best decorative work survives, however. Vouet was a versatile and hard-working artist rather than a great one and his success and influence depended on his having hit upon a style which accorded with the taste of the day at a time when French painting was at a low ebb. He introduced new life and a tradition of solid competence and most of the leading members of the next generation of artists passed through his studio, including <a href=""entry://Lebrun, Charles""><span class=""links"">Lebrun </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Le Sueur, Eustache""><span class=""links"">Le Sueur </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Mignard, Pierre""><span class=""links"">Mignard </span></a>.

His first important work was the restoration of murals in the Church of St Cyril, Kiev, and in his subsequent career he showed an affinity with the spirituality of medieval religious art. In 1889 he moved from Kiev to Moscow and there was taken up by the wealthy art patron Savva Mamontov (a portrait of him by Vrubel, 1897, is in the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow). In 1890 he began to do interpretations of Mikhail Lermontov's poem <i>The Demon</i> and the theme became central to his work. In treating it he passed from fairly naturalistic depictions to highly idiosyncratic anguish-ridden images rendered in brilliant fragmented brushwork that recalls the effects of medieval mosaics. The obsessive treatment of the theme reflected his own emotional instability; in 1902 the first symptoms of approaching insanity became apparent, in 1906 he went blind, and he died in a lunatic asylum. Although he was little appreciated in his lifetime, he had great influence on Russian painting in the early 20th cent."

The lucidity, precision, and clarity of his work were enhanced when in 1922/3 he changed from oil painting to <a href=""entry://tempera""><span class=""links"">tempera</span></a>, and during the rest of the 1920s, abandoning <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubist</span></a> leanings, he painted in a more naturalistic manner, showing a penchant for maritime subjects and developing a distinctive type of highly composed marine still life that often has a <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealistic</span></a> flavour, brought about by oddities of scale and juxtaposition and the hypnotic clarity of the lighting (<i>Satellitium</i>, Castle Museum, Nottingham, 1932).

Thus they painted realistic pictures of peasant and middle-class life, often scenes arousing pity or inspiring the oppressed to better themselves. Their exhibitions travelled about the country, bringing art to a new public. The Wanderers (in Russian <i>Peredvizhniki</i>) eventually included most of the leading Russian painters of the last quarter of the 19th cent., notably Vasily Perov (1834&ndash;82), Ilya <a href=""entry://Repin, Ilya""><span class=""links"">Repin </span></a>, Vasily Surikov (1848&ndash;1916), and Viktor Vasnetsov (1848&ndash;1926).

In particular Warburg was impressed by the hold that religious loyalties and astrological superstition retained on the minds of Renaissance merchants and princes, indicating that the subject matter of the paintings they commissioned was no mere pretext for the display of artistic fancies. Warburg published little, but his aim of understanding every work of art in terms of a tradition modified by the psychological needs of the moment had great influence on his followers. The superb library that he built up in his home in Hamburg developed into a research institute, which was transferred to London in 1933 to escape the Nazi regime and in 1944 was incorporated in the University of London as the Warburg Institute. Its field of study is now officially defined as ‘the history of the <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> tradition’ (das Nachleben der Antike), but its intellectual range encompasses, in <a href=""entry://Panofsky, Erwin""><span class=""links"">Panofsky's </span></a> words, ‘the history of art, the history of religion and supersition, the history of science, the history of cultic practices (including pageantry) and the history of literature’.

"Warhol, Andy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Warhol, Andy</b><div class=""content""><i>(1928&ndash;87)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. American painter, graphic artist, film-maker, and writer, born to Czech immigrant parents. In the 1950s he was enormously successful as a commercial artist in New York (specializing in shoe advertisements): by 1956 he was earning $100,000 a year. In 1960 he began making paintings based on mass-produced images such as newspaper advertisements and comic strips, then in 1962 of Campbell's soup cans. They were exhibited in that year with sensational success and Warhol soon became the most famous and controversial figure in American <a href=""entry://Pop art""><span class=""links"">Pop art</span></a>. In the same vein as his soup cans he did pictures of Coca-Cola bottles and made equally banal sculptures of Brillo soap pad boxes and similar cartons. He also embarked on a seemingly endless series of pictures of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Elizabeth Taylor, and other celebrities. Similar in method but different in effect were his pictures of disasters such as car crashes and views of the electric chair. Whatever the subject in his pictures, he often made use of rows of repeated images. The silkscreen process allowed infinite replication, and he was opposed to the idea of a work of art as a piece of craftsmanship, hand-made and expressing the personality of the artist: ‘I want everybody to think alike. I think everybody should be a machine.’ In keeping with this outlook he used clippings of ‘dehumanized’ illustrations from the mass media as his sources, turned out his works like a manufacturer, and called his studio ‘The Factory’. There he was surrounded by a crowd of helpers and hangers-on, described by Robert <a href=""entry://Hughes, Robert""><span class=""links"">Hughes </span></a> as ‘cultural space-debris, drifting fragments from a variety of sixties subcultures’. Warhol liked to give the idea that he took a paternal interest in his followers, but Eric Shanes (<i>Warhol</i>, 1991) writes that ‘Just how cynical he could be in his dealings with his entourage is demonstrated by an incident that occurred in October 1964 when one of his hangers-on, Freddie Herko, committed suicide by jumping from a fifth-floor window in Greenwich Village while high on LSD: Warhol was heard to complain repeatedly that Herko should have forewarned him so that he could have filmed his death.’<br class=""nLine"" />In 1965 Warhol announced his retirement as an artist to devote himself to films and to managing the rock group The Velvet Underground, but in fact he never gave up painting and in the 1970s he made an enormous amount of money churning out commissioned portraits of wealthy patrons. In the 1980s he sometimes collaborated with other painters, including the <a href=""entry://Graffiti art""><span class=""links"">Graffiti artist</span></a> Jean-Michel Basquiat and LeRoi Neiman, who is best known for his illustrations in <i>Playboy</i> magazine. As a film-maker, Warhol became perhaps the only ‘underground’ director to be well known to the general public. His first films were silent and virtually completely static: <i>Sleep</i> (1963)&mdash;a man sleeping for six hours; and <i>Empire</i> (1964)&mdash;the Empire State Building seen from one viewpoint for eight hours: ‘I like boring things.’ Later films, such as the two-screen <i>Chelsea Girls</i> (1966), gained widespread attention because of their voyeuristic concentration on sex. In 1968 Warhol was shot and severely wounded by a bit-part player in one of his films, a member of SCUM (The Society for Cutting Up Men), an incident that added to his legendary status. By this time he was perhaps already more famous for his celebrity-courting lifestyle and deliberately bland persona than for his art; indeed, it could be argued that his advertising skills were nowhere more brilliantly deployed than in promoting himself. In purely financial terms his success in promoting himself was prodigious. At his death (following a routine gall bladder operation) he left a fortune estimated at $100,000,000, most of which went to create an arts charity, the Andy Warhol Foundation. His status as an artist, however, is controversial. Even his most fervent admirers tend to admit that he added little to his achievement as a painter after the mid-1960s, but large claims are sometimes made for his earlier works. Warhol published a celebrity magazine called <i>Interview</i>, and several books appeared under his name, some genuinely written by him, others put together from tapes. <i>The Diaries of Andy Warhol</i> appeared posthumously in 1989. In 1994 a museum dedicated to his work opened in his home town of Pittsburgh."

<b>Watteau, Jean-Antoine</b><div class=""content""><i>(1684&ndash;1721)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. The greatest French painter of his period and one of the key figures of <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> art. He was born at Valenciennes, which had passed to France from the Spanish Netherlands only six years before his birth, and he was regarded by contemporaries as a Flemish painter. There are indeed strong links with Flanders in his art, but it also has a sophistication that is quintessentially French. He moved to Paris in about 1702 and <i>c.</i>1703&ndash;7 he worked with <a href=""entry://Gillot, Claude""><span class=""links"">Gillot </span></a>, who stimulated his interest in theatrical costume and scenes from daily life. Soon afterwards he joined Claude <a href=""entry://Audran, Claude III""><span class=""links"">Audran </span></a>, Keeper of the Luxembourg Palace, and thus had access to <a href=""entry://Rubens, Sir Peter Paul""><span class=""links"">Rubens's</span></a>
<i>Marie de Médicis</i> paintings, which were of enormous influence on him, even though Rubens's robustness was far removed from the fragile delicacy that characterized Watteau's art. Rubens was one of the prime inspirations for the type of picture with which Watteau is most associated&mdash;the <i>fête galante</i> (see <a href=""entry://fête champêtre""><i><span class=""links"">FÊTE CHAMPÊTRE</i></span></a>), in which exquisitely dressed young people idle away their time in a dreamy, romantic, pastoral setting. The tradition of lovers in a parkland setting goes back via <a href=""entry://Giorgione ""><span class=""links"">Giorgione</span></a> to the medieval type known as the Garden of Love, but Watteau was the first painter to make the theme his own, and his individuality was recognized by his contemporaries. In 1717 he submitted a characteristic work, <i>The Pilgrimage to the Island of Cythera</i> (Louvre, Paris; a slightly later variant is in Schloss Charlottenburg, Berlin), as his reception piece to the Academy, and owing to the difficulty of fitting him into recognized categories was received as a ‘peintre de fêtes galantes’, a title created expressly for him. He was, indeed, a highly independent artist, who did not readily submit to the will of patrons or officialdom, and the novelty and freshness of his work delivered French painting from the yoke of Italianate academicism, creating a truly ‘Parisian’ outlook that endured until the <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a> of <a href=""entry://David, Jacques-Louis""><span class=""links"">David</span></a>. Watteau's world is a highly artificial one (apart from scenes of love he took his themes mainly from the theatre), but underlying the frivolity is a feeling of melancholy, reflecting the certain knowledge that all the pleasures of the flesh are transient. This poetic gravity distinguishes him from his imitators, and parallels are often drawn between Watteau's own life and character and the content of his paintings. He was notorious for his irritable and restless temperament and died early of tuberculosis, and it is felt that the constant reminder of his own mortality that his illness entailed ‘infected’ his pictures with a melancholic mood. In 1719 he travelled to London, almost certainly to consult the celebrated physician Dr Richard Mead, but the hard English winter worsened his condition. His early death came when he may have been making a new departure in his art, for his last important work combines something of the straightforward naturalism of his early pictures in the Flemish tradition with the exquisite sensitivity of his <i>fêtes galantes</i>: it is a shop sign painted for the picture dealer Edmé Gersaint and known as <i>L'Enseigne de Gersaint</i> (Staatliche Mus., Berlin, 1721).<br class=""nLine"" />Watteau was careless in matters of material technique and many of his paintings are in consequence in a poor state of preservation. A complete picture of his genius depends all the more, then, on his numerous superb drawings, many of them scintillating studies from the life. He collected his drawings into large bound volumes and used these books as a reference source for his paintings (the same figure often appears in more than one picture). In spite of his difficult temperament, Watteau had many loyal friends and supporters who recognized his genius, and although his reputation suffered with the Revolution and the growth of Neoclassicism, he always had distinguished admirers. It is perhaps as a colourist that he has had the most profound influence. His method of juxtaposing flecks of colour on the canvas was carried further by <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a> and later reduced to a science by <a href=""entry://Seurat, Georges""><span class=""links"">Seurat </span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionists</span></a>.

He also had a nephew and a greatnephew (father and son) who worked more-or-less in his manner. They are both known as ‘Watteau de Lille’ after their main place of work&mdash;<i>Louis-Joseph Watteau </i> (1731&ndash;98) and <i>François-Louis-Joseph Watteau </i> (1758&ndash;1823)."
"Watts, George Frederic","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Watts, George Frederic</b><div class=""content""><i>(1817&ndash;1904).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> English painter and sculptor. In 1843 he won a prize in the competition for the decoration of the Houses of Parliament and used the money to visit Italy, where the great <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> masters helped shape his high-minded attitudes towards art. After returning to England in 1847, he established a solid reputation in intellectual circles, but popular fame did not come until about 1880. Thereafter he was the most revered figure in British art, and in 1902 became one of the original holders of the newly instituted Order of Merit. His style was early influenced by <a href=""entry://Etty, William""><span class=""links"">Etty</span></a>, but the <a href=""entry://Elgin Marbles""><span class=""links"">Elgin Marbles</span></a>, the great Venetian painters (notably <a href=""entry://Titian ""><span class=""links"">Titian </span></a>), and <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> were his avowed exemplars in his desire ‘to affect the mind seriously by nobility of line and colour’. He tried to invest his work with moral purpose and his most characteristic paintings are abstruse allegories that were once enormously popular but now seem vague and ponderous (<i>Hope</i>, Tate, London, 1886; and other versions). His portraits of great contemporaries (<i>Gladstone, Tennyson, J. S. Mill</i>, etc., NPG, London) have generally worn much better. As a sculptor, he is remembered chiefly for his equestrian piece <i>Physical Energy</i> (1904). A cast of it forms the central feature of the Cecil Rhodes Memorial, Cape Town, and another is in Kensington Gardens, London. Watts was twice married, his first wife being the celebrated actress Ellen Terry . She was thirty years his junior and the marriage ended in divorce. His former house at Compton, near Guildford, Surrey, is now the Watts Gallery, devoted to his work.

<b>Weber, Max</b><div class=""content""><i>(1881&ndash;1961)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. Russian-born American painter, sculptor, printmaker, and writer, whose work more than that of any other American artist synthesized the latest European developments at the beginning of the 20th cent. He emigrated to New York with his parents when he was 10. From 1905 to 1908 he travelled in Europe, studying in Paris at the <a href=""entry://académie""><i><span class=""links"">Académie</i></span></a> Julian and with <a href=""entry://Matisse, Henri""><span class=""links"">Matisse </span></a>, admiring early <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> and becoming a friend of Henri <a href=""entry://Rousseau, Henri""><span class=""links"">Rousseau </span></a>. After his return to New York in 1909 he rapidly became a controversial figure&mdash;no other American avant-garde artist of the time exhibited his work more widely or was more harshly attacked. His work was influenced by <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauvism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://primitive""><span class=""links"">primitive</span></a> art (he was one of the first American artists to show interest in it), but most importantly by Cubism (in sculpture as well as painting). After about 1917, however, Weber's work became more naturalistic. During the 1930s his subjects often expressed his social concern and in the 1940s his work included scenes with rabbis and Jewish scholars&mdash;mystical recollections of his Russian childhood. He published several books, including <i>Cubist Poems</i> and the autobiographical <i>Max Weber</i> (1945)."

<b>Weenix, Jan Baptist</b><div class=""content""><i>(1621-before 1663).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Dutch painter. In 1642&ndash;6 he was in Italy, and on his return to his native Amsterdam he painted Italianate landscapes close in style to those of <a href=""entry://Berchem, Nicolaes""><span class=""links"">Berchem</span></a>, who is said to have been his cousin. Later he turned mainly to pictures of still life with dead game; he also painted portraits. His son, <i>Jan Weenix </i> (1642?&ndash;1719), specialized in hunting trophy subjects similar to those of his father; indeed, it is often difficult to tell their work apart. Most of his career was spent in Amsterdam, but from 1702 to 1712 he worked at Düsseldorf for the Elector Palatine. Both artists were prolific (Jan told <a href=""entry://Houbraken, Arnold""><span class=""links"">Houbraken</span></a> that his father could paint three half-length life-size portraits in a day) and are represented in many public collections."
"Weight, Carel","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Weight, Carel</b><div class=""content""><i>(1908&ndash; ).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> British painter. In the Second World War he served with the Royal Engineers and Army Education Corps and was appointed an <a href=""entry://Official War Art""><span class=""links"">Official War Artist</span></a> in 1945, working in Austria, Greece, and Italy. He began teaching at the <a href=""entry://Royal College of Art""><span class=""links"">Royal College of Art</span></a> in 1947 and was Professor of Painting there from 1967 until his retirement in 1973. Weight is something of a maverick figure (‘I don't like the art world very much. I don't like the dealers and I don't like the critics’) and his work is highly individual. His best-known paintings are imaginative figure compositions, set in suburban surroundings. They are superficially realistic, but feature idiosyncratic perspective effects and strange human dramas, producing an effect that is sometimes humorous and sometimes menacing: ‘My art is concerned with such things as anger, love, fear, hate and loneliness, emphasized by the ordinary landscape in which the dramatic scene is set.’ Weight has also painted portraits and landscapes."

He often favours aggressively sexual subjects and is best known for his continuing series <i>Great American Nude</i> (began 1961), in which the nude becomes a depersonalized sex symbol set in a realistically depicted commonplace environment. He emphasizes the woman's nipples, mouth, and genitals, with the rest of the body depicted in flat, unmodulated colour. In other works he isolates parts of the body still further, as in his <i>Smoker</i> series, in which the mouth&mdash;often depicted on a huge scale&mdash;becomes a provocatively erotic symbol."
"West, Benjamin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>West, Benjamin</b><div class=""content""><i>(1738&ndash;1820)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. American history and portrait painter who spent almost all his career in England. After early success as a portraitist in New York, he sailed for Italy in 1760. He spent three years studying there, chiefly in Rome, and in 1763 he settled in London. Here he soon repeated the professional and social success he had enjoyed in Italy, in part due to the novelty value of his being an American (a blind cardinal enquired whether he was a Red Indian). He became a founder member of the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> in 1768 (in 1792 he succeeded <a href=""entry://Reynolds, Sir Joshua""><span class=""links"">Reynolds</span></a> as President) and in 1772 he was appointed historical painter to George III, with whom he had a long and lucrative association. Initially West had set up as a portraitist in London, but it was as a history painter that he made his mark. In Rome he had been in contact with the circle of Gavin <a href=""entry://Hamilton, Gavin""><span class=""links"">Hamilton </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Mengs, Anton Raffael""><span class=""links"">Mengs </span></a>, and his early work is in a determined but rather flimsy <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> style (<i>Agrippina Landing at Brundisium with the Ashes of Germanicus</i>, Yale Univ., 1768). With his famous <i>Death of Wolfe</i> (NG, Ottawa, 1770), however, he made a radical innovation by depicting the figures in contemporary costume. At first he was attacked for breaking with the conventions of the <a href=""entry://Grand Manner""><span class=""links"">Grand Manner</span></a>, but his idea was soon adopted by other artists, most notably his countryman <a href=""entry://Copley, John Singleton""><span class=""links"">Copley</span></a>, and it marks an important turning-point in taste. As his style grew away from Neoclassicism, West was in the vanguard of the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romantic</span></a> movement with paintings such as the melodramatic <i>Saul and the Witch of Endor</i> (Wadsworth Atheneum; Hartford, 1777), and his <i>Death on a Pale Horse</i> (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1802) has been hailed as a forerunner of <a href=""entry://Delacroix, Eugène""><span class=""links"">Delacroix </span></a>. Following <a href=""entry://Kent, William""><span class=""links"">Kent</span></a>, he was also one of the pioneers of medieval subjects; in 1787&ndash;9 he produced a series of paintings for Windsor Castle showing events from the life of Edward III. West's historical importance far outweighs the quality of his work, which (in spite of its modernity in ideas) is generally pedestrian. He was the first American painter to achieve an international reputation and his influence on his successors, such as <a href=""entry://Trumbull, John""><span class=""links"">Trumbull </span></a>, was great."

His history paintings (he contributed to <a href=""entry://Boydell, John""><span class=""links"">Boydell's</span></a> Shakespeare Gallery) are typical of the work of a second-class artist of the generation that was trained in the 18th-cent. tradition and lived to adapt itself to the <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a> of the new century.

After his return to London, he soon had a very large practice, second only to <a href=""entry://Chantrey, Sir Francis""><span class=""links"">Chantrey </span></a>. His best-known work is the huge <i>Achilles</i> statue (unveiled 1822) in Hyde Park; it honours the Duke of Wellington and is made of bronze&mdash;33 tons&mdash;from captured French cannon! At the time the figure's conspicuous nudity was considered shocking or amusing, especially considering it had been paid for by a group of lady subscribers. Westmacott also did the pediment sculpture on the British Museum (finished 1847). His work is dignified but often rather pedestrian and dead in handling. He was Professor of Sculpture at the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> from 1827 to 1854. Two of his brothers, <i>George</i> (active 1799&ndash;1827) and <i>Henry</i> (1784&ndash;1861), were sculptors, as was his son, another <i>Richard Westmacott </i> (1799&ndash;1872)."
"Weyden, Rogier van der","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Weyden, Rogier van der</b><div class=""content""><i>(1399/1400&ndash;64)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. The leading Netherlandish painter of the mid-15th cent. In spite of his contemporary celebrity (his work was appreciated in Italy as well as north of the Alps), his reputation later faded, and there is little secure knowledge about his career. There are, in fact, no paintings that can be given to him indisputably on the basis of signatures or contemporary documentation, but several are mentioned in early sources, and the style these show is so distinctive that a coherent <i>œuvre</i> has been built up around them. His early career is still somewhat problematic, however. In 1427 a certain Rogelet de la Pâture entered the workshop of Robert Campin at Tournai and left as Maistre Rogier in 1432. It is generally accepted that this is Rogier van der Weyden (the French and Flemish forms of the name both meaning ‘Rogier of the Meadow’), although it is uncertain why he should have started his apprenticeship so late. There are no documented pictures surviving from Campin's hand, but he is generally agreed to be identical with the <a href=""entry://Master of Flémalle""><span class=""links"">Master of Flémalle</span></a>, so the whole question of Rogier's relationship with his master is based on stylistic analysis. Some scholars have assumed that the Master of Flémalle should be identified with the young Rogier rather than with Campin, but the prevailing opinion is now that Rogier's work shows a development from the powerfully naturalistic and expressive style of his master towards greater refinement and spirituality. Rogier's celebrated <i>Deposition</i> (Prado, Madrid), for example, is close to the Master of Flémalle's <i>Crucified Thief</i> fragment (Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt) in its dramatic power and use of a plain gold background, but it has a new poignancy and exaltedness. <i>The Deposition</i>, like all of Rogier's works, is undated, but it must be earlier than 1443, when a copy was made.<br class=""nLine"" />By 1436 Rogier had moved to Brussels and been appointed official painter to the city. Apart from making a pilgrimage to Rome in 1450, he is never known to have left Brussels again. His work for the city included secular work&mdash;four large panels (destroyed in 1695) on the theme of justice for the court room of the town hall, for example&mdash;but all his surviving paintings are either religious pictures or portraits. He was extremely inventive <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">iconographically</span></a> and compositionally, and was a master of depicting human emotion. Unlike Jan van <a href=""entry://Eyck, Jan van""><span class=""links"">Eyck </span></a> he seems to have had a large workshop with numerous assistants and pupils, and many of his compositions are known in several versions. His influence was strong and widespread; in his own lifetime his paintings were sent all over Europe, and his emotional and dramatic style found more followers than the quiet perfection of van Eyck. Rogier's portraits, usually refined and aristocratic, were also much imitated, influencing Netherlandish art until the end of the 15th cent."

"Whistler, James Abbott McNeill","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Whistler, James Abbott McNeill</b><div class=""content""><i>(1834&ndash;1903)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. American-born painter and graphic artist, active mainly in England. He spent several of his childhood years in Russia (where his father had gone to work as a civil engineer) and was an inveterate traveller. His training as an artist began indirectly when, after his discharge from West Point Military Academy for ‘deficiency in chemistry’, he learnt etching as a US navy cartographer. In 1855 he moved to Paris, where he studied intermittently under <a href=""entry://Gleyre, Charles""><span class=""links"">Gleyre </span></a>, made copies in the <a href=""entry://Louvre""><span class=""links"">Louvre</span></a>, acquired a lasting admiration for <a href=""entry://Velázquez ""><span class=""links"">Velázquez </span></a>, and became a devotee of the cult of the Japanese print (see <a href=""entry://Ukiyo-e""><i><span class=""links"">UKIYO-E</i></span></a>) and oriental art and decoration in general. Through his friend <a href=""entry://Fantin-Latour, Henri""><span class=""links"">Fantin-Latour </span></a> he met <a href=""entry://Courbet, Gustave""><span class=""links"">Courbet </span></a>, whose <a href=""entry://realism""><span class=""links"">Realism</span></a> inspired much of his early work. The circles in which he moved can be gauged from Fantin-Latour's <i>Homage to Delacroix</i>, in which Whistler is portrayed alongside <a href=""entry://Baudelaire, Charles""><span class=""links"">Baudelaire </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Manet, Édouard""><span class=""links"">Manet </span></a>, and others. He settled in London in 1859, but often returned to France. His <i>At the Piano</i> (Taft Mus., Cincinnati, 1859) was well received at the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> exhibition in 1860 and he soon made a name for himself, not just because of his talent, but also on account of his flamboyant personality. He was famous for his wit and dandyism, and loved controversy. His lifestyle was lavish and he was often in debt. Dante Gabriel <a href=""entry://Rossetti, Dante Gabriel""><span class=""links"">Rossetti </span></a> and Oscar Wilde were among his famous friends.<br class=""nLine"" />Whistler's art is in many respects the opposite to his ostentatious personality, being discreet and subtle, but the creed that lay behind it was radical. He believed that painting should exist for its own sake, not to convey literary or moral ideas, and he often gave his pictures musical titles to suggest an analogy with the abstract art of music: ‘Art should be independent of all claptrap&mdash;should stand alone, and appeal to the artistic sense of eye or ear, without confounding this with emotions entirely foreign to it, as devotion, pity, love, patriotism, and the like. All these have no kind of concern with it, and that is why I insist on calling my works “arrangements” and “harmonies”.’ He was a laborious and self-critical worker, but this is belied by the flawless harmonies of tone and colour he created in his paintings, which are mainly portraits and landscapes, particularly scenes of the Thames. No less original was his work as a decorative artist, notably in the Peacock Room (1876&ndash;7) for the London home of the Liverpool shipping magnate Frederick Leyland (now reconstructed in the Freer Gal., Washington), where attenuated decorative patterning anticipated much in the <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a> style of the 1890s.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1877 <a href=""entry://Ruskin, John""><span class=""links"">Ruskin</span></a> denounced Whistler's <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket</i> (Detroit Institute of Arts), accusing him of ‘flinging a pot of paint in the public's face’, and Whistler sued him for libel. He won the action, but the awarding of only a farthing's damages with no costs was in effect a justification for Ruskin, and the expense of the trial led to Whistler's bankruptcy in 1879. His house was sold and he spent a year in Venice (1879&ndash;80), concentrating on the etchings&mdash;among the masterpieces of 19th-cent. graphic art&mdash;that helped to restore his fortunes when he returned to London. He made a happy marriage in 1888 to Beatrix Godwin, widow of the architect E. W. Godwin, with whom Whistler had collaborated, but she died only eight years later. In his fifties Whistler began to achieve honours and substantial success. His portrait of Thomas Carlyle was bought by the Corporation of Glasgow in 1891 for 1,000 guineas and soon afterwards his most famous work, <i>Arrangement in Grey and Black: Portrait of the Painter's Mother</i> (1871), was bought by the French state (it is now in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris) and he was made a member of the Legion of Honour.<br class=""nLine"" />Whistler's paintings are related to <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a> (although he was more interested in evoking a mood than in accurately depicting the effects of light), to <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolism</span></a>, and to <a href=""entry://Aestheticism""><span class=""links"">Aestheticism</span></a>, and he played a major role in introducing modern ideas to British art.

<b>Whitney, Gertrude Vanderbilt</b><div class=""content""><i>(1875&ndash;1942)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. American sculptor, patron, and collector, the founder of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. She was the daughter of Cornelius II Vanderbilt, an immensely wealthy railroad magnate and turned seriously to art after her marriage to Harry Payne Whitney, a financier and world-class polo player, in 1896. Her training as a sculptor included periods at the <a href=""entry://Art Students League of New York""><span class=""links"">Art Students League</span></a> and in Paris, where she knew <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a>. She won several major commissions, notably for monuments commemorating the First World War, including the Washington Heights War Memorial, New York (1921). Her style was traditional, but she was sympathetic towards progressive art and is much more important as a patron than as an artist. In 1907 she opened her New York studio as an exhibition space for young artists, and in 1914 she put her patronage on a more formal basis when she bought the house adjoining her studio, converted it into galleries, and opened it as the Whitney Studio; later she founded a series of organizations in New York with the same aim of helping young artists&mdash;the Friends of Young Artists (1915), the Whitney Studio Club (1918), and the Whitney Studio Galleries (1928). In 1929 she offered to donate her own collection of about 500 American paintings, sculptures, and drawings to the <a href=""entry://Metropolitan Museum of Art""><span class=""links"">Metropolitan Museum</span></a>, New York, but the gift was turned down. Consequently in 1930 she announced the founding of the Whitney Museum of American Art and it opened the following year at 10 West 8th Street in a group of converted brownstone buildings. In 1954 the museum moved to a new building at 22 West 54th Street on land provided by the <a href=""entry://Museum of Modern Art""><span class=""links"">Museum of Modern Art</span></a>, and in 1966 to its present home&mdash;a spectacular building designed for it by Marcel Breuer at 945 Madison Avenue. The museum now has the largest and finest collection of 20th-cent. American art in the world, as well as a good representation from earlier periods. Every other year it holds the Whitney Biennial, a major showcase for work by living artists. Mrs Whitney donated funds to many other good causes, artistic and otherwise, but she was ‘a woman of modest disposition who carried out her public activities quietly’ (<i>Dictionary of American Biography</i>)."

<b>Wilde, Johannes</b><div class=""content""><i>(1891&ndash;1970)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. Hungarian-born art historian who became an Austrian citizen in 1928 and a British citizen in 1947. From 1923 to 1938 he was on the staff of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and he gained an international reputation with his work on the Italian (particularly the Venetian) paintings there. He made many contributions to the attribution and dating of pictures, and one of his most important achievements was the systematic use of X-rays not only as a tool for discovering the physical condition of a painting but also as a guide to the individual artist's creative process. Following the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, Wilde resigned from the Kunsthistorisches Museum and moved to England. From 1948 to 1958 he taught at the <a href=""entry://Courtauld, Samuel""><span class=""links"">Courtauld</span></a> Institute, where he was an inspirational figure&mdash;Kenneth <a href=""entry://Clark, Kenneth""><span class=""links"">Clark </span></a> described him as ‘the most beloved and influential teacher of art history of his time’. Wilde published comparatively little, and as Anthony <a href=""entry://Blunt, Anthony""><span class=""links"">Blunt </span></a> wrote ‘his wisdom was mainly dispensed in lectures, supervisions and private conversation’. During his life-time only two of his major contributions appeared in book form in English, both on <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo's</span></a> drawings&mdash;in the catalogue of the 15th- and 16th-cent. drawings at Windsor Castle (1949, with A. E. Popham ) and in his catalogue of Michelangelo's drawings in the <a href=""entry://British Museum""><span class=""links"">British Museum</span></a> (1953). In these two works, which demonstrate his keen sensibility as well as his great learning, Wilde effectively reversed the ‘revisionist’ tendency whereby many genuine drawings by Michelangelo had been rejected. After his death, two collections of lectures were published: <i>Venetian Art from Bellini to Titian</i> (1974) and <i>Michelangelo</i> (1978)."

In 1825&ndash;8 he travelled abroad for reasons of health and his style changed radically under the influence particularly of Spanish painting, becoming grander in subject-matter and broader in touch. The change was regretted by many of his contemporaries. In 1840 Wilkie went to the Holy Land to research material for his biblical paintings and on the return journey died at sea; <a href=""entry://Turner, J. M.

He studied at the National Gallery School in his native Melbourne, 1944&ndash;9, and then in London, 1951&ndash;6. His earliest etchings, often with music-hall subjects, were produced about this time. He returned to Australia in 1957, and from the late 1950s began to produce paintings revealing a distinctly personal vision of the Australian landscape such as <i>Charcoal Burner</i> (NG of Victoria, 1959). By increasing reductivism, his paintings in the 1970s became uniquely evocative of the primeval mystery and remoteness of Australian landscape, and he was regarded as the most original of Australian landscape painters. His work is represented in all Australian state galleries."

"Wilson, Richard","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Wilson, Richard</b><div class=""content""><i>(1713/14&ndash;82)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. British painter, born in rural north Wales, the son of a well-connected clergyman who encouraged his interest in art as well as giving him a good education. Wilson became the first major British artist to specialize in landscape, but after moving to London in 1729 he seems to have initially worked mainly as a portraitist. The decisive change in his career did not come until his visit to Italy in 1750&ndash;6, when he decided to devote himself exclusively to landscape. He is said to have done this at the urging of Francesco <a href=""entry://Zuccarelli, Francesco""><span class=""links"">Zuccarelli </span></a>, whom he met in Venice and whose portrait (Tate, London, 1751) he painted, but he was more obviously influenced by the painting of <a href=""entry://Claude Gellée ""><span class=""links"">Claude</span></a> and by the natural surroundings of Rome where Claude had worked. Here he found subject-matter suited both to his own taste and to that of his patrons, who were for the most part English noblemen, for whom he made chalk and charcoal drawings as well as paintings.<br class=""nLine"" />Back in England Wilson became sucessful with his Italian landscapes and applied the same classical compositional principles to English and Welsh views, as in his celebrated <i>Snowdon from Llyn Nantlle</i> (versions are in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and the Castle Museum, Nottingham, <i>c.</i>1765). He also painted large historical landscapes more or less in the manner of <a href=""entry://Dughet, Gaspard""><span class=""links"">Dughet </span></a> or Salvator <a href=""entry://Rosa, Salvator""><span class=""links"">Rosa </span></a>, trying to establish himself as a master of the <a href=""entry://Grand Manner""><span class=""links"">Grand Manner</span></a> (<i>The Destruction of the Children of Niobe</i>, Yale Center for British Art, 1760). Wilson, however, had a prickly nature and a problem with drink, and in the early 1770s his career went into a sharp decline. The <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> (of which he had been a founder member in 1768) helped him out by appointing him librarian, but in 1781 his family took him (now a pitiable figure) back to Wales. His work is of great importance in the history of British art, for he transformed landscape from an art that was essentially topographical to one that could be a vehicle for ideas and emotions. The only one of his pupils to attain distinction was Thomas <a href=""entry://Jones, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Jones </span></a>, but he had many imitators and was admired by such later artists as <a href=""entry://Cotman, John Sell""><span class=""links"">Cotman </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Crome, John""><span class=""links"">Crome </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Constable, John""><span class=""links"">Constable </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Turner, J.

<b>Wilson, Scottie</b>
<i>(Robert)</i><div class=""content""><i>(1889&ndash;1972)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. British self-taught painter of imaginative subjects, born in Glasgow of working-class parents. A colourful character, he ran away from home at the age of 16, did military service in India and South Africa, and lived in Canada from about 1930 to 1945. He started to draw in the 1930s. After the Second World War he settled in London and became something of a character in the art world (he was barely literate and fond of the bottle). He made a good living selling his work to dealers but lived in very modest circumstances. Unlike the work of most <a href=""entry://naïve art""><span class=""links"">naïve artists</span></a> (with whom he is sometimes grouped), his pictures (which are often in coloured inks) were not ‘realistic’ renderings of scenes from the daily life with which he was familiar but pure decorative fantasies incorporating stylized birds, fishes, butterflies, swans, flowers, self-portraits, and totem heads. The last of these he saw at Vancouver, and they were rather fancifully thought by some commentators to represent the powers of evil in contrast to the powers of good symbolized in the images taken from nature. All his work, however, was decorative rather than symbolic or profound."

On his return to London he rapidly became successful, carved the state coach (still in use) for the coronation of George III (1760), and was then appointed sculptor to the King (1764). He was an intimate friend of the architect Sir William Chambers, with whom he often collaborated, and he was one of the original members of the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a>. His portraits are generally regarded as his best works, his monuments showing him hesitating between various styles. Much of his work was executed by assistants. His talents were considerable, but he was more interested in social life than his work; he inherited a fortune from his father (a manufacturer of ornamental plaster) but dissipated it and became bankrupt in 1793. Considering the quality of his training and his friendship with key figures in the art world, his career is a story of wasted opportunity."

<b>Winckelmann, Johann Joachim</b><div class=""content""><i>(1717&ndash;68)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. German art historian and archaeologist, a key figure in the <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> movement and in the development of art history as an intellectual discipline. He impressed contemporaries and later generations as much through his romantic life-story as by his writing. The son of a poor cobbler, he early developed a fervent love for <a href=""entry://classicism""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> antiquity and ancient art. After studying theology and medicine he held lowly positions as a schoolmaster and tutor whilst he taught himself Greek and absorbed himself in ancient culture. Eventually, in 1755, Winckelmann managed to reach his goal of Rome (his conversion to Catholicism in 1754 was allegedly to facilitate this), and there he became librarian to the famous collector Cardinal <a href=""entry://Albani ""><span class=""links"">Albani </span></a> and soon established himself as a scholar and antiquarian of European fame. In 1768 he was murdered in Trieste, perhaps for the sake of some gold coins he had shown to a fellow guest at his inn.<br class=""nLine"" />Winckelmann's two most important books are <i>Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst</i>, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (<a href=""entry://Fuseli, Henry""><span class=""links"">Fuseli </span></a> published an English translation in 1765 under the title <i>Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks</i>), and <i>Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums</i> (History of Ancient Art), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book). In these immensely influential works he proclaimed the superiority of Greek art and culture, combining rapturous descriptions of individual works (above all the <i><a href=""entry://Apollo Belvedere""><span class=""links"">Apollo Belvedere</i></a></span>) with historical analysis. He never went to Greece and unwittingly based most of his observations on Roman copies, but his account of the stylistic development of Greek sculpture was a milestone in archaelogical writing, and he is regarded as having laid the foundations of modern methods of art history. His analysis of ancient Greek culture as a unity, and his interpretation of art as an index of the spirit of the time were novel (he thought that when social conditions in general were good, then art was good, and when one declined the other did also); these ideas were subsequently developed into a proper philosophy of culture by 19th-cent. German writers. He refined the notions of how a work may be dated or its place of origin located and explained the character of works of art by reference to such factors as climate, religious customs and social conditions. His influence on contemporary artists&mdash;above all <a href=""entry://Mengs, Anton Raffael""><span class=""links"">Mengs </span></a>&mdash;was enormous, and his interpretation of classical antiquity determined aspects of German education right into the 20th cent."

He was based in Paris for most of his career, but he painted most of Europe's royalty and was a particular favourite of Queen Victoria, who called him ‘excellent, delightful Winterhalter’ (the royal collection has more than a hundred of his paintings). His style was romantic, glossy, and superficial and his portraits have until recently generally been valued more as historical records than as works of art. However, a major exhibition of his work at the National Portrait Gallery, London, and the Petit Palais, Paris, in 1987 brought him into the limelight again. Winterhalter was also an accomplished lithographer. His brother <i>Hermann</i> (1808&ndash;91) was his assistant.

De Wit's style, however, was much lighter than Rubens's, with a <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> delicacy and charm. He was a Catholic and was the first Dutch artist since the 16th cent. to carry out a good deal of decorative work for Catholic churches, but he was at his best in domestic ceiling decorations (<i>Bacchus and Ceres in the Clouds</i>, Huis Boschbeek, Heemstede, 1751). His name has entered the Dutch language to describe a kind of <a href=""entry://trompe-l'œil""><i><span class=""links"">trompe-l'œil</i></span></a> imitation of marble <a href=""entry://relief""><span class=""links"">reliefs</span></a> for which he was renowned; such pictures, usually set over a chimney-piece or door, are called ‘witjes’ (<i>wit</i> is Dutch for ‘white’).

In place of the soft lines and lyrical qualities of <a href=""entry://International Gothic""><span class=""links"">International Gothic</span></a> we find in Witz's work heavy, almost stumpy, figures, whose ample draperies emphasize their solidity. Witz's most famous works are the four surviving panels (forming two wings) from the altarpiece of St Peter he painted for the cathedral in Geneva. These are now in the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire there; the central panel is lost. One of the panels, the <i>Miraculous Draught of Fishes</i>, is Witz's masterpiece and his only signed and dated work (1444). The landscape setting depicts part of Lake Geneva (one of the earliest recognizable landscapes in art) and Witz's naturalism is even more remarkable in his observation of reflection and refraction in the water."

In 1921 he studied at the <a href=""entry://académie""><i><span class=""links"">Académie</i></span></a> Julian in Paris and subsequently travelled widely on the Continent. To influences from modern French art (<a href=""entry://Picasso, Pablo""><span class=""links"">Picasso </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Diaghilev, Sergei""><span class=""links"">Diaghilev </span></a> were among his friends), he added an entirely personal lyrical freshness and intensity of vision, touched with what Gwen <a href=""entry://Raverat, Gwen""><span class=""links"">Raverat </span></a> felicitously described as ‘fashionable clumsiness’. In a remarkably short time he achieved a position of high regard in the art worlds of London and Paris but he was emotionally unstable and his early death was probably suicide (he was killed by a train). After this he became something of a legend as a youthful genius cut off before his prime. Much of Wood's best work was done in Cornwall, where he and his friend Ben <a href=""entry://Nicholson, Ben""><span class=""links"">Nicholson </span></a> discovered the <a href=""entry://naïve art""><span class=""links"">naïve painter</span></a> Alfred <a href=""entry://Wallis, Alfred""><span class=""links"">Wallis </span></a> in 1928."

<b>Wood, Grant</b><div class=""content""><i>(1892&ndash;1942)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. American painter, active mainly in Iowa, his native state. Early in his career he was an artistic jack-of-all-trades. The turning-point in his life came when he obtained a commission to make stained-glass windows for the Cedar Rapids Veteran Memorial Building in 1927 and went to Munich to supervise their manufacture the following year. Influenced by the Early Netherlandish paintings he saw in museums there, he abandoned his earlier <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionist</span></a> style and began to paint in the meticulous, sharply detailed manner for which his work is chiefly known. Adapting this style to the depiction of the ordinary people and everyday life of Iowa, he became one of the leading exponents of <a href=""entry://Regionalism""><span class=""links"">Regionalism</span></a>. He first came to national attention in 1930 when his painting <i>American Gothic</i> won a bronze medal at an exhibition of the Art Institute of Chicago, which now owns the painting. Although at the time it aroused violent controversy and was deplored as an insulting caricature of plain country people, the painting gradually gained great popularity. In 1931 Wood introduced an element of humorous fantasy in <i>The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere</i> (Met. Mus., New York) and in 1932 he painted his famous satirical picture <i>Daughters of the Revolution</i>, (Cincinnati Art Museum), described as ‘three sour-visaged and repulsive-looking females, represented as disgustingly smug and smirking because of their ancestral claim to be heroes of the American Revolution’. His other work includes some vigorous stylized landscapes, and during the 1930s he supervised several Iowa projects of the <a href=""entry://Federal Art Project""><span class=""links"">Federal Art Project</span></a>. In 1934 he became assistant professor of fine arts at the University of Iowa."
"woodcut","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>woodcut</b>.<div class=""content"">The technique of making a print from a block of wood sawn along the grain (the term is also applied to the print so made). It is the oldest technique for making prints and its principles are very simple. The design is drawn on a smooth block of wood (almost any wood of medium softness can be used&mdash;beech, pear, sycamore for example) and the parts that are to be white in the print are cut away with knives and gouges, leaving the design standing up in relief. This is then inked and pressed against a sheet of paper. The origins of woodcut are obscure (the principle was employed in fabric printing in the Middle East at least as early as the 5th cent. AD), but woodcut as we know it appeared in Europe in the early 15th cent.; the earliest dated print is perhaps the <i>St Christopher</i> (1423) by an unknown artist in the John Rylands Library, Manchester. Many of the earliest woodcuts were crude popular religious images designed to be sold at fairs and pilgrim shrines (see also <a href=""entry://block book""><span class=""links"">BLOCK BOOK</span></a>), but in skilled hands the technique could produce much more sophisticated results. Woodcut was at its peak in the first thirty years of the 16th cent., in both individual prints and book illustrations, with <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a> being the supreme master. Thereafter it lost ground to <a href=""entry://line engraving""><span class=""links"">line engraving</span></a>, which could produce subtler effects. In the late 19th and early 20th cents., however, there was a major revival of interest in the woodcut as a medium of original artistic expression. <a href=""entry://Gauguin, Paul""><span class=""links"">Gauguin </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Munch, Edvard""><span class=""links"">Munch </span></a> were the great pioneers in the 1890s, using the grain of the wood to create bold and vigorous textural effects, and they were followed by the German <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionists</span></a> (notably the members of Die <a href=""entry://Brücke, Die""><span class=""links"">Brücke </span></a>), some of whom virtually hacked the design into the block.

Woolner found little gold, but he began to prosper as a portrait sculptor, and after returning to England made a name for himself with his marble bust of Alfred Tennyson of 1857 (Trinity College, Cambridge, and replicas in Westminster Abbey and the NPG). His work was praised for its lifelikeness and he did portraits of many other distinguished sitters. Woolner also did a few figure subjects, occasionally painted, and wrote poetry."

<b>Wotruba, Fritz</b><div class=""content""><i>(1907&ndash;75)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. The leading Austrian sculptor of the 20th cent. His masterly craftsmanship soon won him acclaim, as when his work was shown in an exhibition of Austrian art in Paris in 1929; Aristide <a href=""entry://Maillol, Aristide""><span class=""links"">Maillol </span></a> is said to have refused to believe that such work could have been done by a 22 year old. In his most characteristic works he carved directly in stone, preferring a hard stone with a coarse texture. He began his career working in a naturalistic style reminiscent of Maillol, but moved towards abstraction by reducing the figure to bare essentials. It was similar to the method used by <a href=""entry://Brancusi, Constantin""><span class=""links"">Brancusi </span></a>, but in contrast to Brancusi's smooth, subtle abstractions, Wotruba's figures are solid, block-like structures. They were left in a rough state, creating a feeling of primitive power. Wotruba also worked in bronze, and near the end of his life he branched out into architecture, designing the church of the Holy Trinity on the outskirts of Vienna (constructed 1974&ndash;6). After the Second World War he taught at the Vienna Academy and his work was admired and imitated by many younger Austrian artists, bringing about a revival of sculpture in his country."

The most celebrated member of a family of Dutch painters from Haarlem, where he worked virtually all his life. He became a member of the painters' guild in 1640 and is said by a contemporary source to have been a pupil of Frans <a href=""entry://Hals, Frans""><span class=""links"">Hals </span></a>. The only thing he has in common with Hals, however, is his nimble brushwork, for he specialized in landscapes of hilly country with horses&mdash;cavalry skirmishes, camps, hunts, travellers halting outside an inn, and so on. In this genre he was immensely prolific and also immensely successful&mdash;<a href=""entry://Houbraken, Arnold""><span class=""links"">Houbraken </span></a> says he left his daughter a dowry of 20,000 guilders. He had many imitators, including his brother <i>Peter</i> (1623&ndash;82), and his great popularity continued throughout the 18th cent., when he was a favourite with princely collectors and engravings after his work had wide circulation. Subsequently he has perhaps been underrated, for although his work generally follows a successful formula, he maintained a high quality; his draughtsmanship is elegant, his composition sure, his colouring delicate, and his touch lively."
"Wright, John Michael","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Wright, John Michael</b><div class=""content""><i>(1617&ndash;94)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. English portrait painter. He was apprenticed to George <a href=""entry://Jamesone, George""><span class=""links"">Jamesone </span></a> in Edinburgh in 1636, then spent a long period abroad, chiefly in Rome, where he became a member of the Accademia di S. Luca (see <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">ACADEMY</span></a>), the only British painter of the 17th cent. to have this distinction. On his return to England in 1656 he won many patrons among his fellow Catholics and became <a href=""entry://Lely, Sir Peter""><span class=""links"">Lely's </span></a> chief rival, although he never had his great worldly success and died in modest circumstances. His style was less glossy than Lely's but more penetrating and individual in characterization, his sitters tending to look thoughtful rather than merely glamorous (<i>Magdalen Aston</i>, Castle Museum, Nottingham). Wright's most unusual work is an allegorical ceiling painting (Castle Museum) done for Charles II's bedroom at Whitehall Palace; it cannot be considered a success, but it is interesting as an attempt at <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> decoration by someone who was familiar with the works of Pietro da <a href=""entry://Cortona, Pietro da""><span class=""links"">Cortona </span></a> (whom he described as ‘the greatest master of his time’). Wright was a collector, antiquarian, and scholar, a man of considerable culture; in 1685&ndash;7 he accompanied an embassy from James II to Pope Innocent XI and wrote and account of it in Italian, published in 1687 (English translation, 1688)."
"Wright, Joseph","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Wright, Joseph</b><div class=""content""><i>(1734&ndash;97)</i><br class=""nLine"" />. English painter, born and principally active in Derby and generally known as ‘Wright of Derby’. He was one of the most original, versatile, and accomplished British artists of the 18th cent. and the first major English painter whose career was based outside London. In 1751&ndash;3 and again in 1756&ndash;7 he trained under <a href=""entry://Hudson, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Hudson </span></a> in London, and after returning to Derby he made a name as a portraitist in the Midlands, his works displaying a firm grasp of character. In the 1760s he began to paint candlelit scenes of various types, showing the fascination with unusual lighting effects that was to run throughout his career. He was influenced in some of these by Dutch painting, but in his depictions of the contemporary scientific world he broke new ground&mdash;his finest work, <i>An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump</i> (NG, London, 1768), has been described by Sir Ellis <a href=""entry://Waterhouse, Sir Ellis""><span class=""links"">Waterhouse </span></a> as ‘one of the wholly original masterpieces of British art’. Such works won him a considerable reputation, and in 1772 James <a href=""entry://Northcote, James""><span class=""links"">Northcote </span></a> called him ‘the most famous painter now living for candle-lights’. In 1768&ndash;71 Wright worked in Liverpool, and in 1774&ndash;5 was in Italy, where he assiduously studied the <a href=""entry://antique, the""><span class=""links"">antique</span></a> but was even more impressed by the eruption of Vesuvius he witnessed and by a kind of man-made equivalent&mdash;the great fireworks display held annually at the Castel Sant' Angelo in Rome (he painted several pictures of both subjects). On his return to England in 1775 he moved to Bath, hoping to fill the gap left by <a href=""entry://Gainsborough, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Gainsborough's </span></a> departure for London, but his more forthright style did not please sophisticated society there and in 1777 he returned to Derby. There he remained for the rest of his life apart from short journeys when he made tours of the Lake District in 1793 and 1794 (landscape became increasingly important towards the end of his career). Appropriately, Derby Art Gallery has far and away the finest collection of his work. There are also good examples in the National Gallery and Tate Gallery, London."

"Wyeth, Andrew","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Wyeth, Andrew</b><div class=""content""><i>(1917&ndash; )</i><br class=""nLine"" />. American painter, son and pupil of a well-known muralist and illustrator of children's books, <i>Newell Convers Wyeth </i> (1882&ndash;1944). Wyeth's work consists almost entirely of depictions of the people and places of the two areas he knows best&mdash;the Brandywine Valley around his native Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and the area near Cushing, Maine, where he has his summer home. He usually paints in watercolour or <a href=""entry://tempera""><span class=""links"">tempera</span></a> with a precise and detailed technique, and often he conveys a sense of loneliness or nostalgia (trappings of the modern world, such as motor cars, rarely appear in his work). He became famous with <i>Christina's World</i> (1948), which was bought by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1948 and has became one of the best-known images in American art. It depicts a friend of the artist, Christina Olson, who had been so badly crippled by polio that she moved by dragging herself with her arms. She is shown in a field on her farm in Maine, ‘pulling herself slowly back towards the house’. Building on the picture's fame, Wyeth has gone on to have an enormously successful career. There is great disparity of critical opinion about him, however: J. Carter Brown, Director of the National Gallery in Washington, has called him ‘a great master’, whereas Professor Sam Hunter, one of the leading authorities on 20th-cent. American art, has written ‘What most appeals to the public, one must conclude, apart from Wyeth's conspicuous virtuosity, is the artist's banality of imagination and lack of pictorial ambition. He comfortably fits the commonsense ethos and non-heroic mood of today's popular culture, despite his occasional lapses into gloomy introspection.’"

Swiss art historian, professor at the universities of Basle (1893&ndash;1901), Berlin (1901&ndash;12), Munich (1912&ndash;24), and Zurich (1924&ndash;34). He was one of the most influential art historians of his period, and several of his books are still widely read. They include <i>Die klassische Kunst</i> (Classic Art, 1899), on the art of the High <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, <i>Kunstgeschichtliche Grundbegriffe</i> (Principles of Art History, 1915), and a monograph on <a href=""entry://Dürer, Albrecht""><span class=""links"">Dürer </span></a> (1905). Most of his work was devoted to stylistic analysis, and he attempted to show that style&mdash;in painting, sculpture, and architecture&mdash;follows evolutionary principles. <i>Principles of Art History</i> presents his ideas in the most completely developed form, discussing the transformation from <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> to <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> in terms of contrasting visual schemes&mdash;for example the development from linear to painterly (‘malerisch’). Wölfflin's view that style was a force in its own right rather than an intellectual abstraction and his lack of interest in <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">iconography</span></a> are out of tune with much modern thinking on art history, and his approach is often over-rigid; however, he was a figure of great importance in establishing his subject as an intellectually demanding discipline.

He moved to Paris in 1909 after spending four years in Britain (sent there by his father&mdash;a professor of classics&mdash;to learn ‘English and good manners’). Although he deeply admired <a href=""entry://Rodin, Auguste""><span class=""links"">Rodin </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a> had a greater impact on his work.

The individual style he evolved made great use of hollows and concave inflections, his figures often having openings pierced through them. In 1915 he joined the French army but was invalided out after being gassed. He worked in Paris through the 1920s and 1930s, and spent the Second World War in New York (where he taught at the <a href=""entry://Art Students League of New York""><span class=""links"">Art Students League</span></a>), returning to Paris in 1944. Often Zadkine's work can seem merely melodramatic, but for his greatest commission&mdash;the huge bronze <i>To a Destroyed City</i> (completed 1953) standing at the entry to the port of Rotterdam&mdash;he created an extremely powerful figure that is widely regarded as one of the masterpieces of 20th-cent. sculpture. With its jagged, torn shapes forming an impassioned gesture mixing defence and supplication, it vividly proclaims anger and frustration at the city's destruction and the courage which made possible its rebuilding. This work gave Zadkine an internationed reputation and many other major commissions followed it. The house in which he lived in Paris is now a museum dedicated to his work."

BC).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Greek painter from Heraclea (probably meaning the town of that name in southern Italy, rather than the one on the Black Sea). None of his works survives, but ancient writers describe him as one of the greatest of Greek painters and there are many anecdotes about his remarkable powers of verisimilitude (for an example see <a href=""entry://Parrhasius ""><span class=""links"">PARRHASIUS </span></a>). Another story tells how when called upon to paint a picture of Helen of Troy for a temple at Croton he assembled the five most beautiful maidens of the city and combined the best features of each into one figure of <a href=""entry://ideal""><span class=""links"">ideal</span></a> beauty&mdash;an early example of an idea that later became commonplace in aesthetic theory. He is said to have specialized in <a href=""entry://panel""><span class=""links"">panels</span></a> rather than murals. According to legend, Zeuxis died laughing while painting a picture of a funny-looking old woman, and the story has occasionally formed the basis for later artists' self-portraits. Aert de <a href=""entry://Gelder, Aert de""><span class=""links"">Gelder </span></a> painted himself as Zeuxis (Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt, 1685) and <a href=""entry://Rembrandt ""><span class=""links"">Rembrandt's </span></a> ‘Laughing’ Self-Portrait (<i>c.</i>1665) in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne has also been interpreted in this way."
"Zoffany, Johann","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Zoffany, Johann</b><div class=""content""><i>(1733&ndash;1810).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> German-born painter who settled in England in about 1760 after working in Rome. He was patronized by the famous actor David Garrick and made his name with paintings representing scenes from plays, usually showing Garrick in one of his favourite parts. They show how quickly he adapted to English taste, and he also painted <a href=""entry://conversation piece""><span class=""links"">conversation pieces</span></a> of much the same small scale and in the same relaxed vein. No doubt because of his German background, he was taken up by George III and Queen Charlotte and he painted numerous works for the royal family. The two most important (still in the Royal Collection) are <i>The Academicians of the Royal Academy</i> (1772) and <i>The Tribuna of the Uffizi</i> (1772&ndash;8). For the latter he made a long visit to Florence (1772&ndash;9) and when he returned to England he found that the demand for conversation pieces had slumped. He went to India in 1783 and made a fortune painting Indian princes and expatriate Britons before returning to England in 1789. The remainder of his career was undistinguished. For a long time Zoffany's paintings were valued chiefly as historical records (they are sharp and clear in detail and contain a wealth of information about costume, etc.), but he is now also appreciated for his charm and recognized as an artist who brought new life to the conversation piece."
"Zorach, William","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Zorach, William</b><div class=""content""><i>(1887&ndash;1966).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Lithuanian-born American sculptor. Initially Zorach worked as a painter in a vivid <a href=""entry://Fauvism""><span class=""links"">Fauvist</span></a> style, but he took up sculpture in 1917 and abandoned painting (apart from watercolours) about five years later. His sculpture is figurative and its salient characteristics are firm contours, block-like bulk, and suppression of details: ‘I owe most’, he said, ‘to the great periods of primitive carving in the past&mdash;not to the modern or the classical Greeks, but to the Africans, the Persians, the Mesopotamians, the archaic Greeks and of course to the Egyptians.’ He was a pioneer in America of the revival of direct carving in stone and wood and in this as well as in his formal austerity he exercised a powerful influence on modern American sculpture. He had numerous major commissions, including relief carvings for the Municipal Court Building, New York (1958). His most famous work is not a carving, however, but the aluminium <i>Spirit of the Dance</i> (1932) for Radio City Music Hall, New York&mdash;a heroic female figure that was banished for a time because of its nudity but reinstated by public pressure. Zorach taught at the <a href=""entry://Art Students League of New York""><span class=""links"">Art Students League</span></a> from 1929 to 1966. His wife, <i>Marguerite Thompson Zorach </i> (1887&ndash;1968), was one of America's leading modernist painters in the years immediately before and immediately after the <a href=""entry://Armory Show""><span class=""links"">Armory Show</span></a> (1913), in which both she and her husband exhibited. At this time she painted in a style influenced by Fauvism and <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionism</span></a>. In her later career, however, much of her time was spent selflessly helping her husband with his scupltural commissions, producing many of the preliminary drawings for his work."
"Zorn, Anders","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Zorn, Anders</b><div class=""content""><i>(1860&ndash;1920).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Swedish painter and etcher. After leaving the Stockholm Academy in 1881 because of its restrictive and outdated ideas, he travelled widely, becoming the most cosmopolitan of Scandinavian artists and an international success. He was based in London (1882&ndash;5), then Paris (1888&ndash;96), and visited Spain, Italy, the Balkans, North Africa, and (on several occasions) the USA, where he painted three Presidents. Originally he worked almost exclusively in watercolour, but in 1887&ndash;90 he abandoned the medium for oils. In 1896 he settled permanently at Mora in Sweden, building his own house, which is now a museum dedicated to him. He painted three main types of pictures: portraits, <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes (often depicting the life and customs of the area in which he lived), and female nudes. It is for his nudes&mdash;unashamedly healthy and voluptuous works&mdash;that he is now best known. He often painted them in landscape settings and delighted in vibrant effects of light on the human body, depicted through lush brushwork that recalls the handling of his friend Max <a href=""entry://Liebermann, Max""><span class=""links"">Liebermann </span></a>. Zorn also gained a great reputation for his etchings and he occasionally made sculpture."
"Zuccarelli, Francesco","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Zuccarelli, Francesco</b><div class=""content""><i>(1702&ndash;88).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian painter of landscapes, often featuring mythological subjects. He was born near Florence and studied in Rome, but is associated chiefly with Venice, where he settled in 1732 and worked in the vein of pastoral landscape popularized by Marco <a href=""entry://Ricci, Sebastiano""><span class=""links"">Ricci </span></a>. Like <a href=""entry://Canaletto ""><span class=""links"">Canaletto </span></a>, Zuccarelli was patronized by the English entrepreneur Joseph Smith and his work found a ready market in England. When Richard <a href=""entry://Wilson, Richard""><span class=""links"">Wilson </span></a> (still primarily a portrait painter) visited Venice in 1751 he painted Zuccarelli's portrait and it was perhaps Zuccarelli's encouragement which induced him to turn his attention to landscape. In 1752&ndash;62 and again in 1765&ndash;71 Zuccarelli worked in England, where his delicate <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> style met with great success. He was made a foundation member of the <a href=""entry://Royal Academy of Arts""><span class=""links"">Royal Academy</span></a> in 1768, and on his return to Venice he became President of the Venetian Academy."
"Zuccaro, Taddeo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Zuccaro, Taddeo</b> (1529&ndash;66) and <b>Zuccaro, Federico</b><div class=""content""><i>(<span class=""italic"">c.</i>1540&ndash;1609).</span><br class=""nLine"" /> Italian <a href=""entry://Mannerism""><span class=""links"">Mannerist</span></a>, painters, brothers, from the neighbourhood of Urbino. Taddeo worked mainly in Rome and although he was only 37 when he died he had made a great name for himself as a fresco decorator, working most notably for the <a href=""entry://Farnese""><span class=""links"">Farnese</span></a> family in their palace at Caprarola. His style was based on <a href=""entry://Michelangelo Buonarroti ""><span class=""links"">Michelangelo</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Raphael""><span class=""links"">Raphael</span></a> and tended to be rather dry and wooden. Federico took over his brother's flourishing studio, continuing the work at Caprarola and also the decoration of the Sala Regia in the Vatican (begun by Taddeo in 1561). His talent was no more exceptional than Taddeo's, but he became even more successful and won himself a European reputation&mdash;indeed for a time he was probably the most famous living painter. In 1573/4 he travelled via Lorraine and the Netherlands to England, where he is said to have painted portraits of the Queen and many courtiers, although only two drawings in the British Museum portraying Elizabeth I and Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, can safely be attributed to him. (Many anonymous portraits of the period are improbably attributed to him.) After working in Florence, Rome, and Venice, he was invited to the <a href=""entry://Escorial""><span class=""links"">Escorial</span></a> by Philip II of Spain, where he painted a number of altarpieces (1585&ndash;8). Back in Rome he was elected the first President of the new Accademia di S. Luca, founded in 1593 (see <a href=""entry://academy""><span class=""links"">ACADEMY</span></a>), to which he later gave his house as headquarters. Like many of his contemporaries he believed that correct theory would produce good works of art and himself wrote <i>L'Idea de' Pittori, Scultori, et Architetti</i> (1607). Zuccaro also worked as an architect, designing a doorway in the form of a grotesque face (one enters through the open mouth) for his own house in Rome (the Palazzo Zuccaro, now the Biblioteca Hertziana). The two flanking windows are treated in similar bizarre fashion."

<b>Zuloaga y Zabaleta, Ignacio</b><div class=""content""><i>(1870&ndash;1945).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Spanish painter, the son of <i>Placido Zuloaga </i>, a well-known metalworker and ceramicist.

Bull-fighters, gypsies, and brigands were among his subjects, and he also painted religious scenes and portraits.

He was highly popular during his lifetime (he had a resoundingly successful one-man show in New York in 1925), but his work now often looks rather stagy."
"Zurbarán, Francisco de","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Zurbarán, Francisco de</b><div class=""content""><i>(1598&ndash;1664).</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Spanish painter, born at Fuente de Cantos and active mainly in Seville. He trained there 1614&ndash;17 and after a period at Llerena near his birthplace returned in 1629 as town painter. In 1634&ndash;5 he was in Madrid working for Philip IV on a series of ten pictures on <i>The Labours of Hercules</i> and a large historical scene, <i>The Defence of Cadiz</i> (all now in the Prado, Madrid), but apart from these pictures, a few portraits, and some masterly still lifes, he devoted himself almost entirely to religious works. He worked for churches and monasteries over a wide area of southern Spain and his paintings were also exported to South America. His compositionally simple and emotionally direct altarpieces, combining austere <a href=""entry://naturalism""><span class=""links"">naturalism</span></a> with mystical intensity, made him an ideal Counter-Reformation painter. His most characteristic works are single figures of monks and saints in meditation or prayer, most of which seem to have been executed in the 1630s. The figures are usually depicted against a plain background, standing out with massive physical presence. Many of these monumentally solemn figures are conceived in great series, such as <i>The Members of the Mercedarian Order</i> (Academy, Madrid), or <i>The Carthusian Saints</i> (Cadiz Mus.). But there are single pictures of the same kind. He painted numerous pictures of <i>St Francis</i>, for example (two in the NG, London), and a number of virgin saints. Towards the end of his career Zurbarán's work lost something of its power and simplicity as he tried to come to terms with the less ascetic style of <a href=""entry://Murillo, Bartolomé Esteban""><span class=""links"">Murillo </span></a>, who in the 1640s overtook him as the most popular painter in Seville. In 1658 he moved to Madrid, where he spent his final years. His son <i>Juan</i> (1620&ndash;49) is known from a few still-life paintings."

After studying at Granada, Madrid, and Paris he settled in Rome (1805&ndash;25), where Canova befriended him. He preferred classical themes such as <i>Nestor and Antilochus</i> (Modern Art Mus., Madrid, 1818), but was also a good portraitist."
