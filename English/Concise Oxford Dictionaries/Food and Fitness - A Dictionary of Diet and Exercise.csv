"abdominal muscles","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>abdominal muscles</b><div class=""content"">Four pairs of muscles, often referred to as the stomach muscles, that support and protect the contents of the abdomen and help you to breathe out forcibly. (The technical names for the four pairs of muscles are the rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, and the transversus abdominis.) Strong and healthy abdominal muscles support the back during lifting by stabilizing the vertebral column. If the muscles are weakened by lack of exercise they become pendulous, forming a ‘pot-belly’. Despite claims to the contrary (see <a href=""entry://spot-reducing""><span class=""links"">spot-reducing</span></a>), the only way to develop a flat stomach is by combining an appropriate diet with regular exercises to strengthen and tone the abdominal muscles. Suitable exercises include the abdominal hold, crunches, and curl-ups."

"absorption","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>absorption</b><div class=""content"">Absorption is the process by which nutrients in the gut are taken into the blood-stream so that body cells can use them. For a nutrient to be absorbed, it has to be broken down into substances small enough to pass through the gut wall. Despite eating a balanced meal rich in nutrients, a person may still be malnourished if he or she lacks the enzymes required to break down the food into absorbable components (lack of the enzyme lactase, for example, will result in an inability to digest milk sugar (see <a href=""entry://lactose""><span class=""links"">lactose</span></a>). Malnutrition may also result from damage to the intestinal wall, as happens in people intolerant to gluten (see <a href=""entry://coeliac disease""><span class=""links"">coeliac disease</span></a>), or when one food item interferes with the absorption of another. Absorption of iron and other minerals, for example, may be impaired by drinking tea and coffee, or by eating soya protein, wheat bran, calcium supplements, and fibre. Alternatively, high levels of vitamin C in the diet enhances iron absorption. See also <a href=""entry://phytic acid""><span class=""links"">phytic acid</span></a>."

"Achilles tendon","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Achilles tendon</b><div class=""content"">A large tendon at the back of the ankle which connects the calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) to the heel bone (calcaneus). The tendon is very susceptible to injuries. An Achilles tendon weakened by lack of exercise may rupture if the calf muscle contracts suddenly (for example, when a badminton player suddenly changes from a backward to a forward motion or when a jogger misjudges a curb and lands too far forward on his or her foot). A rupture is often accompanied by a loud crack and victims think they have been struck violently behind the heel. In extreme cases, the tendon may be completely ruptured, leaving the victim incapacitated and requiring surgery. Less severe than a complete rupture, but more common, is Achilles tendinitis. This stress injury is characterized by inflammation, pain, and tenderness in and around the tendon. It is common among runners who train over long distances on hard surfaces, and those who increase their training intensity too quickly. Women distance runners who usually wear high-heeled shoes are at particular risk because these shoes effectively shorten the Achilles tendon over a period of years. When they adopt the more flat footed position during running, their tendons are subjected to more stress than they are used to. Training shoes with high backs or hard heeltabs also increase the risk of injury.<br class=""nLine"" />Treatment for Achilles tendinitis usually includes rest, medication (e.g. aspirin) to reduce the swelling, and appropriate physiotherapy. A heel pad to restrict the range of movement may provide some relief. In severe cases, surgery may be required. If not treated properly, an acute inflammation of the Achilles tendon can develop into a chronic condition that is very difficult to resolve. You can reduce the risk of injuring your Achilles tendon by including an Achilles stretch in your warm-up routine (figure 1). Although this stretch may be performed freestanding, it is easier to do against a wall.<center class=""centre""><img src=""000030.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 1</center><br class=""nLine"" />❏<i> Stand upright about one large pace away from the wall with your feet parallel and about hip width apart. Place your hands against the wall, at shoulder height. Move your right leg half a pace forward. Lunge forward on your right leg so that the knee is brought directly above the ankle. Stretch your left leg back as far as is comfortable with the foot remaining flat on the floor. Slowly flex your left leg to stretch the lower calf muscles and tendon. Hold the stretch for about 10 seconds, relax, and repeat on the other leg.</i>"
"acidosis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>acidosis</b><div class=""content"">The human body functions best when blood and tissue fluids are neither too alkaline nor too acidic. An abnormally high acidity of blood and tissue fluids is called acidosis. It results in chemical reactions taking place less efficiently and can impair muscular contractions which may lead to fatigue.<br class=""nLine"" />There are two main types of acidosis: metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis. Metabolic acidosis may be caused by loss of bases (chemicals which readily accept hydrogen ions and decrease acidity), ingestion of highly acidic foods, or the production of excessive amounts of acid in the body. Respiratory acidosis results from a failure to exhale carbon dioxide from the lungs as quickly as it forms in respiring tissues. Carbon dioxide accumulates in the blood and tissues where it forms carbonic acids. Heavy or severe exercise may also cause temporary acidosis by producing large amounts of both lactic acid and carbon dioxide. Persistent acidosis is rare and usually associated with disease.<br class=""nLine"" />We usually respond to acidosis by breathing very heavily in order to flush out excess carbon dioxide from the body and eliminate excess acids (a process called compensatory hyperventilation). Some athletes use sodium hydrogen carbonate (sodium bicarbonate or baking soda) as a performance enhancer in the belief that it decreases acidity and reduces the risk of acidosis. Research evidence suggests that ingestion of 300 mg of bicarbonate per kilogram of body weight can enhance the performance of all-out, maximal aerobic activities lasting from 1 to 7 minutes."

<b>acquired immune deficiency syndrome</b> (AIDS)<div class=""content"">A disease caused by a blood-borne virus (called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV) that disrupts the body's normal immune responses. HIV is transmitted via body fluids, primarily through sexual intercourse, transfusion of infected blood and plasma products, or injections of drugs through contaminated needles. The general medical consensus is that the risk of infection is very low in groups exercising together or participating in a sport. However, the risk is increased during activities in which blood contact may occur (e.g. boxing). Standard commonsense precautions and adherence to basic principles of hygiene should always be followed if any bleeding occurs to prevent infection with HIV or other disease organisms such as the hepatitis viruses. Exercise usually benefits HIV-infected individuals. If started when still healthy, it can play an important role in the management of the disease while improving the quality of life. Diet is also important, with a high energy diet being necessary as the disease progresses."

<b>acupuncture</b><div class=""content"">An ancient Chinese system of healing in which symptoms are relieved by inserting 3 to 20 thin needles through the skin and muscle at certain points in the body. The points are plotted along the body on lines determined by tradition. Selected points are stimulated by rotating the needle or by passing an electric current through it. The precise mechanism of acupuncture is unknown, but it is thought that the needles act as an external stimulus, encouraging the release of natural chemical painkillers, called endorphins. These are believed to initiate self-healing within the body.<br class=""nLine"" />Acupuncture is used in the Far East as an alternative to anaesthesia for some major operations. It is gaining popularity in the West as a technique for the relief of pain and the treatment of ailments such as arthritis, backpain and depression. If you feel you might benefit from the services of an acupuncturist, choose carefully. Many acupuncturists are not medically qualified. If an acupuncture is not performed properly there is a real danger of infection. Acupuncture has also been used to treat overweight people, and special ‘acupressure’ ear rings are marketed as weight-loss aids, but there is no evidence that they are effective."

"adapted physical exercise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>adapted physical exercise</b><div class=""content"">A number of physical activities have been adapted to enable people with disabilities to participate in competitive sports. The activities may require specially adapted equipment and some specialist medical support, but exercise for the disabled has the same aims and attractions as exercise for the able-bodied.<br class=""nLine"" />Athletes with a permanent disability of the lower body (e.g. because of amputations, spinal cord injuries, or poliomyelitis) can participate in wheelchair sports such as road racing, tennis, basketball, archery, softball, and track and field athletics. One of the fastest growing wheelchair sports is quad rugby. This is a highly competitive sport for quadriplegics. It is played on a basketball court. Four players from one team are allowed on the court at a time and their aim is to carry the ball across their opponent's goal line.<br class=""nLine"" />Wheelchair sports have similar rules and provide a similar experience to other varieties. They are just as competitive. The winner of the wheelchair New York marathon, for example, has to be totally dedicated to training, and just as aerobically fit as the winner of the able-bodied event. In addition, wheelchair athletes have to master the skills required to manoeuvre and drive the specially designed wheelchair.<br class=""nLine"" />The aim of many competitive wheelchair athletes is to take part in the Paralympics. These are competitions, equivalent to the Olympic Games, for athletes with permanent disabilities. The governing body is the International Paralympic Committee, supported and partly funded by the International Olympic Committee. The first Paralympics were held in Rome in 1960, and they have been held every Olympic year since. Activities include archery, athletics, basketball, boccie, cycling, fencing, goal ball, judo, shooting, soccer, swimming, table tennis, and volleyball. Of course, not all disabled people use a wheelchair. Amputees, blind people, those with cerebral palsy, and other physically disabled individuals participate as stand-up participants in many of the activities.<br class=""nLine"" />Many disabled athletes train on a daily basis. They train, often with weights, for flexibility, strength, speed, power, endurance, and to develop specific skills. The training principles for the disabled are the same as those for the able-bodied, but disabled athletes have an additional challenge. They must develop an individual style that takes their specific disability into account, but allows them to use their abilities to the maximum.<br class=""nLine"" />Sports participation offers disabled people a powerful incentive to become fitter, and plays an important part in both the psychological and physical rehabilitation of the disabled. The vast majority of disabled people do not take part in formal, highly-organized competitive sport. Nevertheless, many acquire the benefits of exercise by taking part in a wide range of physical leisure activities, from low-risk activities such as wheelchair aerobics, to high-risk activities, such as skydiving and mountain climbing. As Dr Frank M Brasile, a physical educator with a special interest in adapted exercise, stated ‘…even the sky is no limit to what the individual can do if he or she wants to participate in a desired activity’ (quoted from Mellion, M.B.

It is claimed that Siberian ginseng heightens resistance to physical, chemical, and psychological stress, enhances stamina, increases resistance to infection, accelerates recovery, and that it is not harmful, even in high doses. Although there are several reports of the effects of Siberian ginseng in Eastern European scientific journals, many Western scientists are sceptical about its beneficial effects and are waiting to see the results of rigorous double-blind, cross-over experiments before they make up their minds."

<i>(adductors)</i><div class=""content"">A muscle that moves a body part (e.g. an arm or leg) towards the midline of the body. A strain of the thigh adductors is a relatively common injury of horse riders, fast bowlers, and footballers who make lunge tackles. A simple exercise called the adductor stretch reduces the risk of injury (figure 2). It is also useful for pregnant women and others whose thighs tend to rotate inwards causing backache and flat feet.<center class=""centre""><img src=""000074.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" /> Figure 2 Adductor stretch</center><br class=""nLine"" />❏<i> Sit with your knees apart and legs crossed.

<b>adenosine triphosphate</b><div class=""content"">Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a relatively simple but remarkable chemical. It is the only compound that the body can use directly as fuel for energy-consuming activities, including movement. Without it, we would die. ATP is a high-energy compound made using the energy derived from the breakdown of food during respiration. Physical activity uses enormous quantities of ATP. An active muscle cell requires about two million ATP molecules per second to drive its biochemical machinery. It has been estimated that more than 75 kilograms of ATP are turned over (i.e. made and broken down) during a marathon. The body has only a small store of ATP (approximately 100 grams in an average person). This would be used up in about 1 second if it were not continuously regenerated by respiration."

<b>adipocyte</b>
<i>(fat cell)</i><div class=""content"">A cell containing a glistening oil droplet composed almost entirely of fat. The droplet occupies most of the cell's volume, compressing other components such as the nucleus to one side. Mature adipocytes are among the largest cells of the body. Although they can become plumper by taking up more fat or more wrinkled by losing fat, they are fully specialized for fat storage and have a restricted ability to divide. The number of fat cells within an adult does not usually change, except when a high percentage of the cells are completely full of fat. However, an appropriate diet and exercise programme can be effective at reducing the size of adipocytes."

<b>adipostat</b><div class=""content"">A hypothetical mechanism which keeps the level of body fat of most people within a narrow range despite considerable variations in dietary fat intake and physical activity. It is thought that some people may become obese because of a malfunction in the adipostat, but this hypothesis has not gained general support in the scientific community.<br class=""nLine"" />Three mechanisms for an adipostat have been proposed. The first proposal likens the adipostat to a thermostat. When fat stores exceed genetically determined limits, the adipostat switches on metabolic processes (called futile cycles) that convert excess fat into heat. Conversely, when fat stores run low, the adipostat switches off the futile cycles. Thus fat stores are regulated by the adipostat increasing or decreasing fat metabolism. The second proposal is that a hormone is released from adipose tissues affecting the appetite control centre in the brain. The third proposal is that the activity of special, metabolically active fatty tissue (see <a href=""entry://brown fat""><span class=""links"">brown fat</span></a>) increases when fat stores exceed the normal level, increasing heat output and burning off the excess fat."
"adolescence","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>adolescence</b><div class=""content"">Adolescence, the period between childhood and adulthood, begins after secondary sexual characteristics (e.g. pubic hair) appear and continues until sexual maturity is complete. It is a period during which bones are still growing and there is a high risk of skeletal injuries. Rapid physical changes are accompanied by important psychological changes relating particularly to the way the adolescent perceives himself or herself. This can be a turbulent time. Parents and others, especially sports coaches and teachers, who work with adolescents must be very sensitive to both the physical and the psychological changes taking place during this period. It is unwise for adolescents to take part in exercises which put undue strain on the growth regions of their bones. This is one reason why they are usually excluded from taking part in long-distance running events, such as marathons.<br class=""nLine"" />It is not unusual for an adolescent to add more than 5 kg in body weight and to grow 10 cm in height in one year. Such rapid growth requires good nutrition. Active adolescent boys may need up to 4000 Calories a day, about twice the normal adult requirement. The protein, vitamin, and mineral requirements of adolescents of both sexes are also higher than for adults. Adequate calcium intake is especially important during adolescence to maximize bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life. Eating habits acquired during adolescence are often retained for life. Therefore, adolescents should be encouraged to eat a well balanced diet and not to skip meals."
"adrenaline","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>adrenaline</b><div class=""content"">The so-called ‘fight or flight’ hormone secreted by the inner part of the adrenal gland. It prepares the body for action by its stimulatory effects on muscles, circulation, and carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Adrenaline increases heart rate, the depth and rate of breathing, and metabolic rate. It also improves the force of muscular contractions and delays the onset of fatigue. Its actions oppose those of insulin. Adrenaline accelerates fat mobilization and encourages the conversion of glycogen to glucose.<br class=""nLine"" />Adrenaline and adrenaline-related drugs are sometimes used in sport as stimulants. Although these drugs can improve performance, they may produce harmful side-effects such as heart beat irregularities. Consequently, they are on the International Olympic Committee's list of banned substances."

A survey in April 1994 by the Advertising Standards Authority (the ASA, the controlling body for advertisements in the UK), reported that almost two-thirds of these adverts flouted the advertising code by making ‘miracle’ claims guaranteeing weight loss without mentioning the need to diet and exercise. The code states that advertisements should make it clear that the only way to lose weight is by taking in less energy than the body is using. Claims that weight loss can be achieved wholly by any other means than diet and exercise are not acceptable within the code of practice of the ASA."

<b>aerobic exercise</b>
<i>(steady state exercise)</i><div class=""content"">Any repetitive, rhythmical, relatively low intensity exercise involving large muscle groups. Aerobic exercise increases the body's demands for oxygen and adds to the workload of the heart and lungs, strengthening the cardiovascular system and helping to develop endurance. For aerobic exercise to have lasting benefit, it should have the following features:<blockquote>•&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">FREQUENCY</small>: at least 3 days per week, but no more than 6<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">INTENSITY</small>: high enough to elevate the heart rate to between 60 and 80% of its maximum (see <a href=""entry://training heart rate""><span class=""links"">training heart rate</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">DURATION</small>: 20&ndash;60 minutes of continuous activity.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> Because aerobic exercise is often done slowly and continuously, it is especially suitable for older people, those who have been inactive, or those who are not very fit. However, these groups of people should begin exercising gently and increase the amount gradually as it could be harmful to expect too much too soon. Those with known medical problems should consult a physician to determine appropriate exercise levels. Examples of good aerobic exercise are jogging, brisk walking, cross-country skiing, swimming, cycling, and dance.

<b>aerobic fitness</b>
<i>(cardiorespiratory endurance, cardiovascular fitness)</i><div class=""content"">The ability of the whole body to sustain prolonged, rhythmical activity (such as cycling, running, and swimming) of low to moderate intensity.

"aerobic points","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>aerobic points</b>
<i>(Cooper points)</i><div class=""content"">A scoring system, devised in the 1960s by Dr Kenneth C. Cooper, to compare the beneficial effects of different aerobic exercises on the heart, lungs, and circulatory system. Each exercise is awarded points dependent on the type of exercise, its frequency, intensity, and duration. For example, a two mile walk completed in under 30 minutes, performed five times a week, scores 25 points; four sessions of aerobic dance classes per week scores 36 points. Dr Cooper argued that in order to develop cardiovascular fitness and protect the heart a person needs to earn at least 30 aerobic points each week. He popularized his ideas in eleven books selling more than 20 million copies worldwide. In 1970 he established the Cooper Aerobics Center in Dallas for research into the value of exercise and the practice of preventative, diagnostic, and rehabilitative medicine. His top five forms of aerobic exercise are:<blockquote>•&nbsp;cross-country skiing<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;swimming<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;jogging<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;cycling<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;walking.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>"

<i>(aerobic work capacity)</i><div class=""content"">The maximum rate at which energy is provided by aerobic respiration. Aerobic power is dependent on the ability of the respiratory and circulatory systems to transport oxygen from the air to the respiring tissues, and the ability of the tissues to use the oxygen to break down metabolic fuels. Aerobic power is usually measured in terms of oxygen consumption. See also <a href=""entry://maximal oxygen consumption""><span class=""links"">maximal oxygen consumption</span></a>."

"aerobic training threshold","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>aerobic training threshold</b><div class=""content"">A rough guide to the training intensity required to produce significant beneficial effects on endurance and cardiovascular fitness of most people. In sports physiology, the threshold is usually expressed as a percentage of a person's maximal oxygen consumption (a measure of aerobic fitness). However, facilities for measuring oxygen consumption are available only to a lucky few, therefore target or training heart rates are used as more convenient measures of exercise intensity. The minimum heart rate required to benefit significantly from aerobic training is about 60 per cent of maximum heart rate. For convenience, it is usually assumed that maximum heart rate per minute equals 220 minus age (in years). Therefore, the heart rates required to reach the aerobic threshold for most healthy adults are as follows: <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""><tr><td>AGE</td>

</table></center> It should be emphasized that the above threshold is only a rough guide to training intensities. The benefits gained from a particular aerobic activity depend on the initial fitness level of the individual as well as exercise intensity. A completely sedentary person will benefit from any exercise, even gentle walking. However, the fitness improvements will not be sufficient for participation in a race or something more strenuous than gentle walking. Older people or those who have been inactive for a long time, should exercise below the 60 per cent threshold and increase the intensity gradually. Those with known medical problems should consult a physician to determine appropriate exercise levels. The aerobic threshold increases as fitness improves, so a well-trained person may need to exercise at a minimum of 80 per cent maximum heart rate to gain any training benefits."

<b>aerobics</b><div class=""content"">Rhythmic exercises performed to music. During an aerobics workout, dance steps are mixed with callisthenics, running and jumping. Ballet, disco, jazz, rock, and other types of music supply the tempo and rhythm for the exercises. A well-structured session works the entire body, and takes muscles and joints through their full range of movement, enhancing flexibility and improving strength. A good workout can also develop stamina and help maintain bone mass, vital for women around the menopause and beyond.<br class=""nLine"" />To avoid injury, it is essential to have a good instructor who is properly qualified. Good instructors insist that participants always perform appropriate warm up and cool down exercises to reduce the risk of injury and muscle soreness. They are sensitive to the ability of each member of the class and ensure that the exercise level is neither too low nor too high (many instructors offer graded classes taught at different levels of intensity). Particularly good instructors will expect participants to check their pulse two or three times during the class. They are able and willing to explain how to perform the exercises and the reasons for performing them, and readily correct anyone's poor technique.<br class=""nLine"" />An aerobics session may consist of high-impact or low-impact movements, or a combination. High-impact movements include running on the spot and jumping up and down. These can cause stress injuries, such as shin splints and lower back pain, especially if done on a hard floor (concrete floors are worse, sprung floors are best). Low-impact movements are performed keeping one foot on the ground all the time. They have a low incidence of injury but have to be performed at a high intensity to improve aerobic fitness. Low impact aerobic movements are sometimes combined with upper body conditioning in which exercisers use their own body weight (or light hand weights for added resistance) to improve muscle strength and toning.<br class=""nLine"" />Many people join aerobics classes to lose weight, but most studies show that, although muscles are toned, there is no significant change in the body weight of the majority of participants."

<b>aflatoxins</b><div class=""content"">Peanuts, wheat, corn (maize), beans, and rice stored for a long time in a moist, warm atmosphere tend to go mouldy due to the growth of a fungus called <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>. This fungus produces complex organic poisons, called aflatoxins, that damage the liver if eaten in large amounts. People infected with the hepatitis B virus are particularly susceptible to the harmful effects of the toxins. In addition, aflatoxins are highly carcinogenic. Stored peanuts are particularly vulnerable to the fungus. Even freshly picked peanuts contain some aflatoxins, but the level is usually too low to be harmful. Most processed nuts are subjected to rigorous controls to prevent contamination. Salt also protects against the mould. However, peanuts or peanut products showing any sign of mould should be discarded. The mould can usually be detected by a white or brownish bloom on the nuts, or by a musty taste."
"ageing","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>ageing</b><div class=""content"">As we grow older, we tend to become physically weaker, bones become more brittle and break more easily (see <a href=""entry://osteoporosis""><span class=""links"">osteoporosis</span></a>), reaction times are slower, and fitness declines. The desire and ability to exercise often diminishes, so the tendency to put on body weight (especially in the form of fat) increases. Consequently, the body mass index will also increase. The US National Research Council states that the desirable body mass index range increases with age (from 19 to 24 for a 20-year-old to 24&ndash;29 for a 65-year-old). Nevertheless, it is usually difficult for older people to maintain their desirable body mass index because basal metabolic rate decreases as muscle mass declines with age and lack of exercise. After the age of 60 years, metabolism slows down at a rate of up to three per cent a year. Even if activity levels remain the same, energy intake must drop to avoid excessive weight gain. A lower energy intake (and therefore total food intake) makes it more difficult to ensure adequate supplies of vitamins and minerals. Thus, it is very important that elderly people eat a well-balanced diet, rich in these nutrients.<br class=""nLine"" />Although you cannot change all of the ageing processes, many authorities believe that several of them are actually caused by other factors, such as inactivity. This type of ageing (called acquired ageing) is not inevitable and can be avoided or delayed by taking regular aerobic exercise, eating a balanced diet, and reducing stress. Gerontologists generally agree that poor physical fitness is one of the greatest problems of the elderly, and that a well-designed programme of exercise could help to reduce the effects of ageing, and improve both physical and mental well-being. Ageing curves of exercisers and sedentary people indicate that a steady deterioration in fitness occurs with each decade, but the deterioration is much less in active people than in those who are inactive.<br class=""nLine"" />You are never too old to benefit from exercise. Regular exercise three times a week, consisting of strength training sandwiched between stretching and cycling for the warm up and cool down, can improve strength by over 90 per cent in men and women aged between 56 and 80. This type of exercise will increase total energy expenditure by up to 15 per cent per day, even if the workout uses less than 250 calories. So, regular exercise can increase the strength and fitness of older exercisers, and enable them to control their weight more easily than non-exercisers. Diet may also affect the ageing process. Laboratory mice and rats kept on a calorie-restricted diet live longer and have less age-related diseases than animals fed on unrestricted diets. The applicability of these results to humans is questionable, but there is a growing body of evidence to support the notion that a well-balanced, calorie-controlled diet can delay ageing. There is also a strong suggestion that many foods are potential carcinogens (even glucose may react with amino acids to form mutagens) and that too much food increases the risk of harmful mutations. On the other hand, foods rich in antioxidants (e.g. vitamins A, C, and E) may slow down the ageing process by mopping up the free radicals that many scientists believe are the underlying cause of ageing.<br class=""nLine"" />You cannot halt ageing. It starts at conception and ends at death. But you can increase your chances of maintaining a high level of health throughout your life by taking regular aerobic exercise and eating sensibly."
"agility","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>agility</b><div class=""content"">Agility is the ability to change body position rapidly and accurately without losing balance. It is important in sports and activities in which opponents or obstacles have to be avoided (e.g. slalom events). It is a basic component of physical fitness.

<b>air pollutants</b><div class=""content"">Air pollutants include a multitude of substances that reduce the quality of the environment and make it more dangerous. These noxious substances have a cumulative effect. They may affect various parts of the body, but they are particularly damaging to the lungs, reducing the ability to supply oxygen to the body. High pollution levels therefore reduce your ability to exercise.<br class=""nLine"" />In many cities, car exhaust fumes create high concentrations of nitrogen oxides, ozone and carbon monoxide. Ozone inhalation can tighten the chest and induce asthma-like symptoms, including nausea, throat irritation, and burning eyes. Inhalation of carbon monoxide reduces the capacity of blood to carry oxygen. Cycling in heavy traffic for half an hour is equivalent to chain-smoking up to 20 cigarettes. Many cyclists in New York, Tokyo, London, and other large cities resort to wearing face masks to filter the air in an attempt to limit the intake of these noxious gases. Runners training in traffic have similar problems, but they can usually escape to nearby parks and wooded areas that have lower pollution levels.<br class=""nLine"" />A diet rich in antioxidants (e.g. vitamins A, C, and E) may offer protection against some of the damaging effects of air pollution."
"air resistance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>air resistance</b><div class=""content"">Air resistance is the enemy common to all runners and cyclists. Air produces frictional forces which tend to reduce the speed of anyone moving through it. About eight per cent of a runner's energy is expended in overcoming air resistance, but up to 80 per cent of that energy can be saved by drafting (running directly behind another runner). During cycling even greater savings of energy can be made. The larger the group of cyclists and the further from the front the cyclist rides, the greater the energy saved. This is why it is much easier to ride towards the back of the peloton in the Tour de France, than to ride at the head of the race."
"alanine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>alanine</b><div class=""content"">An amino acid involved in the production of glucose and glycogen. Alanine production is increased in exercising muscle, especially in the fasting state. Some body-builders and weight-lifters take alanine supplements to increase muscle glycogen levels, and improve their muscular endurance and strength-training ability. Alanine, however, is one of the truly non-essential amino acids. There is no evidence that synthesis from other amino acids is ever inadequate to meet demands, unlike some non-essential amino acids which may be synthesized in inadequate amounts under some conditions. Research on amino acid supplementation shows no beneficial effects on strength, power, or muscle growth."
"alcohol","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>alcohol</b><div class=""content"">Alcohol (or more precisely ethanol) is a colourless, tasteless, flammable liquid, formed during the fermentation of yeasts. In medicine, it is used as a tincture and antiseptic but its greatest use is in drinks. It is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream from the mouth cavity and stomach. After absorption, it acts as a depressant on the central nervous system. This may have the beneficial effect of reducing feelings of fatigue but it also reduces judgement, self-control, and concentration. Reactions are slowed by alcohol and muscular coordination is impaired. Alcohol also acts as a diuretic, stimulating the kidneys to eliminate more urine which can result in dehydration.<br class=""nLine"" />Alcohol can lessen hand tremor and improve performance in ‘aiming’ sports such as archery, fencing, and shooting, but because of its potentially harmful effects, its use is restricted by some sports federations.<br class=""nLine"" />Alcohol and its after-effects decrease aerobic fitness. Tests of rugby players showed that those suffering from a hangover 16 hours after drinking alcohol performed on average almost 12 per cent worse than when they had no hangover.<br class=""nLine"" />Alcohol is no great friend to the athlete, nor is it to those on a weight-loss diet. Each gram of pure alcohol provides 7 Calories (7000 calories) of energy. In addition, alcoholic beverages often contain sugar and other nutrients, increasing their calorific value. A single measure of spirits contains about 50 Calories, and one pint of lager contains about 170 Calories. Drinking too much alcohol can lead to obesity because some is converted to fat. Despite its relatively high energy content, alcohol is a poor energy source compared with carbohydrate because it cannot be used directly by muscles, and because of its adverse effects. Before it can be used by heart muscle and skeletal muscle, alcohol has to be broken down in the liver to acetate or acetaldehydes. The breakdown is relatively slow which is why alcohol can remain in the bloodstream for several hours. Alcohol can also inhibit the conversion of glycogen to glucose in the liver. If it is ingested during prolonged exercise it can increase the likelihood of hypoglycaemia (abnormally low blood sugar).<br class=""nLine"" />Moderate drinking has not been linked to any significant health problems. On the contrary, several studies have shown that it can be beneficial and may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by preventing platelets in the blood from sticking together. However, chronic, heavy drinking is a significant health risk: it can shrink the brain; it irritates the stomach and small intestine, resulting in malabsorption and deficiencies of vitamins and minerals; it can damage the liver and cause cirrhosis; and it can adversely affect the cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of heart attacks. Heavy drinking is not compatible with a healthy, active lifestyle.<br class=""nLine"" />As a general rule the following alcoholic drinks contain roughly the same amount of ethyl alcohol (about 8 grams):<blockquote>•&nbsp;a single measure of whisky or other spirit (about 25 ml)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;a glass of wine (125 ml)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;a small glass of sherry or other fortified wine (about 80 ml)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;half a pint of cider, lager or beer (figure 4).<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><center class=""centre""><img src=""000040.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 4 Alcohol.

Drinking more than one glass of wine per hour can damage your liver.<br class=""nLine"" />A Scottish study showed that there was no adverse effect on the babies of women who drank up to 8 units a week when they were pregnant. Nevertheless, pregnant women, those planning a pregnancy, and nursing mothers are generally advised to take no alcohol because it can pass from the mother's bloodstream to the baby. The risk is greatest during the early stages of pregnancy when the baby's brain is developing."

<b>alkali</b>
<i>(alkalosis; alkalinizer)</i><div class=""content"">An alkali is a substance that has a high pH when in solution and tends to neutralize acids. The amount of alkali available in the body to act as a buffer, moderating changes in pH, is called the alkali reserve or standard bicarbonate (because most of the alkali is in the form of bicarbonate ions). A high alkali reserve is particularly important for those involved in high-intensity activities lasting up to three minutes (e.g. 800 metre run). The bicarbonate ions help to neutralize lactic acid produced during anaerobic respiration. Some athletes boost their alkali reserve artificially by ingesting extra amounts of sodium bicarbonate. This can enhance performance for maximal effort activities of 1&ndash;7 minutes duration. When used in this way, sodium bicarbonate is called an alkalinizer. Alkalinizers have also been used by some athletes to avoid drug detection. By raising the pH, they reduce the excretion of metabolic by-products of some stimulant drugs, thereby masking them.<br class=""nLine"" />Although a high alkali reserve is beneficial, an abnormally high pH in the blood or tissue fluids (a condition called alkalosis) can be harmful. The excess alkali can make muscles overreact, causing them to go into cramp-like spasms. There are two forms of alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis usually results from hyperventilation (heavy breathing) which reduces carbon dioxide levels in the body fluids. It can also occur at high altitudes where the air is thin and oxygen levels are low. Metabolic alkalosis often results from ingesting excessive amounts of alkalinizers, or from losing large amounts of acid (for example, by vomiting the acidic stomach contents).

"allergy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>allergy</b><div class=""content"">The word ‘allergy’ was first used in 1906 by a Viennese paediatrician, Baron Clemens von Pirquet, to mean ‘altered reactivity’. It was applied to any abnormal response to a substance. This wide meaning has been retained by some people, but in Britain many doctors limit the term to responses which involve an over-reaction by the body's immune system. Such responses include the classic allergic disorders of asthma, eczema, hay fever, non-seasonal rhinitis (runny nose) and urticaria (nettle rash). These disorders may be triggered by pollen, house dust, fungi, drugs, air pollutants, and some food constituents. The specific allergy-causing substance (allergen) provokes an immunological reaction in skin-prick tests. In the 1960s, scientists discovered that such reactions involve the production of a specific antibody called immunoglobulin E. This binds to the surface of special large cells (mast cells), stimulating them to secrete histamine, serotonin, and prostaglandins. These are the chemicals that produce the allergic reactions such as inflammation of the nasal membranes in hay fever or the contraction of the tubes leading to the lungs which causes asthma.<br class=""nLine"" />True food allergies involve the release of immunoglobulin E when a problem food is eaten. Allergens occur in cow's milk, eggs, nuts, fish, and shellfish, causing allergic reactions that show up in skin and blood tests. They also produce symptoms such as urticaria and a tight chest that makes breathing difficult. Most reactions are short-lived and relatively harmless, but severe allergic reactions leading to anaphylactic shock and death are not uncommon. These reactions may occur in food allergies (nuts are an especial problem) and in response to bee stings in sensitive people. Very few people (probably less than 1 per cent) suffer a true food allergy but between 20 and 30 per cent may have an adverse reaction to food which is not revealed by skin or blood tests (see <a href=""entry://food intolerance""><span class=""links"">food intolerance</span></a>)."
"altitude","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>altitude</b><div class=""content"">As altitude increases, air temperature and pressure decrease and there is less oxygen available for aerobic activities. This lack of oxygen can severely limit the physical performance of endurance athletes and climbers, particularly those accustomed to living at low altitudes. The thin air, however, offers less resistance to sprinters and jumpers, so it is generally easier to perform these activities at high altitudes than at sea level.<br class=""nLine"" />High altitudes are potentially dangerous environments. Anyone who ascends too quickly above 2100 metres can become sick. Individuals differ in their susceptibility to altitude or mountain sickness, but nearly everyone suffers above a height of 4900 metres. Twenty five per cent of visitors to the Colorado skiing areas, just 3000 metres above sea level, suffer some form of altitude sickness. The risk appears to be less if you sleep at a lower altitude than the one at which you are active; the mountaineer's advice ‘play high, sleep low’ appears to be sound.<br class=""nLine"" />Altitude sickness is caused by lack of oxygen and is characterized by shortness of breath, feelings of lassitude, muscular weakness, headaches, rapid pulse, loss of appetite, nausea, and sometimes fainting. The symptoms become more severe the higher a person ascends and the faster the ascent is made, but they usually quickly disappear when the sufferer returns to lower altitudes and rests.<br class=""nLine"" />It can be fatal to continue climbing when suffering from altitude sickness. Each year several people die in high mountain regions such as the Himalayas. The situation is likely to worsen as more people take to the mountains on organized expedition treks. Altitude sickness is best avoided by ascending slowly, drinking plenty of fluids (non-alcoholic!), and giving your body the opportunity to acclimatize to low oxygen levels.<br class=""nLine"" />Altitude acclimatization consists of a number of reversible physiological adaptations. These enable the body to cope with low oxygen levels. In the early stages of acclimatization, breathing and heart rate increase. Major long-term adaptations include the production of more red blood cells, an increase in the haemoglobin content of the blood, and a greater blood supply to muscles. All these adaptations help to improve the ability of the blood to carry oxygen to respiring tissues. Biochemical changes also help the muscles to utilize oxygen more efficiently. Acclimatization to medium altitudes (1829 m above sea level) takes about two weeks, but acclimatization to high altitudes (more than 3048 m above sea level) may take much longer.<br class=""nLine"" />Many elite athletes train at medium altitudes to benefit from the effects of altitude acclimatization and to enhance performance in endurance events. Most exercise scientists believe that the training is of significant benefit only to those who intend competing at high altitudes, and that it is of little benefit to sea-level competitors. To be effective, altitude training must take place at least 1500 metres above sea level and for a period of not less than three weeks, with the first week consisting of light exercise only. It is, however, risky to train at altitudes for very long periods because it may lead to loss of muscle and body weight. It takes three to six weeks at sea level to lose all the effects of altitude training and acclimatization."

Aluminium is toxic and can damage nerve cells. Excess dietary aluminium is normally eliminated in the faeces, but when intakes are very high some aluminium may be retained. Some researchers claim that this retention can contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (senile dementia). A study by the Medical Research Council showed that sufferers of the disease have unusual clusters of nerve cells in the brain saturated with aluminium. There is some evidence that vitamin C may help to reduce aluminium levels in the body."
"Alzheimer's disease","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Alzheimer's disease</b><div class=""content"">Alzheimer's disease is a mysterious, progressive degeneration of the brain that shares some of the characteristics of dementia: memory disorders, changes in personality, deterioration in personal care, impaired reasoning ability, and disorientation. It is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart disease, cancer, and stroke. There are millions of sufferers worldwide. The disease can occur at any age but it is more common among the elderly. Unlike some other forms of secondary dementia, Alzheimer's disease is generally regarded as incurable.<br class=""nLine"" />Several theories have been proposed to explain the development of the disease. One theory is based on the observation that high concentrations of aluminium may accumulate in the brain. Several groups of research workers have suggested that aluminium taken in the diet over a long period of time may contribute to the development of the disease, but this suggestion has not been generally accepted. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, aluminium utensils should not be used for cooking acidic foods (e.g. fruits) because the mineral can be absorbed into the food. Some researchers suggest that the disease is due to an accumulation of a protein (amyloid protein) that congests the brain. In 1992, scientists in the United States showed that a genetic defect may stimulate the production of this protein in some sufferers. A recent theory suggests that Alzheimer's disease may be an inflammatory response which can be slowed or even stopped by aspirin-like drugs. These and other suggestions remain controversial. Despite billions of dollars being spent on research and many theories being postulated, no definitive cause is known. It is possible that there are several forms of the disease and that a number of genetic and environmental factors (including diet) contribute to their development."
"amenorrhoea","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>amenorrhoea</b><div class=""content"">Absence of periods or menses (the flow of blood from the genital tract of women during menstruation). There are many causes of amenorrhoea including pregnancy, stress, weight loss and extreme thinness (amenorrhoea is one of the symptoms of anorexia), and high levels of exercise. The latter condition is sometimes called athletic amenorrhoea. It is relatively common among middle- and long-distance runners, gymnasts, and dancers who tend to have low body weights and a low percentage body fat. There is good evidence that menstruation ceases when the percentage of body fat falls below a critical level, but the relationship between fat levels and menstruation is not simple. Some extremely thin female athletes menstruate normally while others with a higher body fat content are amenorrhoeic. Athletic amenorrhoea is probably due to a number of factors, including the stress associated with regular, intense exercise.<br class=""nLine"" />Until recently, athletic amenorrhoea has been regarded as a harmless variation of the female rhythm since it does not affect long-term fertility. However, failure to menstruate over a long period of time is linked with reduced secretions of female hormones, such as oestrogens. These hormones are made in adipose tissue as well as the ovaries; therefore when the levels of body fat are very low, oestrogen production is reduced. Oestrogens are required for normal mineralization of bone. Low levels of female hormones in young women are associated with a weakening of bones, an increased risk of stress fractures, and osteoporosis. The situation is further exacerbated if the dietary intake of calcium is low. Nevertheless, people of all ages (except young amenorrheic women with low blood oestrogen levels) benefit from exercise, particularly when it is combined with a high calcium diet. It increases bone mineralization and reduces the risk of osteoporosis. See also <a href=""entry://menstruation""><span class=""links"">menstruation</span></a>."
"American football","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>American football</b><div class=""content"">American Football is a tough contact sport that dominates the American sporting scene and is gaining popularity in Europe. It is a game requiring all-round physical fitness. Players have to be fast, strong, and proficient in the six basic skills of football: passing, catching, running, blocking, tackling, and kicking. American football has always been associated with a large number of injuries, not surprising when the game commonly involves players in excess of 240 pounds colliding with each other at full speed. In the United States, it is estimated that more than 300 000 high school players, 35 000 college players, and half of the National Football League players are injured to some extent each season. Head and neck injuries are common: there are approximately 250 000 incidents of concussion each year. Some injuries have been fatal or have resulted in players becoming permanent quadriplegics. However, the number of very severe injuries has declined in recent years. This is probably due to rule changes concerning tackling and blocking with the head, and improvements in protective equipment which were introduced in 1976. There has also been a greater emphasis in training on strengthening the muscles of the neck and learning good tackling techniques. This is particularly important in the younger age group.<br class=""nLine"" />Protective clothing is an essential feature of modern football, but this makes the players vulnerable to heat stroke. One study reported 12 heat stroke deaths among college and high school football players over a three year period. The victims were all interior linemen, probably the players required to work hardest and longest; most were stricken during pre-season practice so they may have been in poor physical condition; all were dressed in full uniforms which increases workload and interferes with heat loss; and most were not permitted to drink water during practice. Clearly, it is essential that players and officials should be aware of the risk of heat stroke, and ensure that drinking water is available during practice and games."
"amino acid supplements","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>amino acid supplements</b><div class=""content"">Amino acid supplements come in the form of pills, capsules, or powders containing a particular concoction of amino acids. Manufacturers usually claim the supplements have special properties, for example, to cure herpes, strengthen fingernails, cure split ends in the hair, improve sleep patterns, or relieve pain and depression. Dieters may take them to spare their bodies' protein while losing weight. One particular combination of amino acids (which includes arginine, lysine, and ornithine), is sold as a slimming aid, accelerating weight loss. There is little scientific evidence to support these claims.<br class=""nLine"" />Most amino acid supplements are sold as anabolic agents to help in body-building; arginine and ornithine are two constituents frequently promoted as ‘natural steroids’ (a distinctly misleading name since they are chemically very different from steroids). Since amino acids are the building blocks of protein, the main component of muscle, it is not surprising that many people believe that, by taking extra amino acids, they can develop larger muscles. But it is important to note that a muscle grows only in response to extra physical demands placed on it. Excess amino acids not needed for growth or repair of body tissues are broken down and excreted as urea, converted into glucose and used as an energy source, or converted to body fat. There is some evidence to support the use of amino acid supplements when there is a natural stimulus to increase muscle bulk, for example during the initial stages of training. There is no scientific evidence, however, to support claims that amino acid supplements improve strength, power, muscle growth, or work capacity. Most nutritionists state emphatically that a normal, healthy person eating a well-balanced diet does not need amino acid supplements. Overconsumption causes health risks. Unbalanced amino acid mixtures or single amino acids may be toxic. If amino-acid supplements are used as the basis of a high-protein, low fat diet they can be downright dangerous because they can cause abnormal heart rhythms.

The other amino acids can be synthesized in the body provided that the total intake of protein is adequate. Amino acids may be used as an energy source during endurance activities, but they probably supply no more than 10 per cent of the body's demands.

<b>amphetamines</b>
<i>(pep pills)</i><div class=""content"">A group of chemicals belonging to the class of drugs called stimulants. Although their effects are inconsistent, amphetamines act as powerful stimulants on the central nervous system producing feelings of euphoria, aggression, and alertness which may be achieved at the expense of good judgment and selfcriticism. They suppress feelings of hunger and were used in slimming pills. But because they are addictive, amphetamines have been replaced by a number of their derivatives (e.g. fenfluramine). Although not as dangerous as amphetamines, these derivatives, in addition to suppressing appetite, may still induce harmful side-effects (e.g. insomnia, depression, and pulmonary hypertension). In 1996, misuse was linked to 15 deaths in the UK. The General Medical Council advise that amphetamine-style drugs should be used only under expert medical supervision to treat certain forms of obesity.<br class=""nLine"" />Amphetamines tend to increase metabolic rate, cardiac output, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and arousal. Claims that they improve the ability to carry out strenuous physical exercise have not been supported by scientific evidence. These drugs are potentially very harmful. Usage may be followed by severe bouts of depression and dependence. Several fatalities have been attributed to the ability of amphetamines to suppress feelings of fatigue, permitting individuals to overexert themselves to such an extent that they suffer heat stroke and cardiac failure. In 1967, the cyclist Tommy Simpson collapsed during a very long climb in the Tour de France. He died on arrival to hospital. An autopsy revealed that amphetamines almost certainly contributed to his death from heat stroke."

"anabolic steroids","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>anabolic steroids</b><div class=""content"">Anabolic steroids are synthetic drugs similar to the male hormone, testosterone. They are taken as tablets, in powder form, or by intramuscular injection, to improve muscle growth, strength, and power. They can be acquired on prescription for the treatment of a number of diseases including anaemia, breast cancer, and post-surgical muscle wasting. But an estimated 200 000 users in the UK take the drugs to enhance their appearance or strength. Several routes of administration are used simultaneously; a process called stacking. Abusers believe that stacking enhances the effects of the drugs. Anabolic steroids may also increase the ability to train hard because they improve muscle repair and tolerance to fatigue. Until relatively recently, the abuse of anabolic steroids was confined mainly to athletes and adult body-builders. Now there seems to be a significant increase in the number of young people, both male and female, taking the drugs. Some estimates place anabolic steroid abuse among young males in American high schools as high as 10 per cent; some are participants in competitive sports but many are not. There is a cultural trend in Western countries for young men to dance at parties with their upper bodies exposed. Many youngsters (some as young as fifteen or less) take anabolic steroids in an attempt to develop well-defined upper body muscles to impress their friends. Young women also take the drug as a short-cut to firm, well-toned bodies low in fat. Users of anabolic steroids may also feel stronger, more aggressive, and more confident. Many law enforcers are seriously concerned that increased aggression associated with steroids (known as ‘roid rage’) is leading more young people to commit violent crimes. If children and teenagers take anabolic steroids regularly, the drugs can adversely affect their skeletal growth. Adults who take anabolic steroids may be affected psychologically, their livers may become damaged, and they may suffer heart disorders. Numerous investigators report that steroid abuse in males may reduce the size of the testes (reflected by decreased testicular tissue on biopsy) and reduce sperm production. In females, the steroids may cause the development of secondary male characteristics such as growth of facial hair, enlargement of the clitoris, disruption of the menstrual cycle, and reduced breast size. Anabolic steroids are responsible for much of the drug abuse in sport. They are on the International Olympic Committee's list of banned substances."

"anaemia","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>anaemia</b><div class=""content"">A condition in which the amount of haemoglobin in the blood of an individual, or the number of red blood cells, is below the normal range for a healthy population of comparable age and sex. The standard varies, but in women the haemoglobin concentration is normally greater than 12 grams per decilitre and in men is greater than 13 grams per decilitre. Anaemia may reduce the oxygen-carrying ability of the blood. It is characterized by brittle or ridged fingernails, loss of appetite, abdominal pains, tiredness, shortness of breath, and headaches.<br class=""nLine"" />The most common cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. Iron is an essential component of haemoglobin. Iron deficiency may result from lack of iron in the diet; inadequate absorption through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream (coffee, for example, can reduce iron absorption by 40&ndash;50 per cent); or excess losses, usually through bleeding (e.g. during menstruation). Iron deficiency affects 10&ndash;15 per cent of women of menstruating age, because iron lost in menstrual blood exceeds the iron obtained from food. These women usually require iron supplements. Those on a strict weight-loss or weight-maintenance diet (such as female gymnasts) often suffer from anaemia. Anaemia caused by dietary deficiencies can be rectified by eating plenty of lean red meat, beans, or peas.<br class=""nLine"" />Many endurance athletes appear to suffer from anaemia because they have low haemoglobin and red blood cell concentrations. This so-called sports anaemia is usually due to an expansion in blood volume which dilutes the concentration of haemoglobin and red blood cells. Rather than causing the athlete any harm, the increased plasma volume is beneficial to fitness and health by making the blood flow more easily and increasing the efficiency of the heart. This increase more than offsets the fall in haemoglobin concentration as it means that more oxygen can be delivered to muscles. Sports anaemia is not true anaemia but is, in medical terms, a dilutional pseudoanaemia. See also <a href=""entry://iron""><span class=""links"">iron</span></a>."
"anaerobic exercise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>anaerobic exercise</b><div class=""content"">An exercise performed at a high intensity and requiring a rate of energy production greater than that supplied by aerobic respiration. A totally anaerobic exercise is an all-out effort of short duration, such as a 100 metre sprint or a clean-and-jerk in weight-lifting. It uses the phosphagen system (sometimes called the ATP-PCr system) of respiration which relies on special high-energy stores. These stores are used as a very quick source of ATP, the chemical required by muscles to contract. The phosphagen system can sustain a maximum effort for only about 10 seconds after which the stores become exhausted. High intensity exercises of longer duration also rely, at least partly, on anaerobic sources of energy. They use a different type of anaerobic respiration, with muscle glycogen as the energy source and lactic acid as a waste product. These exercises can be performed only at submaximal efforts (up to about 90 per cent). A 90 per cent effort can be sustained for a maximum of two or three minutes.<br class=""nLine"" />A training programme that includes short bursts of activity is important for many athletes but less important for a personal fitness programme. Such training can be very demanding physically and psychologically. It can harm those not used to strenuous activity. Even a physically fit person must take sufficient rest between sessions of anaerobic exercise so that the body can recover and adapt to the high demands. It is generally advised that anaerobic exercise should be carried out on no more than three days in any one week."

Put simply, you start to get out of breath. This point is known as the anaerobic threshold and reflects your capacity to work at a steady state. It is an important indicator of aerobic fitness. A number of methods have been used to determine this threshold (see <a href=""entry://blood lactate""><span class=""links"">blood lactate</span></a> and <a href=""entry://conversational index""><span class=""links"">conversational index</span></a>), but none is completely satisfactory.

These include meticulous, gentle cleaning of the affected area with soap and water, followed by thorough rinsing and drying with cotton wool; wearing cotton undergarments; wearing loose clothing; and minimizing exercises which result in anal irritation. In some cases, corticosteroid lotions are prescribed to relieve the itching and allow the skin to heal. Occasionally the condition is caused by infection with an intestinal worm (e.g. threadworms, roundworms, or tapeworms), in which case treatment with a special drug, such as mebendazole (for roundworms and tapeworms) or niclosamide may be necessary."

"anaphylaxis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>anaphylaxis</b><div class=""content"">Hypersensitivity to certain agents, resulting in pain, swelling, and feverishness. A form of anaphylaxis occurs in individuals suffering from nettle rash (urticaria) or asthma, and those who eat foods to which their bodies are allergic (see <a href=""entry://food allergy""><span class=""links"">food allergy</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />A condition called exercise-induced anaphylaxis is triggered in some people by combinations of exercise and particular foods. Typically, symptoms occur five minutes into a bout of intense exercise. Itching is the most common symptom, but others include rashes and difficulty in breathing. The most common food associated with exercise-induced anaphylaxis is raw celery, but other foods including shellfish, peaches, grapes, wheat, and alcohol may increase the risk of an attack. Medications, such as aspirin and antibiotics, have also been linked with the condition. In the USA, there have been over 1000 documented cases of exercise-induced anaphylaxis but no reports of death. However, other forms of anaphylaxis can be more serious (see <a href=""entry://anaphylactic shock""><span class=""links"">anaphylactic shock</span></a>)."

"android fat distribution","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>android fat distribution</b><div class=""content"">The distribution of excess fat, laid down as adipose tissue, predominantly around the abdomen and trunk, and within the abdominal cavity. Fat distribution of this type can result in ‘apple-shaped’ obesity which carries an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. It is far more common in males than females. Although it is not entirely clear why android fat distribution increases the risk of coronary heart diseases, one suggestion is that abdominal fat may be more readily broken down under stress, raising the fatty acid concentration of the blood. This would increase the risk of fat deposition and clogging of the arteries which in turn may lead to high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases.

<b>angina</b>
<i>(angina pectoris)</i><div class=""content"">A gripping, vice-like pain in the chest which sometimes extends down the left arm. It is induced by increases in physical exertion and relieved by rest. The pain usually lasts about 15 minutes. Angina is a symptom of heart disease. It results from a narrowing of the coronary arteries which reduces the oxygen supply to heart muscle. Pain is produced when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen to cope with its workload. A controlled programme of physical activity can benefit angina sufferers, provided it is performed under medical supervision and at a safe level. The appropriate level is usually determined by an exercise test on a cycle ergometer or a treadmill in the presence of a doctor."

<b>ankle sprain</b><div class=""content"">Ankle sprain is the most common injury in sport. The ankle forms the area around the joint between the lower parts of the tibia and fibula, and the tarsal bones at the back of the foot. It is a complex joint, criss-crossed by a number of ligaments that can be damaged easily when the foot is turned over. Treatment usually consists of rest, application of ice, compression, and elevation (see <a href=""entry://RICE""><span class=""links"">RICE</span></a>). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) are often taken to relieve the swelling and pain.

"anorexia nervosa","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>anorexia nervosa</b><div class=""content"">Anorexia nervosa is usually abbreviated to anorexia, and is sometimes referred to as self-starvation syndrome. It is a potentially fatal eating disorder in which there is a loss of appetite or desire for food, leading to severe loss of body weight. Clinical diagnosis is usually based on the following criteria:<blockquote>•&nbsp;weight less than 85 per cent ideal weight<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;intense fear of becoming obese, even when underweight<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;disturbance of body image (i.e. feeling fat even when thin)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;in women, cessation of periods for three or more consecutive cycles when not on the contraceptive pill.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> Anorexia is often associated with other eating disorders, such as bulimia nervosa. Although it can affect adults, both male and female, it occurs most frequently in adolescent girls. Anorexics are ten times more likely to be female than male.<br class=""nLine"" />Anorexia is now recognized as a serious psychological illness and is on the increase in Western societies (one estimate gives a 360 per cent increase over the last 9 years). Anorexics are usually emotionally disturbed and have a distorted body image. They are often convinced that they should be thinner even when their body weight is well below average. They will go to extreme lengths to restrict eating and to lose weight because they have a phobia about becoming obese. This phobia is expressed as an intense fear of gaining weight even when they are dangerously underweight.<br class=""nLine"" />There are many suggested causes of anorexia. It has been linked to dietary problems in early life, parental obsessions with food, problems within the family, and rejection of adult sexuality. Some psychologists see the relentless pursuit of thinness as a desire to be autonomous, to have control over one's own body, and to gain an identity. It is also seen as an attempt constantly to please others. Anorexia has been linked with participation in certain types of sports. Gymnasts, distance runners, and dancers are believed to be prone to eating disorders because of the pressure on them to remain slim, but it is generally agreed that these disorders rarely develop into the full condition. Some sport psychologists and sports nutritionists believe that high levels of physical activity can lead to the development of anorexia nervosa. They contend that strenuous exercise can suppress appetite resulting in a reduced food intake and weight loss. Many people who perceive themselves as being overweight exercise in order to slim. Any weight loss associated with their activity encourages them to exercise even more. This may initiate a cycle of exercise and weight loss that can lead to anorexia. However, although excessive exercise may contribute to anorexia, most experts believe that it is only one contributory factor, and does not explain the majority of cases.<br class=""nLine"" />Whatever the cause, the effects of anorexia are dramatic and potentially very dangerous. The persistent anorexic becomes malnourished, may suffer a variety of medical complications (including hair loss, cessation of periods, and cardiovascular abnormalities), and risks death due to starvation. One recent study reported a mortality rate of 6.6 per cent during a ten-year follow-up period.<br class=""nLine"" />Anorexia is much more than dieting gone wrong. It requires medical treatment and may respond to psychotherapy. The more chronic the condition, the more difficult it is to treat. If treated early, most of the physical symptoms can be corrected through adequate nutrition and the gradual restoration of normal weight. However, the underlying psychological problems may be more resistant to treatment."
"anorexiant drug","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>anorexiant drug</b><div class=""content"">A drug that acts on the brain to reduce appetite. Anorexiants are sometimes included in slimming tablets. They should be used only under strict medical supervision. The main anorectic drugs are dexfenfluramine, fenfluramine, diethyl propion, and mazindol. They have been useful in helping some individuals overcome their obesity."
"antacid","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>antacid</b><div class=""content"">A medicine that neutralizes an acidic stomach (caused by excessive secretion of hydrochloric acid in the gastric juices). Antacids (e.g. aluminium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and magnesium hydroxide) are used to relieve the pain and discomfort of digestive disorders such as peptic ulcers and less serious conditions."
"antagonist","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>antagonist</b><div class=""content"">Muscles usually occur as antagonistic pairs. Each antagonist opposes or reverses the action of its partner. For example, the triceps extends or stretches the arm, and the biceps flexes or bends it. An antagonist may also help to regulate the action of its partner by partially contracting. This resists a movement and reduces the risk of damage from an overload. It may slow or stop an action.<br class=""nLine"" />It is important when training to use both members of an antagonistic pair of muscles (e.g. both the quads and hamstrings in the leg) because imbalances increase the risk of injury."
"anterior compartment syndrome","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>anterior compartment syndrome</b><div class=""content"">A potentially dangerous form of shin splints characterized by feelings of severe pain and burning, inflammation, and hardening of the tissue at the front of the lower leg around the tibia (shin bone). Its exact cause is debatable, but it may result from the expansion of muscle after prolonged training. During exercise, blood flow increases through the compartment. The muscle may swell, pressing blood vessels against the rigid structures of bone and connective tissue. This may reduce the supply of oxygen to the muscle, causing severe pain.<br class=""nLine"" />Anterior compartment syndrome requires radical treatment: elevation, compression with bandages, massage, and administration of anti-inflammatory and anti-diuretic drugs to reduce the swelling and eliminate excess fluids. If the condition is very severe, it may be necessary to surgically relieve the pressure on the blood vessels."
"anterior cruciate ligaments","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>anterior cruciate ligaments</b><div class=""content"">The main ligaments in the knee binding the back of the thigh bone (the femur) to the front of the shin bone (the tibia). They stop the shin bone from moving excessively forward in relation to the femur. If they are damaged, the knee becomes unstable and wobbles.<br class=""nLine"" />Injuries to the cruciate ligament can be dramatic, incapacitating a person instantly. Falling backwards at high speed is a common cause of such injuries among skiers, especially those who are poorly conditioned. Surgery is sometimes needed to rebind the bones.<br class=""nLine"" />Rehabilitation includes special exercises. A typical programme starts immediately after the operation with slow flexion on a passive motion machine. This is followed by several weeks of active bending and straightening of the knee. During this time, more strenuous activities, such as cycling on a stationary bike and exercising in water, are gradually introduced."
"anthropometry","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>anthropometry</b><div class=""content"">Anthropometry is the comparative study of the dimensions of the human body. It involves making precise, highly standardized measurements so that size and shape can be described objectively. Basic anthropometric measurements include those for body mass (weight), stature (height), and skinfold thickness. The procedure for taking the measurements is very strict, as illustrated by the following instructions for measuring height.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>❏The individual must stand straight against an upright surface, touching it with heels, buttocks, and back. The heels should be together and on the floor. The head must be oriented so that the upper border of the ear opening and the lower border of the eye socket are on a horizontal line (the Frankfort plane). The individual must take in and hold a deep breath while height is measured to the nearest millimetre.</i> In many sports, success is often associated with a particular body configuration. For this reason, anthropometry can be used by coaches and trainers to help predict the activity at which an individual is most likely to succeed (see also <a href=""entry://somatotype""><span class=""links"">somatotype</span></a>). Anthropometry is also used extensively to monitor health (see <a href=""entry://body mass index""><span class=""links"">body mass index</span></a> and <a href=""entry://waist-hip ratio""><span class=""links"">waist-hip ratio</span></a>)."

Although the antibiotics used in these feedstuffs are not those used in human medicine, some people still fear that antibiotics may be transferred to humans and destroy beneficial bacteria normally resident in the gut. This is not likely.<br class=""nLine"" />Indiscriminate use of antibiotics (e.g. not taking a full course) can encourage the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.

"antioxidant","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>antioxidant</b><div class=""content"">Antioxidants are chemicals that mop up unstable products of metabolism, called free radicals, which can damage the body. Antioxidants include beta-carotene, and the vitamins A, C, and E. Certain trace elements, such as copper, manganese, selenium, and zinc, also have some antioxidant properties. In addition, phenols (non-alcoholic components of red wine) and many other non-nutrient antioxidants in many plants may act as antioxidants, preventing platelets from sticking together and reducing the risk of blood clots, but this is unproven.<br class=""nLine"" />There is strong evidence that the combined antioxidant properties of vitamins A, C, and E provide some protection against certain cancers, particularly those of the bowel and bladder, and against cardiovascular disease. The World Health Organization recommends that we aim for a daily intake of about 450 grams (1 lb) of fruit and vegetables, especially orange and yellow fruits such as carrots, apricots, and oranges, and green vegetables, such as broccoli, and spinach (perhaps the cartoon hero Popeye had the right idea after all!). A variety of nuts, seeds and their oils should also be eaten because they are rich sources of vitamin E. Exercisers tend to consume more oxygen than sedentary people and they may produce more free radicals. Research by sports scientists indicates that consuming extra vitamins C and E may protect muscle fibres from free radical damage.<br class=""nLine"" />Some antioxidants, such as synthetic vitamin E (alpha tocopherol), are added to fatty foods (for example, margarine made from sunflower oil) to stop the food from going rancid. See also <a href=""entry://free radicals""><span class=""links"">free radicals</span></a>."
"antiperspirant","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>antiperspirant</b><div class=""content"">In hot, humid conditions, exercisers usually drip with sweat as their bodies attempt to dissipate the heat generated by intense activity. Many exercisers, self-conscious of the puddles forming around them, use antiperspirants to reduce the sweating. The active ingredients in most antiperspirants are metal salts, usually those of aluminium. The metals are thought to reduce sweating by seeping into the pores of apocrine glands (sweat glands responsible for body odour) where they combine with proteins and plug the exit from the gland. Deodorants are often added to the metals to mask sweaty smells.<br class=""nLine"" />Antiperspirants are mostly innocuous, but some varieties can cause hypersensitive people to develop uncomfortable side-effects. In the USA, antiperspirants are classified as medicines and tested for safety. Common side-effects, such as rashes and skin irritation, are usually minor and easily treated. However, you should not use antiperspirants on broken skin because of the danger of blood poisoning. Contrary to popular belief, most antiperspirants do not seem to affect temperature regulation."
"anxiety","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>anxiety</b><div class=""content"">Anxiety produces feelings of apprehension and tension. Two components have been recognized: cognitive anxiety, characterized by distressing thought processes, and somatic anxiety expressed in physical reactions, such as butterflies and sweating. Anxiety may be an enduring personality trait (known as A-trait) or a temporary state (known as A-state). The term is often used synonymously with arousal, but anxiety corresponds only to high arousal states that produce feelings of discomfort. It is also closely associated with the concept of fear, but anxiety is more a feeling of what might happen rather than a response to an immediate fear-provoking situation.<br class=""nLine"" />Regular aerobic exercise may reduce general anxiety levels. Habitual exercisers often state that they feel better as a result of engaging in vigorous activity. This may be because exercise stimulates the brain to secrete endorphins, natural chemicals which have characteristics similar to morphine. Relaxation exercises may also reduce anxiety (see <a href=""entry://relaxation""><span class=""links"">relaxation</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />High levels of anxiety can adversely affect sporting performance. This can cause an athlete to enter an anxiety-stress spiral: the poor performance induced by anxiety results in even more anxiety and another poor performance. Anxious performers usually find it more difficult to focus attention, consequently they waste time and energy doing irrelevant tasks.

"appendix","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>appendix</b><div class=""content"">The appendix is a worm-shaped extension of the large intestine. It forms the blind end of the caecum, a pouch at the junction between the small and large intestine.<br class=""nLine"" />The appendix is believed to have had an important function in mammalian ancestors of humans, harbouring beneficial bacteria that enabled their hosts to break down the cellulose of plants. The human appendix has lost this function and has diminished in size during its evolution. It is therefore regarded as a vestigial, non-essential organ. One in 100 000 people has no appendix and its absence appears to do no harm.<br class=""nLine"" />Despite its lack of function, the appendix is relatively easily infected with bacteria. The infection may cause appendicitis, an acute inflammation causing persistent pain in the lower right abdomen, made worse by pressure, coughing, sneezing, or even slight movements. Nausea is another common symptom. Appendicitis is the commonest reason for emergency abdominal surgery. In Britain, more than 80 000 people who experience these symptoms have their appendix removed surgically. Appendicitis develops suddenly and is potentially very dangerous because the appendix may burst, spreading the infection into the surrounding membranes and causing peritonitis which can be fatal if not treated. Unfortunately, diagnosis is difficult and many of the appendices removed (up to 30 per cent in a recent Swedish study) are found to be healthy. Diagnosis becomes easier as the inflammation develops, but delay in removal increases the danger of an appendix bursting.<br class=""nLine"" />Fit people who have undergone surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis can usually return to training within a few weeks of the operation, but should not indulge in very vigorous exercise until a few weeks after that."

"appetite","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>appetite</b><div class=""content"">Appetite is a psychological desire to eat and is often related to specific foods. Unlike hunger, it is probably a learned response associated with pleasant tasting and satisfying food. It is an agreeable sensation that aids digestion by stimulating the secretion of saliva and other digestive juices. It also stimulates the desire to eat sufficient food to maintain the body and supply it with enough energy and nutrients to carry out its functions. However, as with other body functions, disorders of appetite occur. Excessive appetite may result in obesity, while diminished appetite is a sign common to many illnesses and may be a manifestation of stress. There is no simple relationship between exercise and appetite, but most experts believe that appetite is likely to increase with exercise only if an individual is normally fairly active and then raises his or her activity even higher. When a sedentary person exercises, appetite may not increase, on the contrary, it may be suppressed (see also <a href=""entry://anorexia nervosa""><span class=""links"">anorexia nervosa</span></a>)."
"appetite suppressant","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>appetite suppressant</b><div class=""content"">A wide range of over-the-counter substances are marketed as appetite suppressants. Some contain ingredients, such as bran, gums, pectin, and plant fibre, that act indirectly by swelling the stomach and making the consumer feel full. Even that arch enemy of the dieter, sugar, is supposed to reduce appetite if taken immediately before a meal (so those mothers who said that eating sweets ruins your appetite were right after all!). Although some gums reduce appetite when taken in abnormally high concentrations, tablets containing small quantities are unlikely to have significant appetite-suppressant effects. High intakes of gums are potentially dangerous. In 1989, appetite suppressants containing more than 15 per cent guar gum or locust bean gum were banned in Britain after a number of deaths were linked to their use.<br class=""nLine"" />Prescribed appetite suppressants, on the other hand, are effective. They include fenfluramine (a derivative of amphetamines) and related drugs which act directly on the parts of the brain that control appetite. A review of recent studies showed that over a three-month period, slimmers who took prescribed appetite suppressants lost an average of 1.4 kg (3 lb) more than a control group who took placebos (dummy pills). Although the effect of most appetite suppressants wears off after a few months, they may be useful as a short-term measure to encourage dieters. Most doctors prescribe appetite suppressants only to those who really need them (such as the clinically obese), but their effects are also exploited by some members of the slimming industry. An investigation by reporters from the BBC revealed that several slimming clinics prescribed amphetamine derivatives to people who wanted to lose weight, even though there was no medically justifiable reason; the people were not obese nor did they have any other urgent need to lose weight for health reasons. This is a dangerous practice. Slimming drugs are potentially addictive and can have harmful side-effects such as headaches and nausea. Administration and withdrawal can be followed by severe bouts of depression and hallucinations.<br class=""nLine"" />Some tablets marketed as appetite suppressants are no more than sugar coated pills. They do no great harm (except to a person's bank balance) but neither do they help to reduce weight. In the UK, new regulations have been introduced to control the use of appetite suppressants and to reduce their misuse.

<b>aquarobics</b><div class=""content"">Aquarobics are aerobic exercises performed in water. They have benefits similar to aerobics, but they also have additional advantages. Vigorous body movements create water turbulence which massages the superficial muscles. More importantly, the buoyant effect of water reduces the risk of joint injuries. This makes it a particularly attractive exercise for people who are overweight, or have orthopaedic or back problems. Because body weight is supported, aquarobics does not stimulate bone growth, so it does not protect against the development of osteoporosis. However, it is much better than land-based aerobics for anyone who is already suffering from brittle bones or a bad back. Many land-based athletes train in water when recovering from injuries that would be aggravated by high impact exercises. Recent research has shown that running in water (aqua running) preserves endurance and leg strength, and maintains fitness.<br class=""nLine"" />When exercising in water, the heart rate is lower than when exercising at a similar intensity on land. This may be due to water compressing the body and making the blood flow more easily. Whatever the reasons, it seems that the stress on the heart is less in water than on land. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that the average person uses 450 to 700 Calories during an hour of aquarobics, with 77 per cent of the calories coming from fat stores. This helps to reduce fat body mass, while movements performed against the resistance of the water stimulate muscle growth and increase lean body mass.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1981, the benefits of aquarobics were recognized in the United States by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, who recommended an exercise programme for small bodies of water. The programme included standing water drills (e.g. toe touching, side-straddle hopping, and jogging on the spot), pool-side standing drills (e.g. stretching the arms out and pressing the back against the wall), gutter-holding drills (e.g. knee hugs and a variety of flutter kicking), bobbing, and treading water.<br class=""nLine"" />Aquarobics is quickly gaining in popularity and manufacturers are responding with a whole range of exercise aids that include aquarobics footwear, buoyancy cuffs and vests, water belts which offer resistance, and peculiar devices called ‘woggles’. These are six-foot long, very flexible, sausage-shaped pieces of foam that provide a buoyant weight to push against, and to act as a support when performing muscle-strengthening exercises.

"arches","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>arches</b><div class=""content"">The arches are curved structures, arch-like in profile, which span the foot. There are three arches to each foot: two longitudinal (the medial arch and lateral arch) and one short, anterior, transverse arch. Together, they form a half-dome structure which is essential for efficient load-bearing and locomotion. During standing and walking, the arches distribute half the body weight onto the heel bone, and half onto the tarsal bones in the toes. The shape of the arches is maintained by the combined action of bones, muscles, and ligaments in the foot. Weakening of these structures may lead to biomechanical problems, adversely affecting walking and running. See <a href=""entry://fallen arches""><span class=""links"">fallen arches</span></a>."

"aromatherapy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>aromatherapy</b><div class=""content"">The combined use of pure plant extracts or so-called essential oils and various massage techniques. It is promoted as a method of natural healing. According to practitioners, substances released from the oils have a therapeutic value when inhaled or when they penetrate the skin. It is also claimed that certain oils aid slimming by stimulating circulation of the lymph and blood so that surplus body fluids are removed. Some practitioners think that aromatherapy helps to reduce cellulite in the belief that the main cause of cellulite is a sluggish circulation and high fluid retention. Most dietitians dispute these claims.<br class=""nLine"" />A bottle of aromatherapy oil containing extracts of fennel (<i>Foeniculum vulgare</i>) in spring water is included as part of the ‘Revolutionary Three in One Diet’, a high protein, high fat, and low carbohydrate diet. The oils are said to act as diuretics, eliminating excess body water. Although there is no rigorous scientific evidence to support this claim, any weight loss associated with fennel would be regained quickly when the dieter started drinking and eating normally again. If fennel does have its claimed effects, there is a risk of dehydration."
"arousal","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>arousal</b><div class=""content"">The state of being prepared for action. The intensity of arousal ranges from deep sleep to extreme excitement. Heightening of arousal is brought about by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and an increase in secretion of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. As the body becomes prepared for action, the electrical activity of the brain changes; sweating becomes more profuse; muscle tension, heart rate, and metabolic rate all increase; and some blood is diverted from the gut to the skeletal muscle. Exercise psychologists have established that there is an optimal state of arousal above and below which a person underperforms (see <a href=""entry://catastrophe theory""><span class=""links"">catastrophe theory</span></a>). Excessive levels of arousal can be very uncomfortable and are better referred to as anxiety."

A fibre optic lens system allows the surgeon to look around corners and into small crevices for any signs of injury."
"artificial colours","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>artificial colours</b><div class=""content"">A substance added to food to make it appear more appetizing and to restore colours lost during processing. Many added food colours come from natural substances, such as caramel (burnt sugar, E150) and annatto (E160b, a yellowish-red dye from the pulpy seeds of a small South American tree). Some of the most controversial ones are artificial, such as the azo food dyes, which were originally made from coal tar. Some artificial colours have been banned because they are suspected carcinogens or because they cause allergic reactions. In the UK, there are 52 permitted colourings, but baby foods are allowed to contain only three and these are also vitamin sources.

One ‘fat-free fat’ called Olestra is made from a type of sucrose polyester that is indigestible and has no calories. Olestra is intended for use in the manufacture of ‘fat-free’ potato crisps. It is not yet on the market, but is going through the approval process by the Food and Drug Administration in the USA and the Department of Health in the UK. Another artificial fat, Simplesse, is already on the market in extremely low-fat spreads (it has only 5 per cent fat compared with 80 per cent fat in most margarines). It is made from egg white and milk protein. If they pass all the safety tests, many nutritionists would favour the use of these artificial fats if they help to reduce fat intake."

"artificial sweeteners","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>artificial sweeteners</b><div class=""content"">Substances which increase the sweetness of food. There are two main groups: bulk sweeteners and intense sweeteners.<br class=""nLine"" />Bulk sweeteners, such as hydrogenated glucose syrup and sorbitol, are used as flavour-enhancers in many processed foods; they have about the same calorific value as natural sugars. Sorbitol is frequently used as a sugar substitute in confectionery. It is used especially in confectionery for diabetics because it is slowly absorbed and therefore puts less strain on the pancreas than glucose and sucrose. It should be used with care, however, because it has a laxative side-effect with which some people find difficult to cope. European Community directives recommend bulk sweeteners should not be used in food intended for children under three years of age.<br class=""nLine"" />Intense sweeteners, such as aspartame and saccharin, have no calories so they are often used as part of weight reducing diets. They produce their sweet taste by triggering specific receptors on the tongue. Some people believe that intense sweeteners disturb blood glucose control, stimulate the appetite, and increase the likelihood of suffering hunger pangs when on a weight-loss diet; there is little scientific evidence for this belief.<br class=""nLine"" />New, chemically engineered products much sweeter than current products are being developed and awaiting full approval. Among these super sweeteners are sucralose, 600 times sweeter than sugar, and alitame which is 2000 times sweeter.

"aspartame","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>aspartame</b><div class=""content"">An artificial sweetener 200 times sweeter than sugar. It contains virtually no calories and, unlike some other sweeteners, has no bitter after-taste. It is made of two amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is the most widely used intense sweetener, but it cannot be used in cooking. It quickly loses its sweetness in hot water but is stable for 2&ndash;3 months in cold soft drinks. The Food and Drug Administration in the USA says it is safe for a healthy 150-pound adult to consume up to 3.5 grams of aspartame per day. In the UK, the acceptable daily intake is 40 mg per kg body weight (i.e. 2.8 g for a 70 kg adult). There is some doubt about the safety of consuming larger amounts of aspartame. Some people who habitually use the sweetener have reported migraines and headaches, and a few have suffered swelling of the larynx. In addition, it is believed that aspartame may have a toxic effect on the foetal brain. Therefore some people think its use should be avoided by pregnant and lactating women, and young children. People suffering from phenylketonuria (an inborn defect of protein metabolism) are sensitive to phenylalanine, and are generally advised to avoid aspartame."
"aspartates","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

"aspirin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>aspirin</b>
<i>(acetylsalicylic acid)</i><div class=""content"">A white crystalline powder which has anti-inflammatory (inflammation-reducing), antipyretic (fever-reducing), and analgesic (pain-relieving) properties. It is widely used to treat headaches. Aspirin is one of the few effective analgesics not on the International Olympic Committee list of banned substances. Consequently, it is frequently prescribed to athletes and is particularly effective in the treatment of some injuries and diseases (especially arthritis) involving the muscles and joints. Aspirin also tends to increase clotting time, reducing the risk of thromboses and some other cardiovascular problems. A US physicians' study indicated that daily consumption of half an aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. Recent research indicates that aspirin may also offer some protection against Alzheimer's disease. Because of these many beneficial properties, some people, including Ron Hill, the famous British marathon runner, hail aspirin as a wonder drug and take half or a whole tablet on a daily basis as a precautionary measure. However, such routine consumption is not without its risks. One consequence of the longer clotting time is that aspirin also increases the tendency of people to bleed, making it particularly harmful to sufferers of stomach ulcers. This effect is exacerbated by the fact that aspirin irritates the mucous membrane lining the stomach. Aspirin taken with a meal also decreases the absorption of iron, vitamin C, and folic acid (one of the B vitamins). Therefore, a person taking aspirin may suffer a deficiency unless there is a compensatory increase in the intake of these nutrients.<br class=""nLine"" />Some unfortunate individuals are allergic to aspirin and cannot take advantage of any of its beneficial properties. If they take even one dose of the drug they are liable to go into an anaphylactic shock similar to a severe asthmatic attack. Aspirin is not recommended for children because it has caused liver and brain damage, albeit rarely, in those with viral infections (e.g. influenza and chickenpox). High doses of aspirin can be poisonous and extremely dangerous, even for individuals who are not particularly sensitive."
"asthma","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>asthma</b><div class=""content"">A respiratory disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of difficulty in breathing (described in medical books as ‘episodic wheezing’), particularly on exhalation. It is caused by an increased resistance to air flow through the respiratory bronchioles (small air tubes leading to the lungs). Sufferers are hypersensitive to a variety of stimuli (e.g. house dust mites; diesel exhaust particulates; and vehicle exhaust gases, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides) which cause the airways to narrow. Asthma may be induced by exercise (see <a href=""entry://exercise-induced asthma""><span class=""links"">exercise induced asthma</span></a>) and food allergies. Sports vary in their tendency to induce asthma, with running having a high tendency, cycling a moderate tendency, and gymnastics and swimming a low tendency. Paradoxically, many asthmatics gain relief from bronchospasms by regular exercise, and exercise is now seen as important in the management of asthma. Asthmatic attacks are relieved by a number of drugs, but competitive sports people should be aware that some of these are banned by sports federations because, as well as controlling asthma, they may act as artificial stimulants."
"atherosclerosis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>atherosclerosis</b><div class=""content"">Atherosclerosis is the accumulation of fatty materials within arterial walls. This results in a narrowing of the arteries and reduction of blood flow which can encourage the formation of a blood clot and lead to a heart attack or stroke. The risk of atherosclerosis has traditionally been linked to behavioural and dietary causes, such as eating too much fat (especially saturated fat), not taking enough exercise, and smoking. Free radicals (highly reactive chemicals) are thought to be a major factor in the development of atherosclerosis, consequently antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E) may offer some protection. There seems to be no doubt that too much cholesterol in the blood can line the arteries with plaque, causing atherosclerosis, but several genes have been identified recently that affect the transport and deposition of cholesterol in the body. One of the genes is carried by 24 per cent of the population and may increase their susceptibility independent of the traditional factors. Nevertheless, even those with a genetic predisposition to the disease, can reduce the risk by taking regular, vigorous aerobic exercise and by eating a balanced diet, rich in antioxidants and relatively low in fat."
"athlete","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>athlete</b><div class=""content"">An athlete is an individual who, by virtue of special training or natural talent, is fit to compete in a physically demanding sport. The term is derived from the Latin word ‘athleta’, referring to a person who competed in physical exercises for a prize.<br class=""nLine"" />An athlete thought to have a lot of natural talent is often called a ‘born athlete’. Such an athlete usually exhibits great proficiency in a range of physical activities, apparently after little practice. Most great athletes are genetically endowed with high athletic potential, but this potential is rarely realized without many years of hard and dedicated training. Great athletes, therefore, are generally made, not born."

<b>athlete's heart</b><div class=""content"">Athletes often have an enlarged heart. When this is a natural, physiological adaptation to regular, endurance exercises, the condition is called athlete's heart. Those with athlete's heart often have a slow heart rate (considerably less than 60 beats per minute). There is no evidence that the condition is detrimental to health. However, when a person's exercise history is not known, athlete's heart is sometimes confused with abnormal, pathological changes associated with some heart diseases. In abnormal enlargements, the changes are not reversible and are accompanied by development of scarlike fibrous tissue (fibrosis) in the heart; athlete's heart is reversible and is not accompanied by fibrosis."

"Atkins diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Atkins diet</b><div class=""content"">The Atkins diet (also called ‘Dr Atkins Super Energy Diet’) is a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate, weight-reduction diet devised by an American doctor, Robert C. Atkins. The diet appears to contravene most of the generally accepted dietary guidelines for health since it relies on saturated fats as the main energy source.<br class=""nLine"" />Atkins recommended that a dieter should eat virtually no carbohydrate in the first week: no carbohydrate-rich alcoholic drinks, bread, fruit, potatoes, pasta, pastries, or sugar. An attractive feature of the diet is that it permits an unlimited intake of fat and protein foods (e.g. meats, poultry, fish, and cheese). After the first week, carbohydrate consumption increases a little, but is still kept at a low level. The low intake of fruit and vegetables could result in vitamin deficiency, except that Atkins prescribed very large vitamin supplements for his dieters.<br class=""nLine"" />Atkins claimed that the low level of carbohydrates forces the body to use body fat as a fuel. He suggested that it also stimulates the secretion of a fat mobilizing hormone that encourages the breakdown of fat. (There is no independent scientific evidence to support the existence of this hormone.) Calories are not counted. Instead, the dieter tests the urine with special paper strips which turn mauve-purple in the presence of ketones. Ketones are breakdown products of fat and indicate that it is being burnt off. Despite Atkins' claims to the contrary, they are not a good measure of the effectiveness of a weight-reducing diet.<br class=""nLine"" />The diet is unquestionably effective in reducing weight, up to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) in one week. High levels of ketones in the blood suppress the appetite, however it can be very harmful. The ketones create a diabetes-like environment in the body, potentially damaging to the kidneys and allowing blood sugar levels to fall dangerously low.<br class=""nLine"" />The Atkins diet is not generally recommended by medical practitioners or dietitians and its introduction provoked strong opposition from the American Medical Association."

"backache","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>backache</b><div class=""content"">Backache is second only to the common cold as a reason for absence from work in the United Kingdom and Europe. Eighty per cent of all Americans will see a physician about backache during their lifetime, and an estimated 75 million Americans have recurring back problems, causing 93 million days of lost work per year and costing an estimated $10 million worth of sickness benefits. Backache has a number of causes. The ache may be associated with an injury, such as a fracture of the spine, prolapsed inter-vertebral discs, spondylosis or, more commonly, muscle and ligament strains. Most back injuries are the result of poor posture, lack of fitness (including poor flexibility, and lack of strength and muscular endurance), or inappropriate loadcarrying techniques, but it is usually due to mechanical stress. As the following table shows, poor posture (particularly while sitting) and poor lifting technique may impose on the back unbearable loads that injure muscles and ligaments: <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""<tr><td>BODY POSITION</td><td>APPROXIMATE PRESSURE ON THE BACK (MM HG)</td></tr><tr><td>lying down on back</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>lying down on side</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>standing upright</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>seated, with back upright</td><td>140</td></tr><tr><td>standing, leaning forwards on hips</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>seated, slumped forward</td><td>185</td></tr></table></center> Excess weight, particularly in the abdomen, can contribute to back problems by exaggerating the mechanical stresses.<br class=""nLine"" />The majority of backaches occur in the lower back because this is the region that supports most of the weight and is also subject to the greatest strains from activities such as jumping, bending, and twisting. More than 25 per cent of professional golfers suffer from lower back pain caused by the twisting movements of the golf swing. Psychological stress may also cause backache. Highly stressed individuals often tense their back muscles, shortening and tightening them. This can trigger muscular spasms resulting in back pain. In a few cases, a pain felt in the back may be due to diseases in deep-seated organs although the back itself is undamaged; this type of pain is called referred pain.<br class=""nLine"" />Most acute backaches could be prevented by performing regular exercises to strengthen and stretch the back and abdominal muscles. It is also important to develop good posture and train the back muscles to move properly and to place the least strain on the back (figure 8). People suffering from, or predisposed to, back problems should avoid exercises that put a strain on the back. It is no good starting a programme of back strengthening and stretching exercises when suffering backache. Sports such as golf and tennis which involve twisting movements, can exacerbate backpain. Running and aerobic dance may also jar the back, but the stress can be minimized by wearing the correct shoes. Swimming is the most highly recommended activity for people with back problems.<center class=""centre""><img src=""000057.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 8 Your back and how to care for it</center>"
"badminton","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>badminton</b><div class=""content"">Badminton is one of the most popular sports in the UK. It can be played at all levels and by all age groups. Great natural ability is not needed to play the game at a recreational level but good skill, agility, and fast reflexes are required to play it at a highly competitive level. An elite player has to be strong, mobile, and flexible to cover the court at speed. Badminton helps to develop all-round fitness: it strengthens legs, arms, and wrists, and improves the flexibility of the trunk, back, and shoulders. Rallies usually consist of short bursts of anaerobic activity but played at a high level, a game can go on for a long time and helps to develop aerobic fitness. If you suffer from a back problem, however, it may not be wise to play badminton because the game involves quick twisting and bending movements. Recreational badminton players who play infrequently are particularly vulnerable to injury unless they incorporate general fitness training into their schedule and warm up properly before playing a game."
"balance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>balance</b>
<br class=""nLine"" /><b>1</b> The ability to maintain a stable position while either stationary (static balance) or moving (dynamic balance). Balance is achieved by the action of reflexes involving the eyes, the balance organs in the semi-circular canals of the ears, pressure receptors in the skin (particularly on the soles of the feet), and stretch receptors in muscles and joints. Good balance is needed for many sports, especially those requiring sudden changes in movement, such as gymnastics and tennis.

"balanced diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>balanced diet</b><div class=""content"">A balanced diet contains sufficient amounts of fibre and the various nutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals) to ensure good health. Food should also provide the appropriate amount of energy and adequate amounts of water. The diet should not contain items that are harmful. In other words, a balanced diet should be both adequate and wholesome. This definition is easy to give, but it is much more difficult to state precisely what constitutes a balanced diet for any particular individual. Government departments, using advice gained from expert committees, provide dietary guidelines that are designed to help us achieve a balanced diet (see <a href=""entry://Dietary Reference Values""><span class=""links"">Dietary Reference Values</span></a>; and <a href=""entry://Recommended Dietary Allowance""><span class=""links"">Recommended Dietary Allowance</span></a>)."

"ballistic stretching","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>ballistic stretching</b><div class=""content"">Ballistic stretching involves quick, bouncing movements that often take a joint beyond its normal range. Such stretching has been popularized in the workouts of some famous people, but it is potentially harmful because the bouncing movements can result in a protective reflex which causes antagonistic muscles to be torn as they attempt to contract against the direction of the stretch (stretch reflex). Most qualified exercise teachers and coaches advocate static stretching which is a much safer and more effective way of improving flexibility."

"bare foot exercise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>bare foot exercise</b><div class=""content"">Many people enjoy the freedom of exercising without any foot protection, particularly indoors during keep fit classes. Some famous runners, such as Bruce Tulloh and Zola Pieterse (née Budd), ran barefooted outdoors. However, bare foot exercise can considerably increase the risk of injury to those who are not used to it. The majority of exercisers spend most of their waking hours wearing some kind of supportive footwear. Subjecting feet to occasional bursts of activity without any protection can stress them beyond their tolerance limits. It has been estimated that each foot hits the ground more than 1000 times in a 10 minute intensive aerobics workout.<br class=""nLine"" />Although some floors are sprung and wooden, many do not offer sufficient cushioning for bare foot exercise. It is important to choose the right footwear; dance and aerobic fitness shoes are specially designed to cushion the foot after vertical jumps while running shoes are designed for shock absorption and motion control as the foot strikes and rolls off the ground.

"basal metabolic rate","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>basal metabolic rate</b> (BMR)<div class=""content"">The basal metabolic rate is the minimum rate at which the body uses energy at complete rest. It is the minimum amount of energy needed to keep the body alive and is the largest component of an average person's daily energy expenditure. The BMR is usually expressed simply as kilocalories per day or in units of energy per unit surface area (or per kilogram body mass) per unit time. It is very difficult to determine the absolute minimum metabolic rate, but estimates are usually standardized by being made when a person is resting quietly after at least 8 hours sleep and 12 hours since the last meal. BMR for the average, healthy adult is usually between 1200 and 1800 kilocalories per day. It may, however, be less than 700 kilocalories in some individuals. BMR usually remains relatively constant for each individual, but it varies widely from one person to another. Factors which affect BMR include:<blockquote>•&nbsp;AGE: BMR tends to decrease as we get older because of increased percentage body fat; children have a higher BMR because of the energy cost of growth<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;SIZE: BMR tends to be greater in tall, thin people<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;BODY COMPOSITION: Those with a high percentage lean body mass (low percentage fat) tend to have high BMRs because muscle is metabolically more active than fat<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;BREAST-FEEDING: BMR is higher in nursing mothers than other women, because of the energy cost of synthesizing milk<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;DIETING: BMR decreases during a weight-loss diet, fasting, or starvation<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;EXERCISE: BMR increases with regular, very strenuous exercise, but is probably little affected by moderate levels of activity<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;MALNUTRITION: BMR decreases during malnutrition<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;PREGNANCY: BMR increases during pregnancy<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;SEX: BMR is higher in males than females even at the same body weight because of their relatively large bulk of muscle<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;STRESS: BMR increases during periods of emotional stress<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;THYROID ACTIVITY: BMR is regulated by a hormone, thyroxine, secreted by the thyroid gland. It increases if the thyroid is overactive and decreases if the thyroid is underactive<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;WEATHER: BMR increases during both very cold and hot weather.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> People trying to lose weight often want to increase their BMR as an easy way of burning excess fat. Many manufacturers entice dieters to buy slimming products that claim to increase BMR (see <a href=""entry://kelp""><span class=""links"">kelp</span></a>); most of these claims are not supported by rigorous scientific evidence. Drugs that can increase basal metabolic rate should be taken only under medical supervision."
"base training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>base training</b><div class=""content"">All training programmes should start with base training. This consists of high-volume, low-intensity training to improve overall physical condition in preparation for more specific, intensive training. In many sports, base training includes long-slow-distance (LSD) running which improves the cardiovascular system and aerobic capacity. The training is purposely slow to reduce the risk of injury, but the speed and distance are increased gradually as fitness improves. Many coaches recommend between 6 months and 1 year base training for those unused to exercise before they start intensive, anaerobic training."
"baseball and softball","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>baseball and softball</b><div class=""content"">Baseball is a physically demanding sport comprised of several specialisms requiring different skills and types of fitness. Running between bases requires good anaerobic fitness, speed, agility, and the strength to stop suddenly after sprinting. Feet-first slides make the ankle, knee, and thigh susceptible to injury; head-first slides may injure the hand, wrist and fingers. Hitting a baseball is one of the most difficult things to do in sport. It requires excellent eye-to-hand coordination, instantaneous reflexes, and the coordinated movements of the hips, shoulders, arms, and wrists. These movements put a lot of strain on the neck, shoulders, and upper back. Batters therefore require good upper body strength and flexibility. Fielding requires good all-round fitness: fielders have to be able to run quickly and catch a ball (usually with the non-dominant gloved hand) and then throw it accurately. All baseball players have to throw the ball at one time or another, but it is the major function of pitchers. By coordinating the movements of all the muscles of the upper body, a pitcher can release the ball at speeds in excess of 160 km per hour. This imposes tremendous forces on the throwing arm, shoulders, upper chest and abdominal region. Consequently, pitchers must be very well conditioned to avoid injury and must be skilled at minimizing the forces on any one part of the body. Pitchers are often required to throw the ball repeatedly, making them susceptible to overuse injuries (see <a href=""entry://thrower's elbow""><span class=""links"">thrower's elbow</span></a>). This is especially true for young pitchers whose tissues are still growing. Sports medicine experts recommend that a growing child who plays baseball should not perform overhand pitching more than 50 times daily or 350 times per week.<br class=""nLine"" />Softball can be played in a smaller area than baseball, but it is a faster game. It can be played indoors as well as outdoors. The name is a little inappropriate because it is played with a ball which is actually larger and harder than that used in baseball. In the 1950s softball became one of the biggest participation sports in the United States and it is now played in many different countries. One of its attractions is that it can be played by mixed teams of men and women. There are two versions of the game: slow pitch in which the ball is delivered in an arc from pitcher to batter and not unreasonably fast, and fast pitch in which the delivery is as fast as the pitcher likes. All pitches are underarm and the pitch distance is shorter than in baseball. Although the slow pitch game is played at a relatively leisurely pace, the fast pitch is action-packed and faster than baseball. The skills and physical demands of softball are similar to those of baseball, and the injuries associated with the game are also similar. It was once thought that the underhand throw of fast-pitch softball caused less injury than the overhand throw of baseball, but injury statistics are similar for both. Throwing injuries can be minimized by learning sound technique; strengthening the upper body, especially the anterior shoulder, the biceps, and flexor muscles of the throwing arm; and by beginning and ending all activity with appropriate warm-up and cool-down exercises."

Other common injuries are jumper's knee and bruises on the upper thighs. There is also considerable strain on the chest muscles caused by the overhead arm-stretch movements characteristic of the game. A thorough warm up and good physical condition will reduce the risk of injury. Games tend to be fiercely competitive and basketball requires considerable aggression.

"behaviour therapy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>behaviour therapy</b><div class=""content"">Behaviour therapy uses psychological techniques to overcome problem behaviours. It is used to change the habits of those with eating disorders, whether they are overeating or undereating. Therapists usually achieve this by establishing new attitudes and by focusing, not on the food, but on a person's behaviour around the food. The therapy uses a wide range of psychological techniques including stimulus control where, for example, a person susceptible to impulse buying, learns to shop only after eating, or shopping only from a prescribed list. Appropriate rewards, such as praise from friends or treats, are used in the therapy to reinforce good behaviour. Subjects learn to control eating behaviour so that they can eat the correct amount of food. Those who should be eating less can learn to put down their knife and fork between mouthfuls of food and to chew food fully.<br class=""nLine"" />Setting appropriate goals is an important part of behaviour therapy. Subjects are discouraged from using words such as ‘always’ or ‘never’, and encouraged to set themselves achievable tasks. Physical activity could be increased, even by changing a simple routine, such as by walking to the corner shop rather than taking a car. Continuous feedback forms an essential part of most behaviour therapy. Eating and exercise habits are monitored by using a food and exercise diary. This enables problems to be identified and good behaviour to be rewarded. Behaviour therapy can be very effective, but it may take a long time to overcome problems. Those with serious eating disorders should seek professional help from a clinical psychologist.<br class=""nLine"" />Behaviour therapy is also used by athletes who suffer from excessive anxiety before competition. Some competitions, such as the Olympic Games, which are seen by millions of people may invoke a feeling of fear in even the most seasoned athlete. Behaviour therapy uses relaxation techniques and other procedures which enable the athlete to approach such a competition with optimal levels of physiological arousal and minimum anxiety."

For example, in the first week the dieter is allowed to eat only specified fruits, such as pineapples, which are claimed to have fat-burning properties. Most nutritionists and doctors dismiss claims made in the diet as having little scientific basis. Weight loss may occur as a result of water losses associated with the laxative effect of eating large amounts of fruit. It may also occur because the reliance on one type of food produces effects similar to fasting. There is no scientific evidence, however, that weight loss occurs because enzymes from the fruit burn excess body fat. The laxative effects of eating large amounts of fruit are so great that the diet became commonly known as the ‘diarrhoea diet’. Needless to say, the diet is not generally recommended by dietitians."

"biofeedback training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>biofeedback training</b>
<i>(autoconditioning)</i><div class=""content"">A technique that can help you to relax. It depends on the subject receiving a continuous and immediate flow of information about one or more physiological functions which indicate stress levels. The most commonly used function is heart rate which usually increases during stress. Reasonably priced, portable heart rate monitors are now widely available. They usually consist of a strap that goes around the chest and a watch-like wrist attachment which displays the heart rate. Biofeedback training teaches you to make a conscious effort to reduce your heart rate (or other physiological functions) as soon as any increase associated with stress occurs. The training enables you to identify when you are under stress. You can then learn to control its physiological effects so that you can become more relaxed."
"biomechanics","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>biomechanics</b><div class=""content"">The application of physics and mechanics to the study of movement. In sport, biomechanics is especially concerned with how the human body applies forces to itself and objects with which it comes into contact, and how the human body is affected by external forces. A sound knowledge of biomechanics equips a coach, athlete, or other performer to choose appropriate training techniques, and to detect and understand faults that may arise in their use."
"biorhythm","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>biorhythm</b><div class=""content"">Cycles of human activity. It is claimed that each person has negative and positive periods within a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle, and a 33-day intellectual cycle. The physical cycle is said to control a person's energy, strength, aggressiveness, and some other aspects of physical fitness; the emotional cycle influences sensitivity and moods; and the intellectual cycle is supposed to affect mental abilities.<br class=""nLine"" />Some competitive athletes compute their biorhythms on specially designed charts to predict when they are most likely to achieve a peak performance and when there is the greatest risk of failure. The correlation between an individual's biorhythm and athletic performance varies greatly. A detailed examination of the biorhythm charts of hundreds of athletes with world or national records showed that the records occurred randomly and were not influenced by biorhythms.

"biotin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>biotin</b><div class=""content"">A vitamin of the B complex, also known as vitamin H. Biotin is found in small amounts in body tissues, combined with protein. It plays an important role in many reactions, including the release of energy from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Biotin also helps to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations from protein when carbohydrate sources have been exhausted. There is some evidence that biotin is needed for normal vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> activity. Deficiency results in a scaly skin, muscular pain, pallor, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue and elevated cholesterol levels. Deficiency is extremely rare in adults but it can be induced by consuming too much raw egg white. The egg white contains avidin, a chemical which binds to biotin, preventing it from being absorbed. Avidin is destroyed by heat. Some biotin is synthesized in the gut by bacteria. Dietary sources include yeast extracts, liver, egg yolk, and legumes. Although there are no official recommended dietary intakes, it has been calculated that 10&ndash;200 micrograms is a safe and adequate range of intake."
"black nail","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>black nail</b>
<i>(runner's toe, soccer toe)</i><div class=""content"">Blackening of the toe-nail near its base is quite a common injury among runners and other athletes. It can be very painful and is often accompanied by joint swelling. Black nail is often caused by wearing shoes that are too short or too wide. The foot slides forwards, especially on dry, artificial turf, and jams against the end of the shoe. It may also develop from a direct blow to the toe. The damaged nail, blackened by bruising, dies. The underlying nail grows and displaces the black nail which eventually drops off. Nail injuries can be prevented by wearing well-fitting shoes but if such injuries occur, the pain can be relieved by inserting a heated, sterilized needle through the nail. This creates a hole which releases the blood and reduces the pressure. The procedure should be performed by a medically qualified person!"

"blister","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>blister</b><div class=""content"">An injury in which the top layer of skin is detached from the underlying layer; the gap between the two layers becomes filled with a watery fluid from damaged cells. A blister is usually painful because the thick outer epidermis of the skin is lifted away to expose nerve-endings. Blisters are usually caused by friction. Training vigorously in brand new shoes is a common cause among exercisers. The time-honoured practice of applying surgical spirit to harden the feet may reduce the occurrence of blisters. Wearing two pairs of socks may prevent blisters by allowing friction to occur between the socks rather than between the socks and skin. However, if large uncomfortable blisters occur despite precautionary measures, they can be treated by releasing the fluid with a sterilized needle, snipping away dead skin, and then applying a sterile dressing. Small blisters should be left unbroken as long as possible to reduce the risk of infection."

White blood cells and some components of blood plasma play an essential role in the body's defence against disease.<br class=""nLine"" />Regular aerobic exercise can significantly change the composition of blood. Exercisers tend to have a higher blood volume, more haemoglobin, more anti-clotting agents, and lower blood cholesterol levels than inactive people."
"blood doping","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>blood doping</b><div class=""content"">A technique that athletes use to boost their stamina by injecting themselves with extra blood. Blood doping has been used to improve the performance of crosscountry skiers, marathoners, and triathletes. Blood doping is carried out in the belief that it increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the circulatory system and thereby improves endurance. The blood may be obtained from the same individual (autotransfusion) or from another individual.<br class=""nLine"" />In autotransfusion, about a litre of blood is extracted usually some time before a competition so that the body has time to replace the lost blood. The blood is frozen for storage to reduce damage to red blood cells. After thawing, the stored blood is returned to the body immediately before competition to boost the red blood cell count. In addition to contravening the ethics of medicine and sport, this procedure carries a number of risks. These include the possibility of increasing the thickness of blood, making it more difficult to pump around the body and imposing an extra strain on the heart. The extra-thick blood may also damage the kidneys. When using donated blood, there is also a very real risk of transmission of infective diseases. Blood doping is banned by the International Olympic Committee. See also <a href=""entry://erythropoietin""><span class=""links"">erythropoietin</span></a>."
"blood glucose","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>blood glucose</b><div class=""content"">It is vital that the blood contains some glucose as it is the only body fuel used by the brain. However, there is an optimal concentration (between 3 and 8 mmol/l). Too much results in hyperglycaemia and too little in hypoglycaemia; both conditions are harmful. The blood glucose level is controlled mainly by insulin (which lowers blood glucose after meals); other hormones involved in its regulation are glucagon, adrenaline, and glucocorticoids (steroids produced by the adrenal cortex), which raise blood glucose in the fasting state or in response to excitement, fear, and shock.

"blood pressure","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>blood pressure</b><div class=""content"">The pressure exerted by the heart and arteries to push blood around the body. The magnitude of blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood being pumped out of the heart per beat (the stroke volume) and the resistance encountered as it passes through the blood vessels (peripheral resistance). Blood pressure is usually expressed as two measurements: systolic blood pressure, indicating the pressure when the heart is actually pumping; and diastolic blood pressure, the pressure when the heart is filling up with blood. Systolic pressure is always the higher and is expressed first. The pressures are measured in millimetres of mercury. Thus a blood pressure of 130/80, or 130 over 80, refers to a systolic blood pressure which will support a column of mercury 130 mm high, and a diastolic pressure which will support a column 80 mm high. Systolic pressure in children is about 100 and in young adults the value is about 120. It tends to rise with age as arteries thicken. A systolic pressure of 180 is not uncommon and it may be as high as 280. The value varies according to a person's position. It tends to drop when you stand up after lying down; this is called postural hypotensive drop. A typical value for diastolic pressure is 80 mm of mercury. Although it is difficult to define precisely what is ‘normal’ blood pressure, there is general agreement that a desirable blood pressure is less than 140/90.

<b>body awareness</b><div class=""content"">The ability to recognize different parts of one's own body, and their relative positions. It is essential for performing smooth, coordinated movements, and must be well-developed in those aspiring to be top-class dancers, synchronized swimmers, or gymnasts. Body awareness is dependent on being able to perceive and integrate information coming from all the sense organs, including the less well-known ones (proprioceptors) in the muscles and joints, which monitor internal movements. Gymnastics and dance are excellent activities for developing body awareness in children. See also <a href=""entry://kinaesthesis""><span class=""links"">kinaesthesis</span></a>."
"body building","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>body building</b><div class=""content"">A routine of exercise and diet designed to make the body appear muscular. Weight-training is used to develop the size, shape, and symmetry of all the superficial muscles in the body so that they are larger, more conspicuous, and better defined. Training routines usually reduce fat levels and, if performed properly, can improve flexibility, particularly of the shoulders, hips, and trunk. When combined with aerobic fitness training, body building can be beneficial to health. However, when the only objective is to obtain a better looking body, the exercises usually have little beneficial effect on fitness and may even be harmful. Body building may, for example, reduce flexibility and mobility if the weight training is performed without using the full range of movements.<br class=""nLine"" />One routine, called the ‘blitz’ system, uses circuits of several different exercises performed on one body part over long periods of time. This enlarges muscles because more blood can be pumped into them, but blitzing does not necessarily strengthen the muscles.<br class=""nLine"" />The most controversial aspect of body building concerns the methods used to increase body mass. This can be achieved only if there is a positive energy balance, with food intake exceeding energy expenditure. There are many special food supplements on the market which claim to help body-builders to gain weight. However, a major problem is ensuring that the gain is in the form of muscle rather than fat. Appropriate weight-training exercises can help the process, but only slowly. Many serious body-builders resort to taking drugs, such as androgenic-anabolic steroids, for quick results. This can be expensive, both financially and in terms of health.<br class=""nLine"" />Although body-builders require protein, they sometimes over-indulge in protein-rich foods (often in the form of expensive, commercially-packaged supplements) and do not eat enough of the other nutrients. It is difficult to define an individual's exact protein requirements, but the needs of an active body-builder are more than twice those of a sedentary person. Nevertheless, even a 200 lb (90 kg) male body-builder would require no more than 6.5 oz (180 g) of protein per day. Many body-builders eat much more protein than this; the excess is either excreted or turned to fat.

"body composition","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>body composition</b><div class=""content"">The relative percentage of fat, muscle, bone, and other tissue in the body. There are different ways of categorizing body composition. One method assumes that there are four main components: fat, fat-free water, fat-free mineral, and fat-free protein. Another method, generally preferred because it is easier to measure, divides the body into two components: lean (or fat-free) body mass and body fat. These components contribute unequally to body weight. Fat is less dense than muscle. Consequently, two individuals could have the same body weight but have completely different body compositions and body dimensions.<br class=""nLine"" />Body composition has an important effect on physical performance. Generally, the higher the proportion of lean body mass, the greater a person's power to weight ratio. Contact sports (e.g. American football and rugby) favour participants with high body weight. Highly mobile non-contact sports (e.g. gymnastics and distance running) favour those with small body weights. Both groups of sports are usually performed better by those with a high proportion of lean body mass. Regular aerobic exercise and weight training are generally regarded as effective ways of reducing body fat and increasing lean body mass."

<b>body fat</b><div class=""content"">A measurement of the amount of fat in the human body, usually expressed as a percentage of total body weight. Most adult males have between 15 and 25 per cent body fat, and most females have 20&ndash;30 per cent; values for athletes and others who exercise regularly and vigorously are usually less. Between 4 and 15 per cent of body fat is contained within muscles. This is the most metabolically active and accessible form of fat. It is sensitive to the ‘exercise hormones’ (adrenaline and noradrenaline) and is a very important energy source for ultra endurance activities.<br class=""nLine"" />Body fat tends to increase with age, but it is uncertain whether this is an inevitable consequence of the ageing process, or whether it is due to a decrease in daily physical activity.<br class=""nLine"" />There are a number of ways of measuring body fat, including the rather macabre cadaver (dead body) dissection analysis; hydrostatic weighing (this involves weighing a person under water and in air); skinfold measurements and the modern techniques of ultrasound analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance; biological impedance; and computerized tomography. One of the easiest ways of determining body fat is by measuring the thickness of the skin at specific points (see <a href=""entry://skinfold measurements""><span class=""links"">skinfold measurements</span></a>).

"body fuels","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>body fuels</b><div class=""content"">The main sources of energy in the body are carbohydrates and fats. Carbohydrates yield about 4 kilocalories per gram; fat yields more than 9 kilocalories per gram. Protein yields about the same amount of energy as carbohydrates, but, except during starvation or prolonged fasting, only contributes up to 10 per cent of the energy requirements. The energy released from these nutrients during cellular respiration is used to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the only chemical that can be used directly by the body as a source of energy. Glycogen stored in muscles is the quickest source of ATP for muscles to use, especially for short bursts of vigorous activity. Fat is a less accessible source of energy. Fat stores in adipose tissue have to be broken down to glycerol and fatty acids, then transported in the blood stream to active muscles before being broken down. Consequently, fat is used mainly when physical activity is relatively gentle and prolonged. Because carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for intense, short bursts of muscular activity, they should constitute at least 50 per cent of the diet of physically active people."
"body image","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>body image</b>
<i>(body schema)</i><div class=""content"">The perception, both conscious and unconscious, of one's own body and physical dimensions.

"body mass","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>body mass</b><div class=""content"">In anthropometry, when scientific measurements of the human body are made, the mass of the human body is measured to the nearest tenth of a kilogram when the subject is nude, or dressed with clothing of known mass so that correction to nude mass can be made. Body mass is commonly referred to as body weight."
"body mass index","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>body mass index</b> (BMI; <i>Quetelet index</i>)<div class=""content"">An index of weight for height, calculated as:<div class=""expo"">BMI = weight in kg/(height in metre)<sup class=""expo"">2</sup></div>Measurements are for a subject barefooted and without clothes. You can use the above equation to calculate your own BMI (if measurements are made in pounds and inches, divide pounds by 2.2 to convert to kilograms, and divide inches by 39.4 to convert to metres).<br class=""nLine"" />The BMI has been used as a guideline for defining whether a person is overweight because it minimizes the effect of height, but it does not take into consideration other important factors, such as age and body build. The BMI has also been used as an indicator of obesity on the assumption that the higher the index, the greater the level of body fat. However, this assumption is not always true. Highly muscular people, such as body-builders, may have a high BMI but low fat content. Nevertheless, for most people, the BMI is a good way of determining a range of acceptable weights (figure 16).<center class=""centre""><img src=""000020.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 16 Chart depicting body weight to height ratio</center><br class=""nLine"" />Most authorities use the following guidelines:<center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""<tr>

In practical terms, this means that the average woman, 1.63 metres (5 foot 4 inches) in height, should weigh between 52.7 and 67 kg (8 stone 4 pounds to 10 stone 8 pounds), but there is no health risk until she weighs more than 71.3 kg (11 stone 3 pounds). When the BMI exceeds 35, the risk of premature death is doubled."

Measurements of the temperature changes are used to calculate the energy content of the food (see <a href=""entry://Atwater factor""><span class=""links"">Atwater factor</span></a>)."
"bone","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>bone</b><div class=""content"">Hard tissue consisting of a calcified matrix (mainly calcium phosphate) and fibres of protein. About 200 bones make up the human skeleton. It is living tissue with its own blood supply. Bones have a number of functions: they support and protect soft tissues; they act as levers for muscle movement; and the central cavities of long bones store minerals and produce blood cells.<br class=""nLine"" />The long bones and some flat bones contain a central cavity filled with a very active tissue called bone marrow. In adults, the marrow in certain bones (e.g. those of the sternum, ribs, and limbs) produce new red blood cells and destroy those which are defunct. Marrow is also an important source of white blood cells which play a vital role in the body's immunity against disease.<br class=""nLine"" />Bone elongation stops in adults, but bones may change their density and strength at any age (figure 18). Bones need to be mechanically stressed if they are to remain strong and healthy. They tend to become thicker and denser when exercise intensity increases, but they get less dense and weaker if a person becomes inactive. They also weaken if there is a deficiency of calcium or vitamin D in the diet, or if calcium absorption is impaired.

"bone injury","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>bone injury</b><div class=""content"">Bone is very strong, but it is also relatively rigid so that if it yields at all, it tends to fracture. The sensation of pain is confined to the outer membrane lining the bone (the periosteum). Therefore, unless this part is damaged, some bone disorders may go unrecognized. However, pain is severe if the periosteum is even slightly stretched (e.g. by a stress fracture).<br class=""nLine"" />Complete fractures of bone are usually fairly obvious, either from external examination or from an X-ray. Stress fractures, however, are much more difficult to deal with, and often require a bone scan to confirm diagnosis. A bone scan uses scintigraphy to examine the condition of a bone. Scintigraphy is a technique in which a small dose of a radioactive tracer is introduced into the body part to be examined. A scintillation counter helps to produce a picture (a scintigram) of the distribution of the tracer in internal parts of the body."

It is sometimes confused with fatigue, but boredom usually results from too little stimulation, motivation, and interest. It commonly occurs in those who regularly perform monotonous exercise routines. Unlike fatigue, boredom leads to a lack of desire to exercise, rather than an inability to exercise. Boredom is one of the main reasons why people stop exercising and drop out of sport. It can be avoided if the type and location of exercise is varied, if achievable but challenging targets are set, and if exercise is made more fun."

The bacterium is common in soil but also thrives in improperly processed foods, especially low-acid canned goods. Extra care should be taken to destroy bacteria during home-bottling. The toxin affects the central nervous system, particularly the cardiac and respiratory centres, and can cause death due to heart and lung failure. The toxin is usually destroyed during cooking.<br class=""nLine"" />One authoritative medical book recommends that infants under a year old should not be given home-made honey because it may contain dormant spores of <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> which can grow in the immature digestive tract. Honey is safe for older people because it does not contain the toxin and the bacterium cannot survive in the more mature gut."

<b>bovine spongiform encephalopathy</b> (BSE; <i>mad cow disease</i>)<div class=""content"">An infectious disease in cattle thought to be caused by a prion, a very small abnormal heat-resistant protein with the unusual property of transforming normal protein into more prions, hence the infectious nature of the disease. The abnormal protein accumulates leading to nerve damage in the brain. Spread between species is possible. Cattle can, for example, contract the disease from feed containing meat and bone-meal from sheep infected with scrapie (the sheep form of the disease). Transfer of the disease has not yet been demonstrated with certainty between cow and man, but it is a possibility if infected offal (specifically, nerve, brains, and spinal cord) is eaten, as it was between 1988 and 1992 in the UK. The human form of the disease is sometimes called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or CJD, but, at the time of writing, it is still not known whether or not BSE and CJD are the same disease."

It is commonly experienced by tenpin bowlers who attempt to put spin on the ball by keeping the thumb inside the thumbhole until the last possible moment before release. This bowling action puts great strain on tendons and the ulnar nerve. It is usually a transient condition as symptoms subside when bowling stops, but it sometimes results in permanent damage to the nerve. Bowler's thumb can be avoided by widening the thumbhole of the ball, changing technique, or padding the thumb."

<b>bowling</b><div class=""content"">Bowling, whether tenpin bowling with a large, heavy bowl or lawn bowls played with a lighter, wooden bowl, is not a great stamina builder, but it can increase flexibility of arms and shoulders, strengthen legs, and improve coordination. The act of delivering a bowl involves a back swing, forward swing, release, and follow through. These movements involve the coordinated action of muscles in the back, shoulders, arms, and legs. During the delivery, the back may be bent forward and twisted. This imposes considerable mechanical stress on the discs, ligaments, and muscles of the lower back. Consequently, bowling is not recommended for people with persistent lower back problems, and all bowlers are advised to warm up. Gentle mobility and stretching exercises help to reduce the risk of injury."

This activity is quickly gaining in popularity among men and women with many fitness centres across the USA providing classes. Boxercisers perform the same training as professional boxers, including punching balls and shadow boxing, but they do not hit each other. They train not to fight but to improve fitness. In addition to developing power, boxercise also develops grace, coordination, and balance. No doubt one of the additional attractions of boxercise is the opportunity it provides to release pent up aggression. See also <a href=""entry://boxing""><span class=""links"">boxing</span></a>."
"boxing","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>boxing</b><div class=""content"">Boxing is an arduous contact sport requiring very high levels of physical fitness and controlled aggression. There is little doubt that professional boxing is dangerous and can cause serious, even fatal injuries. Many people believe that it is unacceptably hazardous and should be banned. However, supporters of amateur boxing, including some physicians, believe that the amateur code should be considered differently from the professional code. They emphasize that the main aim of amateur boxing is to score points and not to knock out the opponent. Therefore, success depends more on finesse and strategy than brute force. Supporters argue that amateur boxing is much less dangerous than professional boxing (e.g. because of the shorter bouts, more protective gear, heavier gloves etc. in the amateur version). Supporters also cite statistics to indicate that boxing is less dangerous than several other popular contact sports including ice hockey, rugby, and American football. In college and high school American football, for example, three deaths occur per 10 000 participants; in boxing only 1.3 deaths occur per 10 000 participants. Supporters maintain that amateur boxing is a time-honoured way of encouraging young men to develop character and physical fitness, and that it should continue to be a valuable element of the Olympic programme. Nevertheless, many groups of physicians, including the American Medical Association, oppose all forms of boxing because participants suffer repeated blows to the head which have a cumulative effect on the brain (see <a href=""entry://punch-drunk syndrome""><span class=""links"">punch-drunk syndrome</span></a>).

"breakfast","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>breakfast</b><div class=""content"">Breakfast is regarded by many nutritionists as the most important meal of the day, yet it is the one meal that many dieters and exercisers miss: dieters, because they believe that by missing it they can reduce calorific intake and lose weight; exercisers, because their early morning routines often leave them little time to eat. However, food consumed at breakfast seems to be more easily utilized than the same amount eaten at night. In one study, subjects who needed about 2000 Calories per day to maintain body weight, lost weight when the calories were eaten in one morning meal, and gained weight if they ate the same amount at night.<br class=""nLine"" />Clearly, to be of any real value, breakfast must be nutritious. Breakfasts vary according to the culture of the country. In Britain and the USA breakfasts often include complex carbohydrates which contain fibre, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and provide a steady stream of glucose. Equally nutritious breakfasts are provided by salads and soups in Japan, or fish and bread in Norway.

"breast-feeding","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>breast-feeding</b><div class=""content"">Breast milk is the perfect food for a newborn baby. It contains a balanced mixture of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, with adequate amounts of vitamins (except vitamin D) and minerals. During the first two weeks, breast milk is called colostrum or early milk. It contains substances (e.g. immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, and lysozyme) that provide some immunity from infection. Breast-feeding lowers the incidence of food allergies in infants, especially those from families with a history of hypersensitivity.<br class=""nLine"" />A study of 926 babies born before the normal 40 week term of pregnancy, found that those fed on breast milk had significantly higher IQs by the time they were 7 years old, than those given formula milk. It was suggested that the effect was due to breast milk containing long chain polyunsaturates, special fatty acids similar to those found in oily fish. These are believed to help the nervous system to develop.<br class=""nLine"" />During lactation, the dietary demands of the mother are greater than during pregnancy. A breast-feeding mother has to produce milk continually to satisfy the incessant demands of her child. She has to consume sufficient nutrients for herself and her infant. She can obtain most of these nutrients, especially protein, calcium, magnesium, and vitamin B<sub class=""ind>2</sub>, from cow's milk. (Newborn babies cannot cope with cow's milk because it contains more protein than the infant can deal with and a high mineral content which may damage their kidneys.) Other calcium-rich foods include cheese, yoghurt, soya milk, and dark green vegetables. At least three servings of such foods should be eaten each day.<br class=""nLine"" />If the mother's intake of vitamins and minerals is inadequate, the quantity of milk is more likely to be affected than its quality. The baby's supply of vitamins and minerals is usually maintained at the expense of maternal body stores. The American Medical Association is one of several reputable organizations to suggest that multivitamin-mineral supplementation may be beneficial to lactating women.<br class=""nLine"" />A nursing mother's milk contains large amounts of water, so she should drink plenty of fluids (at least eight glasses a day) to prevent the supply of milk from drying up.<br class=""nLine"" />Anything the mother consumes may affect the quality of her milk. If she smokes tobacco, drinks alcohol, or takes other drugs, the toxins from these substances may seep into her milk and affect the infant.<br class=""nLine"" />Lactating mothers often feel overweight, but should not go on a severe weight-loss diet. The mothers need to retain some fat in the breasts and other fat stores for milk production. However, a slow and steady weight loss, no more than 1 kg (2.2 lb) per week, is possible through a sensible selection of low-calorie, nutritious foods. Most fat is lost, anyway, once lactation stops and, in the long term, mothers who breast-feed tend to retain less fat than those who do not."
"breast-stroker's knee","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>breast-stroker's knee</b><div class=""content"">An injury to the inner (medial) surface of the knee, usually caused by the hydrodynamic forces produced by swimmers using a breast-stroke action. It is possible that swimmers who perform whip kicks are more prone to the condition because of extensive movements at the hip. Risk of this injury may be reduced by strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles which act as stabilizers, limiting the amount of abduction and adduction of the lower leg."
"breathing","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>breathing</b><div class=""content"">Breathing is a natural act and most people do not give it a second thought unless they encounter difficulty. However, many non-athletes think that there is some magical method of breathing that endows athletes, particularly distance runners, with greater powers. This is not the case. Arthur Lydiard, one of the gurus of distance running stated: ‘There is no set rule for how you breathe. You'll consume a great amount of oxygen when you are running and it doesn't matter how you get it.’ Nevertheless, there are coaches who advocate special techniques: many European coaches used to insist that their athletes breathe only through the nose; the Finns, many years ago, introduced an extended rhythm system, beginning with four strides to inhale and two strides to exhale, increasing until there are up to eight strides on inhalation and six on exhalation; and some modern coaches advocate ‘belly breathing’ using mainly the diaphragm rather than the chest muscles. These techniques may be effective for some, but if they have to be performed consciously they may interfere with the relaxation essential for efficient exercising.<br class=""nLine"" />Although not important in aerobic exercises, breathing technique is important for those performing strenuous anaerobic exercises, such as weight training. They should not hold their breath during the complete exercise. This causes an increase in intra-abdominal pressure that might result in dizziness or light-headedness, which can be dangerous for those with a heart condition. Most coaches train their weight-lifters to inhale as the weight is lowered and exhale as it is lifted. Difficulty in breathing occurs after extreme exertion, but breathlessness after mild exertion may indicate a malfunction of the lungs or heart.

"brown fat","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>brown fat</b>
<i>(brown adipose tissue)</i><div class=""content"">A layer of special heat-producing fat cells found mainly around the shoulder blades and kidneys; it is more abundant in infants than adults.<br class=""nLine"" />Brown fat cells contain many more mitochondria than other types of fat cells. Mitochondria are sometimes called the powerhouses of the cell because they are the organelles responsible for aerobic respiration. They usually produce the energy-rich storage compound ATP, but in brown fat their activity is diverted to heat production. The colour of brown fat is derived from highly pigmented chemicals (cytochromes) contained within the mitochondria. These cytochromes enable mitochondria to produce heat instead of ATP.<br class=""nLine"" />The purpose of brown fat in small mammals and babies is to maintain body temperature. Hibernating mammals metabolize brown fat to re-warm their bodies during arousal. Brown fat is well supplied with blood which can transport the heat to different parts of the body. Unlike other types of fat, it has its own nerve supply which can quickly stimulate it to produce heat when the animal (or baby) gets cold.<br class=""nLine"" />There has been a lot of speculation about the significance of brown fat in adults. It makes up less than 1 per cent of the body weight and is generally regarded as unimportant. It is, however, more abundant in lean than in fat animals and some researchers believe that it plays a role in regulating body weight and energy balance, at least in small mammals. It has also been shown that some forms of obesity and overweight in mice are linked to an inherited lack of brown fat. Some members of the slimming industry have capitalized on these ideas by marketing special clothes with holes in the back and arm pits, which they claim will stimulate the formation of brown fat and help you lose weight effortlessly. The effectiveness of these clothes has yet to be scientifically proven."
"bruise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>bruise</b>
<i>(contusion)</i><div class=""content"">A bruise is likely to develop whenever your body collides with another object, so it is a very common injury in any contact sport. A bruise forms from seepage of blood in an internal wound. The blood gradually decomposes, changing colour from red to blue as haemoglobin loses its oxygen, and then to yellow as the haemoglobin is reabsorbed. The accumulation of blood in damaged tissues can be reduced by applying firm pressure for 3&ndash;5 minutes immediately after the injury, followed by a cold compress.

"bulimia nervosa","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>bulimia nervosa</b>
<i>(binge&mdash;purge syndrome)</i><div class=""content"">An eating disorder characterized by sequences of excessive eating followed by purging. Self-induced vomiting is the most common purging behaviour, but others include fasting, excessive exercise, laxative abuse, and diuretic abuse. Individuals who develop bulimia are convinced that they are overweight and that their body shape is abnormal. Bulimics begin restrictive dieting in an effort to lose weight, but this induces hunger and thoughts of food which leads to binge eating. In an effort to undo the excessive eating, the bulimic vomits or purges what he or, more commonly, she has eaten. Bulimia may become chronic if an individual develops a psychological need to binge.<br class=""nLine"" />Bulimic behaviour may become a means through which emotional problems are regulated and managed. Binge eating may help to release pent-up emotions and enable the bulimic to be distracted temporarily from unpleasant problems. However, the bulimic then has to purge to remove the feelings of guilt associated with the bingeing.<br class=""nLine"" />A number of medical complications can occur as a direct or indirect result of bulimic behaviour. Dental problems, including erosion of tooth enamel and gum disease, may occur if there is frequent vomiting of the acidic contents of the stomach. Gastrointestinal problems are common, including abdominal cramps, constipation and diarrhoea. Laxative abuse may lead to loss of normal bowel function. An imbalance of electrolytes, caused by loss of body fluids, may result in cardiovascular complications. Most of these effects of bulimia are reversible once the sufferer resumes a normal eating pattern.<br class=""nLine"" />Bulimia nervosa may occur as a phase of anorexia nervosa, and bulimics often share the same psychological problems as anorexics. Both disorders must be treated seriously and medical advice sought. However, it is not easy to identify bulimics. They may show few symptoms until late in the course of the illness, and, unlike anorexics, they may be of normal weight. In addition, bulimics are very secretive about their condition and usually deny vehemently that they have a problem."

<b>bulking agents</b><div class=""content"">Bulking agents are substances that add to the bulk of food. They are dietary fibres that usually contain no calories and pass through the intestine undigested. Consequently, they are common ingredients of slimming foods. Some so-called slimming pills and tablets contain bulking agents such as guar gum, extracted from the seeds of a tropical Indian member of the pea family, <i>Cyamopsis tetraglobula</i>. If taken before a meal, the gum makes you feel full and depresses your appetite. Unfortunately, excessive amounts may block the intestines, so the British government recommends that products should contain no more than 15 per cent of this gum. Other bulking agents, other gums, and cellulose-related substances such as sugar beet fibre, may also block the intestines and cause flatulence if taken in excess."
"bungee jumping","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>bungee jumping</b><div class=""content"">An increasingly popular activity in which a person, attached to elasticated ropes, jumps from a considerable height. The jumper goes into a free-fall, broken by the ropes that are secured at the jump-off point. The ropes prevent the jumper from hitting the ground or water. They are elasticated so that the jumper's descent does not come to an abrupt halt and deceleration is at a tolerable rate.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1993, there were more than 60 000 bungee jumps in the UK, many for charity. Some of the jumps were made by people with little training. Although there have been few accidents involving collision with the ground or another object, there is concern that the jumps result in a sudden rise in pressure within the eye which may detach the retina and lead to blindness. Prospective jumpers are advised to consult a physician to ensure that they have no medical condition (such as high blood pressure, eye problems, or bone disorders) which might be exacerbated by jumping. In addition, they should ensure that the jump is properly organized. In the UK, the official national body for bungee jumping is the British Elastic Rope Association. It ensures that sites are safe and that jumpers have had sufficient training."

It develops as a result of chronic stress, especially among people in very demanding jobs. Burn out has been viewed by psychologists as ‘an imbalance between the psychological resources of an individual and the demands being made on these resources’. It leads to mental fatigue and an inability to deal with stressful situations. Anyone can experience burn out but it is particularly prevalent in business middle-managers and professional athletes who push themselves (or are pushed) too hard."

"caffeine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>caffeine</b><div class=""content"">Caffeine occurs naturally in about 60 species of plant, including coffee beans, tea leaves, and cocoa nuts. It is a constituent of chocolate bars, coffee, tea, and cola-type drinks and occurs in the following approximate amounts: <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""<tr><td><small class=""smCap"">CAFFEINE PER AVERAGE</small></td>

<tr><td>decaffeinated coffee</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>tea</td><td>40</td></tr>
<tr><td>cola</td><td>40</td></tr>
<tr><td>chocolate bar</td><td>40</td></tr></table></center><br class=""nLine"" />Caffeine is a mildly addictive drug. It acts as a stimulant, increasing blood pressure, and accelerating heart rate and breathing. It also makes you feel more alert and energetic.<br class=""nLine"" />High caffeine consumption prior to competition is banned by the International Olympic Committee because it improves performance artificially and it may be harmful if taken in excess. Concentrations above 12 micrograms per millilitre are regarded as positive indicators of doping.<br class=""nLine"" />Caffeine may boost athletic performance by improving muscle strength and reaction times. Drinking as little as two cups of coffee may enable athletes of average ability to run the 1500 metres several seconds faster. Coffee may also improve endurance and delay fatigue by mobilizing free fatty acids, making them more readily available as fuel. A high carbohydrate diet appears to nullify this effect.<br class=""nLine"" />Excessive caffeine intake can cause sleeplessness, diarrhoea, fluid loss, and stomach irritation. Many researchers have tried to link high caffeine consumption to an increased risk of certain diseases, such as cancer, high blood pressure, and heart disease. As yet, the links have not been confirmed and some of the evidence is contradictory. However, there is a well-established correlation between heart disease and those who both smoke and have high levels of caffeine consumption. Caffeine, when consumed at the same time as other foods, may also interfere with the absorption of minerals, such as calcium and iron. Loss of bone density associated with ageing in adults, may be accelerated by drinking two or more cups of coffee a day. Coffee also acts as a diuretic, increasing urine production by as much as 30 per cent.<br class=""nLine"" />Although there is still some uncertainty about the effects of caffeine, the general medical opinion is that between 200&ndash;250 milligrams of caffeine a day rarely cause adverse reactions in healthy adults. It also appears that caffeine consumed during exercise (rather than before or after it) has little effect on heart rate, performance, or urine production."
"caffeinism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>caffeinism</b><div class=""content"">A condition resulting from a very high intake of caffeine and characterized by anxiety, mood swings, sleep disruption, and other physiological and psychological abnormalities. Abstinence following high intake can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as severe headaches. A caffeine intake of more than 600 mg per day may produce depression and other harmful effects. Caffeine intoxification is recognized as a medical condition in the USA. Many doctors believe that young people may be particularly sensitive to the harmful effects of caffeine and want to limit the amount of caffeine in cola drinks (one American high caffeine cola drink has more than 200 mg of caffeine in each can)."

"calcium","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>calcium</b><div class=""content"">A metallic element essential for normal development and health. The average adult contains over 1 kg of calcium, stored mainly as calcium salts in the bones. Calcium is essential for the normal activity of muscles and nerves, for growth of bones and teeth, and for blood clotting.<br class=""nLine"" />In the United States, it is recommended that adults take 800 mg of calcium each day; in the UK, the Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI, the amount of nutrient sufficient for almost all individuals) is 700 mg per day. Higher RDAs are recommended for children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating mothers. In the USA, the National Institute of Health recommended that post-menopausal women should consume between 1200 and 1500 mg of calcium per day to reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Some nutritionists believe that this high level of intake after menopause has no benefit. The need for adequate calcium is greatest in adolescents and young adults, so as to maximize bone density. The higher the peak density, the longer the post-menopausal losses can continue without causing significant weakening of the bone. Regular exercise is also important to minimize mineral loss. Good sources of calcium are milk, cheese, yoghurt, legumes, nuts, and wholegrains. Vitamin D aids absorption.<br class=""nLine"" />About one-third of the dietary intake of calcium is egested in the faeces. Some is also excreted in the urine with the amount increasing among those on a high protein diet. Long-duration activity and high temperatures increase the amount of calcium lost in urine and sweat. Many sports coaches believe that these losses justify the use of calcium supplements by young women, especially elite endurance athletes who train at a relatively high intensity for long periods.<br class=""nLine"" />Excess calcium depresses some physiological activities associated with nerves and muscles and can lead to the development of kidney stones. Calcium deficiencies can slow down the growth rate of children and cause rickets. Deficiencies in adults may lead to the development of soft, inadequately mineralized bones (osteomalacia) and brittle bones.

"calisthenics","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>calisthenics</b><div class=""content"">Systematic, rhythmic exercises, such as sit-ups and push-ups, which utilize the weight of the body as resistance. The exercises are usually performed gracefully. They are designed to tone and strengthen muscle, and to promote general fitness. Structured training routines, similar to circuit training, have been formulated using timed calisthenics. Exercise intensity is controlled by varying the number of repetitions performed in a given time. As fitness improves, you can increase the number of repetitions and circuits. However, once you can perform a certain number of repetitions (approximately 25), additional repetitions will only improve your muscular endurance, not your strength. To develop strength, you can add weights or change your body position to increase the resistance. For example, you can wear a weighted vest or elevate your feet while doing push-ups. Exercises in a calisthenics routine should be chosen carefully so that all the major muscle groups are worked. A typical routine might consist of seven exercises: burpees, curl-ups, push-ups, treadmills, running on the spot, star jumps, and chin-ups. Each exercise lasts a predetermined time depending on fitness level, and is separated from the next exercise by a 10 second rest period. Exercisers usually walk for two minutes between circuits to hasten recovery."

<b>calorie</b><div class=""content"">Despite an international convention which agreed to use the joule (J) as the standard unit for energy, work, and heat, the calorie is the unit most commonly used in written work about nutrition. One calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water through 1°C (more precisely, from 14.5°C to 15.5°C). It is easy to convert calories into joules, as one calorie equals 4.2 joules (more exactly, 4.184 joules). These units are very small in relation to the energy used by a person, so it is usual to use units 1000 times larger. These should be called kilocalories (often written as Calorie), but most diet and exercise books use ‘calories’ to mean kilocalories; so a 1000 calorie diet is really a diet that provides 1000 kilocalories a day."
"calorie counting","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>calorie counting</b><div class=""content"">An awareness of the calorie content of foods is healthy, but an obsessive preoccupation with the exact number of calories you eat in any one day can be both unhealthy and ineffective. It can be unhealthy because the calorie content gives no indication of the nutritional value of the food, only its energy content. It can be ineffective because once those on a calorie controlled diet overshoot their daily target they often eat without restraint. Calorie awareness should include the fact that all foods contain calories (even a piece of celery!), but that it is really only worth considering calorie consumption and expenditure in hundreds of calories; many drinks, especially alcohol, have a significant calorie content; and that fats and sugars are the most calorie dense foods (25 g of butter, for example, has more calories than 275 g of potatoes). Most dietitians and nutritionists agree that it is better to understand the basic principles of nutrition so that you can eat a balanced diet containing all the main food groups in their correct proportions, than blindly follow a set of calorie-counting rules. Nevertheless, simple calorie counting does provide a way of controlling energy intake and losing weight."
"calorimetry","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>calorimetry</b><div class=""content"">Measurements of energy expenditure and energy consumption in terms of heat units, usually expressed as kilocalories. There are two main types of calorimetry: direct and indirect.<br class=""nLine"" />Direct calorimetry is based on the premise that energy expended by an individual doing any kind of work is ultimately converted to heat. To measure this heat, a person is placed in a specially designed, insulated chamber (called a calorimeter) supplied with air and surrounded by a jacket of circulating water; the heat production (or energy expenditure) is estimated from changes in the temperature of the surrounding water.<br class=""nLine"" />Indirect calorimetry uses oxygen consumption as a means of estimating energy expenditure. Oxygen is required to release from food the energy needed for activity. The more energy expended, the more oxygen is consumed. To convert values of oxygen consumption to kilo-calories of energy expenditure, it is necessary to know what type of food is being used as the energy source. This is because a litre of oxygen will release different amounts of energy from fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.<br class=""nLine"" />A new method for measuring energy expenditure has been devised. This entails drinking heavy water (it has the formula <sup class=""expo"">2</sup>H<sub class=""ind>2</sub><sup class=""expo"">18</sup>O; normal water has the formula <sup class=""expo"">1</sup>H<sub class=""ind>2</sub><sup class=""expo"">16</sup>O). Oxygen-18 and deuterium (hydrogen-2) are two stable, harmless isotopes that can be detected in liquids or in air. Some of the oxygen-18 is exhaled as carbon dioxide (the waste product of respiration), and some is excreted in urine along with some of the deuterium. Deuterium is lost from the body only in water. The difference between the rate of excretion of deuterium and oxygen-18 in the urine over a reasonable length of time (usually a day or more) can be used to estimate energy expenditure. The estimates can be made using daily urine samples and do not affect performance. The method has been used to gain valuable information about true energy expenditure under natural, as opposed to laboratory, conditions. Dual-labelled water was used to show that Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Dr Mike Stroud expended more than 8000 Calories a day during their polar expedition. This is three to four times an average person's daily energy expenditure and double the amount used by riders in the gruelling Tour de France."

"cancer","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>cancer</b><div class=""content"">A group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells which have the ability to spread throughout the body or body parts. Cancers are among the most insidious and feared diseases. There have been great advances in our understanding of cancers in recent years, but much remains unknown. Nevertheless, cancer research is a very active field and new knowledge is gained every day enabling doctors to establish the causes for the diseases and design new treatments. Unfortunately, a lot of this is pioneering research and sometimes claims are made prematurely or are exaggerated.<br class=""nLine"" />Diet has featured strongly in cancer research. Results are often inconclusive, but there are clear indications that some diets can affect the risk of contracting cancer. Scotland has a diet with one of the lowest levels of fruit and vegetable consumption in the world, and a particularly high incidence of bowel cancer. Some doctors believe that up to 1563 deaths a year, 90 per cent of the total caused by bowel cancer, could be avoided if people changed their diet. It is believed that high fibre diets with plenty of fruit and vegetables give some (but not complete) protection against bowel cancer, and a substance in garlic (diallylsulphide) may reduce the risk of stomach cancers. Animal research has shown that certain fish oil derivatives may halt the growth of some tumours. It is claimed that gammalinoleic acid (GLA), found in evening primrose oil, has powerful anti-cancer properties; and there is a catalogue of claims about the effects of antioxidants, with the vitamins A, C, and E gaining most attention recently. Cancers of the pancreas, prostate, bladder, breast, cervix, womb, ovary, small intestine, and rectum have at some time been linked with obesity and unhealthy diets. These are just a few examples of the possible relationship between foods and cancers, and it is important to emphasize that many of the claims are not fully substantiated. In January 1993 the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer was set up to examine links between diet and cancer. Detailed diet diaries and health records of 250 000 people across Europe are being studied over a ten-year period. The results will allow researchers to examine the diets of apparently healthy patients who later develop cancer.<br class=""nLine"" />The relationship between exercise and cancers has been studied in less depth. The general consensus, although tentative, seems to be that there is an optimum amount of exercise that activates the immune system and reduces risk of tumour development; regular exercise above and below this level may weaken the immune system and increase the risk of certain cancers. One study undertaken in 1977 examined the exercise habits of 17 000 Harvard graduates. Those who burned at least 1000 extra Calories a week exercising had half the incidence of colon cancer compared with sedentary people within the same age group. It was suggested that exercise may reduce the intestinal transit time (the amount of time food remains in the gut) and the exposure of the gut wall to carcinogens. The results, however, may be due to differences in diet between exercisers and non-exercisers."
"candida","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>candida</b><div class=""content"">A group of yeast-like fungi that lives in moist areas of the body, including the alimentary tract and vagina. Normally, the populations of candida are kept in check by beneficial bacteria in the body, but sometimes they grow beyond tolerance levels and the infected person suffers a disease called candidiasis or thrush. In the vagina, thrush causes a white discharge and is accompanied by itching and soreness. Some doctors believe that heavy infections of candida in the gut can contribute to a wide range of different disorders, including abdominal discomfort, disturbed bowel function, soreness, and itching.<br class=""nLine"" />Some nutritionists believe that the incidence of candidiasis is affected by an individual's health and diet. The fungi are thought to thrive on simple sugars, bread, and biscuits, as well as fermented foods such as yoghurt, cheese, and alcohol, which form a large part of the modern diet. A person in good health can usually keep candida under control, but if the immune system is weakened by illness or stress, or if friendly bacteria are killed off (for example, by antibiotics) the opportunistic fungus grows rapidly. People suffering from candidiasis often have cravings for sweets and yeast-containing foods and drinks, which makes weight control very difficult. Candidiasis can be treated with a special diet that emphasizes the avoidance of yeasty foods and the foods on which candida thrive, but doctors often use anti-candida drugs, such as nystatin."

<b>canoeing</b> and <b>kayaking</b><div class=""content"">Performed correctly, canoeing and kayaking use every major muscle group in the body and are very good for developing aerobic fitness. Competitions require a lot of practice time and high levels of cardiorespiratory endurance. Recreational canoeing and kayaking are suitable for people over a wide range of age and fitness. Even if pursued solely as recreation, these activities have definite training effects improving stamina, firming muscles, and increasing shoulder and wrist flexibility. Despite their attractions, canoeing and kayaking share the same dangers as most water sports. To minimize these dangers, participants should be trained by well-qualified instructors, life jackets should always be worn and other water-safety guidelines followed."
"carbohydrate addict's diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>carbohydrate addict's diet</b><div class=""content"">A diet that appeals to the chocaholic has been described in the book <i>The carbohydrate addict's diet</i>, written by Drs Rachael and Richard Heller (1994, Mandarin, London).<br class=""nLine"" />Users of this diet are allowed three meals a day, two of which must contain no carbohydrates (no pasta, potatoes, fruit, sweets etc.). The Hellers recommend that the third meal should be balanced to include all the food groups, but it allows the dieters to have whatever they want, as long as it is consumed in less than one hour. This third meal is regarded by dieters as being a reward, and some use it as an excuse to satisfy their cravings for rich, chocolate-laden foods.<br class=""nLine"" />The theory behind the diet is that, by restricting most of the carbohydrate intake to one meal, hunger pangs are less likely to occur. High blood glucose levels stimulate insulin secretion which, in turn, causes the glucose to be converted into the storage carbohydrate, glycogen. Insulin production is believed to be linked to the development of hunger pangs. The Hellers claim that thousands of people have been helped to lose weight on this diet, through the Carbohydrate Centre they set up.<br class=""nLine"" />Helen Kon, a self-confessed chocaholic, reported in the <i>Independent</i> newspaper (16 August 1994) that she neither lost nor gained weight on the diet. However, although she was unsure of its nutritional benefits, she reported that she was going to keep to the carbohydrate addict's diet because she was having so much fun during what she called her ‘happy hour’!

<b>carbohydrate loading</b>
<i>(carboloading; glycogen overshoot; muscle glycogen loading)</i><div class=""content"">A classic experiment showed that a high carbohydrate diet can triple an athlete's endurance. It compared fuel use during exercise among three groups of runners. One group consumed a normal diet (about 55 per cent carbohydrate); one group consumed a high carbohydrate diet (83 per cent carbohydrate); and the third group consumed a low carbohydrate, high fat diet (about 94 per cent fat). The high carbohydrate group sustained activity for an average of 167 minutes, those on a normal balanced diet for 114 minutes, and those on a high fat diet for only 57 minutes. This study encouraged athletes to increase the carbohydrate stores within muscle artificially to improve their endurance capacity; a procedure called carbohydrate loading.<br class=""nLine"" />There are two main methods of carbohydrate loading. The traditional method is a combined diet and exercise regime that artificially raises the muscle glycogen (the main carbohydrate storage molecule in muscles). It is based on the assumption that depleting the muscle of its glycogen stores stimulates the body to take up and store more glycogen than normal. A typical carbohydrate-loading procedure for a marathon runner starts seven days before a race when the athlete depletes the muscle of its glycogen by running a long distance, usually about 20 miles (32 km). For the next three days (the depletion phase), the athlete eats a high protein, low carbohydrate diet and usually continues exercising to ensure that glycogen stores are completely depleted, and to sensitize the physiological processes which manufacture and store glycogen. For the final three days before a race, the athlete eats a high carbohydrate diet and takes little or no exercise. In the second method, training is tapered during the week before exercise and then the carbohydrate content of the diet is increased for the three days before the event. The second method has generally replaced the traditional method because it is simpler to follow, achieves the same muscle glycogen concentrations, and avoids the side-effects (diarrhoea, dehydration, and insomnia) sometimes experienced during the depletion phase of the traditional method.<br class=""nLine"" />Both methods of carbohydrate loading can more than double the glycogen content of muscle. However, the procedures are not without risks. Carbohydrate loading causes more water to be stored in the body (each gram of carbohydrate stored requires an extra 2.7 grams of water). This sometimes makes the athlete feel heavy and stiff. Some body-builders take advantage of this effect by carbohydrate loading before competition to ‘pump’ up their muscles. If used repeatedly, carbohydrate loading can lead to the presence of the red muscle pigment, myoglobin, in the urine (myoglobinuria), chest pains, and heart irregularities. A lot of the harmful effects of carbohydrate loading are linked to the depletion phase. Most sports nutritionists believe this phase is unnecessary and that an athlete needs only to load up on carbohydrate to benefit from it. It may be less risky to maintain a high muscle glycogen content by ensuring a good, regular daily intake of carbohydrates rather than by having a short period of carbohydrate loading."
"carbohydrates","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>carbohydrates</b><div class=""content"">Carbohydrates are the most accessible and most used form of fuel in the body. One gram yields approximately 4 Calories of energy (about 16.7 joules).<br class=""nLine"" />Simple carbohydrates include the sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) found in jams, confectionery, cakes, biscuits, pastries, and table sugar. Complex carbohydrates include starches and fibres found in unrefined foods (e.g. bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, cereals, and nuts). Most carbohydrates (but not fibre) are broken down during digestion to glucose and other monosaccharides.<br class=""nLine"" />Although the precise figures differ, most nutritionists and dietitians recommend that carbohydrates (mainly complex carbohydrates because they contain other nutrients and fibre) should be the prime source of energy for everyone (see also <a href=""entry://glycaemic index""><span class=""links"">glycaemic index</span></a>). A typical recommendation is that 55&ndash;60 per cent of daily calories should come from carbohydrates, of which 85 per cent should be complex carbohydrates. The figure should be even higher (about 70 per cent of daily calories) for those who are regularly engaged in strenuous endurance activities. This means that an adult male exerciser in hard training and requiring about 4000 Calories a day, would need to eat about 500 grams of carbohydrate; a large plateful of pasta supplies about 110 grams of carbohydrate.<br class=""nLine"" />The ability of the body to store carbohydrate is limited, but relatively small amounts of glycogen can be stored in the liver and muscle (about 2000 kcal of energy, or the equivalent of the energy needed for about 32 km of running). Diets rich in carbohydrate help to replace muscle glycogen which is the main fuel used during exercise. There is also some evidence that carbohydrates are less easily converted to body fat than is dietary fat.

In non-athletes, cardiac hypertrophy may be the result of a number of pathological conditions, including heart valve disease.

The average cardiac output at rest is 5&ndash;6 litres per minute.<br class=""nLine"" />Regular aerobic exercise strengthens heart muscle and enables it to increase its stroke volume. A typical value for a sedentary man at complete rest is only 75 ml per beat; a typical value for a trained endurance athlete at rest is 105 ml per beat. A well conditioned person usually has a lower heart rate than a sedentary person for the same cardiac output.

Carnitine is synthesized in the body from two amino acids, lysine and methionine. The synthesis requires iron and certain vitamins (B<sub class=""ind>6</sub>, C, and niacin).<br class=""nLine"" />Two forms of carnitine exist: D-carnitine and L-carnitine, but only L-carnitine is physiologically significant. There is speculation that an extra dose of L-carnitine can boost long-term energy supplies and reduce body fat because it accelerates fat metabolism, or fat burning. Manufacturers of special diet foods containing carnitine claim that they boost athletic performance and help people to lose weight.<br class=""nLine"" />It is widely agreed that carnitine supplements are necessary for those who have a deficiency, but there is less agreement about its general use. Over-the-counter products were banned in the United States because there was no rigorous proof of the manufacturers' claims. In 1993, France stopped the sale of dozens of products containing carnitine because a government investigation concluded that carnitine neither enhances athletic performance nor helps people lose weight.

However, the condition is harmless and reversible. Carotenes are important anti-oxidants. It has been claimed that carotene offers some protection against lung cancer induced by tobacco smoking. Research in the USA also suggests that beta-carotene may reduce several other types of cancer and coronary heart diseases. However, a study carried out in Finland in 1994 of 10 000 people showed that more lung cancer deaths actually occurred in those given carotene supplements, so the value of supplementation is unclear. Carotenes are present in a wide range of foods, but concentrations are especially high in carrots, parsley, and green leafy vegetables."

Within the wall of each carotid artery is a swelling (the carotid sinus) which contains nerve-endings sensitive to pressure changes in the blood.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is quite common among middleaged and pregnant women. It is also probably the most common over-use sports injury involving the wrist. Long-distance cyclists who maintain a constant grip on the handlebars, weight-lifters, racket players, and golfers are all susceptible. The first step in treatment is to remove the cause. Most cases respond well to rest and hydrocortisone treatment, but sometimes surgical relief is needed. In the case of cyclists, wearing padded cycling gloves and regularly changing the grip on the handlebars can prevent the condition from arising."

<b>catastrophe theory</b><div class=""content"">A mathematical model developed by the French mathematician, René Thom, to show how the interaction of varying factors produce sudden, dramatic changes. Sports psychologists use catastrophe theory to explain why athletes subjected to a critical level of stress experience a huge and sudden loss of performance.<br class=""nLine"" />Among athletes, two main factors are associated with stress: physiological arousal (changes in heart rate, sweating, adrenaline secretion etc.) and cognitive anxiety (i.e. mental anxiety). The relationship between these two factors and the performance of an athlete can be depicted in a 3-D graph, with the surface shape representing performance (figure 21). The graph shows that when stress increases up to a critical level, performance improves. At the critical level, the surface folds so that more than one level of performance can occur; an athlete's performance can leap unexpectedly from one level to the other. Beyond the critical level, further increases in stress result in poorer performances. <center class=""centre""><img src=""000047.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 21</center>"
"cellulite","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>cellulite</b><div class=""content"">A term adopted by the diet industry to describe the bulged, rippled, and waffled appearance associated with subcutaneous fat on hips, thighs, and buttocks. It occurs almost exclusively in women. Cellulite is less common in men because they have a different fat distribution; the connective tissue around their fat cells is stronger, and their skin is thicker.<br class=""nLine"" />The general consensus of medical opinion in Britain and the USA is that cellulite is merely an effect created by weakened connective tissue and cells filled with fat, and that it can be reduced by regular exercise and dieting. Typically, treatment consists of: <blockquote>•&nbsp;a low fat, high fibre diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;regular, vigorous exercise, such as brisk walking for 30 minutes, three times a week<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;drinking plenty of water (about eight glasses a day).<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> Many doctors on the European mainland have a different opinion. They believe that cellulite is a medical problem requiring medical treatment. Some European researchers suggest that an oversensitivity to oestrogen may disturb the normal pattern of fluid and fat storage. They called cellulite ‘localized hydrolipodystrophy’. They believe that the bulging fat cells of cellulite harden if left untreated and recommend mesotherapy. This is a treatment used on a wide range of medical conditions including osteoarthritis and some sports injuries. It consists of injecting minute quantities of drugs under the skin in areas of tenderness associated with cellulite. Mesotherapy should be administered only by those medically qualified. In 1994, only one specialist in Britain provided this treatment."

By the age of seven, nearly all of the motor control mechanisms in the brain are present and the child is rapidly developing motor skills. During the major growth spurts (usually experienced by girls between the ages of 9 and 12 years, and by boys between 11 and 14 years) reasonable exercise encourages growth of muscles, tendons, and bones, but excessive exercise can permanently damage bones and joints. Most experts agree that, although exercise during childhood is important, the emphasis should be on fun.

<b>Chinese restaurant syndrome</b><div class=""content"">A disorder experienced by some people after eating Chinese food. It is characterized by headaches, thirst, tightness in the chest, palpitations, and numbness in the hands and neck. The syndrome has been attributed to monosodium glutamate (MSG) contained in highly flavoured foods and sauces (especially the soy sauce which is offered as an accompaniment to many Chinese meals).<br class=""nLine"" />MSG adversely affects certain susceptible individuals but it may not be entirely responsible for the syndrome. Some victims of Chinese restaurant syndrome have a low vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub> status which is thought to increase their sensitivity to MSG. When given vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub> supplements, most of these victims quickly recover. In double-blind experiments comparing the effects of MSG and a placebo, the percentage of those who experienced unpleasant symptoms was not significantly different between the two groups. This suggests that some other factor, such as histamine, may be involved in the syndrome. Certain foods contain histamine (interestingly, soy sauce when fermented produces this chemical).

In 1991, each Briton consumed an average of 7.3 kilograms (16 lb) of chocolate.<br class=""nLine"" />Chocolate contains high levels of magnesium and there might be a link between chocolate cravings and the body's need for this element. Some scientists believe that the cravings are linked to two other chemicals found in chocolate: phenylethylamine (PEA) and theobromine. PEA produces feelings of euphoria described as being similar in kind, if not intensity, to a sexual climax. Levels of PEA in the brain increase when people fall in love, and decrease when they fall out of love. Theobromine is related to caffeine and has similar stimulatory effects.<br class=""nLine"" />Recent studies question this link between cravings for chocolate and chemicals. When self-confessed chocoholics were given capsules of cocoa powder, chocolate with the flavour removed, or unadulterated chocolate, only those eating real chocolate satisfied their cravings although all consumed EPA and theobromine. These chemicals may have stimulatory effects, but it appears that chocoholics crave chocolate primarily because they like the taste.<br class=""nLine"" />Some psychologists and nutritionists believe that overindulgence in chocolate is due to emotional and social conditioning in early life when chocolate is often given as a sign of social approval.

<b>cholesterol</b><div class=""content"">A white, waxy substance, related to fats. It occurs naturally in most animal tissue.

There is little danger of cholesterol deficiency because it can be manufactured in the liver from fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.<br class=""nLine"" />The problems associated with cholesterol arise because modern diets in northern Europe and North America often result in over-production. A lot of cholesterol is not used but is deposited in the walls of blood vessels where it increases the risk of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. The most influential factor in raising blood cholesterol levels is eating foods high in saturated fat. Nicotine increases deposition of cholesterol in the walls of blood vessels. Hereditary factors are also important determinants of blood cholesterol levels.<br class=""nLine"" />A good diet can decrease blood cholesterol levels. Soluble fibre, polyunsaturated fat (especially fish fats which contain omega-3 fatty acids), and monounsaturated fat (such as olive oil) may all lower cholesterol levels. Regular aerobic exercise helps to reduce deposition of cholesterol in blood vessels.<br class=""nLine"" />Blood cholesterol levels vary considerably and there is no universally accepted safe level, but the following are guidelines used by most doctors: <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""<tr><td></td><td><small class=""smCap"">CHOLESTEROL LEVELS</small></td></tr>
<tr><td>desirable levels</td><td>&lt;5.2 mmol/l (&lt;200 mg/dl)</td></tr>

<tr><td>high</td><td>6.5&ndash;7.8 mmol/l (251&ndash;300 mg/dl)</td></tr>
<tr><td>very high</td><td>&gt;7.8 mmol/l (&gt;300 mg/dl)</td></tr></table></center> Some people with cholesterol levels just below 200 mg/dl may also be at risk of cardiovascular diseases because of the type of lipoprotein they possess (lipoproteins carry cholesterol and fats in the blood; see <a href=""entry://lipoprotein""><span class=""links"">lipoprotein</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />Several cholesterol test-kits can be bought over the counter. If used properly, these can give quite accurate readings, but interpreting the results is not easy, and the results may make a person unnecessarily anxious. A number of factors can affect blood cholesterol levels temporarily. Exercising or eating before the test can raise levels by more than 15 per cent. It is normal for cholesterol levels to fluctuate, so at least two tests, separated by one or two months, are needed to give a reliable average. People who are worried about their cholesterol level should have it checked properly by a doctor.<br class=""nLine"" />Although many people with high cholesterol levels have an increased risk of coronary heart disease, the effects of treatment are not straightforward. Treatment has been linked to increases in deaths from other causes (notably violent deaths). Cholesterol testing may be advisable for those at greatest risk (such as those with a family history of high cholesterol levels or coronary heart disease) and who are prepared to change their lifestyle. But many doctors believe that automatic screening and self-testing may turn healthy people into patients chronically anxious about their cholesterol levels. As one medical textbook states ‘It may be healthier not to know’."
"cholesterol-lowering drugs","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>cholesterol-lowering drugs</b><div class=""content"">Drugs that reduce the level of blood cholesterol. They are sometimes prescribed to individuals who cannot reduce their high cholesterol levels by special diets or exercise. There are a number of cholesterol-lowering drugs, some of which have unpleasant and potentially dangerous side-effects. Drugs containing niacin have gained particular notoriety. Niacin (specifically, one form called nicotinic acid) may reduce cholesterol levels, but large doses can cause irreversible liver damage. Clearly, no one should take any cholesterol-lowering drug without medical advice. The patient should also be monitored to ensure that the drug is effective and does not cause any harmful side-effects.

Often, the knee gives way unexpectedly. Chondromalacia patellae has become, in the words of one eminent specialist of sports injuries, a ‘wastebasket’ term applied to any syndrome characterized by pain and a crackling sound around the front of the knee.

They claim it burns fat and increases lean body mass by accelerating protein metabolism. They also claim that it may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by increasing the proportion of high density lipoproteins in the blood. Studies in the USA have recently disproved these claims. Obesity experts state that chromium supplements do not speed up metabolism or burn fat. Nutritionists generally advise that you should get enough chromium from a well-balanced diet. Good sources of chromium include liver, meat, cheese, wholegrains, brewer's yeast, and wine."

"circadian rhythm","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>circadian rhythm</b><div class=""content"">Circadian rhythms are cyclical changes that recur regularly over an approximately 24-hour cycle. They are a type of biological rhythm affecting many aspects of human life and should not be confused with ‘biorhythms’, a theory which has little scientific support.<br class=""nLine"" />Circadian rhythms ranging from cellular and tissue processes to whole-body functions, have been demonstrated in volunteers kept in experimentally controlled conditions (e.g. constant temperature and light). One of the best known circadian rhythms is the daily change in body core temperature. We tend to be at our coolest in the early morning and at our warmest in the late afternoon and early evening. Other circadian rhythms include arm and leg strength, heart rate, metabolic rate, wakefulness, and flexibility. It is not surprising, therefore, that the ability to perform many physical activities also follows a circadian rhythm. Several studies show that runners, cyclists, and swimmers perform best in the afternoon and early evening. In most cases (but by no means all) they performed better in the late afternoon (4.30 p.m.&ndash;5.30 p.m) than in the morning for both aerobic and anaerobic exercises of short to moderate duration. The peak probably corresponds to the time when body temperature is highest since muscles work better when warm. Although the variations in performance were usually small (3 per cent either side of the average), they can make a difference between the success and failure of athletes attempting to break records. Not all sports share the same circadian rhythm. Fencers, for example, seem to perform better in the middle of the day, perhaps because their sport demands mental skills which peak around noon. The results on endurance exercises have been less clear. Some studies have reported that peak performances occur later in the day, but others have shown no clear association between time of day and performance.<br class=""nLine"" />Circadian rhythms may be affected by personality and altered by environmental factors such as sleeplessness and travel. Introverts tend to perform better in the morning than extroverts. In addition, the circadian rhythms may be modified by the way people phase their normal habitual activities. Those who prefer to work in the morning (so-called ‘larks’ or morning types) may perform better early in the day than those who normally prefer to work in the evenings (‘owls’ or evening types). Long-distance travel to different time zones can alter circadian rhythms and impair sporting performance. Pistol shooters travelling from Britain to New Zealand took eight days to regain form. The following advice is given to athletes travelling to compete in a new time zone: <blockquote>•&nbsp;ensure that there is plenty of time to adjust to the new time zone<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;start the process of rhythm adjustment on the aircraft by resting and being active at times which match those at the destination<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;on arrival, sleep properly so that the rhythm can be reset quickly.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>"
"circuit training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>circuit training</b><div class=""content"">Circuit training is an intensive form of fitness training in which a group of exercises are completed one after the other. Each exercise is performed for a specified number of repetitions or for a prescribed time before you move on to the next exercise. Whether you are a swimmer, cyclist, rower, racket player, or runner, circuit training will improve your mobility and stamina, enabling you to move more powerfully.<br class=""nLine"" />Circuit training using weight machines improves aerobic fitness, flexibility, and strength. Each machine in the circuit is designed to exercise a different group of muscles. Individuals move from machine to machine completing a set of exercises, usually in a predetermined time. Generally there are between 6&ndash;15 stations to complete in a time of 5&ndash;20 minutes. Aerobic benefit is gained by moving swiftly between machines and completing the circuit as a continuous flow of activity. This keeps the heart rate at a steady and fairly high level.<br class=""nLine"" />Circuits without weights or with free standing weights usually consist of eight to ten exercises chosen from a large number of possible ones, such as pattering or running on the spot, press-ups, abdominal curl-ups, free squats, squat thrusts, step ups, and arm curls (figure 22). Each session should start with a warm-up and mobility exercises, and end with cool-down exercises. The circuit should be designed so that the same muscle groups are not worked in consecutive stations. In the following circuit each part of the body is worked twice: <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""<tr><td>1 total-body exercise:</td><td>e.g. ski-jumps</td></tr>

<tr><td>7 lower-body exercise:</td><td>e.g. free squats</td></tr>
<tr><td>8 trunk exercise:</td><td>e.g. back extensions.</td></tr></table></center> A complete session (warm-up, stretching, circuits, and cool down) should take about one hour. Generally, you should circuit train two to three times per week; circuit training should not be performed on consecutive days. <center class=""centre""><img src=""000050.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 22 A typical circuit</center><br class=""nLine"" />Circuit training is excellent for developing overall body strength and aerobic fitness. However, it is essential that the correct weights, repetitions and positions are established to avoid injury and to achieve all the fitness objectives. For serious athletes, the aim of the first training session is usually to establish the maximum number of repetitions that can be completed for each exercise, either to a point of exhaustion or in a given time. Each score is divided by three to determine the training rate for the exercise. At subsequent training sessions the athlete performs three circuits of all the exercises at the training rate. This rate can be adjusted as the athlete improves. Stage training is a variation of circuit training. Individuals perform exercises in sets, repeating the same exercise a number of times, before moving on to the next exercise. It tends to make more demands on the lactic acid system than traditional circuit training."

<b>clenbuterol</b><div class=""content"">A drug that has stimulatory effects similar to adrenaline and anabolic effects similar to steroids. As a stimulant, it is used to treat asthma, but it is sometimes misused to improve sporting performance. Because of this and its possible harmful effects (for example, clenbuterol is known to damage the hearts of laboratory rats) clenbuterol is on the International Olympic Committee list of substances banned during competition. There is growing concern, however, that it is still being misused outside competition periods to promote muscle growth and repair artificially. In the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, two British weight-lifters, Andrew Davies and Andrew Saxton, tested positive for clenbuterol and were sent home accused of drug abuse. They admitted taking the drug, but only outside the period of competition. They argued that this was not contrary to the IOC rules because, although an anabolic agent, it is not related chemically to the steroids, which are banned. They were subsequently cleared. The case illustrates the confusion surrounding the use of drugs in sport."
"climbing","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>climbing</b><div class=""content"">An activity gaining in popularity both as a recreation and a demanding sport. Outdoor climbing improves aerobic fitness and all-over body strength, but is particularly good for developing muscles in the hands, forearms, and shoulders. Good technique and flexibility can compensate for lack of strength. Some women, despite their relatively low strength, are outstanding climbers. In addition to its physical benefits, climbing also helps to develop courage and self-confidence. Apart from bruises, bumps, and scrapes, few injuries occur during outdoor climbs as long as climbers have the appropriate safety equipment and instruction.<br class=""nLine"" />Climbing has become accessible to many more people since the introduction of climbing walls at many sports centres. Unlike outdoor climbing, indoor climbing emphasizes anaerobic fitness. Usually the aim is to climb a wall as quickly as possible. This requires powerful bursts of activity and good upper body strength. Indoor climbing is used as training by outdoor climbers, by exercisers as part of a general fitness training programme, and to relieve stress. Many people in managerial positions find the total concentration required for a quick climb blocks out all their worries. They also find the physical effort and excitement invigorating. There is even less risk of injury in indoor climbs than outdoor climbing. It is rare to have a fall because climbers should be roped at all times. The most common injury is a strained finger tendon."
"clo unit","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

One clo unit is the thermal insulation required to keep a resting person comfortable at 21°C where relative humidity is less than 50 per cent and air movement is less than 6 metres per minute. It equates to a man wearing a three-piece suit and light underclothes. At -40°C, 12 clo units are required; light activity lowers this to 4 clo units."
"clothing","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>clothing</b><div class=""content"">Exercise has become extremely popular and sports clothes manufacturers have been quick to respond to consumer demand. Each sport has its own specific clothing requirements, but the most important consideration for the general exerciser is that clothes are comfortable, that they allow the body to breathe normally, and that they stretch to allow maximum freedom of movement. There is no need to buy expensive designer sports clothes, some of which are more suited to the poser than the exerciser. Loose-fitting cotton T-shirts, high-cut elasticated shorts, and one-piece leotards with tights which fit snugly over the legs are popular and fulfil the basic requirements. It is also important to wear a tracksuit or shell suit at the start and end of an exercise session to prevent chills. If the temperature is very low, the best way to keep warm is by wearing two or more layers of clothes. The inner layer should allow sweat to escape so that you will not get wet. The outer layer should be wind-resistant, waterproof, and ideally should also let sweat escape. Up to 40 per cent of body heat can be lost through the head, so you should wear a hat in cold weather. You should not overdress or you might overheat during exercise. It is a good idea to wear an outer layer which can be zipped open for quick cooling off.<br class=""nLine"" />Gloves are a very useful accessory for several sports. Weight-lifters use fingerless gloves to improve grip and to prevent blisters forming; cyclists use padded gloves to reduce the risk of injuring the delicate structures in the palm of the hand when gripping handlebars for long periods; and runners often put on thin woollen gloves to keep their hands warm in cold weather.<br class=""nLine"" />Probably the most important parts of the body to clothe properly are the feet. Padded socks made from cotton or a cotton-wool mixture absorb sweat and help protect the feet from blisters and other injuries. A wide range of footwear is available, but it is important to obtain shoes specifically designed for your activity and which suit your own requirements (see <a href=""entry://training shoes""><span class=""links"">training shoes</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />Those exercising as part of a weight reduction programme should avoid rubberized or plastic suits as they prevent heat loss and can be very dangerous. Despite claims to the contrary, these suits do not accelerate fat loss. See also <a href=""entry://clo unit""><span class=""links"">clo unit</span></a>."
"coach","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>coach</b>
<i>(instructor)</i><div class=""content"">Most top-class sports people and serious exercisers have a coach or instructor to help them improve their performance and reach their full potential. Good coaches act as motivators and teachers. Ideally, they should be able to convey both theoretical understanding and practical instruction, and they should be sympathetic to the requirements of those they coach.<br class=""nLine"" />The way a coach or physical fitness instructor works varies greatly. It usually reflects the coach's personality, ability, and experience, as well as the nature of the work, and the aspirations and personalities of those being coached.<br class=""nLine"" />The popular image of the coach, stereotyped in fiction and films, is often of a person who strives for excellence and fitness, and who presents a tough inflexible front to his charges. Some studies by sports sociologists have supported this image that many coaches are dominant; they are able to express aggression easily; they are not very interested in the dependency needs of others; and they are autocratic, often requiring unquestioning obedience. However, it is unclear whether this pattern of behaviour is a true reflection of personality or an attempt to act out the role imposed by society. Other studies have shown that coaches do not differ from other people in the way and extent to which they exploit situations and people. These studies showed that coaches exhibit a whole spectrum of behaviours, ranging from the autocratic described above, to the democratic, maintaining an open dialogue with their athletes about all aspects of their coaching.<br class=""nLine"" />Whatever behavioural style the coach adopts, most sports psychologists agree that compatibility between coach and athlete is a critical factor in the success and satisfaction of the athlete, so it is important to choose a coach who suits you."

Until recently it was thought that cobalt in humans was found only as a constituent of vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> (cobalamin), but it is now known to have a role in some enzymes. Sources of cobalt include liver, lean meat, poultry, fish and milk. Recommended intakes have not been established, but excessive intakes (29.5 mg per day), which were used to treat certain anaemias, have proved toxic. High doses of cobalt salts may also contribute to heart disease. This was a problem in the 1950s when cobalt salts were added to beer in Belgium and Canada to retain the head."
"cocaine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>cocaine</b><div class=""content"">An addictive drug that acts as a powerful stimulant on the central nervous system. Cocaine is an alkaloid derived from the leaves of the coca plant, <i>Erythroxylon coca</i>, which grows in the Andes. Because of the dangers inherent in administering the drug, there are no controlled experiments of cocaine's effects on athletic performance. Nevertheless, some athletes do take cocaine in the belief that it enhances performance. The drug makes them feel more euphoric, more alert, and physically less tired. Although speed of reflexes may be increased, cocaine abuse disturbs muscular coordination and distorts the athlete's perception of his or her ability. Other more serious side-effects include irregularities of heartbeat, high blood pressure, blockage of the coronary arteries, and mental seizures. Cocaine abuse is potentially fatal and is believed to have contributed to the deaths of several prominent American athletes, including the basketball star Len Bias and professional footballer Don Rogers in 1986, and the footballer Dave Waymer in 1993."

<i>(gluten intolerance; sprue)</i><div class=""content"">A digestive disorder caused by hypersensitivity to gluten, a mixture of two proteins found in wheat, barley, oats, and rye. The name ‘coeliac’ is derived from the Greek for ‘suffering in the bowels’. The condition is characterized by swelling of the intestinal wall and disappearance of the microvilli (the very fragile, highly folded membrane of some intestinal cells) in the presence of gluten. This results in impaired absorption of all nutrients (general malabsorption). Coeliac disease can be controlled by eating a strict and lifelong, gluten-free diet (i.e. a diet excluding wheat, barley, and rye products).

The body makes its own coenzyme Q in the liver, but manufacturers of the enzyme claim that the ability to do so may decline with age. Supplements may be useful to those who cannot make sufficient quantities of their own coenzyme Q.

There is some concern that exercising during a viral infection can worsen the disease and may, albeit rarely, lead to myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle which can in some cases cause sudden death). Studies on the effects of exercising during a viral infection are inconclusive, but it is generally agreed that it is safe for a person with a mild cold to continue with light to moderate levels of physical activity, provided the cold is not accompanied by a fever. A person with a body temperature higher than 38°C should not exercise."
"cold therapy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>cold therapy</b><div class=""content"">Indirect application of ice or a cold compress is often the first line of treatment for an acute sports injury. The low temperature decreases the metabolic rate of injured tissue and constricts blood vessels. Since most internal bleeding occurs a few minutes after an injury, immediate application of ice for about 10 minutes reduces bruising and swelling. The low temperature also stops muscle spasms and deadens pain receptors in the injured tissue. The painkilling effect of ice is sometimes too effective. A victim who feels no pain may return to activity prematurely and exacerbate the injury. See also <a href=""entry://RICE""><span class=""links"">RICE</span></a>."
"collagen","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>collagen</b><div class=""content"">Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body comprising up to 6 per cent of our total weight. It is one of the main constituents of skin, bones, tendons, cartilage, and ligaments, forming fibres that bind together and strengthen these tissues. Collagen (from the Greek, meaning ‘glue-maker’) is a remarkably strong material, having a tensile strength equal to that of light steel wire, but it is relatively inelastic.<br class=""nLine"" />As a person ages, the three-dimensional shape of collagen fibres changes, resulting in the formation of wrinkles. Collagen treatment has been available in Britain since 1984 to counteract this ageing process. Approximately 4000 people each year ask cosmetic surgeons to inject preparations of bovine collagen into their skin to remove wrinkles, creases, and folds. About 3 per cent of the women cannot have the treatment because of an allergic reaction, but for the others the treatment may remove wrinkles. However, the effects are short-lived as the collagen is usually reabsorbed into the body within 6 to 18 months.<br class=""nLine"" />Collagen from animal bones is extracted by boiling them to form a sticky resin from which gelatin can be extracted. Gelatin is, of course, edible and is used in jellies, some cheesecakes, and other foods as a gelling agent because it swells on contact with water."

When the comfort index is above 95 and the wind speed is low, it may be necessary to acclimatize to the conditions before attempting very strenuous activity; the presence of wind allows higher values to be tolerated."
"comfort zone","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>comfort zone</b><div class=""content"">The weather has marked effects on the ability of a person to exercise comfortably. The comfort zone is the range of temperatures and humidities within which people feel comfortable under calm wind conditions. In general, as temperature increases, tolerance to humidity decreases, and vice versa. For people adapted to most temperate regions, the comfort zone has air temperatures of 20&ndash;25°C and relative humidities between 25 and 75 per cent. In Britain, it is generally agreed that the optimum conditions for comfort are 15°C and 60 per cent relative humidity. Wind speed, however, has a great effect on the comfort zone. Increases in wind speed up to about 40 miles per hour lower the effective temperature, a phenomenon known as the wind-chill factor. When air temperature is 20°C and wind speed is 20 miles per hour, the effective temperature is -10°C, and -21°C when wind speed is 40 miles per hour."

<b>complex carbohydrate</b><div class=""content"">Complex carbohydrates are polysaccharides. They include starches and cellulose. The more complex a carbohydrate is, the longer it takes to digest and be absorbed; cellulose is not digested at all. Therefore foods containing complex digestible carbohydrates such as starches release their sugar constituents into the bloodstream over a long period. This makes them a good source of energy for endurance activities. Complex digestible carbohydrates are common in unrefined foods, such as wholemeal breads, potatoes, cereals, fruit, and vegetables, which are also rich in vitamins, minerals, and fibre.

"compression neuropathy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>compression neuropathy</b><div class=""content"">An inability to transmit nerve impulses because compression has damaged nerve fibres either directly, or indirectly by restricting their supply of oxygen. During cycling, the ulnar nerve in the palm of the hand is often compressed onto the handlebars leading to a loss of sensation and weakening of the hand, a condition known as ulnar compression syndrome. Compression neuropathy can lead to permanent paralysis of the hands. It is easily treated in its early stages by altering the hand position frequently and protecting the hands with tape or cycling gloves."
"compulsive overeating","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>compulsive overeating</b><div class=""content"">An addiction to eating large amounts of food even when not hungry. Compulsive eaters binge for pleasure rather than to satisfy nutritional needs. Such excessive eating usually leads to obesity.

"computerized tomography","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>computerized tomography</b><div class=""content"">An application of computer technology to radiography. It involves making X-ray images in layers or ‘cuts’ through the body. Computerized tomography provides excellent images of internal body structures. It is used as a diagnostic tool and also for research purposes (for example, to determine body composition). The technique is also called Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT scan)."
"concentration","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>concentration</b><div class=""content"">The ability to sustain attention and to focus on particular target stimuli. Concentration is an important skill for most sports activities. It can be learned and improved by specific training. Footballers and hockey players, for instance, play distraction games in which one person has to try to concentrate on performing a skill while others try to distract him or her.<br class=""nLine"" />A wide range of factors can affect concentration. Eating a heavy meal, very high levels of noise, and anxiety can reduce concentration. The morning is the best time to concentrate on complex tasks which rely on memory (see <a href=""entry://circadian rhythm""><span class=""links"">circadian rhythm</span></a>). It is difficult to sustain concentration at any time on tasks that are too simple, too complicated, or too repetitive."

"concussion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>concussion</b>
<i>(knockout)</i><div class=""content"">A sudden, transient loss of consciousness due to a blow to the head. The blow produces mechanical acceleration and deceleration forces that act on the brain. This impairs mental function, and can cause confusion. Concussion may last a few minutes or a few hours and is often accompanied by pallor, slowness, feebleness of heartbeat, shallow breathing, and reduction in reflex responses.<br class=""nLine"" />Individuals suffering from concussion are usually advised to avoid body-contact activities for at least three weeks. In some sports, such as Rugby Union football, this lay-off period is mandatory. Boxers suffering from concussion after being knocked out in the ring may also be required to avoid boxing for a time. In Britain, amateur boxers are not allowed in the ring again until 28 days after the first knockout, 84 days after the second knockout, and 1 year after the third knockout. In the USA, many team physicians in contact sports follow the ‘1&ndash;2&ndash;3’ rule: one concussion and the player is removed from the game; two concussions results in the player missing the rest of the season; and after three concussions the player is advised to stop completely."
"conditioning","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>conditioning</b><div class=""content"">Activities that exercise the whole body to improve overall physical fitness, especially aerobic fitness, muscle strength, and flexibility. Conditioning is not primarily concerned with developing a skill. For athletes, it forms part of the preparation period of their training programme. Conditioning enables an athlete to become fit enough to cope with specific training which may be physically very demanding."
"confidence","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>confidence</b><div class=""content"">A belief and a self-assurance in one's own abilities. In competitive sport, confidence includes having an expectation of success. Very often the most successful sports people have high levels of confidence, but it is situation-specific: e.g. a person who is highly confident when playing tennis may not be confident when swimming.<br class=""nLine"" />Lack of confidence is thought to be an important factor in the development of some eating disorders (see <a href=""entry://anorexia nervosa""><span class=""links"">anorexia nervosa</span></a> and <a href=""entry://bulimia nervosa""><span class=""links"">bulimia nervosa</span></a>). One of the main ways of treating such disorders is to boost self-confidence."
"conjunctivitis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>conjunctivitis</b><div class=""content"">Inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin protective membrane lining the eyelids and covering the front surface of the eye. Conjunctivitis may be due to a viral or bacterial infection, or chemical irritation. Bacterial infections can cause pus to form. Such purulent infections can be exacerbated by exercise. Chlorine in swimming pool water commonly acts as a chemical irritant resulting in conjunctivitis, similar to that caused by bacterial infections. Wearing goggles offers protection against this condition."
"connective tissue","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>connective tissue</b><div class=""content"">A tissue found in all parts of the body. Its functions include support, storage, and protection. All types of connective tissue have a good blood supply. Most types, especially bones, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, are strengthened by collagen fibres. This enables the tissues to endure high levels of abuse from physical trauma and abrasions. Adipose tissue is a fairly loose connective tissue that is not very strong. Its main function is to store fat."

"constipation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>constipation</b><div class=""content"">Contrary to popular opinion, you are not constipated if you do not pass faeces once a day. Constipation exists only when bowel movements are difficult or accompanied by discomfort, and if there is failure to empty the bowels at least three days in succession. Many people who are not constipated, but who believe that daily bowel movements are important, resort to using laxatives to achieve their objective. Laxatives, however, may disrupt normal bowel reflexes and cause true constipation. Fluid losses associated with laxatives may also contribute to dehydration and induce abdominal cramps which restrict physical activity.<br class=""nLine"" />Changes of environment and diet, or inactivity can lead to intermittent bouts of constipation. Chronic constipation is often linked to low dietary fibre. It can affect physical performance and make a person feel unwell. Risk of constipation can be reduced by: <blockquote>•&nbsp;eating high fibre foods, such as fruits, vegetables (especially legumes), and unrefined cereals<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;drinking plenty of fluids, at least eight glasses or cups a day<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;exercising regularly.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> Constipation lasting more than a week warrants seeking medical advice, because it can be a symptom of an underlying disorder."

"contact sport","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>contact sport</b><div class=""content"">Any sport in which the impact of one person against another is an inherent part of the sport. Contact sports include boxing, football (especially American football and rugby), ice hockey, lacrosse, martial arts, and wrestling. Contact sports carry a high risk of injury and some people are advised not to take part in them: for example, those with a history of epileptic seizures triggered by a collision, and those suffering from certain contagious skin infections (e.g. impetigo, herpes, scabies, and boils). It is also unwise for any injured person to compete in a contact sport until completely recovered (see <a href=""entry://concussion""><span class=""links"">concussion</span></a>)."
"continuous exercise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>continuous exercise</b><div class=""content"">Aerobic exercise performed to completion at a steady pace without any periods of rest. It is also called continuous training or continuous work. The most popular forms of continuous exercise at low to moderate intensity are walking and jogging. They tend to have less drop out rates than more intensive, anaerobic forms of exercise. Compare <a href=""entry://interval training""><span class=""links"">interval training</span></a>."
"contraception","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>contraception</b><div class=""content"">The contraceptive pill contains chemicals that prevent fertilization of the ovum by a sperm. Other options for preventing unwanted pregnancies include abstinence (not popular with many!); the rhythm method, which restricts sexual intercourse to periods when the chances of conception are low; barrier methods, such as condoms, a diaphragm or sponge; and intrauterine devices. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages so it is important to obtain comprehensive advice from a doctor when deciding which form of contraception to use.<br class=""nLine"" />Little is known about the effects of most contraceptives on athletic performance although some women endurance athletes found that their weight increased when they took steroid contraceptive pills. New low-dose oral contraceptives have much lower hormone concentrations than the older pills. Their side-effects (e.g. weight gain) have been greatly reduced. However, many athletes are still wary of using these pills because there have been reports that they reduce maximal oxygen consumption and aerobic power. Also, some athletes still believe that use of such pills may lead to weight increase and fluid retention.<br class=""nLine"" />Contraceptive pills containing steroids are sometimes taken by athletes to control the menstrual cycle so that blood flow does not coincide with important competitions. The onset of a period can be delayed for up to 10 days. The potential health risks of this practice are not known but women are advised not to engage in it repeatedly."

"contraindicated","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>contraindicated</b><div class=""content"">A contraindicated procedure, technique, or exercise is one that is inadvisable or undesirable. Contraindicated exercises include any which pull a body part out of alignment, or force the body beyond its normal limits. An exercise may also be contraindicated for an individual because of a medical condition; for example, strenuous exercise and isometric exercises are contraindicated for people with serious heart disease. Several ballistic stretching exercises that have been practised for years and advocated in popular magazines and books, are now known to be contraindicated for most people (figure 23). These include standing toe touches and sit-ups performed with straight legs (an abdominal curl-up with legs bent is much safer and more effective at developing abdominal muscles). As a general rule: <blockquote>•&nbsp;do not overstretch the upper back and neck (e.g. avoid the plough)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;do not hyperextend the lower back (e.g. avoid straight leg sit-ups)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;do not hyperextend the neck (e.g. avoid neck circling)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;do not flex the knee joint more than ninety degrees (e.g. avoid deep squatting)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;do not perform exercises that cause muscle imbalance (e.g. avoid strengthening pectorals at the front of the chest without also strengthening the rhomboids and trapezius muscles at the back).<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>

"contrast baths","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>contrast baths</b><div class=""content"">A common treatment for sports injuries, such as a sprained ankle. Two baths or basins are used, one filled with hot water and the other filled with cold water. Plunging the injured part into the baths alternately stimulates blood supply to the immersed part, accelerates metabolic processes, decreases pain, and increases the elasticity of the ligaments. The ratio of heating time to cooling time is adjusted according to the likelihood of creating tissue swelling. Short periods in the hot water and longer periods in the cold water are used for acute injuries."
"control group","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>control group</b><div class=""content"">When the safety and effectiveness of a diet or exercise are tested, it is important to ensure that the observations are due to the factors under consideration, and not to any other coincidental factor. It is necessary to compare the results of at least two groups of subjects: one (the experimental group) is subjected to the factor under consideration, while the other (the control group) matches the experimental group in all aspects except that the factor under investigation is kept at a constant level (often zero). Incorporating adequate controls is an essential part of the design of scientific investigations. It is also one of the most difficult aspects, and many studies of the effects of diet and exercise lack adequate controls, making their results suspect.

"conversational index","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>conversational index</b><div class=""content"">The conversational index is reached when an exerciser can no longer hold a conversation because the supply of oxygen is only enough to meet the demands of the exercise. It is an approximate indicator of the upper limit of aerobic exercise (see also <a href=""entry://anaerobic threshold""><span class=""links"">anaerobic threshold</span></a>)."
"cool down","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>cool down</b>
<i>(warm down)</i><div class=""content"">Most people are aware of the importance of warming up before exercise. It is also important to cool down afterwards. When you stop exercising suddenly, blood vessels contract and the waste products of exercise become trapped in muscles. One function of the cool down is to help eliminate these products, such as lactic acid, and to reduce the risk of muscle stiffness. Another function is to allow body temperature to return to normal and lessen the risk of chills. Cool down procedures vary, but they usually involve a gradual reduction in activity which includes jogging (or slow swimming), and static or slow stretches to reduce muscle tension and maintain flexibility. Low intensity activities maintain the flow of blood through muscles so that the waste products can be carried away. They also enable the body to adjust gradually from exercise to rest.

"Cooper twelve-minute test","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Cooper twelve-minute test</b><div class=""content"">A test of aerobic fitness in which the total distance a subject runs in twelve minutes is recorded. The Cooper twelve-minute test is a maximal test. The subject must run to exhaustion if the results are to be reliable. A variation of the test is based on the time taken for a subject to run 1.5 miles. Although the exact fitness rating will depend on age and sex, men covering 1.5 miles in 12&ndash;13 minutes and women doing the same distance in 14&ndash;15 minutes are generally regarded as having a good level of aerobic fitness."
"coordination","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>coordination</b><div class=""content"">Coordination is one of the main components of physical fitness. It is the ability to perform smooth and accurate movements involving different parts of the body. It requires good awareness of relative limb and body positions, and good integration between the senses and muscles involved in the movement. Ball juggling is regarded as a good way to develop eye to hand coordination."
"copper","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>copper</b><div class=""content"">An essential element involved in many processes including red blood cell formation, respiration, and bone formation. Copper deficiencies are rare, mainly because most domestic water supplies are contaminated with copper from pipes, but low intakes can lead to anaemia. Oysters and liver are good sources of dietary copper. In the UK, the adult Reference Nutrient Intake for copper is 1.2 mg each day. In the USA, the estimated safe and adequate daily intake of copper is 1.5&ndash;3.0 mg. Blood levels of copper often decrease after exercise indicating that athletes may need higher than normal intakes. Copper and zinc appear to be antagonistic; high intakes of one tend to reduce the absorption of the other. Copper toxicity is rare, but intakes greater than 20 mg cause vomiting and nausea."
"core temperature","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>core temperature</b><div class=""content"">Temperature in the part of the body containing the vital organs (the brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys). The core temperature is measured internally (e.g. in the rectum or oesophagus) and it usually remains within a narrow range, between 36.5 and 37.5°C. This is the temperature at which the majority of the chemical reactions in the body work most efficiently. During exercise, heat is generated and the muscle temperature may rise to 39 or even 40°C. Skeletal muscle functions best at 38.5°C. See also <a href=""entry://hyperthermia""><span class=""links"">hyperthermia</span></a> and <a href=""entry://hypothermia""><span class=""links"">hypothermia</span></a>."
"corn","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>corn</b><div class=""content"">A hard pad of skin that develops on or between the toes as a result of friction or pressure. It is often caused by shoes that do not fit properly. The corn has a small fluid sac below the hard pad that allows the pad to slide back and forth without damaging the underlying tissue. Pressure on top of the corn (e.g. from a shoe) pushes it downward causing pain. Corns can be treated with warm water or other softening agents. Also, the pressure on the corn can be relieved by using specially designed pads. Radical treatment by surgical resectioning of the bone underlying the corn, is generally reserved for very difficult cases that do not respond to other forms of treatment."
"coronary heart disease","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>coronary heart disease</b><div class=""content"">Malfunction of the heart caused by blockage of one of the arteries supplying the heart muscle. Coronary heart disease has been linked to unhealthy eating and lack of exercise. In the USA more than 500 000 people die from coronary heart disease each year. In Britain, it is responsible for one in four of all deaths. More than 800 people a day suffer heart attacks and it costs the National Health Service more than 700 million pounds a year to treat them.<br class=""nLine"" />The disease is not confined to the elderly. Children as young as seven years old can have abnormal electrocardiograms indicating the beginnings of heart disease. These abnormalities are thought to be linked to the children's lack of exercise: in the UK, about a third of 10-year-olds walk continuously for less than 10 minutes a week. Most are transported to school by car and spend a lot of their leisure time in front of a television or computer screen.<br class=""nLine"" />A new test has been devised to screen children's susceptibility to the disease. It involves tying a tight band round a child's arm or leg. When the band is removed, there is a sudden increase in pressure, causing the artery to expand. The degree of expansion is measured using ultrasound. Slow or restricted expansion is believed to be an early warning sign of artery disease that may develop into a fatal condition in later life.<br class=""nLine"" />The risk of succumbing to a coronary heart disease at any age is reduced by regular aerobic exercise and a healthy diet. Physically active people have a lower incidence of the disease. Health experts in the USA estimate that 30 000 deaths would not occur each year if more people engaged in regular exercise. As little as 5&ndash;10 miles (8&ndash;16 km) walking or jogging each week can offer some protection against heart disease."
"coronary heart disease risk factor","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>coronary heart disease risk factor</b><div class=""content"">A factor that increases the risk of suffering a coronary heart disease. The factors include: <blockquote>•&nbsp; age<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;family history of heart disease<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;high blood pressure<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;high blood cholesterol level<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;high stress<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;lack of exercise<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;obesity<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;tobacco smoking.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><br class=""nLine"" />Males, particularly those who are baldheaded, are at greater risk than females. Of these factors, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are the three major risk factors which operate independently of the others. This means they influence the risk of heart disease whatever other factors are involved. Age, sex, and family history (i.e. genetic factors, as yet ill-defined) have the greatest effect on coronary heart disease, but they are beyond an individual's control. The three independent factors are controllable. Smoking can be avoided. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels can be reduced by eating a well-balanced, healthy diet, and by taking exercise. Experts generally agree that the risk of heart disease can be reduced by eating less salt and fat (particularly saturated fat), and by eating more fibre. It may also be beneficial to eat less sugar. The exercise should be regular (at least three times a week), vigorous, (but not overstrenuous), and aerobic. Such exercise does not guarantee immunity, but exercisers are less likely to have a heart attack than those who are inactive."
"coronary-prone personality","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>coronary-prone personality</b><div class=""content"">The personality of an individual whose patterns of behaviour are thought to increase the risk of suffering a coronary heart disease. Such an individual is usually highly aggressive and competitive, and always seems to be in a hurry to get things completed. This pattern of behaviour is sometimes called type A behaviour, but recent research suggests that only particular aspects of type A behaviour are related to coronary heart disease."
"corticosteroids","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>corticosteroids</b><div class=""content"">Hormones released from the outer part of the adrenal gland (adrenal cortex). Drugs similar to corticosteroids are produced synthetically. There are two main groups of corticosteroids: glucocorticoids are essential for carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism; and mineralocorticoids which are involved in salt and water balance. The glucocorticoids are also powerful anti-inflammatories and painkillers, normally involved in reactions to stress. Synthetic glucocorticoids are used to treat sports injuries. They are administered in and around damaged muscles, tendons, or joints. They are not given directly into damaged structures because of the risk of weakening them and hindering the healing process. Except under certain conditions, use of artificial corticosteroids is banned by the International Olympic Committee and many other sports federations."
"cortisone","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

"counter-conditioning","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>counter-conditioning</b><div class=""content"">A method of reducing stress. When a person is faced with a potentially stressful situation, counter-conditioning attempts to replace unpleasant feelings of anxiety with pleasant feelings.

"cramp","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>cramp</b><div class=""content"">A sudden, uncoordinated, prolonged spasm in a muscle, causing it to become taut and excruciatingly painful. Cramps commonly occur in the calf, thigh, and hip muscles after strenuous exercise. As yet, there is no complete explanation for their development. Several causes have been suggested including muscle damage, dehydration, low blood glucose levels, and restriction of the blood supply to the muscles. Exercisers are more likely to suffer cramps if they are out of condition, wear low-heel shoes, or do not take enough fluids and electrolytes during exercise (see also <a href=""entry://heat cramps""><span class=""links"">heat cramps</span></a>). Cramps are often relieved by gentle static stretching, gentle massage, and rest. To reduce the risk of cramps: <blockquote>•&nbsp;warm up properly; include static stretching<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;increase exercise intensity gradually during a workout<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;take it easy when performing a new type of workout<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;drink plenty of fluids before and after exercise.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>"
"crash diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>crash diet</b><div class=""content"">A diet designed to produce a dramatic decrease in body weight in a short time. Losses may be as high as 3 kg (more than 6 lb) in the first 3 days, but much of this loss is water rather than fat. This is because water is associated with carbohydrate stored in the body as glycogen. Crash diets are usually high in protein and low in carbohydrate, resulting in a reduction of glycogen and its associated water. The weight lost due to water losses is regained when the dieter returns to a balanced diet with normal levels of carbohydrate.<br class=""nLine"" />Some crash diets do result in reduced body fat, but usually lean tissue is also lost. It can be dangerous to lose lean tissue from vital organs. When the dieter returns to a normal calorific intake, weight is more likely to be regained as fatty tissue than as lean tissue. Fatty tissue has a lower metabolic rate, consuming less calories, so that the dieter is likely to gain more weight than before the diet started. See also <a href=""entry://Yo-Yo diet""><span class=""links"">Yo-Yo diet</span></a>."
"creatine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>creatine</b><div class=""content"">A chemical made naturally in the body from amino acids readily obtained from meat and fish. Inside the body, creatine is involved in energy expenditure during exercise. Much of it is phosphorylated (i.e. a phosphate group is added to it) to form phosphocreatine, an energy-rich compound used by muscles during very short bursts of explosive activity (see <a href=""entry://phosphagen system""><span class=""links"">phosphagen system</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />The average person's body has about 120 grams of creatine; 98 per cent in the muscles, 1.5 per cent in nervous tissue, and 0.5 per cent in other organs. The recommended intake is about a gram a day.<br class=""nLine"" />Studies have shown that dosages of about 24&ndash;30 g of creatine per day for two days can raise the level of phosphocreatine stored in muscle, increasing the energy available for high intensity exercise where there is a short recovery between bouts of activity. When individuals performed multiple sprints of 10&ndash;15 seconds duration with less than 30 seconds recovery between each sprint, then after the 6th, 7th, or 8th sprint those who consumed creatine were not so fatigued as those who took a placebo. Creatine supplementation increased power output by as much as 7 per cent in high intensity exercise of an intermittent nature, but there is no evidence that it improves peak power output or sprint ability in a continuous sprint. A dosage of 24 to 30 g per day is equivalent to eating approximately 6 kg (13lb) of beef. Ingesting so much meat would create dietary problems, so a pure form of creatine has been produced as a supplement. Further research has shown that the greatest improvements in short-term performance occur if exercise is performed immediately after taking the supplement, and the improvements are retained longer if relatively small doses of creatine are ingested over a long period of time.<br class=""nLine"" />Creatine supplements have been used by a number of successful sports people, including the Cambridge University crew who won the 1993 boat race, and many competitors at the Barcelona Olympics. However, there is concern that the large amounts consumed by athletes may put their health at risk because kidney failure can occur if too much creatinine (the end product of creatine metabolism) is excreted after muscle damage."

It is often assumed that you do not have to be very fit to play cricket. This is a misconception. Fast bowlers, batsmen running between the wickets, and fielders chasing a ball have to be able to move suddenly, extremely quickly, and powerfully for brief amounts of time. This pattern of inactivity followed by dynamic movement carries a high risk of injury. Fast bowlers are particularly vulnerable if they are unfit or if their running and bowling technique is poor. Injuries of the shoulders, back, knees, and ankles are common. The risk of injury can be reduced if players are in good physical condition; if they warm up and perform stretching exercises before playing; and if they keep mobile during periods of relative inactivity."
"Crohn's disease","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Crohn's disease</b><div class=""content"">A disease that results in local inflammation of the gut wall, usually the ileum. Acute inflammations can mimic appendicitis. Chronic inflammation causes abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and malabsorption of nutrients. Treatment includes anti-inflammatories (commonly corticosteroids), or surgical removal of the offending portion of the gut. Sufferers of the disease usually perform badly in sports because of the nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption, but those who have been treated successfully can lead a fully active life."

"cross-training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>cross-training</b><div class=""content"">A training programme involving more than one type of aerobic activity; for example, one that combines running, swimming, and cycling. Cross-training is an integral part of the preparation for a triathlon. Many exercisers also use cross-training to develop all-round fitness. For example, swimming combined with running develops muscles of the upper and lower body respectively. Many people cross-train to improve their cardiovascular fitness needed for endurance activities. However, the effects gained from one activity are not readily transferred to another. For example, training on a stationary cycle for several weeks may improve your cycling by a significant amount, but it is unlikely to improve your running or swimming by the same amount. This demonstrates the importance of specific training; to improve endurance for running, for example, the best training is running. Nevertheless, many runners cross-train, exercising in water when they are recovering from muscle injuries that would be exacerbated by the high impact of running. Other elite, single-activity athletes cross-train to add variety to their training programmes and to improve fitness components not developed by their main activity."

"crunch programme","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>crunch programme</b><div class=""content"">A programme of exercises designed to correct postural misalignments, particularly in the back, and to tone the abdominal or stomach muscles. The abdominals help to stabilize the torso and can be used to draw the ribcage and pelvis together in a ‘crunching’ movement. The exercises in a crunch programme specifically emphasize this action so that the abdominals are strengthened. It is claimed that properly performed crunches reduce lower back injuries because the abdominals work in opposition to the lower back muscles, helping to relieve them of excess stress and strain. There are several forms of crunching, but a typical crunch is described below. <br class=""nLine"" /><i>❏Lie on your back on the floor. Your knees should be bent and the soles of your feet on the floor. Rest your hands on your abdomen so that you can feel the muscles contract as you perform the crunch. Exhale and pull your abdomen in and up as you slowly round your spine forward to lift your shoulders and ribcage off the floor and towards your pelvis (the ‘crunch’ movement). Lift only as far as you are able without straining. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals a little, hold the position for a few seconds, then relax, inhale and return to the start position. During the whole exercise, keep your middle and lower back in contact with the floor to stabilize the pelvis and protect the back.</i>"

The training programme usually starts with a cycle devoted to general conditioning, then it gradually progresses through cycles of increasing intensity in which training becomes more specifically directed towards the targeted activity. Macrocycles are the main periods of training, e.g. off-season, pre-season, competition, and recovery (transition) cycles. Mesocycles are phases of training within macrocycles. There might be a mesocycle for general conditioning, another for strength training, and a third for speed work. Microcycles refer to daily and weekly training sessions and are described in terms of the type of exercise, its intensity and duration. Cycle training is the US equivalent of periodization."
"cycling","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>cycling</b><div class=""content"">Cycling has always been a popular activity in northern Europe and it has recently been taken up by an increasing number of people in North America. It is estimated that more than 85 million people in the United States ride bicycles. One of the main attractions of cycling is that the bicycle keeps the body weight off load-bearing joints, so that cyclists are less prone to ankle and knee injuries than joggers or runners. A number of studies have shown that cycling is as effective as running for developing aerobic fitness. Although cycling uses mainly the large lower body muscles, the upper body is also used to steady the cyclist in the saddle and transmit extra drive to the legs. This may explain why echocardiographs (images of the heart produced from ultrasound waves) indicate that trained cyclists have a significantly greater heart-muscle mass than trained runners.<br class=""nLine"" />The major disadvantage of outdoor cycling is the danger of being in collision with other road users. In the United States, cycling injuries accounted for over 500 000 hospital emergency visits and 1300 deaths in 1985. The most common cause of serious disability was head injury. The use of cycle helmets significantly reduces the severity of head injuries but unfortunately many people, especially children, are reluctant to wear them. Unless you can cycle in an area where the air is relatively clean, another disadvantage of outdoor cycling is the risk of breathing in noxious chemicals, especially from vehicle exhaust fumes. So, as well as a helmet, you might want to wear an anti-pollution mask which prevents air pollutants from getting deep into your lungs.<br class=""nLine"" />The dangers of cycling outside can be avoided by using a stationary indoor machine but, much of the appeal of outdoor cycling, the scenery and the sense of speed, will be lost. Before buying a home exercise bike, be sure that you really want it. Less than one quarter of long-term owners use their bikes three or more times a week. Many regular users make indoor cycling more enjoyable by watching television or listening to the radio while they pedal. If you do decide to buy an indoor bike it should have the following features: <blockquote>•&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">VARIABLE RESISTANCE</small>. You should be able to change easily from a low level of exercise for warming up and cooling down, to a higher level during a workout. You should also be able to increase the level of the workout progressively as you become fitter<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">STURDINESS</small>. The bike should be strong and well constructed so that it is stable when you sit on it and when you are pedalling fast. It should stand up to the wear and tear of regular use over a long time<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">ADJUSTABILITY</small>. You should be able to adjust the seat and handle-bar height to suit your own individual requirement.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><br class=""nLine"" /> Whether cycling indoors or outdoors, you should always stretch before you start and finish a cycle ride. You should also cycle gently for about 5 minutes at the beginning and end of each ride to ensure that your muscles are adequately warmed up before you cycle hard and to cool them down afterwards."

<b>dehydration</b><div class=""content"">Dehydration (loss of fluids from the body) is a hazard in many sports and can be a serious medical problem. It is also a problem associated with some weight loss techniques, such as steam baths, plastic sweat suits, and diuretic pills (water tablets). Dehydration can result in overheating, a potentially dangerous lowering of blood pressure, and a reduction in the rate at which blood is pumped out of the heart. These effects can lead to illness, heat stroke, and even death. Dehydration can occur during exercise when the amount of fluid lost through sweating is greater than fluid replacement through drinking. It can cause poor performances even in temperate climates. A 2 per cent loss of body weight due to water loss, can lead to a 20 per cent drop in the working capacity of muscles. Dehydration reduces both the speed and strength of muscular contractions. To minimize the risk, water should be freely available during exercise and competitive sports.

"deinhibition training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>deinhibition training</b><div class=""content"">A potentially dangerous form of training performed by some weight-lifters and body-builders. Usually, when the mechanical strain on muscles exceeds a threshold level, stretch receptors are stimulated and the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) inhibits further muscle activity. This is an important safety mechanism designed to prevent muscles from being overstretched, but it tends to stop them from working to their full capacity.<br class=""nLine"" />Deinhibition training aims to remove the inhibition, enabling muscles to work with greater loads, thus accelerating strength development. It requires high amplitude or explosive movements that stretch muscles and tendons fully. However, with the natural safety mechanism removed, the risk of overstretching and damaging nerves, muscles, and tendons is high. This form of training is definitely not suitable for a beginner."

The deltoids (delts) take part in all movements of the upper arm, but their main action is to abduct the shoulder, lifting the arm sideways away from the midline of the body. They also rotate the arm: the anterior fibres rotating the arm inwards and the posterior fibres rotating it outwards. The deltoids are particularly active during rhythmic swinging movements of the arms during walking, and during the propulsive phase of the front crawl.

"detoxication","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>detoxication</b>
<i>(detoxification)</i><div class=""content"">Detoxication and detoxification are used synonymously when referring to the process whereby toxins (poisons) are removed or toxic effects neutralized. Detoxification also refers to the withdrawal process for those who are addicted to alcohol and drugs such as opiates.<br class=""nLine"" />Natural foods often contain toxins. Wild potatoes, for example, contain glycoalkaloids that cause vomiting, diarrhoea, and nervous disorders (see <a href=""entry://solanine""><span class=""links"">solanine</span></a>). Over thousands of years, we have evolved biological and cultural methods of avoiding toxicity, and metabolic reactions that reduce the toxicity of ingested compounds. We grow less toxic varieties of food and prepare them in ways that reduce their toxicity. We have learnt to avoid foods that make us ill, and to be attracted by those that do not. We also share with other primates the habit of nibbling at strange food and leaving it a while to see if there are any ill-effects. If these cultural and behavioural adaptations fail us and food toxins enter the bloodstream, our livers provide another line of defence. The liver produces a wide range of detoxication enzymes, the best known of which is alcohol dehydrogenase. The toxins are often converted to substances that can be eliminated in the bile or urine. This elimination is helped if the toxin makes us feel thirsty so that we drink plenty of water.<br class=""nLine"" />If, despite all our efforts, toxins accumulate in our bodies, we are likely to suffer from toxicity and feel ill. Some people believe that the risk of toxicity has increased because our food is becoming overloaded with artificial chemicals. Some of these chemicals may be fatsoluble toxins which are stored in adipose (fatty) tissue. They do not harm vital organs until they are released when the fat is broken down.<br class=""nLine"" />Several diets are designed to promote detoxication. Many claims made for ‘detox diets’, however, are exaggerated. They are based on the unfounded assumption that most normal foods are toxic in some way. There is little scientific support for such diets. Some of these diets are based on the belief that fruit, vegetables, and yoghurt are virtually free of toxins, while meat and fish are high in them. Although this may be the case for artificial toxins (it will depend on the source of the food and how it has been treated), there tends to be higher levels of natural toxins in plant products than in meat and fish. Some detox diets claim that they contain enzymes or other chemicals that act as detoxication agents. Again, there is little scientific support for these claims.<br class=""nLine"" />Most doctors believe that our bodies are usually quite capable of eliminating toxins from a normal, balanced diet without the need for extreme measures. Sensible eating of a variety of foods helps you avoid toxicity. A diet with sufficient vitamins and minerals enables your liver to function efficiently, and certain components in a well-balanced diet, such as water-soluble fibre found in oat bran, bind to some toxins helping the body to eliminate them."

"diabetes","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>diabetes</b><div class=""content"">Diabetes is the commonly used abbreviation for the medical condition diabetes mellitus, a disorder characterized by an increased blood sugar level. This may be due to the body's inability to produce enough insulin (called Type I diabetes, insulin-dependent diabetes, or juvenileonset diabetes), or an inability to use insulin properly (called Type II diabetes, adult-onset diabetes, insulin-independent diabetes, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes). In addition to high blood glucose levels, diabetes results in a depression of carbohydrate utilization. This causes the formation of ketones in the liver, toxic chemicals which damage the nervous system and may lead to convulsions and a diabetic coma.<br class=""nLine"" />Type I diabetes develops primarily in young people under 30 years and accounts for about 10 per cent of diabetics. Signs and symptoms include weakness and fatigue, irritability, nausea, thirst, and frequent passing of urine. Type I diabetics frequently suffer extreme hunger and weight loss. Consequently, they are typically lean or have a normal body weight. If left untreated, they often have abnormally high levels of potentially toxic ketones in their blood. To counter the pancreas's lack of insulin production, Type I diabetics take artificial insulin to maintain blood glucose concentrations within the normal range. Regular physical activity has been shown to help Type I diabetics control their blood glucose levels. It also reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases.<br class=""nLine"" />Type II diabetes results from a resistance to insulin. It usually develops gradually in people over 40. Its development is sometimes linked to obesity. One of the highest incidence of Type II diabetes in the world is among a group of people in a district of Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea. In the past, fat was usually in short supply, so it is believed that the people evolved a genetic ability to store fat in times of plenty. This may have predisposed them to diabetes when they adopted a Western, high fat diet. In type II diabetes, the production of insulin by the pancreas may be normal or even greater than normal, but the liver and muscle cells become relatively insensitive to the hormone. Primary treatment of Type II diabetics includes diet and exercise to achieve a desirable body weight, and to control blood glucose. Development of Type II diabetes is less likely in those who lead physically active lives, and physical activity is generally recommended as an effective means of managing the disease. The risk of Type II diabetes falls by about 6 per cent for every 500 Calories of energy expended per week (approximately equivalent to jogging or swimming for an hour). Regular aerobic exercise reduces the concentration of insulin in blood serum, and increases the sensitivity of the cells to insulin. This increased sensitivity applies to diabetics as well as non-diabetics: sedentary diabetics require about 0.5&ndash;1.0 insulin units per kilogram; exercising diabetics require 0.5&ndash;0.6 units. Exercise may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications. The protection provided by exercise is greatest among obese and elderly people, and those with a family history of diabetes.<br class=""nLine"" />Although exercise may benefit diabetics, it also presents some dangers. Overexertion may cause hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) and, paradoxically, in Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetics, it can result in hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose) because the exercise reduces insulin production. Clearly, vigorous exercise may not be safe unless blood glucose levels are well controlled. Certain types of high impact exercise, such as road running, may also harm diabetics who have a decrease in the sensory nerve function of their feet. Diabetics who suffer from some degeneration of the retina should avoid exercises, such as weight lifting, that raise the pressure in the eye, increasing the risk of further damage to the retina.<br class=""nLine"" />Treatment of diabetes includes a diet, carefully controlled so that it provides just the right amount of carbohydrate for the body's needs. If adhered to, the diet can prevent some long-term complications of diabetes. Oral hypoglycaemic agents or administration of insulin may be needed to lower blood glucose levels."

It can result from bacterial or viral infection, from eating contaminated food and drink, from high intake of sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, or from extreme physical exertion and exhaustion. Water in the digestive tract is usually reabsorbed through the intestinal walls, but during a bout of diarrhoea this process is disturbed. Diarrhoea usually resolves itself in one or two days, but it can cause dehydration which limits physical activity. The dehydration can be especially severe and dangerous in the very young and elderly. The most important treatment is to drink plenty of fluid to restore the water balance. Salt and water may need to be added to water to make rehydration effective and to replace losses of mineral salts, especially in young children. Diarrhoea which lasts more than 48 hours, or which recurs, requires medical attention. See also <a href=""entry://traveller's diarrhoea""><span class=""links"">traveller's diarrhoea</span></a>."

"diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>diet</b><div class=""content"">The word diet comes from the Greek word ‘diaita’, used in the past to refer to a person's whole mode of life. Today, the term diet is usually restricted to people's eating and drinking habits: their daily pattern of eating, the quality and quantity of their food, and the frequency of eating. To many people the word means a prescribed allowance or selection of food for some specific purpose. In this sense, a diet may be used to control weight or for health reasons. Weight control diets may be used to maintain a constant weight, to gain weight, or to lose weight. Most people, however, think of diets as restrictive and aimed at weight loss. Around 15 million people in the UK are on some kind of weight-loss diet. These diets are rarely successful. One sports nutritionist estimated that 95 per cent of those who go on a strict diet to lose weight quickly not only regain the weight within a year, but also regain proportionately more fat than muscle.

"diet induced thermogenesis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>diet induced thermogenesis</b>
<i>(thermic effect of food)</i><div class=""content"">When we have a meal, our body temperature tends to rise. This is because we need to expend energy to digest food, and to absorb and assimilate nutrients. Consequently, the calories available to you from food may not correspond exactly to the calorific content described on a food label. It is estimated that diet induced thermogenesis uses between 5 and 10 per cent of a meal's total energy, but the exact amount varies with the type of food. Our bodies seem to be relatively inefficient at utilizing carbohydrate, and less energy is available from it for storage and growth. Diet induced thermogenesis accounts for up to 23 out of every 100 calories when we eat complex carbohydrates, but only 3 out of every 100 calories when we eat pure fats. This is one reason fatty meals are so fattening!"

"dietary exchange lists","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>dietary exchange lists</b>
<i>(food exchange system)</i><div class=""content"">A dietary management system first developed in the USA for diabetics. The lists consist of six types of food that have been grouped together because they have a similar calorific content and similar composition of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The groups are:<blockquote>•&nbsp;milk and milk products (skimmed milk recommended)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;vegetables<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;fruit<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;bread (starchy foods)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;meat (lean, low fat products recommended)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;fat.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> Each group contains lists of foods and the amounts which provide equivalent energy and macronutrients. For example, one teaspoon of oil is equivalent in fat and energy content to one rasher of bacon; and half a banana has a similar content of energy, carbohydrate, protein, and fat, to one small apple. Nutritionally balanced, calorie-controlled diets can be constructed on the basis of the dietary exchange system. Consequently, the lists are used by a wide range of people to plan a structured diet for weight control. In the UK, special carbohydrate exchange lists are used by some people with diabetes, and protein exchange lists by people who need to restrict their protein intake (e.g. those people with kidney disease need to keep their protein intake as low as possible but still obtain adequate amounts of all the essential amino acids)."
"dietary fibre","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>dietary fibre</b><div class=""content"">Part of food that cannot be digested and absorbed. The term is sometimes used to distinguish fibre in the diet from crude fibre, a chemical analytical form of fibre. See also <a href=""entry://fibre""><span class=""links"">fibre</span></a>."
"Dietary Reference Values","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Dietary Reference Values</b><div class=""content"">Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) are standards set in the UK by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA). The Values are established specifically for population groups and not for individuals. The Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI), for example, is a level of intake greater than required by 97.5 per cent of the population, and therefore more than adequate to meet the needs of most people. However, if an individual's intake is below the RNI, this does not mean that the individual will suffer a deficiency because his or her specific requirements are not known. DRVs give the daily requirements for energy and 33 nutrients. The standards were presented in a comprehensive report entitled <i>Dietary Reference Values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom</i>, available from HMSO. The DRVs are provided as four values:<blockquote>•&nbsp;ESTIMATED AVERAGE REQUIREMENT (EAR): The average requirement for a particular nutrient or for energy<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;REFERENCE NUTRIENT INTAKE (RNI): The amount of a nutrient which is sufficient for almost all individuals (97.5 per cent of the population). The RNI is equivalent to the previous Recommended Daily Amount (RDA)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;LOWER REFERENCE INTAKE (LRNI): The amount of a nutrient which is sufficient for only a few individuals (2.5 per cent of the population); therefore most people need more than this<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;SAFE INTAKE: A range of intakes sufficient for almost all individuals' needs but not so high as to cause harmful effects. This level is given for nutrients for which there is insufficient information to set more precise levels.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>In addition, the DRVs include High Intakes indicating the upper levels of intake for a nutrient above which there is no further benefit and effects may be harmful.<br class=""nLine"" />Desirable intakes of total fat, saturated fats, sugars, and starches are expressed as a percentage of the EAR for energy. The estimates are based on the calories expended during sleep or rest, plus the energy expended in physical activity. COMA concluded that, as a population, we have become less active and require less calories than previously recommended. Of course, if you are very active, you would expend more energy and require a higher calorie intake.<center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1"" ESTIMATED AVERAGE KILOCALORIE REQUIREMENTS PER DAY <tr><td>AGE</td><td>MALE</td><td>FEMALE</td></tr>

"digestion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>digestion</b><div class=""content"">The process by which complex food is broken down into simple compounds by chemical processes. Fats are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids, proteins into amino acids, and starch into glucose. Chemical digestion depends on enzymes secreted by cells lining the alimentary canal or by cells in the pancreas. Chemical digestion is aided by chewing which physically breaks down large chunks of food into smaller pieces; this is sometimes called mechanical digestion. Fat digestion is accelerated by bile secreted by the liver. Bile is stored in the gall bladder until needed in the small intestine where it emulsifies fat, increasing the surface area on which enzymes can act."

During digestion, disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides which are absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to the liver for processing, after which their main use is as a source of energy."
"disc","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>disc</b>
<i>(intervertebral disc)</i><div class=""content"">Discs are flexible, cushion-like pads between two adjacent vertebrae. They enable the backbone to move, and act as shock absorbers during movements. Each disc is composed of an inner semifluid material (nucleus pulposus) and a strong outer ring of fibrous cartilage (annulus fibrosis). The discs are thickest in the neck and lower back, increasing their flexibility. Discs have to be able to bear very high loads, particularly during high-impact exercises such as jumping. In very fit people, a single disc in the lower back can withstand loads in excess of 1000 kg without being damaged. Regular exercise aids the flow of nutrients into intervertebral discs and is essential for maintaining back strength and flexibility. See <a href=""entry://prolapsed intervertebral disc""><span class=""links"">prolapsed intervertebral disc</span></a>."
"dislocation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>dislocation</b>
<i>(luxation)</i><div class=""content"">Complete separation (displacement) of the bones forming a joint when the joint is forced beyond its maximum range of movement. A joint becomes immobile or unstable when dislocated, but there is little pain unless the bones press against a nerve. The most common dislocations involve shoulder joints. Dislocations of the knee are rare but when they do occur they are true emergencies requiring expert medical treatment.<br class=""nLine"" />Partial dislocations (subluxations) are more common. They result when a joint moves beyonds its maximum range, distorting the alignment of joint surfaces. Unlike complete dislocations, the articulating bones retain partial contact with each other. Partial dislocations are often temporary and the bones usually go back to their normal position without any special treatment.<br class=""nLine"" />When a bone has to be put back in place, care needs to be taken even if the dislocation is partial. If an unskilled person uses an inappropriate technique, a great deal of damage can be done to surrounding blood vessels and nerves. It is usually relatively easy for a skilled person to replace dislocated bone (it may even realign automatically) within a few hours of injury. If treatment is delayed, however, the condition may be as difficult to correct as a fracture because the ligaments damaged during the dislocation tend to stick together."

They distinguished between primary, innate drives associated with satisfying biological needs (hunger), and secondary drives associated with satisfying social needs (e.g. status). Other early psychologists claimed that a single general drive was responsible for energizing all behaviour.<br class=""nLine"" />The term drive is still used descriptively to convey the idea of a psychological force, but it is not generally used by modern psychologists because of confusion with the scientific concepts of force and energy.

"dropout","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>dropout</b><div class=""content"">An individual who has stopped participating in an exercise programme. Lack of time, loss of interest, and, especially, failure to achieve goals seem to be critical factors. The vast majority of exercisers who do not achieve their pre-set goals drop out, while most exercisers who attain their goals continue exercising. This emphasizes the need to set personal goals which are reasonably easy to achieve before embarking on an exercise programme.

In sport, drugs are used to enhance physical or mental abilities (see <a href=""entry://stimulants""><span class=""links"">stimulants</span></a>); to gain weight (see <a href=""entry://anabolic steroids""><span class=""links"">anabolic steroids</span></a>); to lose weight (see <a href=""entry://amphetamines""><span class=""links"">amphetamines</span></a> and <a href=""entry://diuretic""><span class=""links"">diuretics</span></a>); or to reduce pain (see <a href=""entry://narcotic""><span class=""links"">narcotic</span></a>). They are often taken by sports people to gain an unfair advantage over competitors. Drugs taken to prevent or cure a disease, or to alleviate a body disorder are referred to as medicines.<br class=""nLine"" />Most drugs are potentially harmful. For example, anabolic steroids can cause aggressive behaviour; amphetamines may induce depression; diuretics may increase the risk of cardiovascular disorders; and narcotic analgesics such as morphine can cause loss of appetite, constipation, and nausea. Chronic use of certain drugs can lead to physiological and psychological dependence. Withdrawal from drug use may then induce unpleasant symptoms which act as a disincentive to give up the drug. In addition, drug tolerance increases with repeated use, so larger doses are needed to maintain the same effects.

In amoebic dysentery the gut is infected with a protozoan, <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>, which is spread by food or water contaminated by faeces. The infection sometimes results in intestinal ulcers and abscesses. Treatment is with specific antibiotics. In bacillary dysentery, the gut is infected by a bacterium, <i>Shigella</i>. Transmission is by contact with an infected person, a carrier, or with water contaminated by their faeces. In addition to diarrhoea, symptoms include nausea, cramp, and fever. Again, treatment is with antibiotics. Patients should not handle food for other people until they are completely free of the disease."

"eating diary","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>eating diary</b>
<i>(food diary)</i><div class=""content"">A daily record of all food eaten. An eating diary usually includes the time of day that eating or drinking took place, rough estimates of the amounts ingested, and the diarist's feelings. For example:<blockquote>&nbsp;DATE:<br class=""nLine"" />&nbsp;Time<br class=""nLine"" />&nbsp;Food and drinks consumed<br class=""nLine"" />&nbsp;Location<br class=""nLine"" />&nbsp;Feelings/mood<br class=""nLine"" />
</blockquote><br class=""nLine"" />The eating or food diary is used by nutritionists, dietitians, and food researchers to study what people eat and the relationship between diet, health, and well being. The diary should record everything you consume (even the ‘naughty-but-nice’ treats you would rather keep secret), not just what you think you should consume. If compiled honestly, the record can be used to analyse the nutritional content of the diet, and identify ways in which it could be improved. It can also be used to identify the foods responsible for a food intolerance. A person showing symptoms of intolerance records everything eaten in a meal and any symptoms that develop. Foods associated with unpleasant symptoms, such as headaches, dizziness, irritability, nausea, and sneezing, are avoided and replaced by a nutritionally equivalent substitute (e.g. dairy products may be replaced by soya milk products)."
"eating disorder","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>eating disorder</b><div class=""content"">A potentially dangerous disturbance in the pattern of eating. It usually has an underlying psychological basis, but is sometimes caused by a malfunction of the appetite centre in the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. Eating disorders are usually classified into two main groups: anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. In reality there is a spectrum of disorders and it is not always easy to assign a particular disorder neatly into either of the two main groups. Patients who do not meet all the criteria for either anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa are said to suffer an ‘eating disorder not otherwise specified’ (NOS).<br class=""nLine"" />Eating disorders of any type are more prevalent among females than males. More than 90 per cent of those with eating disorders are women, mostly adolescents. Many sociologists and psychiatrists blame the disorders on the preoccupation of Western culture with slimness and the negative stereotyping of women who are plump. Women are continually bombarded with images from the media reinforcing the notion that they have to be slim to be beautiful, successful, healthy, and happy.<br class=""nLine"" />There now appears to be a significant change in cultural expectations for men, with a greater emphasis on good looks and a muscular physique. This has resulted in many young men becoming compulsive exercisers and resorting to the use of anabolic steroids and special body-building diets. The obsession of men with physical appearance may parallel that of women; both can result in psychological disorders, but of different types.

"eating disorder not otherwise specified","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>eating disorder not otherwise specified</b> (NOS)<div class=""content"">An eating disorder which cannot be classified as either anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. A person suffering from NOS may exhibit behaviour characteristic of both specific eating disorders, or may alternate between the two disorders.

<b>ectopic heartbeat</b><div class=""content"">A heartbeat which momentarily loses its rhythm. The heart may miss a beat which is then followed by a heavy jolt. It is not a cause for concern as long as a person with ectopic beats has an otherwise normal heart, and as long as the ectopics occur during rest. If they occur during exercise and increase in frequency with the intensity of exercise, or if the ectopics combine with other abnormalities, the sufferer should seek medical advice.<br class=""nLine"" />Well-trained athletes have a relatively high incidence of abnormal heart rhythms but, in the absence of other symptoms, these variations are normal and do not indicate heart disease. Ectopics can be caused by drugs such as caffeine."
"eczema","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>eczema</b><div class=""content"">A non-infectious skin disorder characterized by itching and often accompanied by small blisters. One form may be induced by cold, windy conditions, or chemical irritants dissolved in water. Another form is caused by an allergy to one of a wide range of substances. Flexural or atopic eczema affects mainly children at sites frequently involved in flexion, such as the back of the knees. Atopic eczema is partly inherited, but is also believed to be related to the mother's diet during pregnancy, the child's diet after birth, and other factors. Certain foods, such as cow's milk, chocolates, tomatoes, and nuts, may increase the risk of eczema in infants who are genetically predisposed to the condition. Breast-fed infants are less likely to have eczema, especially if the mother avoids eating foods suspected of triggering eczema. Eczema often worsens under conditions of stress.<br class=""nLine"" />Irritant eczema has little effect on participation in sport and exercise, with the exception of swimming, which is not generally suitable for eczema sufferers. Contact sports carry the risk of bacterial infection of eczematous blisters for sufferers of flexural eczema."

<b>elastic belt</b><div class=""content"">A belt claimed to increase the temperature round the waist and melt away fat. The same claim is made for inflatable belts. These claims are false: the belts may increase temperature and water loss, but they do not burn off fat. A temporary reduction in waist size may result from the water loss and compression of tissues, but this will be regained quickly. The belts often come with instructions for abdominal strengthening exercises. These exercises may account for reports of more permanent loss in waist size."

"elbow joint","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>elbow joint</b><div class=""content"">The elbow is a very complex structure. It is the meeting point of many nerves and blood vessels as they pass from the upper to the lower arm. It actually consists of three joints enclosed in a common joint capsule: the humeroulnar joint, between the humerus and ulna; the humeroradial joint, between the humerus and radius; and the radioulnar joint, between the radius and ulna. The elbow functions mainly as a hinge joint, allowing bending and straightening of the arm, but the radioulnar joint also allows the forearm to rotate.<br class=""nLine"" />Elbow injuries are quite common in sports, especially those which use hand-held equipment. Hitting a ball with a racket, for example, imposes great stress on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Repeated movements can damage tendons attached at the elbow. Over a dozen muscles cross the elbow and the tendon attachment sites are very small. The cumulative microtrauma associated with repeatedly hitting a ball can cause the tendons to fray, much like a nylon rope would if repeatedly stretched. They may even become detached. Elbow injuries require skilled treatment, particularly in children, because damage to the complex internal structures can be permanently disabling. Many of the injuries are named after the sport in which they most often occur (see <a href=""entry://boxer's arm""><span class=""links"">boxer's arm</span></a>; <a href=""entry://dart thrower's elbow""><span class=""links"">dart-thrower's elbow</span></a>; <a href=""entry://golfer's elbow""><span class=""links"">golfer's elbow</span></a>; <a href=""entry://judo elbow""><span class=""links"">judo elbow</span></a>; <a href=""entry://tennis elbow""><span class=""links"">tennis elbow</span></a>; and <a href=""entry://thrower's elbow""><span class=""links"">thrower's elbow</span></a>)."
"electric muscle stimulator","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>electric muscle stimulator</b><div class=""content"">A device for stimulating a muscle by passing a current of electricity through the skin. Electric muscle stimulation (EMS) is used to treat muscle injuries and muscle atrophy when a limb has been immobilized. It is claimed that regular EMS passively exercises muscles, reducing fat levels, but it has been shown that 30 minutes of EMS results in less than 10 extra calories being used.<br class=""nLine"" />Charlie Francis, the Canadian athletics coach, believes that EMS can accelerate muscle growth. He used the technique to train his squad of elite athletes, which included Ben Johnson. The general opinion of exercise scientists, based on existing scientific literature, is that EMS appears to be a valuable aid to rehabilitation, but that its use for muscle building is unproven. Improper use of EMS or poorly designed devices can be dangerous. In 1970, a home EMS device was banned by the Food and Drug Administration after users testified that they suffered varying degrees of injury, including severe burns."
"electrocardiogram","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>electrocardiogram</b><div class=""content"">A tracing on a graph of the electrical changes occurring during a heartbeat. It is one of the most useful records of heart function. It can reveal irregular heart-beats and damage to heart muscle. Specific irregularities in the trace may indicate enlargement of the heart chambers, mineral imbalances in the blood, or whether someone has had, or is having, a heart attack. ECGs are usually recorded while the subject is at rest. An exercise ECG, sometimes called a stress test, provides information about the heart's response to physical exertion."
"electroencephalogram","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG)<div class=""content"">A graphical record of the electrical activity of the brain. Three types of brainwaves are associated with different levels of arousal: theta waves occur during sleep, alpha waves are associated with wakefulness, and beta waves with excitement. EEGs can be used to monitor the effects of exercise since there is a close correlation between certain EEG wave patterns and fatigue or overtraining. They are also used to determine the extent of injuries inflicted to the head (for example, after a knockout in boxing)."

"electrolyte drink","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>electrolyte drink</b><div class=""content"">A drink that contains mineral salts, such as sodium. It is taken during or after exercise to replace mineral salts lost by sweating and to avoid heat cramps.<br class=""nLine"" />There are three main types of electrolyte drink:<blockquote>•&nbsp;HYPOTONIC DRINKS are watery and have a lower mineral salt concentration than body fluids; they provide the fastest possible rehydration. The mineral content of these drinks is present simply to ensure rapid uptake of fluid across the small intestine<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;ISOTONIC DRINKS have a mineral salt concentration the same as normal body fluids; they are designed to rehydrate and deliver energy to working muscles<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;HYPERTONIC DRINKS have a mineral salt concentration greater than that of body fluids; they have a high carbohydrate content and are designed to boost energy during endurance activities.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><br class=""nLine"" />Fluid uptake from the small intestine is greater if the drink has a lower salt concentration than body fluids. Hypotonic electrolyte drinks, therefore, are the most effective at preventing dehydration. During exercise, the salt content of sweat decreases while the salt concentration of the body fluids increases. Therefore, replacing salts without also replacing enough water will increase the state of dehydration and may adversely affect performance. Any individual can restore their electrolytes (salts) by eating a well-balanced diet. There are no conditions encountered by normal athletes or recreationally active individuals when salt tablets are required.

<br class=""nLine"" /><b>1</b> The type of movement that occurs when a body part is lifted, such as when the shoulder blades are elevated during a shoulder shrug.
<br class=""nLine"" /><b>2</b> The process of keeping a limb raised after injury. Many sports injuries reduce the ability of peripheral muscles to pump blood back to the heart. This results in pooling of blood. Elevation allows gravity to return the blood to the heart, and reduces the risk of swelling."
"elimination diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>elimination diet</b><div class=""content"">A procedure used to identify foods responsible for food intolerance. First, all suspected foods are excluded from the diet. After several days, the foods are reintroduced one at a time at intervals. An eating diary is kept which logs the foods eaten and any unpleasant symptoms associated with them (e.g. nausea, headaches, insomnia). The aim is to eliminate from the final diet all foods that cause an intolerance reaction, and to substitute them with foods of equivalent nutritional value. Dairy products, for example, that induce lactose intolerance can be replaced by fortified soya milk products.<br class=""nLine"" />Individuals who suspect they are suffering from food intolerance are advised to consult a physician and dietitian to confirm the condition. The experts will also be able to help plan and monitor an effective elimination diet. Self-diagnosis and self-treatment are rarely successful."

"emotions","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>emotions</b><div class=""content"">Psychologists tend to get entangled in a web of words when they are asked to define emotions; some prominent scholars even deny the existence of the concept. However, most people associate emotions with feelings that are either pleasant, like joy and excitement, or unpleasant, like fear or humiliation. Regular, strenuous aerobic exercise commonly induces pleasant emotions (see <a href=""entry://runner's high""><span class=""links"">runner's high</span></a>). An exercise programme that evokes feelings of joy and satisfaction is often more effective than a utilitarian programme aimed only at improving health or athletic performance. The message conveyed by most exercise psychologists is that, for long-term involvement, exercise should be fun. An exercise programme based on coercion and fear is rarely adhered to for very long."
"emphysema","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>emphysema</b><div class=""content"">A degenerative disease associated with chronic coughing. It is fairly common in the elderly.

<b>endometriosis</b><div class=""content"">The presence of uterine tissue at sites in the pelvis other than the uterus. The tissue undergoes similar monthly changes to that in the uterus and can cause severe pain during menstruation. Endometrial tissue may adhere to other pelvic tissue. Endometriosis is often treated with hormones, but sometimes surgical removal of the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries may be necessary to relieve symptoms. Moderate, regular exercise may reduce the risk of endometriosis."
"endorphins","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>endorphins</b><div class=""content"">A group of painkilling chemicals secreted by the brain. Endorphins, like encephalins, are produced naturally and have effects similar to those of artificial narcotics such as morphine and heroin. The release of endorphins is believed to increase during prolonged exercise. This may explain the development of conditions such as runner's high in which exercisers experience a sense of elation during prolonged, vigorous activity. There is also a theory that the pain relief induced by acupuncture and transcutaneous nerve stimulation is due to the release of endorphins."
"endotoxin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>endotoxin</b><div class=""content"">A poison produced within bacterial cells, such as those that cause salmonella poisoning. The toxin is released only when the bacteria die.

"endurance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>endurance</b>
<i>(stamina)</i><div class=""content"">The maximum duration an individual can maintain a specific activity; it is commonly called staying power. Sports scientists sometimes distinguish between activities which demand short-term endurance (between 35 seconds and 2 minutes), medium-term endurance (2&ndash;10 minutes), and long-term endurance (longer than 10 minutes). Short-term endurance activities are associated with high levels of arousal and use special white muscle fibres that can contract very quickly. The energy release for these activities (e.g. an 800 metre run) depends mainly on anaerobic respiration. Medium term endurance (e.g. 1500 metre run) uses a combination of muscle fibre types, some of which can contract slowly and others quickly. The energy for these contractions comes from both anaerobic respiration and aerobic respiration. Long-term endurance activities (e.g. the marathon) mainly use red muscle fibres that contract slowly and aerobic respiration.<br class=""nLine"" />Slimmers are believed to benefit most from vigorous long-term endurance exercises because the body tends to respire more fat as exercise duration increases and exercise intensity decreases."
"energy balance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>energy balance</b><div class=""content"">The relationship between energy intake (food and fluid consumption) and energy output (energy expenditure for body maintenance and activity).

If you ignore weight changes due to water retention and loss, you lose weight only if you have a negative energy balance (i.e. your energy expenditure exceeds energy intake) and you gain weight only if you have a positive energy balance (i.e. energy consumption exceeds expenditure). As a general rule of thumb, most women go into a negative energy balance when they consume less than 1200 calories each day, and men when they consume less than 1500 calories each day."
"energy continuum","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>energy continuum</b><div class=""content"">A concept used to describe the type of respiration demanded by different physical activities. Those activities demanding 100 per cent anaerobic respiration (e.g. 100 metre sprint) are at one end of the continuum; those requiring almost 100 per cent aerobic respiration (e.g. the marathon) are at the other end. In between these two extremes are activities requiring different combinations of aerobic and anaerobic respiration."
"energy drink","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>energy drink</b><div class=""content"">A drink, usually containing glucose, especially designed to replace or supplement energy expended during exercise. Consumption of low concentrations of liquid glucose (less than 2.5 g per 100 ml) may help to maintain blood sugar levels, delay fatigue, and prevent dehydration. However, many energy drinks are more concentrated; some common sports drinks contain the equivalent of twelve or more teaspoons of sugar per can. These hypertonic drinks are absorbed in the small intestine slowly. They actually accelerate dehydration and, paradoxically, lower blood sugar levels for a short time (see <a href=""entry://insulin rebound""><span class=""links"">insulin rebound</span></a>). Several drinks are marketed as complete replacement drinks; the manufacturers claim that these not only replace water and energy used during exercise, but also that the amino acids and creatine they contain contribute to muscle growth and repair. There is little scientific support for this last claim. See also <a href=""entry://electrolyte drink""><span class=""links"">electrolyte drink</span></a>."
"energy expenditure","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>energy expenditure</b><div class=""content"">The energy expended during exercise is commonly expressed in calories, although scientists tend to use the joule. Energy can be measured either directly from heat production, or indirectly from oxygen consumption (see <a href=""entry://calorimetry""><span class=""links"">calorimetry</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />Daily energy expenditure is dependent on a person's sex, basal metabolic rate, body-mass composition, the thermic effects of food (see diet induced thermogenesis), and activity level. The approximate energy expenditure of a man lying in bed is 1.0 kcal/kg/h; for slow walking (just over two miles per hour), 3.0 kcal/kg/h; and for fast steady running (about 10 miles per hour), 16.3 kcal/kg/h. Females expend about 10 per cent less energy than males of the same size doing a comparable activity. For people weighing the same, individuals with a high percentage of body fat usually expend less energy than lean people, because fat is not as metabolically active as muscle."
"energy nutrient","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>energy nutrient</b><div class=""content"">A food which is a major source of energy. Carbohydrates and fats are the main energy nutrients, but dietary protein is also used as a metabolic fuel (protein can supply 5&ndash;10 per cent of the energy needed to sustain prolonged exercise). In extreme conditions (e.g. during starvation) protein within body tissue is broken down as fuel. Alcohol can also provide considerable amounts of energy. <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""<tr><td>ENERGY NUTRIENT</td><td>ENERGY (KILO-CALORIES PER GRAM)</td>

"enriched foods","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>enriched foods</b><div class=""content"">Processed foods to which vitamins and minerals are added. This may be done to replace nutrients lost during processing; to make them more comparable to other foods (e.g. vitamins A and D are added to margarines to make them comparable to butter); or simply to increase people's intake of a nutrient. Enrichment can be statutory or voluntary. Enriched foods do not always have higher vitamin and mineral levels than unprocessed foods; on the contrary, many more nutrients are usually lost than have been replaced. For example, some bread made from white flour is enriched with vitamins B<sub class=""ind>1</sub>, B<sub class=""ind>2</sub>, and niacin, and with minerals such as iron, but may still contain less fibre and other nutrients than bread made with unprocessed, brown flour."

"enzyme","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>enzyme</b><div class=""content"">Enzymes are proteins which act as biological catalysts accelerating specific chemical reactions, such as the digestion of food. Without enzymes, these reactions often require very high temperatures and pressures. Although enzymes take part in the reactions, they are not chemically altered by them. Consequently they are not used up and are required in relatively small concentrations. The body varies the concentration of a particular enzyme to regulate a specific activity; generally, the higher the enzyme concentration, the greater the rate of reaction.<br class=""nLine"" />Enzymes sometimes require additional, non-protein components to function properly; these are called cofactors. Many minerals and vitamins function as cofactors or coenzymes; deficiencies result in inefficient enzyme activity and ill health.<br class=""nLine"" />Enzymes work most effectively within narrow ranges of temperature and pH. Deviations cause the enzyme to change shape (denaturation) and to become less effective; this happens if the body overheats as a result of physical exertion or when lactic acid produced by anaerobic respiration lowers the pH of body fluids."

<b>ephedrine</b><div class=""content"">A stimulant drug sometimes used to treat asthma and respiratory complaints. It acts on the sympathetic nervous system to increase blood flow to muscles and promote a feeling of well being. Some people take ephedrine and ephedrine-related drugs as ergogenic aids to improve their physical performance. It is also included in some weight-reducing medications because of its stimulant effects; it may also act as an appetite suppressant. Side effects of ephedrine include heart irregularities and high blood pressure. Ephedrine is banned by most sports organizations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1994, Diego Maradonna managed to reduce his weight by more than 11 kg (25 lb) in the three months leading up to the World Cup. After Argentina's second game of the World Cup, against Nigeria, he was chosen at random for a drug test. Significant amounts of ephedrine-related drugs were found in his sample, described as ‘a cocktail of banned substances’. Maradonna was banned from participating any further in the competition because of alleged drug abuse."

Exercise does not increase the risk of having a seizure. On the contrary, there is strong evidence to suggest that a regular physical exercise programme may be helpful in seizure control. The British Epilepsy Association advises only against sports in which a blow to the head is likely, and underwater sports, motor racing, or climbing, when an epileptic fit could be fatal. About 2 per cent of the population suffer from epilepsy. In most cases, it is adequately controlled by medication."
"epiphyseal avulsion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>epiphyseal avulsion</b><div class=""content"">A dramatic injury resulting in partial or complete detachment of a bone along one of its growth lines (the epiphyseal plates), between the head (epiphysis) and the shaft (diaphysis) of the bone. A complete avulsion is most common in preadolescent boys (12&ndash;14 years old). It may occur during rapid deceleration, such as when a basketball player comes to a sudden stop or when a long-jumper lands, causing the epiphysis to be pulled upward by the contracting quadriceps. The resulting fracture may extend all the way through the knee joint. Such injuries are a good reason to discourage adolescents from participating in excessively strenuous, high-impact exercises."

<b>ergogenic aid</b><div class=""content"">An erogenic aid is anything that improves performance of physical activities beyond normally achievable levels. Chemical substances that act as performance boosters are called ergogens. They include drugs taken to improve performance during competition or to increase recovery during precontest training (this enables athletes to endure higher training loads). Ergogenic aids are frequently thought of as drugs only, but they may also be mechanical (e.g. equipment); psychological (e.g. hypnosis and mental practice), physiological (e.g. oxygen therapy); or nutritional (e.g. carbohydrate loading and vitamin supplementation)."

<b>ergometer</b><div class=""content"">An apparatus used to measure energy expenditure at different activity levels. A bicycle ergometer is a static bicycle which has had the drive wheel removed. The workload is adjusted by altering the weight attached to a flywheel. Modern ergometers are computerized to give continuous, direct readouts of workloads, heart rates, and speed. A well-designed bicycle ergometer will have a heavy flywheel to provide a smooth ride, a comfortable seat, and straps on the pedals. The handlebars and seat should be easy to adjust to individual requirements."
"erythropoietin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>erythropoietin</b> (EPO)<div class=""content"">A hormone produced by the kidneys. It stimulates the production of red blood cells. Recently a genetically engineered form of the hormone, called recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO), has been made. It has been used successfully to treat anaemia.<br class=""nLine"" />Some athletes take rEPO to boost their red cell content in order to improve their endurance capacity. The beneficial effects of rEPO on athletic performance are unproven, but the possibility of gaining an advantage over competitors is too strong a temptation for some athletes to resist. There is great concern about the possible harmful effects of rEPO. High doses are associated with potentially dangerous increases in blood pressure which may lead to strokes and heart attacks. Some doctors suspect that the increase in the number of deaths among competitive cyclists in Europe may be attributed to rEPO abuse. Erythropoietin and related products are banned by most sports federations. However, detection is not easy because EPO is a naturally occurring substance."
"Eskimo diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Eskimo diet</b><div class=""content"">Eskimos (more properly referred to as the Inuit) eat large quantities of fish rich in oils. Eskimos often appear to be relatively fat, yet suffer low levels of cardiovascular disease. This unexpected combination of a fatty diet and low heart disease is thought to be due to the special nature of the fish oils consumed. The blood of Eskimos takes significantly longer to clot than the blood of those on a Western diet. This longer clotting time is believed to reduce the risk of heart disease. The particular fatty acids thought to be responsible for this beneficial effect include omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid) and other polyunsaturated fatty acids."
"essential amino acid","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

"exercise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>exercise</b><div class=""content"">An exercise may be any movement designed to improve a skill, but it generally refers to physical activities that involve large muscle groups. Exercise includes dance, callisthenics, games, and more formal activities such as jogging, swimming, and running. It may be of low-, moderate-, or high-intensity. The precise definitions of these vary, but as a general guide, low-intensity exercise requires 50 per cent aerobic capacity, little increase in respiration and no breathlessness; moderate-intensity exercise (also called vigorous exercise) requires between 60 per cent to 85 per cent aerobic capacity and causes mild breathlessness and some sweating; and high intensity exercise requires between 80 per cent to 120 per cent aerobic capacity. Exercise above 100 per cent aerobic capacity depends on anaerobic respiration and causes considerable breathlessness, sweating, and acute discomfort. Most people, unless they are ill or physically impaired, can perform low-intensity exercise which helps to expend calories (important in weight control) and reduce the risk of some diseases (e.g. diabetes and heart disease). Moderate exercise can cause some discomfort and may be unwise for those who are unfit. People with a body mass index of more than 30 should seek their doctor's advice before starting a vigorous exercise programme. But for healthy individuals this level is usually recommended as optimal for development of cardiorespiratory fitness. High-intensity exercise is suited only to individuals who are medically fit and interested in reaching a high level of physical performance."
"exercise addiction","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>exercise addiction</b>

A high dependence which produces unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when a person stops exercising is probably rare, but some sports psychologists believe that lower levels of addiction are quite common. The term exercise addiction is often used in a pejorative sense to imply that an individual has an uncontrollable craving for exercise. The cravings may be linked to the production of endorphins, brain chemicals that have narcotic effects similar to those of morphine. A person may be addicted to any exercise, but addiction is usually associated with distance running and weight training.<br class=""nLine"" />Most exercise addicts exhibit few harmful symptoms, but studies cited in the <i>International Journal of Eating Disorders</i> (January 1994) suggest that exercise addiction can lead to eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa. The studies found that many anorexics started to exercise in order to become fit, not, as previously thought, to become slim. Apparently, their obsession with slimness developed only <i>after</i> they became addicted to exercise."
"exercise adherence","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>exercise adherence</b><div class=""content"">Exercise adherence refers to the strength of an individual's commitment to performing physical exercise. People with strong exercise adherence continue physical activity despite opportunities and pressures to withdraw. However, many recreational exercisers quit within 6 to 8 weeks of starting. Adherence improves significantly when exercisers have good family support. Far fewer spouses who exercise together drop out compared with married people who exercise on their own. Exercise adherence is also higher among those who set themselves achievable but challenging goals; whose exercise is supervised or monitored by a coach or trainer; and whose exercise is not intensive to start with, but which becomes gradually harder."

<b>exercise prescription</b><div class=""content"">An exercise programme designed specifically for an individual. It is based on the individual's level of health and fitness, and his or her aims. It is very important to get the exercise prescription right: if it is too demanding it will result in overtraining and the risk of overuse injuries; if it is too easy, the exerciser will not acquire the full benefits of training. People often adopt an exercise prescription designed for someone else (usually a famous athlete); this is usually a mistake unless the prescription is modified to fit the abilities and needs of the person adopting it.<br class=""nLine"" />An exercise prescription should include mode, intensity, frequency, duration, and progression. The following prescription applies to healthy adults who wish to improve their aerobic fitness:<blockquote>•&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">MODE</small>: rhythmical exercises using large muscle groups (e.g. aerobics; crosscountry skiing; cycling; hiking; jogging; rope-skipping; rowing; running; skating; swimming; walking)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">INTENSITY</small>: between 60 and 80 per cent maximal heart rate<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">FREQUENCY</small>: at least 3 days per week<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">DURATION</small>: 15 to 60 minutes of continuous or discontinuous activity, depending on the intensity<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;<small class=""smCap"">PROGRESSION</small>: increase the duration or intensity as fitness improves.

"exercise-induced asthma","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>exercise-induced asthma</b> (EIA)<div class=""content"">A form of asthma induced by physical activity. The bronchioles (air tubes leading to the lungs) are usually dilated during exercise, but in sufferers of EIA they constrict either during exercise or a few minutes after the exercise stops, making breathing difficult. The same intensity of exercise may provoke different degrees of asthmatic attack depending on the nature of the activity. Running provokes worse attacks than cycling, and both running and cycling provoke worse attacks than swimming which is generally considered to be one of the best activities for asthmatics. Asthmatic attacks are most likely if the exercise is of high intensity, continuous, and performed in cold, dry weather, or in a smoky or polluted environment. Attacks are also more likely in those who have poor levels of physical fitness and who have recently suffered a respiratory infection. Attacks are less likely if exercise is intermittent, of low intensity, and performed in a warm, moist environment free from air pollutants or pollen. In most cases, EIA can be prevented by using an inhaler before exercising.<br class=""nLine"" />About 80 per cent of asthmatics experience EIA compared to only 3&ndash;4 per cent of non-asthmatics. Interestingly, in 1984 the US Olympic team had 67 members who suffered EIA, 41 of whom won Olympic medals. This shows that the condition can be controlled and need not be a deterrent to sports participation at the highest level."

"F-plan diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>F-plan diet</b><div class=""content"">A very popular low fat, high fibre diet developed in 1982 by Audrey Eyton, co-founder of <i>Slimming Magazine</i>. The F-plan diet was based on the recommendation of the Royal College of Physicians, that a fibre-rich diet can help weight control by making the dieter feel full on relatively few calories. Fibre absorbs water, providing bulk which fills the gut and contributes to the feeling of being full. Audrey Eyton also believes that the prolonged chewing associated with eating high fibre foods reduces feelings of hunger. She claimed that followers of the diet should find it easier to slim and lose weight quickly, and would gain health advantages from eating high fibre meals. Critics of the diet suggest that the feelings of satiation associated with high fibre diets are gradually lost as the stomach adapts by stretching. Some users complain of high levels of flatulence in the first few weeks of the diet. Nevertheless, in addition to a number of health benefits (see <a href=""entry://fibre""><span class=""links"">fibre</span></a>), high fibre diets are usually effective for losing weight because they tend to decrease calorific intake."
"fad diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fad diet</b><div class=""content"">The word fad, according to <i>The shorter Oxford English dictionary</i>, is derived from fiddle-faddle, an adjective meaning ‘trifling’ or ‘fussy’. When used as an expletive, fiddle-faddle means ‘Nonsense!’ or ‘Bosh!’. This is an apt description of many of the fad diets on the market.<br class=""nLine"" />Fad diets are those which tend to promote only one type of food. They are usually heavily marketed by people with a vested interest in the food. Exorbitant claims are often linked to the diet about its life-enhancing powers, or its weight-reducing properties. Some fad diets do result in weight loss. This can usually be attributed to a reduced energy intake due to boredom with eating one type of food, rather than to any special properties of the diet. A classic example is the man who lost a great deal of weight on a ‘potato diet’. He could eat as much potato, jacketed, boiled, even roasted, as he liked. Unfortunately for him, he did not like potatoes, and his limited intake accounted for a large weight loss."
"faeces","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>faeces</b><div class=""content"">Body waste containing undigested food (mainly dietary fibre), bile pigments, bacteria, mucus, and water. Faeces are formed in the colon, stored in the rectum, and eliminated through the anus. Nearly 450 grams (1 lb) of faeces can be produced per day on a high fibre diet, but this is greatly reduced in low fibre diets. Very small amounts of faeces continue to be produced during starvation.<br class=""nLine"" />The appearance of the faeces is sometimes used as an indicator of health. Very watery faeces may indicate diarrhoea and a disruption of the normal water reabsorption which takes place in the colon. Small, bullet-shaped faeces usually signify lack of fibre in the diet which may lead to constipation. Such small, hard faeces often have to be forced out under pressure; this can contribute to the development of haemorrhoids (piles), diverticulitis, hiatus hernia, and varicose veins. Oily, smelly faeces are usually the result of poor fat digestion. The ideal faecal shape is that of a snake and has a firm, semi-solid consistency"
"fainting","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fainting</b>
<i>(syncope)</i><div class=""content"">Loss of consciousness because of an insufficient blood supply to the brain.

It may also result from severe injury or loss of blood.<br class=""nLine"" />Fainting during exercise is a classic warning of heart disease. It may indicate that the heart is not pumping enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the demands of active muscles. Fainting can occur in healthy, fit people when they are relaxing after strenuous exercise. This is due to pooling of blood in the legs."
"fallen arches","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fallen arches</b>
<i>(flat feet)</i><div class=""content"">A flattening of the arched shape of the foot between the heelbone and toes. Fallen arches usually result from excessive strain and weakening of the tendons and ligaments supporting the arches. The condition may develop after standing still for extended periods, or after running on hard surfaces with insufficient arch supports. Fallen arches are treated with appropriate foot supports (orthotics) and special foot exercises."

<b>fartlek training</b><div class=""content"">Fartlek is a Swedish word meaning' speed play'. It is applied to a relatively unstructured form of training over natural terrain. It originated in Scandinavia where structured training during the snowy months of winter is difficult. Typically, the route is predetermined, but the pace is varied spontaneously according to the terrain and the disposition of the runner. A typical session includes short bursts of running at full speed, longer periods of sustained effort, easy running, jogging, and walking. Fartlek training is often used as an alternative to highly structured interval training to provide variety. If performed properly and energetically, fartlek improves both aerobic fitness and anaerobic capacity."
"fascia","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fascia</b><div class=""content"">Tough connective tissue which may be superficial or deep. Superficial fascia is fatty and lies under the skin. It forms a lining separating the skin from the deep fascia. Deep fascia usually ensheathes muscles, blood vessels, nerves, and organs; it contains dense elastic tissue to give it flexibility."
"fascial hernia","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fascial hernia</b>
<i>(muscle hernia; muscle poops)</i><div class=""content"">Protrusion of a muscle through the superficial fascia beneath the skin when the muscle is under pressure. It is sometimes accompanied by pain. If a person has a fascial hernia, a definite bulge can be felt where the hernia occurs during or immediately after exercise, and it is often possible to feel the hole in the fascia when the muscle is relaxed. The most common site for a fascial hernia is the anterior tibialis muscle at the front of the lower leg."
"fashion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fashion</b><div class=""content"">Fashion has a very strong influence on the attitudes and actions of people. This is particularly so with regard to diet and exercise. The predominant fashion in Western cultures is for women to have slim, almost boyish looks. Being slim has not always been fashionable. One has only to look at a Rubens painting to realize that his feminine ideal was a plump, curvaceous woman. It is unclear whether the fashion industry originally created the trend for slimness or merely followed it. Nevertheless, since the 1960s fashion designers have been accused of creating the cult of the super-thin model, reinforcing the desire for thinness. In order to follow the fashions worn by models, many women have needlessly subjected themselves to weight-loss diets and exercise regimes, not to keep fit and healthy, but to look acceptable. Not surprisingly, this has led to many impressionable young women going to extreme lengths to achieve their goal. An increase in the incidence of the eating disorders, anorexia and bulimia, have followed this fashion for thinness.<br class=""nLine"" />Until recently, apart from a few advertisements for body building, men were not under the same pressure as women to achieve a particular body shape. However, this has changed with the advent of mass parties where it is fashionable for young men to display their naked upper torsos. Consequently, there is an increasing trend for men to use artificial aids, especially anabolic steroids, to build bodies with well-defined muscles.<br class=""nLine"" />Regular exercise and a balanced diet are conducive to good health; an obsessive concern about diet and exercises which develop a certain fashionable body shape is potentially harmful, both physically and psychologically."
"fast foods","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fast foods</b><div class=""content"">Fast foods are convenience foods that can be prepared and served very quickly. On average, one-fifth of the population of the USA (45 million people) eat in a fast-food restaurant each day. Although it is possible to eat nutritious fast foods, menus tend to be stacked with items high on most dietitians' ‘Avoid!’ lists.<br class=""nLine"" />Fast foods include salty french fries, beefburgers, fried chicken, and pizzas with a thick cheese covering. These appeal to the Western palate by being fatty, low in fibre and nutrients, but high in salt (one beefburger can contain more than 1000 milligrams of sodium). To make matters worse, they are often served with sugar-laden soft drinks or creamy milkshakes full of empty calories or fat.<br class=""nLine"" />Those who regularly eat fast foods should be particularly selective, moderating the intake of unhealthy options and choosing healthy options, such as salads with low-fat dressings, wholegrain buns, and skimmed milk. See also <a href=""entry://junk food""><span class=""links"">junk food</span></a>."
"fasting","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fasting</b><div class=""content"">People may go without food for religious reasons, to lose weight, or in the belief that it is good for health, although there is no evidence of health benefits. Religious fasting usually involves going without food at certain times (e.g. between sunrise and sunset). It is rarely harmful to health and may be spiritually and psychologically beneficial. On the other hand, indiscriminate prolonged or repetitive fasting (i.e. going without food for more than 12 hours) to lose weight is generally regarded as unwise. Although a severe restriction of food intake has been used successfully to treat extreme obesity, this type of fasting should be used only under medical supervision. Weight loss during fasting is often in the form of water, and is quickly regained. If fasting is prolonged, muscle, vitamins, and minerals can be lost. Many people who fast say they experience a sense of heightened mental awareness. This may be related to the fact that the brain switches from using glucose as a fuel to ketones (chemicals that result from the breakdown of fat). The American College of Sports Medicine states, however, that prolonged fasting is scientifically undesirable and can be medically dangerous. It may cause loss of hair, dizziness, fainting, muscle cramps, and more serious problems that lead to permanent injury, such as kidney malfunction, and heart irregularities that can cause heart failure.<br class=""nLine"" />As well as being potentially harmful, prolonged fasting may also be ineffective as a means of losing weight. The body responds to prolonged fasting in the same way as to starvation. It adopts a kind of ‘siege economy’; basal metabolic rate is lowered, the ability to store fat improved, and protein within muscles is broken down to yield energy. All these processes mean that when a person resumes a normal diet, body weight is likely to increase beyond the pre-fasting level."
"fat","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fat</b>
<i>(neutral fat; triglyceride)</i><div class=""content"">True fats, neutral fats, or triglycerides (also called triacylglycerols) are lipids formed by the combination of glycerol and three fatty acids. Triglycerides are sometimes distinguished by their physical state: those which are liquid at room temperature (20°C) are called oils; those which are solid at room temperature are called fats. Often, however, fats and oils are both referred to as fats.<br class=""nLine"" />Fats contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They have a high proportion of hydrogen which makes them a more concentrated form of energy than either carbohydrates or protein. Each gram of fat or oil produces about 9 Calories of energy. Fats are the primary source of energy during prolonged aerobic exercise. The release of energy from fat requires more oxygen than the release of the same amount of energy from carbohydrates. Fat metabolism therefore puts a greater strain on the oxygen transport system.<br class=""nLine"" />Excess dietary fat is stored as body fat in adipose tissue. Excess dietary carbohydrates and proteins may also be converted into fat and stored in adipose tissue to provide energy (e.g. during the fasting state between meals), heat insulation, cushioning, and buoyancy.<br class=""nLine"" />There is a lot of confusion over the part dietary fat plays in causing disease. The confusion stems from the bewildering number of types of fat, and there is disagreement about how harmful or beneficial each type is (see <a href=""entry://saturated fat""><span class=""links"">saturated fat</span></a> and <a href=""entry://unsaturated fat""><span class=""links"">unsaturated fat</span></a>). Nevertheless, it is beyond dispute that high intakes of dietary fat are linked to obesity and coronary heart disease. Doctors speak with one voice when they say that we need to restrict our total fat so that it contributes no more than 35 per cent of the total calorific intake in the diet. Only 10 per cent of calorific intake should be saturated fat, the form of fat most clearly linked to disease. The average person in North America and the UK derives 40&ndash;45 per cent of his or her calories from fat.<br class=""nLine"" />Apart from the health risks, high fat diets may also impair physical performance. Athletes are usually advised to avoid fatty foods before competition because they can take 3&ndash;4 hours to digest. It seems that a high fat meal may also cause early fatigue by increasing the level of fatty acids in the blood.<br class=""nLine"" />It is wrong to try to eliminate fat from the diet completely. It is needed to absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K, and a little fat in the digestive system helps to delay hunger pangs. Some fatty acids are essential for the manufacture of other lipids, such as steroids. Other fatty acids appear to actually reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (see <a href=""entry://omega-3 fatty acids""><span class=""links"">omega-3 fatty acids</span></a>). Also, a modest intake of fat helps to maintain optimum levels of triglycerides in the muscles. These act as energy stores for aerobic activities."
"fat blockers","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fat blockers</b><div class=""content"">Synthetic chemicals designed to stop the fat in food from being absorbed. Manufacturers claim that fat blockers provide an easy and quick slimming aid, and that users can eat fatty foods without putting on weight. Unfortunately, fat that is not absorbed may accumulate in the lower bowel where it can cause incontinence by reducing anal sphincter control. In addition, the stools will be smelly, fatty, and foamy. Fat blockers are being used experimentally in the USA but have not yet received approval for general use in Britain. Before approval, the authorities must be certain that fat blockers do not interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids."

"fat loading","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fat loading</b><div class=""content"">Some sports nutritionists believe that fat loading (increasing the consumption of fat to fill fat stores within muscle cells) can delay fatigue. They suggest that the extra fat enables muscles to metabolize fat more efficiently during exercise, conserving muscle glycogen. Support for this belief comes from a study of a group of runners who increased their fat consumption by about 60 per cent for a week and improved their running performance by more than 30 per cent. They were able to continue running on a treadmill at 85&ndash;92 per cent maximal heart rate for significantly longer than those who had a normal diet or a high carbohydrate diet. However, the results have limited application because of the peculiar conditions of the experiment. Before the test, the runners fasted for 14&ndash;16 hours and had to complete a maximum treadmill test at 85 per cent effort, which probably depleted the muscles of glycogen. The results therefore apply only to moderate exercise intensities that do not require glycogen. At high exercise intensities, glycogen is the main energy source.<br class=""nLine"" />Because of the uncertainty about the advantages of fat loading and the potentially harmful effects of fat on health, most experts agree that athletes should avoid fat loading and eat foods with only a moderate fat content (10&ndash;25 per cent of the total calories). Dietary manipulations involving the high intake of fats must be proved safe and effective before they are recommended for general use. It is well established, however, that high fat diets are beneficial for activities which demand extremely prolonged endurance in very cold conditions. Polar explorers have been known to chew their way through one-pound slabs of butter so that they could obtain the calories needed to maintain body temperatures and sustain them on their arduously long treks."
"fat malabsorption","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fat malabsorption</b><div class=""content"">A reduction in the ability to absorb fat from food in the gut, usually due to a deficiency of bile salts or coeliac disease. Fat malabsorption results in the body becoming deprived of fat soluble vitamins, the stools become fatty, and the gut becomes bulky."
"fat mobilization","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fat mobilization</b><div class=""content"">The breakdown of fat into glycerol and fatty acids so that it can be transported and used as an energy source by active muscle. Fat stored in fat cells (adipocytes) cannot be used until it is broken down. An enzyme, lipase, exists in the membranes of these cells and accelerates the breakdown. The performance of marathon runners improves significantly if fats can be mobilized and used as fuel early in a race so that glycogen stores can be conserved for later use."

"fatigue","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fatigue</b><div class=""content"">Exercise fatigue is characterized by an overwhelming need to reduce the intensity of activity. When you become physiologically fatigued, no matter how hard you try, you are incapable of maintaining maximum power output from muscles. Fatigue is a safety device that conserves energy for vital activities and prevents irreversible damage to body tissues. It is caused by factors that act directly on muscles. These include depletion of energy stores (especially muscle glycogen, the main carbohydrate energy store in muscles), accumulation of waste proucts, and tissue damage caused by overuse of specific muscle groups. Fatigue may also be caused by chemicals which affect the brain. Some researchers suggest that concentrations of serotonin (a neuro-transmitter) increase in the brain during exercise and cause fatigue. The increase may be associated with depletion of muscle glycogen and increases in fatty acids circulating in the blood. Serotonin levels in the brain may also increase when amino acids, called branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), are used as fuel, lowering the amount of BCAAs in the blood. Sports drinks containing BCAAs are now available. Manufacturers claim that they reduce fatigue by reducing serotonin levels in the brain, but the amount of BCAAs in the drinks is very low (less than 1 g per serving) and probably has a negligible effect. Exercise physiologists have warned that higher supplementations of BCAAs may lead to dehydration, toxic levels of ammonia in the body, and other dangerous effects. They suggest that until we know more about the relationship between BCAAs and fatigue, we should avoid taking supplements containing these amino acids.<br class=""nLine"" />Success in endurance activities often goes to the person who is best able to delay the onset of fatigue. There is a great temptation to take a short cut to success by using drugs (e.g. caffeine) that delay fatigue. This is contrary to the laws of most sports federations and can be dangerous. The following tips, suggested by exercise physiologists and sports scientists, may help you fight fatigue legally and safely:<blockquote>•&nbsp;saturate your muscle glycogen stores by eating high-carbohydrate foods (see also <a href=""entry://carbohydrate loading""><span class=""links"">carbohydrate loading</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;avoid high-fat foods, such as dairy products and doughnuts, which can increase the level of fatty acids in the blood (but see <a href=""entry://fat loading""><span class=""links"">fat loading</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;be sure to reduce training before an endurance event (see <a href=""entry://tapering down""><span class=""links"">tapering down</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><br class=""nLine"" />Less reliable ways of delaying fatigue are increasing the alkali reserve (see <a href=""entry://sodium bicarbonate""><span class=""links"">sodium bicarbonate</span></a>) and phosphocreatine levels in the muscles (see <a href=""entry://creatine""><span class=""links"">creatine</span></a>). For exercise lasting more than 3 hours unique fats, called medium chain triglycerides (MCTs), may improve performance. MCTs are absorbed from the gut quickly. Tests on long-distance cyclists in South Africa showed that drinks containing 4.3 per cent MCTs and 10 per cent carbohydrate may delay fatigue by sparing muscle glycogen.<br class=""nLine"" />As well as physiological fatigue, exercisers commonly experience psychological fatigue due to the boredom of repeating the same exercise again and again. Although the muscles are physiologically capable of working harder, the exerciser can no longer be bothered to make the effort. Boredom can be avoided by making exercise varied and interesting.

Those which attach loosely onto proteins in blood are called free fatty acids. They are an important source of energy for exercises of long duration. Persistently high levels of free fatty acids in the bloodstream are considered by some to indicate high reserves of energy and high levels of fitness. On the other hand, increases in circulating fatty acids have been linked with the onset of fatigue."

Since 1962, it has enforced regulations to ensure that new drugs are effective as well as safe."
"feedback","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>feedback</b><div class=""content"">Information provided either during or after an activity and which enables a performer to assess how well an activity has been done. Feedback is regarded by many sports coaches as the single most important factor in training; without it, a person does not know how well he or she is progressing. Some feedback is a natural consequence of performing an activity; athletes see and feel how well the activity is being accomplished. However, the most effective feedback is often provided by an external observer (e.g. coach) or from some other objective source (e.g. a video camera). A good coach or exercise trainer should always ensure that those being trained are getting high quality feedback.<br class=""nLine"" />Feedback is also important for those who are trying to maintain or achieve a certain body weight.

"fermented foods","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fermented foods</b><div class=""content"">Foods such as cheese and yoghurt are made by bacterial or yeast fermentation. In Asia and Africa cooked soya beans and cereals are fermented to make a number of important foods, including koji, miso, sufu, and tofu. Fermented foods contain the bacteria or moulds which helped to produce them. These can improve the taste of bland foods and may provide valuable nutrients that are especially difficult for vegans to obtain. In addition, some bacteria (e.g. <i>Lactobacillus</i> in natural yoghurt) can take up residence in the intestine where they may produce enzymes, vitamins, and other chemicals beneficial to the health of their host (see also <a href=""entry://gut bacteria""><span class=""links"">gut bacteria</span></a>). Fermented milk products (e.g. yoghurt) are tolerated by people lacking the enzyme lactase who cannot tolerate fresh milk (see <a href=""entry://lactose""><span class=""links"">lactose</span></a>), but fermented milk products are no use for people who cannot tolerate milk because of an allergy to milk proteins."

Fever is usually caused by an infection that disturbs the temperature control centre in the brain, but it is sometimes linked to an emotional disturbance. It is often accompanied by headaches, shivering, and nausea. It can result in dehydration if sufficient liquids are not taken.<br class=""nLine"" />One golden rule of exercise is that you should avoid physical exertion during a fever which raises the core temperature above 38°C. The fever not only diminishes muscle strength and endurance, but it also increases the risk of heat exhaustion during exercise. More seriously, exercising during fevers may lead to inflammation of the heart (myocarditis). Although this may be very rare, myocarditis is a potentially fatal condition."
"fibre","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fibre</b><div class=""content"">Fibre is the indigestible part of plants. It includes cellulose, hemi-cellulose, lignin, pectin, and gums. It is sometimes called bulk or roughage. Fibres are grouped into two basic types: insoluble fibre and soluble fibre.<br class=""nLine"" />Insoluble fibre absorbs many times its own weight in water and swells up in the alimentary canal. People on high fibre diets tend not to suffer from obesity because they feel full and so consume less food. By increasing the bulk of faeces, fibre promotes efficient waste elimination from the colon and may help to prevent colon cancer. The bulk also provides a resistance against which the gut muscles can work. These muscles produce the peristaltic waves of contraction that push food along the gut. Efficient peristalsis reduces the risk of intestinal disorders such as constipation. Insoluble fibre is found in wholegrains and vegetables; it includes cellulose and lignin. Much of it is resistant to human digestive enzymes and therefore passes through the alimentary canal virtually unaltered.<br class=""nLine"" />Soluble fibre is found in many plant foods, but is especially rich in oat bran. Some types are broken down by micro-organisms in the large intestine into substances that can be absorbed through the gut wall and into the bloodstream. Fibre regulates the transit time of faeces and reduces the risk of constipation. It may prevent or reduce the absorption of cholesterol (high cholesterol levels are a risk factor of coronary heart disease). It may also delay the entry of glucose into the blood. This means that blood glucose levels do not fluctuate widely, reducing the risk of glucose overload or deficiency, and diabetes.<br class=""nLine"" />Most nutritional experts agree that Western diets are deficient in fibre. The National Institute of Cancer in the United States, recommends that 25&ndash;50 grams of fibre should be eaten per day. Although wholegrain cereals are an excellent source, the fibre should be provided from a variety of sources (for example, fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole baked potatoes). In addition to providing fibre, these foods provide valuable minerals and vitamins.<br class=""nLine"" />People on high fibre diets should drink plenty of water or the fibre may partially block the gut, inhibit digestion, and cause intestinal problems. They should also be aware that fibre can reduce protein absorption. This problem can be reduced by eating plenty of protein and by getting fibre from a variety of foods. Some types of dietary fibre, such as unprocessed bran, are not recommended as sources of fibre because they contain high levels of phytic acid which may interfere with the absorption of minerals.

"fibre supplements","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fibre supplements</b><div class=""content"">Manufacturers produce pills that contain fibre. They claim that the pills provide the same benefits as dietary fibre. However, natural fibre is a complex of a whole variety of substances. No one knows the combinations that are the most beneficial, so the supplements may be unbalanced or incomplete. Fibre tends to reduce the absorption of some minerals (e.g. iron). Most sources of dietary fibre are rich in minerals and vitamins, which compensates for this reduction. Fibre supplements are usually lacking in nutrients. Some of the early fibre supplements available in the UK contained high concentrations of guar gum. This swells in the stomach, reducing feelings of hunger, but it may also swell and block the intestine or even air passages in the throat. The British government has now banned the sale in the UK of all fibre supplements with more than 15 per cent guar gum."
"fibrin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fibrin</b><div class=""content"">A fibrous, insoluble protein formed during blood clotting. Molecules of fibrin form a network trapping cells and debris that seal off a damaged vessel.

It often responds well to heat therapy and massage."
"fish-oil supplements","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fish-oil supplements</b><div class=""content"">Fish oil supplements are usually taken in the form of pills or capsules. They contain oils from fish, such as mackerel and herring, which are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. These fats are believed to protect the heart against disease by lowering blood cholesterol levels and triglyceride concentrations, and reducing the tendency of blood to clot. Chemicals, such as prostaglandins, derived from some of the fish-oil fats (e.g. arachidonic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid), help to regulate blood pressure, and play an important role in the inflammatory and immune responses. Although it is generally agreed that fish oils are beneficial, many dietitians advise that the oils should be obtained directly from fish and not from supplements because the effectiveness of supplementation is unproven. There is also doubt about the optimum dietary levels of the oils and it is easy to overdose on supplements. An excessive intake may prolong clotting time to a dangerous extent, increasing the risk of bleeding after accidents or during surgery. Also, pills containing cod liver oil are rich in vitamins A and D, which can be toxic in large amounts."

Fitness has health-related components and skill-related components. Health-related components include aerobic fitness, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition. Skill-related components include agility, balance, coordination, speed, power, and reaction time. Both sets of components interact and are interdependent. A deficiency in any component reduces overall fitness.

"fixed-weight machine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fixed-weight machine</b><div class=""content"">A solid weight-training machine that usually uses a weighted pulley system to vary resistance. Some fixed-weight machines are designed for a wide range of muscle-strengthening exercises (see <a href=""entry://multi-gym""><span class=""links"">multi-gym</span></a>); others are used for exercises on specific muscle groups. The butterfly machine, for example, has pads which are moved by the arm and chest muscles in a manner reminiscent of butterfly wings. The lateral pull-down machine has a bar which is grasped above the head. The exerciser pulls down on the bar, working the muscles in the arms and back, particularly the latissimus dorsi muscles. The total hip machine has padded rollers that can be pushed back and forth by the leg muscles, enabling an exerciser to tone the hips and thighs. The total calf machine has a fixed seat and a back plate against which the feet are pushed to strengthen the calf muscles. The recumbent leg press helps to work buttock and thigh muscles when a foot pad is pushed in an effort to make the seat slide backwards and forwards.<br class=""nLine"" />Although variable in design, all fixed-weight machines tend to be easier and safer to use than free weights, because if any weights are dropped they merely fall back into the machine."

"flatulence","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>flatulence</b><div class=""content"">The expulsion of gas from the alimentary canal. Most belching is due to swallowing air. Rectal flatulence is usually caused by excessive gas produced by bacteria in the alimentary canal. The bacteria fermentation results in the breakdown of indigestible complex carbohydrates, such as those in beans and lentils. The fermentation results in the production of gases including hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide. Flatulence may be reduced by chewing food thoroughly, drinking plenty of fluid, and avoiding too much food that causes the flatulence. Although flatulence is associated with high fibre diets, the problem tends to decrease as a person becomes accustomed to the diet. Intestinal gas is also common in those who cannot digest lactose (see <a href=""entry://lactose""><span class=""links"">lactose</span></a>)."
"flavour enhancers","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>flavour enhancers</b><div class=""content"">Substances added to food to exaggerate its taste or aroma.

They are commonly added to gravies, oriental foods, and soups. See also <a href=""entry://food additives""><span class=""links"">food additives</span></a>."
"flexibility","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>flexibility</b><div class=""content"">Flexibility is the ability to move a joint smoothly through its complete range of motion. There are two main types: static flexibility is the ability to move slowly into a stretched position and to hold the body still (e.g. the ability to sit in a splits position); dynamic flexibility is the ability to move quickly or at normal speed into a stretched position (e.g. a gymnast performing a split leap).<br class=""nLine"" />Flexibility is one of the main components of physical fitness and is believed to be important for optimum health. Flexibility exercises have been prescribed for the relief of menstrual disorders, general neuromuscular tension, and low back pain. A certain amount of flexibility is needed for body movement; conversely, lack of flexibility restricts movement.<br class=""nLine"" />Flexibility of a particular joint is limited by factors such as the bony structures of joints, and the size, strength and extensibility of the muscles, ligaments, and tissues associated with the joint. Most flexibility exercises focus on improving the extensibility of muscles and associated tissues, usually by static or very slow stretching. To be effective, flexibility training must incorporate an element of overload. This can be achieved by<blockquote>•&nbsp;stretching the muscle more than is normal (but within tolerance limits)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;holding a stretched position for longer than is normal<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;increasing the number of stretches.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><br class=""nLine"" />It takes several weeks of regular training to produce improvements; for maximum benefit flexibility exercises should be performed on a daily basis. Many adequate routines take only a few minutes each day to complete, but warm-ups and cool-downs must also be included in good flexibility programmes.<br class=""nLine"" />Flexibility tends to be specific for each part of the body and type of movement. Training must take this into account. To develop overall flexibility, different stretching exercises using each of the major muscle groups must be performed at different speeds. The composition of the training will depend on the requirements of individual sports and activities. The needs of a gymnast are quite different from those of a footballer. In addition, a person should not concentrate on flexibility exercises at the expense of strength training as this may reduce joint stability, and increase the risk of sprains and dislocations.

"flotation therapy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>flotation therapy</b><div class=""content"">A form of relaxation therapy that involves floating on very salty water in a light-proof and sound-insulated room. To many people who have not experienced flotation therapy, it appears to be a form of self-inflicted sensory deprivation. If imposed by an outside agency, such as army interrogation officers, it would be banned under the Geneva Convention of Human Rights. However, regular practitioners (called floaters) claim that they experience feelings of great relaxation and euphoria during a float. Some use the float as part of their weight-loss activities and state that it gives them the opportunity to focus their thoughts on positive images about themselves, their diet, and their exercise regime."
"flow","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>flow</b><div class=""content"">A psychological state of extreme well being sometimes felt when exercising. A person experiencing flow has feelings of great pleasure, satisfaction, and enjoyment. To many competitive sports people, this subjective experience is often more important than the actual outcome of the activity. Flow tends to occur when there is a perfect match between the challenge of an exercise and the capability of a performer to complete it successfully. Some sport psychologists believe that flow may be related to the secretion of endorphins in the brain, although others think that this is unlikely."
"fluid retention","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fluid retention</b>
<i>(water retention)</i><div class=""content"">The human body is about 60 per cent water. Everybody's fluid content is kept relatively constant at this level; excess fluid is eliminated by the kidneys. However, fluid retention increases significantly with high carbohydrate diets. When carbohydrate is stored as glycogen in muscles, extra water becomes bound to the glycogen (see <a href=""entry://carbohydrate loading""><span class=""links"">carbohydrate loading</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />Excessive fluid retention is linked to some diseases (e.g. heart failure or kidney disease) and fluid may accumulate in tissues where it causes swelling (oedema) in places such as the ankles. Diuretics (water tablets) help to remove this excess fluid.<br class=""nLine"" />In women, fluid retention also varies during the menstrual cycle, tending to increase just before menstruation. These variations in fluid retention can often mask changes in real body weight. Furthermore, in the first stages of many weight-loss programmes, much of the loss is attributable to water loss.<br class=""nLine"" />Sometimes, when fat is lost from tissue, fluid retention increases to fill the spaces left by the fat. Most dietitians advise people to monitor their weight over a long period and not to be unduly influenced by daily variations, which are probably due to differences in fluid retention."

"fluorine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fluorine</b><div class=""content"">A highly toxic gas that usually occurs in combination with other elements, forming fluorides. Fluorine is an essential trace element needed for the healthy development of teeth and bones. A low fluorine intake increases susceptibility to dental caries. Fluorides are present naturally in hard water, but they are also added to drinking water in some areas, and to most toothpastes to harden teeth. A concentration of 1 part per million (1 ppm) in tap water retards tooth decay by more than 50 per cent. Too much fluoride (above 10 ppm) can damage enamel, causing discolouration of the teeth. Higher concentrations of fluoride may also increase the risk of developing brittle bones (osteoporosis). It is generally accepted that the average daily intake of fluorine should be between 1 and 3 mg. The best sources are tea and seaweeds."

"folic acid","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>folic acid</b>
<i>(folacin; pteroyl-l-glutamic acid)</i><div class=""content"">A member of the B complex of vitamins. Folic acid is a bright yellow, crystalline, water soluble substance that is stable to heat but easily oxidized. It acts as a co-enzyme in the synthesis of a number of important chemicals in the body, including some amino acids and DNA. Because of its involvement in DNA synthesis, it is also essential for the formation of cells, especially red blood cells and embryonic cells. Just before and during the early stages of pregnancy, greater amounts are required for the growth of embryonic and maternal tissues. The Medical Research Council Vitamin Study at St. Bartholomew's hospital in London demonstrated a direct link between taking folic acid before pregnancy and avoiding neural tube defects (NTDs) in the embryo. The defects occur when the embryonic neural tube that forms the brain and spinal cord fails to close properly. NTDs are the most common birth defects in the Western world and cause babies to be born with spina bifida or, worse still, without a brain. In the UK, the Department of Health recommend that all women eat foods rich in folates and take 400 micrograms of folic acid each day if they are planning a pregnancy and for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Research undertaken in Northern Ireland, suggests that synthetic forms of the vitamin are better assimilated by the body than folate from foods such as broccoli. Supplementation must begin before conception because the neural tube closes about day 21 of pregnancy, usually before the woman knows that she is pregnant. Women at greater risk of folic acid deficiency (e.g. those who are anaemic, have had multiple pregnancies, or have used oral contraceptives for a long period) are often prescribed greater amounts.<br class=""nLine"" />Folic acid deficiency causes anaemia, diarrhoea, gastrointestinal disturbances, and other disorders. The risk of cervical dysplasia increases as levels of folic acid in the blood or cervix decrease. Cervical dysplasia is an abnormal growth of tissue in the cervix, linked to a viral infection. It is thought that folic acid may increase resistance to the virus.<br class=""nLine"" />Little is known of the effects of folic acid on physical performance, but a deficiency is likely to affect endurance athletes adversely owing to anaemia.<br class=""nLine"" />Folic acid is supplied in the diet from foods such as leafy green vegetables, liver, pulses, eggs, and wholemeal cereal products. The richest source is dried brewer's yeast (2400 micrograms of folic acid per 100 grams of yeast). It is also made in the body by intestinal bacteria, but this folate is probably not absorbed. In the UK, the adult daily Reference Nutrient Intake is 200 micrograms; in the USA, Recommended Dietary Allowance (1989) is 180 micrograms for females and 200 micrograms for males."
"food additives","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>food additives</b><div class=""content"">Food additives may be natural or artificial. Common natural additives include sugar, salt, corn syrup, baking soda, and pepper. Many modern additives, such as vitamins and some flavours, are made in a laboratory but most of them are exact replicas of naturally occurring substances and the body is unable to distinguish between the natural and artificial forms. The most controversial additives are those which are completely synthetic and have no natural counterpart.<br class=""nLine"" />In the European Union, food additives are often given ‘E’ numbers: a set of standard codes which have been approved by the European Union. The main categories of additives are colours (e.g. E100, curcumin), preservatives (e.g. E200, sorbic acid); antioxidants (e.g. E300, L-ascorbic acid); emuslifiers and stabilizers (e.g. E322, lecithins); and sweeteners (e.g. E421, mannitol). Other food additives include:<blockquote>•&nbsp;acids (e.g. citric acid, give a sour taste)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;anti-caking agents (e.g. some phosphates, to help food flow easily)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;antifoaming agents (e.g. oxystearin, to prevent excessive frothing)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;bases (e.g. bicarbonate, as a raising agent and acid neutralizer)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;bulking agents (e.g. guar gum, adds bulk without adding any calories)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;firming agents (e.g aluminium salts, to retain crispness)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;flavour modifiers (reduces flavour)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;flour improvers (e.g. cysteine)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;glazing agents (e.g. waxes, to give polished appearance)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;humectants (e.g. glycerol, to prevent foods, such as marshmallow, drying out)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;liquid freezants (e.g. liquid nitrogen, to freeze food quickly)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;packaging gases (e.g. nitrogen, to control the atmosphere within a package)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;propellants (e.g. carbon dioxide, to form an aerosol, forcing food out of containers)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;release agents (e.g. silicates, to prevent food sticking to pans)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;sequestrants (e.g. sodium hydrogen diacetate, to help remove heavy metals from food<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;solvents (e.g. glycerol, to dissolve solids in food).<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>"

"food aversion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>food aversion</b><div class=""content"">A psychological repugnance to some foods provoked by emotions associated with the food rather than by any chemical properties within the food. Unlike a food allergy or food intolerance, there is no adverse reaction if the food causing the aversion is given in an unrecognizable form. Anorexia nervosa is regarded by some as an extreme form of food aversion."
"food combining diets","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>food combining diets</b><div class=""content"">Food combining diets were first introduced by Dr William Hay in the 1930s. He believed that everything we eat is either acid- or alkaline-forming, and that the intake of acid-forming foods (e.g. meat and cereals) should be reduced and alkaline-forming ones (fruits and vegetables) increased. He also believed that it was best to eat only one type of food at a meal, otherwise the body could become overwhelmed with toxins, which could lead to acidosis and fat formation. You should never, for example, eat carbohydrate (e.g. potatoes) and protein (e.g. meat) at the same meal.<br class=""nLine"" />Since the 1930s, other food combining diets have been devised, but they all share this idea that food should be eaten in specified combinations only. They promote the idea that certain combinations are incompatible, harmful, and ‘putrefy’ the body, while other combinations are conducive to good health and weight loss. Many accounts which support these diets neglect to point out that all foods (including potato and meat) contain a combination of protein and carbohydrate. There is no scientific evidence to support the use of particular combinations of food, except that a diet should be balanced and contain adequate amounts of all the nutrients."

"food group","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>food group</b><div class=""content"">A group of foods that have similar nutritional properties. There are various classifications, but one commonly used in the USA and UK divides foods into four groups:<blockquote>•&nbsp;milk group<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;meat or protein group<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;fruit and vegetable group<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;cereal group.<br class=""nLine"" />
</blockquote><br class=""nLine"" />The milk group includes milk itself, cheese, and yoghurt. These are rich sources of calcium, riboflavin, and protein.<br class=""nLine"" />The meat group includes all types of meat (lean meat is the highest in nutrient density) and fish, and also nuts and pulses. They are good sources of protein, phosphorus, vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub>, vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub>, zinc, magnesium, iron, niacin, and thiamin.<br class=""nLine"" />The fruit and vegetable group is the main source of minerals and vitamins. Those which have the highest density and which are especially important sources of vitamin A, vitamin C, riboflavin, folate, iron, and magnesium include apricots, bean sprouts, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe, carrots, cauliflower, cucumbers, grapefruit, green beans, green peas, leafy greens (e.g. spinach), lettuce, mushrooms (though not strictly a fruit or vegetable), oranges, peaches, strawberries, and tomatoes.<br class=""nLine"" />The cereal group includes all grains, such as wheat and rice, and their products. They are rich sources of carbohydrate, riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, iron, protein, and magnesium. The best sources are wholegrains (wheat, oats, barley, millet, rice, and rye). These unrefined foods are good sources of dietary fibre.<br class=""nLine"" />The food groups can be used as a guide when devising balanced diets. They are sometimes called food exchange groups, because one food can be freely exchanged with any other food belonging to same group. Quantities eaten also need to be comparable. For example, most health experts advise us to eat at least five servings of fruit and vegetables each day. A serving is half a cup or a typical portion (one medium orange, half a grapefruit, or a wedge of lettuce)."
"food guide pyramid","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>food guide pyramid</b><div class=""content"">A diagrammatic guide to daily eating (figure 27a). The food guide pyramid has been adopted by the US Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services to encourage people to eat healthily. Six major groups of food are arranged in a pyramid shape to indicate the number of recommended daily servings of each group: the food group with the highest number of recommended daily servings (bread, cereal, and pasta group) form the base of the pyramid; the group with the lowest recommended number of servings (fats, oils, and sweets) form the apex of the pyramid. The guidelines are for the average person. All active people should have at least the lowest number of servings recommended for each food group. Very active people, especially serious athletes and those in physically demanding jobs, may need more than the larger number of recommended servings.<br class=""nLine"" />In the UK an alternative diagrammatic guide to the food guide pyramid has been introduced. It is called the ‘plate model’ (figure 27b). This diagram takes the form of a plate divided into five sections representing the main food groups: bread, other cereals, and potatoes; milk and dairy foods; fatty and sugary foods; meat, fish, and alternatives; and fruit and vegetables. Market research found that the public preferred this approach to the pyramid. <center class=""centre""><img src=""000016.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 27 (a) Food guide pyramid; (b) Plate model</center>"
"food intolerance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>food intolerance</b><div class=""content"">An unpleasant and abnormal reaction to a chemical within a food. Sometimes the sufferer cannot identify the offending food, and the condition is not psychological (compare <a href=""entry://food aversion""><span class=""links"">food aversion</span></a>), nor is it a true immunological reaction to the food (see <a href=""entry://allergy""><span class=""links"">allergy</span></a>). The mechanism of intolerances is not fully understood. Most are unexplained, but some are due to inherited deficiencies of the enzymes needed for the efficient metabolism of specific chemicals. For example, lactose (milk sugar) intolerance is due to a deficiency of the enzyme lactase, needed to break the double sugar (lactose) down into the single sugars, glucose and galactose.<br class=""nLine"" />Food intolerance can develop towards a wide range of foods. Some chemicals in foods (such as tyramine in chocolate) can stimulate the production of histamines in certain sensitive individuals. Histamine is involved in immunological reactions, so this form of intolerance is sometimes called a pseudo-allergy because it simulates a food allergy. Identification of food intolerance often involves a blood test or a slow process of elimination to establish the culprit (see <a href=""entry://elimination diet""><span class=""links"">elimination diet</span></a>)."
"food labelling","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>food labelling</b><div class=""content"">Food labelling differs from one country to the next, but most pre-packaged foods have the following labels:<blockquote>•&nbsp;name or description of food<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;net quantity (weight, volume, or number of items in packet)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;ingredients (arranged in descending order of weight)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;date mark (indicating by when it should be consumed)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;instructions for use<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;name and address of supplier<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;place of origin.<br class=""nLine"" />
</blockquote><br class=""nLine"" />In the UK, food labelling regulations require prepacked foods to bear the name; list of ingredients (in descending order by weight); the name and address of manufacturer, or packer, or seller established within the European Union; and the appropriate indication of durability (a ‘use by’ or ‘best before’ date mark). The regulations also set conditions for claiming foods have certain properties (e.g. that it is an aid to slimming). Rules are also set for nutrition labelling. Such labelling is compulsory when a nutrition claim is made (e.g. that a food is ‘low fat’), and the label must include the minimum amount of energy, protein, carbohydrate, and fat provided by 100 ml or 100 g of the food. Many labels provide additional information voluntarily about the nutritional value of the food (e.g. vitamin content and types of fat). In the USA, it is a legal requirement to give nutritional information on food labels (see <a href=""entry://Daily Values""><span class=""links"">Daily Values</span></a>)."
"food poisoning","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>food poisoning</b><div class=""content"">A disorder of the digestive system caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria, fungi (such as moulds), viruses, their products, or a non-biological poison. Symptoms vary depending on the type of food poisoning, but usually include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and a headache. Some types of bacterial and viral infections can be fatal to the elderly, the young, and those with poor immune systems. Most food poisoning is caused by bacteria, such as the well-known <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Listeria</i>. Less well known is a group of bacteria called <i>Campylobacter</i> which are transmitted in untreated water, unpasteurized or poorly pasteurized milk, and insufficiently cooked meats. Apparently, in the UK the disease may also be spread by birds pecking at milk bottle tops. Symptoms of food poisoning by <i>Campylobacter</i> range from mild diarrhoea to death. Food poisoning associated with the bacterium <i>Bacillus cereus</i> is also a major problem. The bacterium thrives in cooked rice kept warm but not hot in some take-away restaurants.<br class=""nLine"" />Nearly all food contains bacteria, but most are harmless unless they are allowed to multiply quickly. Cooking at high temperature kills most bacteria, and refrigeration retards their growth. However, food left at room temperature for long periods may enable certain bacteria (e.g. <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>) to multiply and produce high levels of toxin which is still effective after heating or freezing. The risk of food poisoning is greatly reduced by proper hygienic handling and preparation of the food.

"food transit time","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>food transit time</b><div class=""content"">The time it takes for food to pass through the gut. This is not only of academic interest as it can have important consequences for health and comfort. If food passes too quickly through the gut, there is little time for it to be digested and nutrients will be lost in the faeces. If food is retained for a long time, constipation may result and faeces become hard and bullet-like. In addition, the longer food remains in the gut, the more calories can be absorbed: efficient in biological terms, but not what someone on a weight-loss diet wants.<br class=""nLine"" />Food rich in fibre tends to normalize the food transit time of those whose food either passes through the gut too quickly or too slowly. High fat levels in the diet tend to delay the passage of food and may contribute to constipation. Exercise stimulates peristalsis (the movements of the muscular wall which pushes food along the gut). This is a possible cause of ‘jogger's trots’, the urgent need for early-morning joggers to find a lavatory or some other place to relieve themselves. The quicker passage of food through the gut associated with regular physical activity may also offer some protection against cancers of the colon and rectum."

<b>footballer's ankle</b>
<i>(impingement exostosis)</i><div class=""content"">An ankle joint in which spiky outgrowths (osteophytes) of bone develop. Footballers commonly suffer from this complaint because they are prone to overstretching the soft tissue in the ankle as they make lunging tackles. The overstretching causes the edges of bones that make up the ankle to rub against each other, stimulating the growth of the spikes. This happens particularly at the front of the shin bone (tibia), which knocks against the main ankle bone (the talus). Although the spikes are not malignant, they may break off, damaging soft tissues, causing pain, and reducing flexibility of the joint. When this happens, surgery may be required to remove them from the joint."

<b>forced reps</b>
<i>(forced repetitions)</i><div class=""content"">A method of weight training in which a partner helps a lifter to continue training beyond their normal limit of fatigue. When the lifter has completed the number of repetitions that causes fatigue, the partner physically assists the lifter to perform more repetitions (usually three to five more). This is believed to stimulate the growth of muscles and improve strength."
"form","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>form</b><div class=""content"">Gymnasts, dancers, ice-skaters, and other sports people who perform in front of judges, have to develop good body form to be successful. Their movements have to be graceful, controlled, and precise if they are to be awarded high marks. Good form usually results from efficient movements. Different muscles share the strain so that energy is not wasted and mechanical stress is distributed as evenly as possible.<br class=""nLine"" />Cyclists, runners, and other athletes whose performance is measured by the stopwatch and by their position in a race, are often concerned only about how fast they can go and give little thought to how they look. However, all exercisers can benefit from improving their form so that they move more efficiently and with less risk of injury.<br class=""nLine"" />If you wish to improve your form during exercise you should pay attention to the following general points, unless instructed otherwise:<blockquote>•&nbsp;keep your body straight<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;avoid hunching your shoulders<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;keep relaxed, do not strain, and do not tense your muscles unnecessarily<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;keep your buttocks tucked in and avoid an arched back<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;keep your elbows and knees unlocked. This allows movement to flow freely from the limbs to the torso and vice versa<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;move your upper and lower body in opposing directions to maintain balance. For example, as you move forwards with one leg, move the arm on your opposite side backwards<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;move slowly and gently, focusing on the muscles you wish to use<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;do not perform movements that are painful or very uncomfortable<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;breathe comfortably at all times; never hold your breath during an exercise.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>"
"formula diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>formula diet</b><div class=""content"">An artificial diet usually in the form of powders or drink supplements. Formula diets are designed to provide complete balanced meals and are usually intended to be used for a short time by people who are ill or recuperating from illness. They may used as complete meal replacements, or supplements after meals to increase energy and nutrient intake. They are also often used by dieters to lose weight because they make it easy to keep track of the calories consumed. Although these diets provide all the nutrients needed to survive and help people to recover from malnutrition and infection, laboratory experiments indicate that they are not optimal for growth and health. People using formula diets over a long period often develop nutrient deficiencies. The deficiencies are easily identified and corrected, but they show that many diets are not perfect. Another disadvantage of formula diets is that they are rather bland and boring. They are rarely a long-term solution to weight control.

"fracture","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fracture</b><div class=""content"">A break in a bone, usually the result of an instantaneous application of excessive force, relatively common in contact sports. There are several different types of fracture but they fall into two main categories: simple fractures, in which the bone breaks cleanly but does not penetrate the skin; and compound fractures, in which the bone does not break cleanly, often shattering with the broken ends protruding through the skin. The latter type of fracture is the more serious because it may result in severe bone infections. The gruesomely named green stick fracture occurs when a bone breaks incompletely, in much the same way as a green twig breaks. It is common in children whose bones are more flexible than those of adults. Green stick fractures are more difficult to treat than simple fractures. Suspected fractures require expert medical treatment. This usually includes taking an X-ray."

"free radicals","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>free radicals</b><div class=""content"">Free radicals are unstable, chemically incomplete substances that ‘steal’ electrons from other molecules. They are highly reactive, damaging chemicals in the body such as enzymes, making them less effective. Free radicals occur naturally as products of oxidation and are formed in the body during respiration and other chemical processes. Exposure to pollution, cigarette smoke, and strong sunlight can increase the formation of free radicals. Once in the body, free radicals can damage tissues and delicate cell membranes. They can also damage DNA, disrupting our store of inherited information; this may lead to the initiation of certain cancers. Medical scientists believe that free radicals also contribute to at least fifty other major diseases including atherosclerosis, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and lung disease. They may even accelerate the ageing process. Fortunately, our bodies have a good defence system to deal with free radicals. The system is based on chemicals, such as the enzyme sodium dismutase, which can donate electrons to the free radicals, quelling their hyper-reactivity. Chemicals in food, called antioxidants, also disarm free radicals. These antioxidants include beta-carotene, and vitamins A, C, and E.<br class=""nLine"" />We use much more oxygen during intense physical activity than when we are inactive. Consequently, we are likely to produce many more free radicals that could harm us. It is thought, however, that regular aerobic exercise may stimulate the formation of more chemicals with antioxidant properties to protect our bodies from free radical damage."
"free weight","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>free weight</b><div class=""content"">A weight, such as a barbell or dumbbell, not attached to a specialized weight machine or exercise device. Free weights allow movement in any direction and so lend themselves to a wide variety of exercise routines for weight training. However, they do not isolate muscle action as precisely as weight-training machines. Homemade weights can be constructed from pieces of pipe and plastic bottles filled with water."

"friction burn","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>friction burn</b><div class=""content"">A burn that occurs when the skin rubs against another surface. Friction burns range from a superficial redness where two areas of skin rub together, to deep burns (for example, on the thigh and buttocks of a footballer who makes a sliding tackle on a dry pitch). Burns, called mat burns, often occur on wrestlers when the skin over bony joints rubs against the unyielding surface of a mat. Mat burns are notorious for becoming infected with bacteria. Friction burns should be treated in the same way as any other type of burn: if minor, the injured part should be placed under slowly running water and then covered with a clean, sterile, non-fluffy dressing. Medical advice should be sought if there is any doubt about the seriousness of the burn. See also <a href=""entry://blister""><span class=""links"">blister</span></a>."
"frostbite","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>frostbite</b><div class=""content"">Tissue destruction resulting from exposure to very low temperatures. Usually associated with polar regions and high altitudes, frostbite can even occur in subtropical deserts at night. The extent of the frostbite depends on the temperature, the length of exposure time, and the wind-chill factor. In very serious cases, the damaged tissue can decay and gangrene could occur. Frostbite is treated by gently warming the frozen tissue in tepid water; the affected parts should not be rubbed because this is likely to damage the tissues even more. No thawing should be attempted if there is a risk of the damaged part being refrozen: the alternation of freezing and thawing is more harmful than continuous freezing. Frostbite can develop during any activity performed in freezing temperatures. The late David Niven relates in his autobiography, <i>The moon's a balloon</i>, an account of a rather nasty case of frostnip (a mild, though still painful, case of frostbite in which the tissues become numbed but remain pliable). While skiing, he caught frostnip in a very sensitive and precious part of his anatomy. His treatment, not to be found in medical textbooks, was to immerse the damaged appendage in a glass of brandy. This peculiar therapy revived the organ successfully, but David Niven promised himself that he would never go again into cold climes inadequately clad."

"frozen shoulder","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>frozen shoulder</b><div class=""content"">Chronic pain, inflammation, and restricted movement in the shoulder. It is a common overuse injury in the 50+ age group. During exercise it may be caused by wrenching the shoulder, and inducing a protective spasm in a shoulder muscle. However, it may also be linked to a cardiovascular disorder, or it may develop for no apparent reason. Treatment is by gentle massage and special exercises, sometimes combined with the application of steroids."
"fructose","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fructose</b><div class=""content"">A simple sugar, found naturally in honey and most fruits. Fructose combines with glucose to make sucrose (table sugar). It is often added to drinks in preference to glucose because, weight for weight, it is about twice as sweet. Fructose also has the nutritional advantage that it is absorbed more slowly than glucose and is converted in the liver to glycogen. Consequently, it tends not to cause a rapid rise in blood glucose levels, a feature which makes it suitable for some diabetic diets. However, excessive intake of fructose should be avoided; because of its slow absorption it can cause diarrhoea. There has also been a suggestion that very high levels of fructose intake may damage the liver."

<b>fungal infections</b><div class=""content"">Diseases caused by fungi which either digest dead tissue such as skin (e.g. athlete's foot) or parasitically feed on living tissue in the body (e.g. thrush). Fungal infections of the skin are usually characterized by itchy, red patches that may develop into pus-filled blisters. They tend to be very contagious and occur in warm, dark, moist regions of the body (e.g. in the groin). Primary treatment usually consists of washing with soap and water, drying thoroughly, and applying an antifungal agent.

"gallstones","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>gallstones</b><div class=""content"">It is estimated that, in the USA, more than 5 million men and 15 million women have gallstones. More than 75 per cent of the gallstones are formed in the gall-bladder from cholesterol, sometimes in association with bile pigments and calcium salts. The high incidence is thought to be related to fatty diets which slow down food transit times (the length of time food is in the gut) and increase the likelihood of constipation. Pregnant women may be more susceptible because of their tendency to suffer from constipation. Other factors that increase the risk of gallstone development include obesity, high blood cholesterol levels, and diabetes. A high fibre diet is thought to stimulate bile flow from the liver and prevent bile reabsorption. This may reduce the risk of gallstone formation. A high fibre diet also accelerates movement of food in the gut.<br class=""nLine"" />Gallstones may exist for many years without causing symptoms. However, they can produce severe pain if they enter and obstruct the bile duct. Blockage of the duct may lead to jaundice or an acute inflammation of the gall-bladder or pancreas. If gallstones are causing severe problems, the stones or the entire gall-bladder are usually removed by surgery."

"gamma-linolenic acid","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>gamma-linolenic acid</b> (GLA)<div class=""content"">A constituent of evening primrose oil, starflower oil, and human milk. GLA is a source of linolenic acid, one of the essential fatty acids. Linolenic acid is used in the body to form hormone-like substances called prostaglandins that play an important role in a number of metabolic processes.<br class=""nLine"" />GLA is used as a treatment for an impressive list of disorders. It is reputed to have an almost magical effect on chronic skin itching. It might also help to reduce some symptoms of premenstrual stress, such as irritability and breast tenderness. Additional reports suggest that GLA is beneficial in treating alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, hyperactivity in children, arthritis, and disorders of the immune system.<br class=""nLine"" />The optimum daily dose of GLA has not been established, but usual intakes are 40 mg per day, taken as oil of evening primrose.

"garlic","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>garlic</b><div class=""content"">A hardy, widely cultivated herbal plant, <i>Allium sativum</i>, belonging to the onion family. When crushed, the bulb of this plant releases a pungent odour. Since Hippocrates first recommended garlic for the treatment of battle wounds, it has had a reputation for potent medicinal properties. It is highly regarded as a cure for colds, coughs, and other viral infections, including verrucas, but there is little scientific evidence of its efficacy. It may also offer some protection against stomach ulcers (one theory suggests that it eradicates <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, bacteria that are implicated in the development of some ulcers). Several clinical trials have shown garlic to reduce blood cholesterol levels and the risk of blood clots. Those with low to moderate cholesterol levels (average 220 mg/dl) have been able to reduce their cholesterol levels by as much as 10 per cent after taking a daily dose of 900 mg of garlic for 12 weeks. Since reports of garlic's anti-cholesterol properties gained publicity in the mass media, a multi-million pound garlic-based industry has developed. However, some pills and oils sold in shops have been processed in such a way as to remove the active ingredients. Also, garlic may upset the digestive systems of young children."
"gaseous exchange","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>gaseous exchange</b><div class=""content"">The exchange of gases between air in the lungs and blood, and between respiring tissue and blood. The essential feature of gaseous exchange is that oxygen is absorbed into the body and carbon dioxide, the waste gas of respiration, is eliminated. Efficient gaseous exchange is essential for health and fitness. If it is impaired in any way, for example because the lungs are clogged with soot from tobacco smoking or diesel exhaust particulates, then the ability to exercise is greatly reduced."

"gastritis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>gastritis</b><div class=""content"">A blanket term covering any inflammatory irritation of the stomach lining not due to an identifiable gastrointestinal disorder, such as a stomach ulcer. Gastritis is characterized by pain in the pit of the stomach, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. The layer of mucin protecting the stomach lining from acids may have become damaged, for example by bile salts which have entered into the stomach from the duodenum. As a result, the acidic gastric juice irritates and burns the lining, causing gastritis. Factors that might provoke or aggravate the disorder are alcohol, coffee, indigestible foods, and stress. Antacids are effective in relieving the symptoms, but the condition often resolves itself if the provoking factors are eliminated. If gastritis is not treated properly, there is a risk that it will develop into a peptic ulcer. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that, as with some types of peptic ulcer, gastritis may be associated with an infection of bacteria (<i>Helicobacter pylori</i>), in which case treatment with appropriate antibiotics may be effective."

<b>gender</b><div class=""content"">A social classification of people, attributes, and activities into categories such as male, female, and neuter. Gender is frequently based on anatomical differences between men and women, but does not necessarily coincide with them. Gender is socially and culturally determined; it is not biologically determined.<br class=""nLine"" />There is a strong tendency in Western cultures to indulge in gender role stereotyping, labelling certain activities and forms of behaviour as being appropriate to one sex but not the other. This stereotyping is still rife in sport and exercise; some people still regard activities such as rugby and boxing as being unladylike, while others think that activities such as dance and synchronized swimming are unmanly. Gender stereotyping has resulted in a psychological conflict among some males taking part in activities ascribed as feminine, and among females taking part in activities ascribed as masculine. However, the boundaries of cultural acceptance are continually being extended. It is now more commonplace to find female boxers, rugby players, and body-builders, and some professional soccer clubs, such as Birmingham, are employing female managers."

"general adaptation syndrome","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>general adaptation syndrome</b><div class=""content"">A set of characteristics manifested in the body as a response to stress. The syndrome typically has three stages. The first stage (alarm reaction) occurs when there is an increase in heart rate and mobilization of glucose as an energy source. This stage often happens when somebody starts exercising or increases exercise intensity. It is usually associated with a lowering of tolerance to disease and injury. During this stage, the body's defence systems become more active. During the second stage (resistance stage) the body develops maximum adaptation to stress, including an increase in heart rate and muscle tone. There is also an increase in the production of stress hormones, which help the body to cope with the increased stress. If the stress persists, a third stage (exhaustion) results in the defence mechanisms of the body beginning to breakdown. Overstress may have a wide range of harmful effects, including development of ulcers, heart disorders, and a predisposition to musculoskeletal injuries. The key to successful exercising is to impose sufficient stress for the body to enter the resistance stage, but to avoid exercising so much that the body enters the stage of exhaustion."
"genetic endowment","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>genetic endowment</b><div class=""content"">A person's characteristics are determined by an interplay between genes (the carriers of inherited information) and environment. Genetic endowment predisposes a person to exhibit certain behaviours, inclines a person to put on or lose weight, and sets the ultimate limit to physical and intellectual potential. Genetic endowment is believed to be the most important single factor in determining fitness potential: the type of muscle fibre, capacity to respond to training; and physical traits, such as heart size, are all largely determined by inheritance. However, this is not a recipe for complacency if you are genetically well endowed, or despondency if you have a poor inheritance. Very few individuals achieve their full physical potential; realization of that potential depends on what each individual does during his or her life. People with a low genetic potential for fitness may become fitter than those who are well endowed, by training harder; people with a genetic predisposition to obesity may still maintain a healthy body weight by sensible eating, but they may have to work harder to achieve their goals.

"ginseng","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>ginseng</b><div class=""content"">A herbal root obtained from the plant <i>Panax ginseng</i> (Siberian ginseng is obtained from a different species, <i>Eleutherococcus senticosus</i>). It is one of the best known of the traditional Chinese medicines and is said to bestow a long and happy life. The active ingredients within ginseng are thought to be soapy chemicals called saponins or ginsenosides. Ginseng is sold whole or as an extract in capsules, powders, or tea, and marketed as an ‘energizer’. However, although taken by athletes as an ergogenic aid, there is no concrete, irrefutable evidence that ginseng improves physical performance. One of the problems with its use by sports people is that unrefined products sometimes include traces of other drugs, such as ephedrine, which are banned by many sports federations. Ginseng may also be harmful in doses as low as 3 g per day, causing high blood pressure, insomnia, and depression. See also <a href=""entry://adaptogen""><span class=""links"">adaptogen</span></a>."

<b>glucagon</b><div class=""content"">A protein hormone secreted by the pancreas. It has the opposite action to insulin, causing blood glucose levels to rise. Glucagon is secreted in the fasting state to maintain blood glucose levels and mobilize fatty acids. Secretion usually increases during exercise because of the increased need for fuel mobilization, but the response is lower in people who are physically fit. Consequently, blood glucose levels tend to fluctuate less in those who exercise regularly."
"glucose","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>glucose</b><div class=""content"">A simple sugar belonging to the group of carbohydrates called monosaccharides. It is the main form of carbohydrate used by the body.<br class=""nLine"" />Glucose is the primary fuel for the brain and muscles. Because the brain is very sensitive to shortages, there are a number of control mechanisms in the body which tend to keep blood glucose level constant. Excess glucose is either converted by the liver and muscle cells into glycogen, or turned into body fat. The glycogen store is readily converted back to glucose when blood glucose levels fall (for example, during exercise and between meals). In some circumstances, glucose can also be derived from glycerol and proteins stored in the body. Complex carbohydrates, such as starches, are the best source of glucose in the diet, because they release their glucose molecules gradually.

"gluteal muscle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>gluteal muscle</b><div class=""content"">One of the muscles of the buttocks, attached to the pelvic girdle and the thigh bone. The gluteus maximus is possibly the best known; it is the large buttock muscle on which one sits. It is used to swing the leg powerfully backwards. The muscle can work better if the body is bent forwards at the hip (e.g. in a crouch start of a sprint race). It is generally inactive during walking. The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus are smaller muscles, largely covered by the gluteus maximus. They are involved in hip movements, and help to steady the pelvis during walking and running, preventing the body from falling to one side. They come under particular stress during downhill running when their contractions help to control movement and to resist the pull of gravity."

"glycaemic index","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>glycaemic index</b><div class=""content"">A measure of the relative increase in blood glucose levels after eating similar amounts of different carbohydrate-containing foods. Pure glucose is given a glycaemic index of 100 per cent and all other foods are compared with it. Carrots, for example, have a glycaemic index of 80&ndash;90 per cent while peanuts have a glycaemic index of only 10&ndash;19 per cent. Foods with a high glycaemic index result in rapid changes in blood glucose levels. The glycaemic index was devised to help diabetics manage their diet, but it can also be used by athletes. Many sports nutritionists recommend that exercisers eat complex carbohydrates such as whole-wheat pasta, which have a glycaemic index of less than 50 per cent. A meal with a low glycaemic index should release its glucose slowly during exercise and allow the body's carbohydrate stores to last. Cyclists who eat a meal with a low glycaemic index (lentils) one hour before a cycle endurance test may be able to prolong their time to exhaustion by up to twenty minutes. However, most athletes would find it too uncomfortable to exercise so soon after eating a high fibre meal. <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""<tr><td>GLYCAEMIC</td></tr><tr><td>INDEX (%)</td><td>FOOD</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>pure glucose</td></tr><tr><td>80&ndash;90</td><td>carrots, cornflakes, honey, maltose, parsnips</td></tr><tr><td>70&ndash;79</td><td>wholewheat bread, white rice, new potatoes</td></tr><tr><td>60&ndash;69</td><td>bananas, white bread, brown rice, raisins</td></tr><tr><td>50&ndash;59</td><td>sweet corn, frozen peas, digestive biscuits</td></tr><tr><td>40&ndash;49</td><td>wholewheat spaghetti, dried peas, oranges</td></tr><tr><td>30&ndash;39</td><td>butter beans, apples, milk, ice-cream, yoghurt</td></tr><tr><td>20&ndash;29</td><td>lentils, kidney beans</td></tr><tr><td>10&ndash;19</td><td>peanuts, soy beans</td></tr></table></center><br class=""nLine"" />The above glycaemic index applies to single foods.

Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate (polysaccharide) made of glucose units that are released when it is digested or metabolized. It is the major energy source for muscles. Compared with other fuels, proportionately more glycogen is used during power activities (e.g. weight lifting, sprinting, and jumping) than during endurance activities. The muscle stores can be loaded above their normal capacity by carbohydrate loading (see separate entry), sometimes known as glycogen supercompensation or glycogen overshoot.<br class=""nLine"" />The first scientific evidence that low muscle glycogen levels cause fatigue were provided by studies of cyclists from the volunteer Stockholm firemen.

<b>goal</b><div class=""content"">The specific target towards which a person is striving. Well-defined goals play an important part in the motivation of exercisers and dieters, enabling individuals to direct their energies towards something tangible. Goal setting (choosing specific, objective, concrete targets) is regarded as very important by coaches and leaders of diet, health, and fitness groups.<br class=""nLine"" />In exercise and sport, well-defined goals improve the performance and quality of practice; in both weight control and exercise, achievable goals clarify expectations, relieve boredom, and increase pride and self-confidence. Ideally, goals should be specific, short term, and realistic but challenging. Sports scientists have shown that as goal difficulty increases, performance improves but only up to a critical point, after which performance deteriorates. Goals should not be set so high that they become impossible to attain, nor should they be set so low that they are not challenging. Generally, individually prescribed goals are more effective than one goal set for all members of a group. Occasionally, goals become a disincentive and detract from the original aims of a person. This happens when the process of attaining important goals becomes an end in itself (a condition known by sports psychologists as goal displacement). For example, swimmers who perform time trials in preparation for a major competition may expend more energy on the trial than the actual competition; consequently, they often exhaust themselves both physically and psychologically, and underperform when they want to do well."

"golf","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>golf</b><div class=""content"">Golf is a competitive sport, and a very popular recreational activity played by people of a wide range of age and ability. Unlike many other activities, golf retains its players throughout their lifetime. Golfers in their eighties claim that the game helps them to keep physically and mentally fit. Golf strengthens the back and shoulders, and helps to maintain spine rotation, necessary for a healthy back.<br class=""nLine"" />There are two contrasting parts to the game. On the tee, power is used to hit the ball as close to the hole as possible. The tee shot requires considerable strength in the upper body, and flexibility in the back and legs. When on the green, great muscle control and accuracy are needed to putt the ball delicately into the hole.<br class=""nLine"" />Golf is generally regarded as a gentle aerobic activity that does not require superb fitness to play. A reasonable level of fitness, however, is essential to reduce the risk of injury. Good levels of stamina and flexibility also enhance performance and enjoyment.<br class=""nLine"" />Each of the four phases of the golf swing (backswing or take away, downswing or acceleration, impact, and follow through) imposes stress on specific areas of the body, particularly the wrists, lower back, and outside of the elbow. Stretching exercises for the upper body, back, and legs improve flexibility and reduce injuries caused by rotational stresses. Strengthening exercises for the shoulders reduce the chance of rotator cuff injuries (the rotator cuff muscles help to retain the upper arm within the shoulder socket). Weight training to strengthen the forearm and wrist enables the wrist to cope with the impact forces produced when the club hits the ball. Flexibility and strength training should involve both sides of the body because the golf swing tends to develop one side of the body more than the other. Consequently, right-handed golfers suffer more injuries down the left side of their body. Golfers should also be aware of the dangers of developing overuse injuries (see <a href=""entry://golfer's elbow""><span class=""links"">golfer's elbow</span></a>). This especially applies to older golfers whose powers of recovery are limited.<br class=""nLine"" />In addition to flexibility and strength training, golfers should also do aerobic exercise (e.g. jogging or cycling) so that they have sufficient endurance to walk 18 holes on a hot day. Competitive golfers commonly have to play two rounds in a day. They may be on the course for more than 6 hours and walk over 10 miles."
"golfer's elbow","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>golfer's elbow</b>
<i>(javelin thrower's elbow; medial epicondylitis)</i><div class=""content"">An overuse injury that commonly occurs on the medial (inner) surface of the right elbow of a right-handed golfer. Moving a golf club while applying a tight grip strains the tendons of the flexor muscles which curl the wrist and close the fingers into a fist. Most strain is produced when the club is at or near the top of the backswing, and as it goes through the downswing until just before it hits the golf ball. The strain may be so great that, in youngsters, it may pull off a piece of bone or damage the epiphyseal plate (the region of bone growth). Golfers who make large divots following a chip shot are more likely to develop golfer's elbow. Treatment consists of reducing the pain and swelling (usually by the application of ice), strengthening the muscles, and correcting any faulty swing technique contributing to the strain. A similar overuse injury occurs in javelin throwers; it can also occur when a weight-lifter rotates the arm during a snatch lift.

High intakes of alcohol or fructose can increase the risk of gout."
"graded exercise test","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>graded exercise test</b> (GXT)<div class=""content"">A test that evaluates an individual's physiological response (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen consumption) to exercise, the intensity of which is increased in stages. These tests can be performed using a bench (for step-ups), a cycle ergometer, or a treadmill. A typical test on a treadmill starts with a subject walking gently on a revolving belt, which is accelerated at three minute intervals until the subject is running at maximum pace or until the subject experiences any discomfort or irregularities (e.g. of heartbeat). Heart rate and oxygen consumption are monitored continuously. Blood pressure is measured at rest, during exercise, and after exercise. GXTs provide estimates of the ability of the lungs, heart, and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to respiring tissue; therefore they are measurements of aerobic fitness or cardiorespiratory fitness. The American College of Sports Medicine, which validates a number of courses for fitness instructors, recommends that all men over 40 years of age and all women over 50 years of age have a medically supervised, maximal graded exercise test before starting a programme of moderate-intensity exercise (i.e. exercise which is 60&ndash;80 per cent of the aerobic capacity)."
"grapefruit pills","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

Consequently, dozens of grapefruit diets have been devised in the belief that they can reduce fat levels in the body. Grapefruit pills are usually sold with a diet plan, which probably explains the weight loss observed among some users of the pills. There is no generally accepted scientific evidence that grapefruit, or any other kind of food, contains enzymes that increase the rate of fat digestion. However, grapefruit is rich in vitamin C, and the pith lining the fruit contains high levels of pectin, a form of fibre, so the natural fruit is a valuable component of a balanced diet."

"gripping aids","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>gripping aids</b><div class=""content"">Methods of helping a weight-lifter grip a bar more firmly. They include using powdered chalk, gloves, and training straps. Most competitive weight-lifters prefer chalk, which helps to prevent the bar from slipping and, unlike gloves, enables the lifter to retain direct contact with the bar. Gloves have the advantage of preventing calluses from forming. Training straps are made from cotton webbing wrapped around the lifter's hands and bar. They make it easier for lifters to retain a grip on the bar and to perform a few more repetitions when they are beginning to tire."

These muscles rotate the hip during running and are essential for maintaining a grip on the saddle when horse-riding.<br class=""nLine"" />Overextension of the adductor muscles results in groin strain. It can be caused by forceful kicking movements in football, bringing the free leg forward in skating, or intensive sprint training. Groin strain can be avoided by strengthening the adductor muscles and by improving their flexibility. A good exercise for doing this is holding and then compressing a football between the knees.<br class=""nLine"" />Groin pain (either osteitis pubis or inguinocrural pain) results from a loosening of the ligaments holding the pubic bones together. It often occurs in football players and others who overload one leg more than the other (by repeated kicking, for example)."

<b>growth</b><div class=""content"">Growth of human tissue may result from an increase in the number of cells (hyperplasia), or an increase in the size of individual cells (hypertrophy), or a combination of the two. Growth is often confused with development and maturation. Development is the process by which a person or body structure becomes more specialized. Physical development usually results in an increase in the complexity of body structures; intellectual development arises largely from learning and is characterized by more complex behaviour. Maturation refers to the physiological and psychological ripening of a person or body part; its change towards the relatively stable, adult condition.

"growth hormone","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>growth hormone</b><div class=""content"">Body growth is greatly influenced by a protein hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. This growth hormone (also known as human growth hormone, GH, or hGH) can now be manufactured by a genetic engineering technique called recombinant DNA technology. The growth hormone gene is cut out of human DNA and spliced into bacterial DNA. The bacteria are fermented and secrete growth hormone (sometimes called recombinant GH) identical to that produced in human cells. Growth hormone is used clinically to treat people with stunted growth. Until recombinant GH became available, the only source of growth hormone was human pituitary glands. This source is extremely expensive and was used almost exclusively for treating people of severely restricted growth (those with severe undersecretion of GH). Growth hormone from pituitary glands was also associated with a number of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The production of recombinant GH has meant treatment is safer and easier to obtain, so that those with less severe growth restriction can be treated. Unfortunately, its wider availability has been abused. It is used by body-builders and participants in power sports to accelerate muscle growth. Other sports people use it to accelerate the healing of musculoskeletal injuries. People concerned about their looks use it to decrease body fat. However, although growth hormone may increase the muscle bulk of inactive individuals, it probably has no significant effect on the muscle growth of young individuals who are engaged in an intense weight-training programme. Intense exercise combined with an adequate diet is sufficient to stimulate maximum protein synthesis in most individuals. In addition, excessive use of growth hormone may cause gigantism in prepubertal individuals and acromegaly (increase in size of the bones in hands, feet, and face) in adults. Other potential adverse effects include muscular weakness, arthritis, impotence, diabetes, and heart disorders. Use of growth hormone supplements is banned by the International Olympic Committee and some other sports federations, but it is very difficult to detect it."

<b>gut bacteria</b>
<i>(enteric bacteria)</i><div class=""content"">The gut of a healthy person contains a large population of bacteria. Not only are these bacteria normally harmless, they actually benefit us by carrying out fermentation of undigested foodstuffs in the large intestine. Several nutrients are made during the fermentation, including vitamin K and biotin. The bacterial population can be depleted by antibiotics. People wishing to recruit more gut bacteria can now take them in the form of a health food pill, but there is little evidence that this does anything useful. In 1994, there were worrying reports that some of the pills contained the potentially dangerous bacteria, <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>. This has been called a ‘lethal superbug’ by the press because if it gets into the bloodstream it may cause a serious infection. In addition, some of the bacteria are resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin, known as the ‘antibiotic of last resort’ because it is held in reserve by doctors to treat people who do not respond to conventional antibiotics. Medical researchers are worried that the artificial introduction of large populations of <i>E. faecium</i> may spread vancomycin resistance into the general population and increase the number of untreatable infections. The US Food and Drug Administration has been asked to investigate the sale of health food pills that contain these potentially dangerous bacteria."

<b>gymnastics</b><div class=""content"">Gymnastics is a graceful and artistic sport requiring a combination of strength, suppleness, and muscle coordination. It is increasingly popular at the recreational level and is particularly good as flexibility training. Competitive gymnastics requires very high levels of dedication and all-round fitness, including stamina.<br class=""nLine"" />Gymnastics is classified as a non-contact sport, but it is a high impact activity. Injuries can occur due to heavy landings, falls, or striking apparatus. Injuries tend to be most common among those with the greatest skill, because they have to practice longest, have the highest expectations, and perform the most dangerous routines.<br class=""nLine"" />In the past decade, gymnastics has become the fastest growing female sport in the United States. Participation usually starts at a young age, but the length of time that girls can take part in competitive gymnastics at a top class level is very short, and becoming shorter. The modern equipment that enables girl gymnasts to perform fast, complex, and very dynamic moves, is designed for short, light people. In 1972, the average female Olympian was 18 years old, weighed 7.5 stones (46.8 kg) and measured 5 feet 2 inches (1.57 m) tall. In 1994, she was two years younger, 1.5 stones (8.6 kg) lighter, and 5 inches (12 cm) shorter. This emphasis on leanness has put a lot of pressure on girl gymnasts to keep their weight down so that they can emulate the achievements of Olympians, like Olga Korbut, Nadia Comaneci, and Mary Lou Retton. Studies have shown that about 75 per cent of female gymnasts use at least one kind of extreme weight control technique (fasting, vomiting, laxatives/diuretics, severe calorie restriction, excessive exercise, diet pills) that may make them susceptible to eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia. These girls also have a high risk of overuse injuries, particularly to the shoulders, wrists, and back, because their bones are still growing. Some training routines encourage hyperflexibility which can cause joint disease (see <a href=""entry://hypermobility""><span class=""links"">hypermobility</span></a>). Many of these problems are not shared by male gymnasts because their sport places more emphasis on strength than dynamic flexibility.<br class=""nLine"" />Although gymnastics is an excellent activity for developing fitness and self-confidence, care must be taken to coach youngsters properly, and to minimize the physical and psychological risks associated with the sport."
"gynoid fat distribution","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>gynoid fat distribution</b><div class=""content"">Distribution of excess fat predominantly around the hips, thighs, and buttocks. If sufficient, it results in ‘pear-shaped’ obesity (figure 29). It is more common in females than males. This type of fat responds to female sex hormones which makes it easier for the fat to be broken down into fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation. Pear-shaped people, men as well as women, seem to be less prone to the harmful consequences of moderate obesity than apple-shaped people (see <a href=""entry://android fat distribution""><span class=""links"">android fat distribution</span></a>). This may be because fat around the hips is less likely to be mobilized during stress than fat around the waist. Therefore, the fat remains in the hips and does not enter the bloodstream where it can become deposited in the walls of blood vessels.

<b>haematoma</b><div class=""content"">Haematomas are common sports injuries, often resulting from a collision. A haematoma consists of a swelling caused by accumulation of clotted blood in tissues. The swelling may be inside a muscle (intramuscular haematoma) or outside (intermuscular haematoma). Intramuscular haematomas may be caused by muscle strain, a tear, or bruising. The swelling may press against adjacent nerves, causing pain. It also limits the ability of a muscle to contract and stretch. Intermuscular haematomas cause greater loss of function and a more persistent swelling than intramuscular haematomas. Haematomas require quick treatment by RICE: Resting the affected limb, applying Ice, Compressing the damaged area, and Elevating the damaged limb above the level of the heart."
"haematuria","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>haematuria</b><div class=""content"">A discharge of blood into the urine (haematuria) can be very frightening, especially if the victim has a little knowledge of medicine and realizes that haematuria is associated with a number of serious diseases. However, it may also be a relatively harmless condition, and is quite common in those who exercise intensively. Cases of haematuria are so common in long-distance walkers and runners that the innocuous occurrence of haemoglobin in the urine is sometimes called march haemoglobinuria, runner's haematuria, or runner's haemolysis. One theory is that haematuria is caused by the soles of the feet pounding against a hard surface and breaking open red blood cells; haemoglobin is released and eliminated in the urine. Another theory is that myoglobin (the special oxygen-carrying red pigment in muscles) may be released into the bloodstream from muscles in the legs. Myoglobin is smaller than haemoglobin and can pass through the kidney filter into the urine.<br class=""nLine"" />No treatment is needed if the haematuria is benign. In some cases of haematuria associated with sports, the internal organs (especially the kidneys and bladder) may suffer chronic agitation and shaking, which damages the walls of the organs. The organs usually repair themselves if the exerciser takes sufficient rest. Nevertheless, anyone noticing blood in their urine should consult a physician so that it can be diagnosed professionally and, if necessary, treated."

The build up of high pressures within the body (for example, when straining on the toilet) may cause haemorrhoids to form by forcing blood to accumulate in the veins. Weight-lifters, pregnant women, and people who have constipation or diarrhoea are at particular risk. Although often irritating, haemorrhoids are rarely dangerous. However, victims should seek a medical evaluation because some of the symptoms (especially anal bleeding) may mimic those of more serious conditions. Haemorrhoids can be avoided or the symptoms alleviated by drinking plenty of fluids and eating a high fibre diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. Haemorrhoids are almost unheard of in countries that traditionally have high fibre diets. Regular exercise, by improving gut mobility, reduces the need to strain on the toilet and also reduces the risk of piles. The condition can be exacerbated by cycling or horse-riding, but piles do not preclude vigorous physical activity. Haemorrhoids which have become very enlarged and painful may require surgical removal."
"hair","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>hair</b><div class=""content"">Hair condition may be affected by a person's diet and health. Bouncy, shiny hair is usually a sign of a well-nourished person in good overall health. Dry, dull, and lusterless hair often belongs to malnourished people in poor health.<br class=""nLine"" />Beauticians claim that more than fifty nutrients are needed for healthy hair. A deficiency of proteins (e.g. in anorexics) can lead to hair loss. Lack of vitamin A or linoleic acid (an essential fatty acid found in sunflower oils) may reduce oil secretion from sebaceous glands attached to hair follicles, leaving hair dry and lifeless. Lack of vitamin C causes hair to split and become dry. Copper deficiency sometimes causes hair to lose colour. However, hair condition is affected by so many other environmental factors (e.g. wet weather, smoke, hair sprays, and shampoos) that it is not a reliable indicator of nutritional status."

"hamstrings","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>hamstrings</b><div class=""content"">The term ‘hamstrings’ properly refers to the prominent tendinous cords at the back of the knee which attach the rear thigh muscles to the lower leg, but it is more commonly applied to the muscles themselves. In the latter sense, the hamstrings consist of a group of three large muscles (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus). They extend and rotate the hip, and flex the knee. They are very susceptible to pulls and strains, especially when a runner tries to sprint without a sufficient warm up. Such pulls can be very dramatic, being accompanied by a loud ‘pop’ if the muscle is actually ruptured. Hamstring strains should be treated initially with ice and compression (see <a href=""entry://RICE""><span class=""links"">RICE</span></a>)."
"hand injuries","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>hand injuries</b><div class=""content"">The hands are very sensitive parts of the body, containing many bones, ligaments, tendons, and muscles which may suffer fractures, strains, and sprains. These injuries are often difficult to distinguish and require X-ray diagnosis. Important nerves cross the palm of the hand close to the surface where they can easily be damaged by compression and laceration.<br class=""nLine"" />A common compression disorder of cyclists is called handlebar palsy. It is caused by continually pressing against the ulnar nerve (a nerve which controls movements of the flexor muscles of the wrists and the hands). Damage to the nerve weakens the muscles it supplies. Handlebar palsy can be prevented by protecting the hands with specially padded cycling gloves, and frequently changing the position of the hands on the handlebars.<br class=""nLine"" />The nerves of the hand are so important and so vulnerable to damage as they cross the palms, that the central area of the palm is known medically as ‘no man's land’. It is especially vulnerable to damage. Any laceration or penetrating injury to this area is regarded by a physician as being potentially very serious and should be examined with extreme care."

"headache","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>headache</b><div class=""content"">Headaches have a variety of causes. Most are relatively trivial including those associated with alcoholic hangovers, exertion, fatigue, emotional stress, and poor posture. Some headaches have more sinister implications and may be associated with food poisoning, very high blood pressure, or brain damage after a blow to the head.<br class=""nLine"" />Headaches encountered during or after vigorous physical activity are sometimes called exercise-induced headaches. Typically the headache is benign, occurs suddenly, and produces a throbbing pain. Other headaches, more severe in intensity, may develop after prolonged exertion in heat, high humidity, or at altitude. These effort headaches usually last about one hour and are probably due to acute dehydration. Not surprisingly, footballers sometimes develop headaches and other unpleasant symptoms after heading a ball. These ‘footballers' migraines’ are more likely if the ball is not headed properly. Another common exercise-induced headache is called weight-lifter's headache. This occurs when a person lifts a heavy weight while breathing in or holding breath (see <a href=""entry://Valsalva's manoeuvre""><span class=""links"">Valsalva's manoeuvre</span></a>); pressure in the brain increases, precipitating an intense, incapacitating pain.<br class=""nLine"" />Headaches may also be diet related: food allergies, low blood sugar levels, and very salty foods can provoke headaches and migraines.<br class=""nLine"" />Migraines are severe, throbbing, disabling headaches that usually affect only one side of the head. The pain often starts behind one eye and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances (variously described as ‘auras’, ‘shimmering lights’, or temporary ‘blind spots’). Doctors reassure us that migraine is a medically harmless condition, but this is little comfort to those whose lives are periodically disrupted by excruciatingly painful attacks. These usually last from 4 to 72 hours. About 10 per cent of the population in Britain suffer from a migraine attack some time during their life. Women are about three times more likely to suffer from these debilitating headaches than men. A woman's migraine often coincides with the sudden drop in oestrogen levels that occurs just before menstruation. Although there are many theories, the exact cause of migraine is unknown. Migraineurs (migraine sufferers) often attribute their attack to dietary triggers such as coffee, cheese, chocolate, citrus fruits, and red wine. They may be reacting to chemicals in these foods (such as tyramine and phenylethylamine in chocolate, octopamine in citrus fruits, and 5-hydroxytryptamine in tomatoes, bananas and pineapples). An elimination diet is sometimes successful in identifying triggers which can then be avoided. However, for many migraineurs, no obvious trigger can be found. During an attack, most sufferers lie down in a dark room, drink plenty of watery fluids, and keep themselves warm with blankets and hot water bottles. Treatment includes antimigraine drugs, self-hypnosis, and acupuncture.<br class=""nLine"" />Those suffering from persistent headaches or severe chronic headaches should seek medical advice. It is especially important to see a doctor if a child has a headache which starts suddenly and is accompanied by a rash, vomiting, high temperature, or a stiff neck."

"health risk","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>health risk</b><div class=""content"">Any factor that increases the chance of disease or injury. Health risks are usually expressed in terms of probabilities and percentages. These can be difficult to interpret. In the 1980s, for example, there were press reports that taking high-dose oestrogen oral contraceptives increases the risk of a heart attack by a factor of almost five. This appears to be a dramatic increase, but it is not meaningful unless the initial risk of heart attack, and the relative risk of unwanted pregnancies, are known. Assuming a woman is between 20 and 24, the risk of a heart attack will be less than 1 in 500 000. A five-fold increase will mean that the risk is 5 in 500 000. This is much less dramatic than the reports suggested, and is offset by the even greater risk of death resulting from pregnancy. It is not possible to predict whether a particular woman taking the contraceptive will fall into the lucky 99.999 per cent who do not have a heart attack, or the unlucky 0.001 per cent who do. It can also be very difficult to show that a particular factor is the true cause of a disease. A cause-effect relationship should be claimed only where all the following conditions are satisfied: the factor and disease are experienced by the same person; the experience of the factor immediately precedes the occurrence of the disease; and the disease is unlikely to have happened without the factor being present. If these criteria are not met, the factor and disease may exhibit a close association, but not a cause-effect relationship."
"health risk appraisal","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>health risk appraisal</b><div class=""content"">An assessment tool used by health promoters to evaluate a person's health. The appraisal usually takes the form of an extended questionnaire that enquires into personal lifestyle, and personal and family medical history. The appraisal may also include a physical examination, laboratory tests of blood chemistry (e.g. of cholesterol level), blood pressure, and physical fitness levels. The outcome is a profile identifying specific risks (e.g. heavy smoking and sedentary lifestyle) with strategies and targets for reducing the risks."
"health screening","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>health screening</b><div class=""content"">A procedure used to establish whether a person is healthy enough to undertake strenuous exercise. Its main objectives are to find out about the current state of fitness and any abnormalities likely to present a risk of sudden death or injury, and to detect any condition that would be seriously aggravated by exercise. Health screening may be relatively informal and consist of a self-report questionnaire. Medical screening is a more formal procedure carried out by a medically qualified person. Routine medical screening prior to sports participation is not common in the UK (except for boxing), but in the USA there is an increasing demand for medical certificates before people are allowed to participate in some sports and recreations."

"heart","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>heart</b><div class=""content"">The heart is an amazing pump. It maintains the circulation of blood by beating approximately 70 times a minute, more than 36 million times each year. The heart is about the size of a clenched fist and lies in the chest cavity between the two lungs. Its walls consist mainly of cardiac muscle. It is divided into a left side and a right side, each of which has two chambers: an atrium and a ventricle. Deoxygenated blood from the veins enters the right atrium and is passed through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. This contracts and pumps blood through the pulmonary artery into the lungs. Oxygenated blood returns through the pulmonary vein into the left atrium and then into the left ventricle. This contracts forcefully to pump oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. The unidirectional flow of blood is maintained by heart valves.<br class=""nLine"" />The heart is a very active organ, and it needs a good supply of oxygen to keep it alive. Some of the oxygenated blood pumped out of the left ventricle goes directly to the heart through the coronary arteries. These branch out to supply the thick heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients. Disease of these arteries causes a heart attack."
"heart attack","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>heart attack</b>
<i>(myocardial infarction)</i><div class=""content"">Blockage of one or more of the arteries that deliver blood to a portion of the heart muscle. The blockage may be caused by a clot or by a narrowing of the coronary arteries. The section of the heart which has its blood supply cut off will die, causing severe pain in the centre of the chest. Other symptoms, such as feeling faint, sweating, extreme tiredness, and breathlessness, may or may not be present. If the blockage is towards the beginning of the coronary artery, the heart attack may be very severe causing the heart to stop beating. If the blockage is towards the end of the artery the heart attack may be less severe since the amount of heart tissue deprived of oxygen would be minimal. Heart attacks are the most frequent cause of premature death in Western countries. In Britain, one person dies of heart attack every three minutes, and one in five men will have a heart attack before the age of 65. Most heart attacks are preventable. There are now many volumes of research evidence to indicate that a healthy lifestyle (which includes regular, moderate aerobic exercise and a well-balanced diet, and excludes smoking and excessive alcohol consumption) can reduce the risk of heart attack.

"heart rate","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>heart rate</b><div class=""content"">The number of times the heart contracts per minute to pump blood around the body. It is often, but not always, the same as pulse. Heart rate at rest is usually between 60&ndash;80 beats per minute; males tend to have a lower rate than females, and the resting rate tends to fall with age. Resting heart rate is also generally lower in those who are physically fit; rates of less than 50 beats per minute are relatively common in endurance athletes. A sharp increase in resting heart rate is usually a sign that something is wrong. It may indicate illness, injury, emotional stress, or overtraining. Many elite athletes regularly monitor their resting heart rate and stop or reduce training if it increases significantly. This method of assessing fitness is not, however, very reliable.<br class=""nLine"" />During exercise, heart rate rises dramatically, and is a good indicator of exercise intensity. Maximal heart rate is usually assumed to be 220 minus the person's age in years, but actual measurements indicate a wide variation (see <a href=""entry://maximal heart rate""><span class=""links"">maximal heart rate</span></a>).

<b>heartburn</b>
<i>(pyrosis)</i><div class=""content"">A burning pain felt behind the breastbone that often seems to rise from the stomach into the throat. It is usually caused by the regurgitation of acidic stomach contents into the oesophagus. It is a very common complaint and is usually nothing to worry about. However, repeated regurgitation of the stomach contents can damage the lining of the oesophagus, causing oesophagitis (inflammation of the oesophagus). Heartburn may be alleviated or prevented by increasing fluid and fibre intake, and limiting fat intake. Smoking, wearing tight clothes, and eating before lying down can all cause heartburn."
"heat acclimatization","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>heat acclimatization</b><div class=""content"">If you give your body sufficient time, it will gradually become adapted to living and working in a hot environment. The process by which you become physiologically more tolerant to high environmental temperatures is called heat acclimatization. During the process, resting pulse rate decreases, blood flow to the skin improves, and sweating increases. Sweat becomes more watery so that heat loss from the body can be maximized without losing too much salt. Heat-acclimatized individuals suffer less from nausea, dizziness, and discomfort in hot conditions. Exercisers who train exclusively in cool weather perform badly when suddenly exposed to much hotter conditions. If they stay in a warm environment, continue to exercise at a moderate level, and maintain an adequate fluid intake, they should gradually become acclimatized, be less susceptible to heat injury, and perform better. Acclimatization usually takes 7&ndash;10 days. Once established, it is retained for about 2 weeks."
"heat balance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>heat balance</b><div class=""content"">A condition reached when the heat gained by a body is equal to the heat lost from it. The amount of stored heat does not change and the body temperature remains constant. It is particularly important that the temperature around the vital organs of the human body is kept at about 37°C because this is the temperature at which they work most efficiently. Mechanisms within the body maintain a constant internal temperature by ensuring that heat gained from body activities and the environment equals heat losses. Considerable heat is generated by the body's activities. During exercise, the metabolic rate can increase as much as 25 times the basal rate. Only about 30 per cent of this energy is used in movement, the rest is converted to heat which could produce a theoretical increase in body core temperature of 1°C every 5 minutes. In order to prevent overheating, the excess heat must be lost. Evaporation of sweat and convection by air currents of the heat and water vapour away from the body surface is an important cooling mechanism. This is one reason why exercisers should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes and drink plenty of watery fluids. Conversely, in cold environments it is important to insulate the body surface to prevent hypothermia."
"heat collapse","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>heat collapse</b><div class=""content"">Loss of consciousness associated with hot environmental conditions or exercising in clothing that restricts heat loss and causes overheating. Excessive sweating and an increase in the flow of blood to the skin and muscles reduces blood flow to the brain to cause fainting. Heat collapse is one of the most common medical conditions on a hot day. Nevertheless, its dangers should not be underestimated since it can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Uncomplicated heat collapse often occurs when a person stands for long periods in very hot conditions. Sufferers usually respond rapidly if they lie down, elevate their legs, drink plenty of fluid, and are sponged down with tepid water. However, if loss of consciousness continues heat stroke should be suspected and medical advice sought."
"heat cramps","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>heat cramps</b><div class=""content"">Painful muscular contractions caused by prolonged exposure to hot conditions. The contractions probably result from electrolyte and water imbalances.

"heat equivalence","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>heat equivalence</b>
<i>(caloric equivalence)</i><div class=""content"">The energy released by the combustion of food in 1 litre of oxygen. The heat equivalence of a particular food varies according to its proportions of carbohydrate, fat, and protein. One litre of oxygen releases 5.0 kilocalories of energy from carbohydrates; 4.7 kilocalories from fats; and 4.5 kilocalories from protein. Thus, carbohydrates provide the most energy per litre of oxygen. In addition, for a given level of energy expenditure, more oxygen has to be inhaled if fat, rather than carbohydrate, is used as an energy source.

"heat exhaustion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>heat exhaustion</b><div class=""content"">Fatigue caused by prolonged exposure to environmental heat. Sufferers of heat exhaustion usually have a normal body temperature but their pulse rate is accelerated, their skin is cold and sweaty, and they often experience drowsiness and vomiting. The condition can be prevented by drinking plenty of water. Heat exhaustion is usually relieved by rest and cooling, but if it persists there is a risk of heat neurasthenia developing. Heat neurasthenia is a progressive condition characterized by feelings of apathy, hysteria, and aggression. It can lead to chronic behaviour disorders.

<b>heat stroke</b><div class=""content"">A potentially fatal condition caused by overexposure to heat. Heat stroke is characterized by high body core temperature and hot, dry skin, usually flushed. Sufferers show signs of mental confusion and loss of muscular coordination. They may collapse into unconsciousness. There is an urgent need to reduce the body temperature rapidly by loosening clothing, fanning, and tepid sponging. However, iced fluids and iced baths should not be used because they may constrict blood vessels, reducing the blood supply to the skin and the means by which heat can escape. Medical attention is necessary; hospitalization may be required as there is a danger of kidney failure. During June 1995, there was an unprecedented heat wave in Chicago when more than 400 fatalities were attributed to very high temperatures and humidities."

<b>heat treatment</b><div class=""content"">The use of heat to treat injuries and accelerate recovery. The heat is usually applied to induce feelings of relaxation and comfort, and to increase blood flow through damaged tissue. It is particularly useful for treating injuries that reduce the range of joint movement (e.g. muscle stiffness), but the heat should not be applied immediately after an acute injury because it may increase internal bleeding. Also, heat treatment should not be used while inflammation persists. In addition to treating injuries, heat, sometimes in the form of hot wax or mud packs, is used to reduce weight by inducing perspiration.

<b>hernia</b><div class=""content"">The protrusion of an organ or other body structure through a weakness in the wall of the cavity that usually confines it. One of the most common hernias associated with sport is an inguinal hernia (commonly called a rupture). This occurs in the lower abdomen when a sac made from the membrane (peritoneum) lining the abdominal wall and organs passes through the abdominal wall into the inguinal canal, an opening that leads, in males, into the testes. Inguinal hernias are often caused by lifting heavy weights, but they are also associated with obesity. Some hernias are quite easy to return to their normal site (reducible hernias) but others (irreducible hernias) may be impossible to replace. Some unresolved hernias, particularly in those who weight train and exercise vigorously, are potentially dangerous. An increase in the intra-abdominal pressure that accompanies exertion can cause strangulation, stopping blood flow and resulting in gangrene. In these cases, surgical repair is usually recommended. However, there is a tendency not to perform surgery on hernias that are causing no symptoms. Physicians usually evaluate each case individually before offering sufferers advice about participating in particular physical activities.

It is claimed that up to 30 per cent of the energy content of protein is required for its digestion, but this claim is disputed. It is generally accepted that protein yields about the same amount of energy as carbohydrates (approximately 4 kilocalories per gram). Furthermore, many high protein diets (especially those using animal protein) are rich in saturated fats and cholesterol, which carry a health risk and make a significant contribution to obesity.<br class=""nLine"" />High protein diets are potentially dangerous. The excess protein has to be broken down and eliminated. This puts a strain on the excretory system, particularly if the dieter does not drink sufficient quantities of watery fluids. High protein diets include the ‘Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet’, the ‘Doctor's Quick Weight Loss Diet’, the ‘Miracle Diet for Fast Weight Loss’, the ‘New You Diet’, and the ‘Women Doctor's Diet for Women’."

The introduction of artificial turf has transformed the game, making it much faster with play moving quickly from one end of the pitch to the other. Players require high levels of fitness to keep up with the game and to ensure that their ball-hitting skills do not break down when they become tired. So, in addition to improving individual skill work (dribbling, shooting, and passing), hockey players need to develop agility, coordination, flexibility, running speed, and stamina.

The usual set point for the core temperature is 37 degrees Celsius (37°C): body temperatures above this norm result in sweating and an increase in blood flow to the skin to cool the body; low body temperatures result in an increase in basal metabolic rate (more fuel is burnt by the liver) and shivering to generate heat.<br class=""nLine"" />Other, homeostatic mechanisms include those controlling blood glucose levels, blood acidity, and hormone secretions.

<b>horse-riding</b><div class=""content"">Horseriding is not generally regarded as the most physically demanding activity, but it can be good exercise and an activity that can be enjoyed by all ages. It is recognized as an excellent therapy that can help to improve numerous mental and physical disabilities. The health, condition, and fitness of the horse is usually given much more attention than that of the rider. However, riders, whether recreational or international competitors, will gain maximum pleasure from horse-riding only if they have also reached a suitable level of fitness. A rider should improve general fitness by taking regular aerobic exercise (e.g. jogging, swimming, walking, or cycling). Stair-walking is particularly good for strengthening the muscles in the thighs. Particular attention should be given to exercises that promote suppleness, especially of the hip adductors. These muscles are used to grasp the horse's flanks and help to manoeuvre the horse. Stretching exercises can be performed on or off the horse. The adductor stretch, leg swings, and riding without stirrups, all help stretch and strengthen the adductors. Press-ups can also be useful exercises for strengthening the arm muscles, essential if you ride a very hard-pulling horse. However you train, it is important to increase your riding time gradually if you wish to avoid excessive stiffness and strains."

Artificial preparations have been misused by athletes to boost performance levels by increasing their testosterone levels.<br class=""nLine"" />HCG has also been used as a slimming agent. In the 1950s it was claimed that a low calorie diet combined with a course of injections of HCG mobilizes fat, enabling the body to use fat as a fuel more easily. The treatment was reported to have been successful in removing fat from those parts of the body, such as thighs and hips, where excesses tend to accumulate. However, the success is probably attributable to the low calorie diet (as low as 500 Calories per day) and not to HCG. There is little scientific evidence to support the use of HCG as a slimming aid."
"hunger","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>hunger</b><div class=""content"">A need for food that is usually experienced as an unpleasant sensation. Hunger develops under conditions of food deprivation and the physiological need for nutrients. It may also be provoked by psychological factors. A child who eats lunch regularly at midday will probably feel hungry if the meal is delayed by an hour, even if there is no real physiological need.<br class=""nLine"" />Hunger is usually non-specific: the desire is to satisfy the need for energy, and most foods will do. However, under some circumstances of vitamin or mineral deficiency (especially salt deficiency) hunger may be very specific and result in a search for a particular food (this may explain some of the peculiar feeding behaviours of pregnant women).<br class=""nLine"" />Subjectively, the sensation of hunger appears to be localized in the stomach, appearing and disappearing as the stomach empties and is refilled. In the nineteenth century a North American hunter, Alexis St. Martin, suffered a gunshot wound to his side which left a hole (fistula) leading into his stomach. The fistula enabled his physician to perform some remarkable experiments, one of which demonstrated that food placed directly in the stomach reduced hunger sensations. However, subsequent experiments have shown that people given food directly in the stomach develop a strong desire to taste, chew, and swallow food. Much to the relief of restauranteurs, the mere physical presence of food in the stomach is not as satisfying as the complete process of eating!<br class=""nLine"" />Hunger, it seems, cannot be explained by purely local effects in the stomach and mouth. There is good evidence that the brain contains hunger mechanisms. Receptors in the brain are believed to monitor the availability of glucose for use by cells. As glucose becomes less available, hunger sensations develop. Animal experiments indicate that centres in the hypothalamus (a structure at the base of the brain) play a role in eating behaviours: one centre (the feeding or hunger centre) seems to be responsible for initiating eating, the other (the satiety centre) for stopping. However, it is not clear how important these centres are in determining feeding behaviour in people who have free access to food.<br class=""nLine"" />Clearly, hunger is a complex sensation. Whatever mechanism is responsible for hunger, the desire for food may become so intense that it dominates every thought and action.

Recently, there have been several trials of hyper-baric oxygen therapy (HBO) on patients with sports injuries. Several English football teams have used it to treat players with damaged ligaments. The treatment was apparently successful, with significantly accelerated recovery rates. HBO is thought to stimulate white blood cell activity in the damaged tissues. The therapy also has effects on the heart and circulation, reducing blood flow to the injured parts, which become less swollen. However, HBO appears to have limited application. It is effective on only certain types of injuries. In addition, there are concerns that the high levels of oxygen within the tissue after HBO may increase the level of free radicals.

In addition, it may damage the walls of the arteries. It is regarded as the silent killer because it can develop without symptoms. It is estimated that half of those with hypertension are not even aware of their condition. In adults, hypertension occurs when the blood pressure of a resting person is equal to or greater than 140/90. Regular, vigorous aerobic exercise at a safe level can help to prevent hypertension and reduce blood pressure. Moderating the intake of fat, salt, and alcohol also has beneficial effects.

"hypothermia","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>hypothermia</b><div class=""content"">A condition characterized by an abnormally low body core temperature. It results in rapid, progressive mental and physical collapse. Hypothermia is caused by exposure to cold when a person is suffering from physical exhaustion, and lack of food. It can be aggravated by wet and windy conditions. Victims have a weak pulse, become increasingly irrational, slow to respond, are cold to the touch, and have speech and visual disturbances. Hypothermia can occur all year round even when the weather is not particularly cold. Those involved in water sports are at particular risk, as are cyclists after hard hill climbs. During the climb they are in danger of overheating, but on the descent they are no longer generating much heat but losing it rapidly due to evaporation accelerated by an increase in relative wind speed. Hardened veterans of the Tour de France can be seen at the top of alpine climbs stuffing newspapers down their front in an effort to reduce heat loss. A person with hypothermia should be warmed in a controlled manner. For mild or moderate hypothermia, warm blankets or a warm bath may be all that is required. Those with severe hypothermia will require professional medical attention. Under no circumstances should the body surface be rubbed or alcohol given; although both may make the victim feel warmer, they can cause further heat loss."

Today, there are more than 300 000 ice hockey players in North America. It is an extremely fast and tough sport demanding high levels of all round fitness. Professional players can skate at speeds in excess of 30 mph and even young skaters reach speeds of 20 mph. Puck speeds range from 50 mph to more than 120 mph, producing impact forces greater than 1250 pounds (567 kg). To minimize the damage caused by collisions with other players, the boards, or the puck, hockey players wear so much protective gear that they look like armoured gladiators. Nevertheless, ice hockey is still a high-risk sport. It is made even more dangerous by fans who expect fights and violence during a game, and by officials who do not enforce the rules strictly. Ice hockey is regarded by many sports medicine experts to be the most dangerous sport in the USA for non-fatal catastrophic injuries (i.e. injuries that are severely incapacitating). Statistics show that 2.55 non-fatal catastrophic injuries occur per 100 000 player hours in ice hockey, compared with 0.68 per 100 000 player hours for American Football. In recent years there has been an alarming increase in the number of cervical spine injuries. Some neck injuries resulted from players skating head first into the boards or another player, but most resulted from illegal checking from behind. Although the risk of injury can be reduced by strengthening neck muscles, ice hockey can be made a much safer sport only by better enforcement of the rules, and by coaches, players, and spectators not tolerating or promoting intentional violence. Ice hockey is an exciting game demanding high levels of skill and speed; these are the features to emphasize, not violence."

<b>imagery relaxation</b><div class=""content"">A relaxation procedure in which you imagine being in a relaxing, comfortable environment. It is a technique used by many people faced with stressful situations. Jackie Stewart, former Formula One world champion racing driver, used to sit in his car for several moments before a race and imagine his body inflating like a balloon. Then he would let the air out gradually and feel himself relax. This helped him to prepare mentally for a race."

"immune system","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>immune system</b><div class=""content"">The system of internal defence mechanisms which enables the body to resist disease. The body's first line of defence is the skin and lining of the cavities (especially the gut and lungs). They act as a barrier to the entry of unwanted substances and foreign cells. If foreign bodies penetrate through these defences, the immune system is activated. Cells and proteins within the blood and lymph attack, disarm, destroy, and remove the foreign bodies. Special white blood cells (B-cell lymphocytes) are able to recognize the chemicals (called antigens) associated with foreign bodies and produce antibodies, proteins which attack them. The immune system seems to be able to remember previous encounters with a specific foreign substance, so that if confronted again with the same substance it can mount a prompt and effective defence. This is the basis of immunity.<br class=""nLine"" />People with allergies may have an overzealous immune system that attacks harmless substances or fails to attack harmful ones. Sometimes the immune system breaks down and starts to attack the body's own cells. This condition is called autoimmunity and is implicated in the development of a number of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.<br class=""nLine"" />The immune system can function efficiently only if it is supplied with adequate nutrients. Energy from carbohydrates and fat is needed to mobilize the army of white cells that fight off attacks. Vitamins and minerals are essential components of many chemicals produced to defend the body (see <a href=""entry://antioxidant""><span class=""links"">antioxidant</span></a>). A deficiency or an overdose of any nutrient is likely to harm the immune system.<br class=""nLine"" />The immune system is also affected by the physiological and psychological stress of exercise. Although the results of scientific investigations are not clear, it appears that low to moderate levels of exercise are generally beneficial, activating the immune system and improving its ability to defend the body against disease. Exercise may boost the production of natural killer cells. One of their main duties is to destroy cancer cells before they can develop into full-blown tumours. However, there seems to be a critical level of exercise, specific to each individual, above which the immune system becomes increasingly compromised (see also <a href=""entry://general adaptation syndrome""><span class=""links"">general adaptation syndrome</span></a>). Many athletes preparing for a major competition push themselves to their mental and physical limits, exceed their critical level, and succumb to illness. Elite athletes walk a tightrope between supreme physical condition and a breakdown of health. A new test that uses saliva samples is being devised for monitoring the competence of the immune system. This should help athletes and others know when they should take particular care to avoid overtraining."

"incentive","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>incentive</b><div class=""content"">A factor that motivates a person to achieve a particular goal. People need positive incentives to encourage them to exercise regularly and to eat healthily. Incentives are especially important for competitive sports people who have to train intensively and strictly regulate their diets to achieve success. Incentives vary from individual to individual, but most people are attracted towards activities which offer the following:<blockquote>•&nbsp;pleasant sensations (sensory incentive)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;novel situations, providing varied and exciting stimuli (curiosity incentive)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;reassurance and support from a group (affiliation incentive)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;an opportunity to work independently (independence incentive)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;a feeling of self-control and not being dominated by others (power incentive)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;low levels of frustration and hostility (aggression incentive)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;a strong sense of achievement and success (achievement incentive).<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> A particular incentive will direct a person's immediate behaviour towards a particular goal only if it is the strongest of all competing incentives. Sport psychologists generally agree that the achievement incentive is often the greatest driving force for competitive athletes. Psychologists also recognize that in order to reach long-term goals, a sense of achievement must be reinforced continually by successful completion of short-term intermediate goals."

<b>indigestion</b>
<i>(dyspepsia)</i><div class=""content"">A pain felt in the upper abdomen (usually just below the breastbone or sternum) after eating. Indigestion may be psychological in origin and associated with stress. It is sometimes due to food intolerance: spicy or fatty foods often cause abdominal discomfort. It may also be a symptom of another disorder (e.g. an ulcer) or, in rare cases, of general disease (e.g. heart failure).<br class=""nLine"" />Some physical activities carried out in a crouched position, such as cycling, encourage the build up of gas in the stomach which presses against the diaphragm.

"infancy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>infancy</b><div class=""content"">The first two years of a child's life. During infancy growth is irregular and occurs in spurts. The different parts of the body grow at different rates. Some bones are only just becoming hardened by ossification and are therefore susceptible to deformation if too much stress is put on them. Swimming under expert supervision is an excellent activity for developing heart, lungs, and muscles in infants, without putting too much strain on bones and joints. There is unanimous agreement among paediatricians that stimulation of the infant through simple playful exercises, such as rolling, kicking, and throwing a ball, is a tremendous help in the infant's physical and mental development."

<b>inositol</b><div class=""content"">A water-soluble sugary substance present in cereals as phytic acid. Inositol is sometimes included in the Vitamin B complex. However, it is not a vitamin because it can be synthesized in the body. It may help to control blood cholesterol levels by promoting the transport of fats to the liver and their utilization once there. It is also claimed that inositol acts as a mild anxiety-reducing factor and that it helps to maintain healthy hair. There is little evidence to support these claims."

"insomnia","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>insomnia</b><div class=""content"">The ability to sleep can be affected by diet and exercise. The nervous anticipation experienced before a major sports competition commonly causes insomnia. People who consume certain foods and drinks (e.g. those which contain caffeine or high levels of salt) may also suffer from the condition. On the other hand, certain foods and drinks (e.g. warm milk) seem to be conducive to a good night's sleep. Also, a vigorous bout of exercise taken during the day (but not immediately before going to bed) may be sufficiently tiring physically to help a person get to sleep.<br class=""nLine"" />Many insomniacs resort to taking drugs (‘sleeping tablets’) to induce sleep, but frequent use should be discouraged. Some drugs, such as the benzodiazepines, are habit forming and have side-effects such as inducing drowsiness when awake, which adversely affect physical performance. Moderate exercise, a change of diet, and relaxation techniques (see <a href=""entry://progressive muscle relaxation""><span class=""links"">progressive muscle relaxation</span></a>) may help a person overcome insomnia."

"insulin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>insulin</b><div class=""content"">A hormone secreted by cells within the islets of Langerhans, in the pancreas. Insulin is released into the bloodstream in response to raised blood glucose levels. It stimulates the liver, muscles, and fat cells to remove glucose from the blood, and to store it as glycogen and fat in cells. It also promotes the conversion of glucose to fat and stimulates protein synthesis in muscles. Inhibition of insulin production (e.g. by adrenaline or exercise) results in increased blood glucose levels. Although insulin secretion is reduced during exercise, sensitivity to insulin increases in well-trained individuals. Lack of insulin or progressive loss of sensitivity to insulin, can result in diabetes mellitus."
"insulin rebound","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>insulin rebound</b>
<i>(rebound hypoglycaemia)</i><div class=""content"">A physiological response to eating too much sugar. The resulting high blood sugar causes an exaggerated insulin response so that the blood glucose level, after initially rising, actually falls to a level lower than it was before eating the sugar. Thus, less glucose than normal is available to respiring muscles. Insulin rebound can be exacerbated by alcohol, for example, drinking gin and tonic can cause a marked abnormal hypoglycaemia."

"intelligence","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>intelligence</b><div class=""content"">Although there is no universally accepted definition of intelligence, it is generally regarded as an ability to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with new situations. There have been many attempts to measure intelligence, the best known being the standardized test which scores an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ). An IQ is the ratio of mental age to actual age (usually expressed as a percentage). It is often used as an index of intellectual development.<br class=""nLine"" />In recent years much research has been conducted on the possible influence of vitamins and minerals on intelligence. It has been claimed that vitamin supplementation can significantly improve a child's learning ability. It is generally accepted that vitamin and mineral deficiencies may retard intellectual development (e.g. iron-deficient children have reduced verbal ability, perform poorly in IQ tests, and have lower powers of concentration). However, the claim that supplements can increase the intelligence of children who show no clinical signs of vitamin or mineral deficiency, are hotly disputed. Until we are all able to agree on a definition of intelligence and on a universally accepted means of testing it, the controversy will continue."
"intensity of exercise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is a permanent committee entrusted with the control and development of the modern Olympic Games. It is responsible for ensuring that the Olympic Games are celebrated in the spirit that inspired their revival in 1894. The IOC elects its own members. Each member speaks either French or English and lives in a country with a National Olympic Committee, approved by the IOC, to promote the Olympic movement and amateur sport in that country. In 1966, the IOC created a body, the International Olympic Committee Medical Commission, to combat doping. It is now divided into four subcommissions with responsibilities that include: combating doping; helping athletes to improve their performances without contravening basic principles; enabling athletes to avoid injury; and disseminating information, such as a code of ethics, to physicians treating athletes and to other interested people."

"interval training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>interval training</b><div class=""content"">A system of training for aerobic fitness that alternates spurts of intensive exertion (work interval) with periods of lower intensity activity (relief period) in one exercise session. By carefully spacing the periods of exertion and relief, more total work can be accomplished than with continuous training. High intensity exercise can also be achieved with less stress and strain than in one continuous session.<br class=""nLine"" />Each session is usually described in terms of an interval training prescription indicating the number of sets or repetitions, training distance, training time, and relief time. Thus, a running session may have the following prescription: one set of six repetitions of 200 metres each run at a pace of about thirty seconds, with a relief period between each run of 1 minute 10 seconds. This can be abbreviated as:<div class=""expo"">Set 1 6 × 200 at 0:30 (1:10)</div><br class=""nLine"" />Interval training for elite athletes was pioneered by the German coach, Gerschler. It is now used by many people as an effective way of becoming fit. Often, the intensity of the work intervals and relief periods are strictly controlled.<br class=""nLine"" />A typical session for a well-conditioned 20-year-old 1500 metre runner might consist of stretching and other warm-up exercises to raise the pulse rate to about 120. Then running 400-metre repetitions at a pace sufficient to raise the pulse to between 170&ndash;180 beats per minute, with the recovery between each repetition consisting of a walk or jog continued until the pulse rate goes down to between 120&ndash;140. Often 20 repetitions are planned for a session, but it should be terminated with cool-down exercises when recovery takes longer than 90 seconds.<br class=""nLine"" />Interval training is infinitely variable and can be adapted to the needs of the total beginner as well as to the prospective world champion. As fitness improves, the length and intensity of each session can be increased gradually. Of course, the principles of interval training can be applied equally well to cycling, swimming, and exercising on machines."

(Vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> is known as an extrinsic factor because it is provided from an external source, the diet). A lack of the intrinsic factor results in a deficiency of vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> because of malabsorption and a decrease in the number of red blood cells, and degeneration of the spinal cord (pernicious anaemia).

"iron","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>iron</b><div class=""content"">Iron is essential to good health. Most iron in the body is contained in haemoglobin and myoglobin, the red pigments that carry oxygen. It also occurs as part of enzymes involved in energy production. A deficiency of iron results in anaemia, a lowering of haemoglobin concentration in the blood. The muscles and tissues are starved of vital oxygen, we feel tired and lethargic, and less inclined to exercise. Other more specific problems may include a sore tongue, cracks at the corner of the mouth, and nails that lack their usual pink flare. Heavy endurance training and bleeding (including menstrual bleeding) can increase the risk of iron deficiency and the need for iron therapy (increased iron intake by dietary adjustment and supplementation). Ten to fifteen percent of women between the ages of 13 and 45 lose more iron in menstrual bleeding than they acquire throughout the month from foods. Therefore, they probably require iron supplements to prevent iron deficiency.<br class=""nLine"" />The best sources of iron are meats, legumes, and watercress. Watercress and some other vegetables may have higher concentrations of iron than some meats, but iron from meat is mainly haem iron, which is easier to absorb than non-haem iron. Meat also contains a factor (not yet identified, but named MFP factor) that increases by four times the absorption of non-haem iron from other foods eaten with the meat. Cooking with traditional cast iron pans or a steel wok significantly increases the iron content of food as the surface releases fine particles, but little (if any) of this iron is absorbed. Vitamin C improves iron absorption, while tannic acid in teas, and phytic acid in many vegetables, interfere with it. (This is why you are advised not to drink large volumes of strong tea with a meal.) Large doses of other minerals (particularly calcium, copper, and zinc) in supplements may also reduce absorption. The recommended daily intake varies, but is about 8&ndash;10 mg for men and 15 mg for women of child-bearing age, increasing in physically active people.<br class=""nLine"" />Too much iron is toxic. It can damage the liver, heart, and pancreas, and irritate the stomach and gut, causing constipation or diarrhoea. If you take iron supplements, therefore, you should be careful not to overload your body."
"irritable bowel syndrome","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>irritable bowel syndrome</b><div class=""content"">A digestive disorder characterised by irregularities in the muscle contractions that normally propel waste through the large intestine to the rectum. This may result in diarrhoea or constipation, or alternating bouts of both. Other symptoms often include abdominal pain, flatulence, excess mucus, nausea, and heartburn. It is not certain what causes irritable bowel syndrome but anxiety, lack of fibre, high fat diets, and smoking tobacco may be contributing factors. Treatment usually involves reducing anxiety, making dietary adjustments (e.g. eating more fibre), and taking regular exercise to improve gut mobility.

Regular jogging and distance running tends to shorten and tighten muscles because movements take place through a restricted range and are repeated many times. It is important therefore to perform stretching exercises to maintain the flexibility of muscles at most risk: the calf muscles, quads, hamstrings, and the muscles of the lower back.<br class=""nLine"" />Individuals (particularly those over 35 years old) who have not exercised for a long time should check their fitness with their physician before jogging. A physician's approval should also be obtained by those with arthritis, osteoporosis, and heart and circulatory problems.<br class=""nLine"" />The following suggestions will help you to maximize the benefits and minimize the injury risks associated with jogging:<blockquote>•&nbsp;perform slow, static stretching exercises before and after jogging<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;if you are a beginner, alternate walking with jogging during a session, and jog no more than three times a week<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;increase your weekly mileage slowly, by no more than 10 per cent to 20 per cent every 2 weeks<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;allow yourself plenty of time to recover. Alternate hard weeks with easy ones. Never run hard on two consecutive days. Have at least one rest day each week. (Risk of injury is greatest for those who jog every day.)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;alternate running with other activities, such as cycling and swimming, so that you reduce stress on your legs.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>"
"joint injury","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>joint injury</b><div class=""content"">Physical damage (such as a sprain, dislocation, or stiffness) to a joint. Sometimes an injury may result in loose bodies, called joint mice, occurring in a joint. These can cause locking and may require surgery. Joint injuries, unlike many muscle injuries, may require absolute rest and immobilization (fixation of the joint to prevent movement). In such cases, any damaged ligaments are kept unstressed while the joint is moved passively by someone else to keep the surrounding muscles fit."

Jump height, therefore, can be used as an indicator of instantaneous power or elastic strength. In order for the jumps of two or more people to be compared fairly, the type of jump must be standardized. For example, the heights attained if a person bobs down before jumping or drops down from a specific height before jumping are usually higher than if the jump is made from a static squat position (see also <a href=""entry://Sargent jump test""><span class=""links"">Sargent jump test</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />A more sophisticated measurement of power can be made using a force platform that records the actual force exerted by a jumper at take off."

It is very rich in iodine, consequently it is sometimes prescribed to treat deficiencies of that trace element. Some manufacturers of dietary products containing kelp claim that their high levels of iodine act as a weight-reducing agent by increasing the production of thyroid hormones (of which iodine is an essential component) and raising metabolic rate. This would result in excess fat being consumed as an energy source. The claim is unlikely to be true for people who are not iodine deficient. An excessively high iodine intake can be toxic."
"ketogenic diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>ketogenic diet</b><div class=""content"">A diet (e.g. a low carbohydrate diet) resulting in the production of high levels of ketone bodies. Ketones are energy-containing organic chemicals formed as a result of the incomplete breakdown of fat. As these materials accumulate, acetone is also produced. This gives the breath a very recognisable smell, similar to nail varnish.<br class=""nLine"" />Ketosis, the production of large amounts of ketones, is a normal response to fasting lasting 4 to 12 hours (e.g. between meals). The ketones are produced from fat reserves to provide fuel for muscle and so spare glucose for use by the brain. A more extreme form of ketosis occurs during starvation, and when the diet is low in carbohydrates and high in fats. Persistent ketosis is associated with muscle wasting; it may also have some other harmful side-effects. Acetone cannot be metabolised and is toxic in high concentrations. The ketones can form acids that upset the acid-base balance in the blood.<br class=""nLine"" />Ketogenic diets are sometimes used to reduce weight in obese people. Some depend on the idea that ketones impair appetite, so you eat less. The effectiveness of a ketogenic diet can be monitored by measuring the amount of ketones in urine; the more ketones, the more effective the diet. Simple kits are available from some pharmacists for doing this. However, most dietitians advise against using these diets.<br class=""nLine"" />Ketogenic diets may have a place in the therapy of people with potentially life-threatening obesity, but they should be used only under medical supervision. They are not really suitable for others; they definitely should not be used by diabetics.<br class=""nLine"" />The best form of weight- and fat-loss diet is one that is balanced, calorie controlled, rich in carbohydrates, and does not cause muscle loss."

<i>(nephrolithiasis; renal stones)</i><div class=""content"">Concretions of calcium salt and uric acid or oxalic acid that form irregularly shaped stones in the kidney. Kidney stones can cause excruciating pain and obstruct the passage of urine. If they present problems, they are usually surgically removed or broken down with ultrasound, but they sometimes pass out of the body spontaneously. Those prone to developing kidney stones should ensure that they drink adequate amounts of water, especially before, during, and after physical exertion. Excessive amounts of protein in the diet can lead to high levels of calcium and increase the risk of developing kidney stones. Body-builders in particular should be aware of this risk. It has been suggested that high intakes of vitamin C cause kidney stones, but this suggestion has been hotly disputed by some nutritionists."
"kinaesthesis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>kinaesthesis</b><div class=""content"">The sense by which motion, weight, and the position of various body parts are perceived. Kinaesthesis depends on the sense organs (proprioceptors called muscle spindles and golgi tendon organs) that monitor the state of contraction of muscles, skin receptors, and the balance receptors in the ear. These all pass information to the brain so that a person is aware of body and limb position during movements. This awareness, known as kinaesthetic perception, is important for many physical activities, especially those involving gymnastic movements.<br class=""nLine"" />Kinaesthetic perception can be determined by testing the ability to distinguish between different weights when blindfolded, or by timing how long a blindfolded person can maintain balance while standing on one leg (see <a href=""entry://blind stork test""><span class=""links"">blind stork test</span></a>)."

"knee","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>knee</b><div class=""content"">The knee joint combines mobility with strength. Mobility is required so that we can move our legs freely, and strength so that we can cope with the tremendous impact forces produced during running and jumping. The knee is the largest joint in the body. It is formed between the thigh bone (femur) and tibia (shin bone). It is a complex joint containing the patella (knee bone), semi-lunar discs of cartilage (menisci), and several ligaments that criss-cross between the tibia and femur (see <a href=""entry://cruciate ligaments""><span class=""links"">cruciate ligaments</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />Although the knee appears to be a hinge joint, it moves in more than one plane. In addition to flexion (bending) and extension (straightening) it can rotate slightly. This is essential during walking and running. Its ability to rotate makes it susceptible to injury during physical activities. Between one quarter to one third of all sports injuries involve the knee. Zipper-like scars decorating the knees of many professional sports people (especially body-builders and weight-lifters) is evidence of the high rate of injury. Many knee disorders involve the patella. There are a number of anatomical factors (for example, flat feet and unequal development of thigh muscles) that predispose a person to patellar injury, but most injuries are due to overuse (see <a href=""entry://chondromalacia patellae""><span class=""links"">chondromalacia patellae</span></a> and <a href=""entry://patellar tendinitis""><span class=""links"">patellar tendinitis</span></a>). Flexibility exercises; correction of foot deformities with orthotics; and knee exercises which improve the alignment and coordination of leg muscles, can minimize patellar problems, but sometimes surgery is needed to realign the forces on the patella. Other knee injuries include dislocations, ligament tears and strains, bursitis (see <a href=""entry://housemaid's knee""><span class=""links"">housemaid's knee</span></a>), and torn cartilage (more correctly called a meniscus tear). Because the knee is such a complex joint involving so many structures, diagnosis of injury is notoriously difficult.<br class=""nLine"" />The following exercises are often performed after recovery from a knee injury to minimize the risk of recurrence (figure 35).<center class=""centre""><img src=""000067.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 35</center><br class=""nLine"" /><span class=""italic"">❏

There is some evidence that fungal toxins (known as aflatoxins) in mouldy food may play a role in the development of some cases of kwashiorkor.

"lactic acid","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>lactic acid</b><div class=""content"">An organic acid formed during energy production from the breakdown of glucose when there is not enough oxygen available for the complete breakdown of glucose, or when there are insufficient mitochondria to take up pyruvate, an intermediate breakdown product of glucose. Mitochondria are the components of the cell which can use oxygen to break down the pyruvate completely and release energy by aerobic respiration or aerobic metabolism. The energy production system which relies mainly on the partial breakdown of glucose to lactic acid, is called the lactic acid system. It takes place without oxygen and is therefore a form of anaerobic metabolism or anaerobic respiration. The lactic acid system provides energy for high intensity activities lasting up to two or three minutes. Lactic acid accumulates in the blood and tissue fluids where, like any acid, it dissolves in water to produce hydrogen ions (protons). The accumulation of protons contribute to muscle fatigue. In addition to protons, lactic acid also produces lactate ions, but these do not have a detrimental effect on muscle activity. When intensive exercise is completed and more oxygen becomes available, the lactic acid is broken down to release more energy, or is converted into glucose which may be stored as glycogen. Lactic acid production increases with exercise, as does the production of lactate ions and protons. During low intensity exercise, lactate concentration is usually less than 2 mmol. per litre of blood but this may rise to 25 mmoll. per litre during high intensity exercise.<br class=""nLine"" />There appears to be a critical level of exercise above which lactate increases dramatically. This has been called the lactate turnpoint and the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA). It has been assumed that the lactate turnpoint represents the anaerobic threshold, the transition between aerobic metabolism and anaerobic metabolism. Below the turnpoint, oxygen supply is sufficient to satisfy energy demands, above it the supply is insufficient. Recent studies have questioned this assumption. Improved mathematical analysis suggests that lactate levels rise as a continuous function of exercise intensity, and therefore the lactate turnpoint does not indicate an anaerobic threshold. Nevertheless, the turnpoint is very useful, indicating the exercise intensity above which the production of lactic acid exceeds the body's capacity to eliminate it. It can be used to establish optimum endurance training intensities: exercising at an intensity just below the turnpoint prevents a large accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles so that performance is not impaired. In addition, endurance training between 85&ndash;90 per cent maximum heart rate tends to raise the lactate turnpoint, indicating that training improves the body's ability to deal with lactic acid production."

<b>lactose</b>
<i>(milk sugar)</i><div class=""content"">A sugar found in milk. It is a disaccharide made by the combination of galactose and glucose. Milk goes sour because the lactose is converted by bacteria into lactic acid. Lactose is an energy-rich food but some people suffer from lactose intolerance in which the consumption of milk (or other foods containing lactose) causes cramps, flatulence, and diarrhoea.<br class=""nLine"" />Lactose intolerance is due to a deficiency in the production of lactase, an enzyme that digests lactose into glucose and galactose. It most often affects people who consume few milk products, but since lactase production tends to reduce with age, a large proportion of the population may suffer some degree of lactose intolerance as they grow older. In fact, most ethnic groups (apart from Caucasians) do not retain lactase past adolescence so most adults are lactose intolerant. A few sufferers can still eat some fermented dairy products, such as buttermilk and yoghurt, or they may be able to obtain lactase-treated products. Others may have to avoid dairy products altogether. These people have to find alternative sources of the nutrients, such as calcium and riboflavin, that they would otherwise obtain from milk or its products."

The involvement of lecithin in fat mobilization has led to it being sold as a slimming aid, but there is no evidence that it helps weight reduction. On the contrary it is probably just as fattening as other vegetable oils. Some coaches prescribe lecithin in post-competition diets because they believe it accelerates recovery."

"leg extension","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>leg extension</b><div class=""content"">A weight-training exercise that strengthens the quadriceps (the muscles at the front of the thighs). It is often used to rectify knee problems caused by weak quadriceps. Leg extensions can be performed on a weight bench that has a special attachment or by sitting at the end of a table and lifting ankle weights (figure 37). The exercise is sometimes performed with one leg at a time to prevent the stronger leg from doing most of the work.<br class=""nLine"" />❏<i> Begin with one leg extended with the foot behind the padded bar of the leg extension attachment. Hold the bench with your hands, and slowly lower your leg about 45 degrees before lifting again. Avoid lowering it all the way down because this puts too much strain on knee ligaments.

"libido","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>libido</b><div class=""content"">The sex drive. A large number of psychological and physiological factors interact to determine an individual's libido. It is often difficult, therefore, to pinpoint the cause for a loss of sexual desire. Nevertheless, a healthy diet and regular exercise can improve a person's sex drive; overindulgence in food, alcohol, or exercise can reduce it.<br class=""nLine"" />Loss of sexual desire in middle age may be linked to lowered levels of sex hormones. This can be alleviated by hormone replacement therapy in females and, possibly, testosterone treatment therapy in men. (Testosterone treatment remains controversial and its effectiveness needs to be tested by clinical trials.) However, reduced sex drive is more likely to be due to non-hormonal causes, such as boredom, domestic or job worries, and mental and physical fatigue. The following advice may help a person cope with the stresses of life and maintain a healthy libido:<blockquote>•&nbsp;avoid overindulgence in food or alcohol<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;eat a healthy, balanced diet<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;take regular (but not excessive) exercise<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;incorporate relaxation exercises into your daily routine to reduce stress.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>See also <a href=""entry://sex and exercise""><span class=""links"">sex and exercise</span></a>."
"lifting","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>lifting</b><div class=""content"">If you do not lift a heavy object properly, you may suffer a serious injury, particularly to your back. More man-hours are lost in industry because of accidents resulting from faulty handling of heavy objects than from any other cause. Similar accidents occur when exercisers use the wrong technique to lift weights. An electronic strain gauge can be used to compare the stress imposed on the back during different activities. The most stressful activity is lifting with the knees straight. The strain on the back is reduced considerably if the body is correctly positioned during the lift. To minimize the risk of injury, it is important to lift objects in a controlled manner, with the minimum of effort and the maximum efficiency and skill.<blockquote>•&nbsp;Stand with your feet about a hips' width apart; this should be a comfortable and stable position from which to make a lift.<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;For most weight-lifting exercises, point your toes forwards, but if you intend carrying an object to a new location, point the toes in the direction in which you want to go.<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;Lower your body by slowly bending your knees.<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;Make full use of your leg muscles and other large muscle groups when lifting an object.<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;Make full use of momentum to produce a smooth, controlled lift; avoid snatched or jerky movements.<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;Keep your back straight, but not stiffly vertical, throughout the lift. Avoid bending your back because this can impose unnecessary strain on the lower back and abdomen.<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;Tuck your chin in during the lift. This helps to keep your back straight by shortening the sternocleidomastoid muscles (large muscles at the front of the neck that lock the upper region of the spine, reducing the tendency for the buttocks to move out of alignment).<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;Ensure you have a broad, even grip on the object by using the full palmed surface of your hands and fingers. Do not interlock your fingers; this can be dangerous because the pressure of heavy weights may prevent you from unlocking your fingers making it difficult to get rid of the load in an emergency.<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;When lifting a heavy weight, keep your arms as close as possible to the centre of your body. Keep your elbows tucked in; do not allow them to wing outwards as this imposes unnecessary strain on your shoulders and may cause you to lean backwards.<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;Use both sides of your body. Avoid regularly lifting or carrying weights on one side of your body. This imposes unilateral strains which can upset a number of body processes and impose mechanical strains which can damage the joints, particularly those in the spine and hips.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>"

<b>liniment</b><div class=""content"">A liquid applied to the skin to warm and protect muscles or to relieve muscle pain and stiffness. Applied externally, liniments certainly provide a warm sensation (very warm if a man carelessly rubs the liniment into the more sensitive regions of his body!). Apart from the psychological benefit of feeling warm, liniments do not seem to have much effect on muscles (except, possibly, to divert blood from the deep muscles to the superficial muscles) and they are no substitute for a proper warm-up routine."

<b>lipoprotein</b><div class=""content"">A combination of a lipid and protein (figure 38). Lipoproteins serve as transport vehicles for fatty acids and cholesterol in the blood and lymph. They are classified according to their density as high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, and very-low-density lipoproteins. Health care workers are interested in the concentration of the different types of lipoproteins in the blood because it has implications for health: a high concentration of low-density lipoproteins appears to present a health risk and is associated with a high incidence of heart disease.<center class=""centre""><img src=""000023.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 38 A lipoprotein</center><br class=""nLine"" />High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) have the highest proportion of protein, are the smallest in size, and carry the least amount of lipid. They transport cholesterol from tissues to the liver where cholesterol is broken down and excreted or used to manufacture other substances. Thus, HDLs seem to accelerate the removal of cholesterol from blood, reducing the likelihood of cholesterol becoming deposited in arterial walls where it can cause blockages. Although many experts think that high levels of HDLs provide some protection against heart disease, the relationship between HDLs and the disease is not simple. The composition of HDLs in an individual varies, and some components seem to be more effective at mopping up cholesterol than others. To further complicate matters, heart disease is absent in some families that have almost no HDLs.<br class=""nLine"" />Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) contain a larger proportion of cholesterol than HDLs. They release the cholesterol where it can be used but continue to carry it in the blood if it is not used. High concentrations of LDLs enable more cholesterol to be transported in the circulatory system. It may be deposited in the walls of blood vessels and cause cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Many medical practitioners agree that it is desirable to have LDL-cholesterol levels below 130 milligrams per decilitre of blood. Raised LDL concentrations (more than 160 milligrams per decilitre) are a sign of a high heart attack risk.<br class=""nLine"" />Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are the largest type. They transport cholesterol and fat in the blood, dropping off these chemicals at sites where they are used. When they unload their contents, VLDLs break down into smaller LDLs that continue to carry cholesterol in the bloodstream.<br class=""nLine"" />Regular aerobic exercise can raise the concentration of HDLs. This is one reason why most medical practitioners regard such exercise as a potent preventative and therapeutic tool against heart disease."

"liposuction","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>liposuction</b><div class=""content"">A body ‘sculpturing’ technique. It involves surgically removing fat from the adipose layers under the skin. Enzymes are injected into the tissue to help loosen and break down the fat. Then a needle is inserted to suck the fat out of the body. It is a relatively quick technique made popular by a number of film stars who have used it to improve their appearance. According to the American Society of Reconstructive Surgeons, liposuction is the country's third most common form of cosmetic surgery. It is estimated that more than 100 000 liposuctions are performed each year.<br class=""nLine"" />Some advertisements for liposuction claim that the technique is simple, safe, and has a permanent effect. But if not carried out properly, the procedure can be unpleasant, ineffective, and sometimes dangerous. Older people with inelastic skin may be left with skin that sags and appears flabby. Blood loss and blood clots can occur during surgery, which may also cause severe bruising. In addition, liposuction is usually carried out under general anaesthetic. This can be traumatic for anyone, but obese people are two to three times more likely to die under general anaesthetic than lean people, and they have a higher risk of post-operative complications.<br class=""nLine"" />It is generally agreed by doctors that liposuction is not an effective long-term treatment for obesity.

Listeria is peculiar in being able to multiply in temperatures as low as -2°C and as high as 42°C. The bacteria are often present in the gut with no ill-effects because the body's defence mechanisms keep the bacterial population within tolerable limits. However, in some susceptible individuals (especially pregnant women and elderly people), listeria can multiply and cause a form of food poisoning called listeriosis. Symptoms range from those like mild influenza to severe inflammation of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord. In pregnant women, listeriosis can terminate pregnancy or damage the foetus."

"low carbohydrate diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>low carbohydrate diet</b><div class=""content"">Low carbohydrate diets are often designed for fast weight loss. This is rarely effective in the long term because it is achieved mainly by loss of water and lean mass. The water is rapidly regained when normal eating is resumed. As well as being ineffective, these diets produce ketones (see also <a href=""entry://ketogenic diet""><span class=""links"">ketogenic diets</span></a>) which can be harmful. Therefore, such diets should only be taken under medical supervision. Low carbohydrate diets can also increase blood cholesterol levels, cause hypoglycaemia, and disrupt the balance of minerals. The diets rarely provide sufficient nutrients and are usually difficult to follow.<br class=""nLine"" />Some people reduce their carbohydrate intake in the mistaken belief that carbohydrates are as fattening as pure fats. However, less fatty tissue is made by eating 2000 Calories of carbohydrates than by eating 2000 Calories of pure fat. Fat overeaters tend to put on weight more easily and to be overweight for longer than carbohydrate overeaters. Stated simply, excess fats are more fattening than excess carbohydrates.<br class=""nLine"" />Far from reducing the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet, most people would benefit from increasing it so that it contributes at least 50 per cent of food energy. Carbohydrate is a better source of energy for exercise than fat. Many dietitians recommend a diet rich in complex carbohydrates as the foundation of a weight-reducing diet, a sports diet, and healthy eating for all."
"low fat diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>low fat diet</b><div class=""content"">Most dietitians advocate a low fat diet. This has often been misinterpreted as meaning very little fat of any kind. However, a very low fat diet (one which contributes less than 7&ndash;10 per cent of food energy) may not provide sufficient essential fatty acids or provide the amount of fat required to absorb enough fat-soluble vitamins. Such a diet may also make it difficult to meet energy requirements. So, fats should not be avoided, but they should be restricted so that they contribute no less than 10 per cent of food energy. The average contribution of fats in western diets is 40&ndash;45 per cent, and health guidelines generally recommend that this should be reduced to less than 35 per cent. It is also recommended that saturated fats and trans fatty acids should contribute no more than 10 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. Trans fatty acids occur in margarines that have been hydrogenated to improve their spreading quality. Some polyunsaturated fats and monunsaturated fats are essential to health, but only in moderate amounts."

<b>lung volume</b><div class=""content"">The volume of air inspired into, expired from, or contained within the lungs during breathing.<br class=""nLine"" />One of the most useful measurements of lung volume is vital capacity: the maximal volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled after taking the deepest breath. Values vary from 3 litres to 6 litres. The actual value is not a very good indicator of fitness because it tends to vary for a number of reasons, including the size and sex of each individual. However, among individuals of the same size and sex, the vital capacity tends to be greater in those who exercise regularly. Usually, relatively fit and healthy individuals can exhale at least 83 per cent of their vital capacity in the first second of exhalation (see <a href=""entry://forced expiratory volume""><span class=""links"">forced expiratory volume</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />At rest, only about half a litre of air is drawn into the lungs with each breath; this is known as the tidal volume. It increases with exercise until it reaches the vital capacity. The total amount of air inhaled each minute (ventilation rate) depends on both the depth and frequency of breathing. At rest, about 12 breaths per minute are taken so that the total volume of air inhaled is about 6 litres. During very strenuous exercise, this can increase to more than 100 litres a minute."

"macrobiotic diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>macrobiotic diet</b><div class=""content"">An oriental dietary system based on the view that all life, including nutrition, is a balance between two energies: yin, representing negative life forces, and yang, representing positive forces.

Generally, meat, eggs, and fish are classified as yang foods; dairy produce, fruits, and sugar are yin types; and cereals, nuts, and vegetables are in between. However, the terms are relative. Apples, for example, are fruits and therefore belong to the yin group, but they are the most yang of the fruits. Since the aim of a macrobiotic diet is to have a correct balance of yin and yang, cereals and vegetables form a bulk of the diet. The diet has been criticized because it discourages the consumption of fruits and because it can be difficult to obtain sufficient calories.

These claims appeal to a desire for easy answers to difficult problems. The only ‘magic formula’ for weight loss with significant scientific backing is a balanced diet and exercise regime that results in a person expending more energy than is consumed. A high carbohydrate, low fat diet, and an exercise regime such as the one below, should help most people lose fat and stay healthy. <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""

"magnesium","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>magnesium</b><div class=""content"">A metallic element essential for life and which has a number of indispensable roles in exercise. Magnesium is an important component of some of the chemicals that aid respiration (the release of energy from food). It also plays a role in the function of nerves, and the contraction of heart and other muscles. Good sources are milk, dairy products, wholegrain cereals, nuts, legumes, and leafy green vegetables, which contain magnesium within their green pigment, chlorophyll. After being absorbed, magnesium is stored in the bones. Excessive intake may cause diarrhoea. A deficiency is rare, but it can lead to neuromuscular problems. High fat diets may reduce magnesium absorption. Not all the fat can be absorbed through the small intestine. Fat remaining in the gut may bind with magnesium to form insoluble soaps which cannot pass through the intestinal wall. The magnesium may be absorbed from the colon after fermentation of the soaps by gut bacteria. However, if these are not functioning properly, serious losses of magnesium may occur. Very high calcium intakes may also interfere with the absorption of magnesium. Magnesium supplements are taken in the belief that they can offer some protection or relief from atherosclerosis, insomnia, premenstrual tension and other menstrual problems, alcoholism, insomnia, heart disorders, and, in children, hyperactivity. Magnesium has been used in some hospitals to reduce the recurrence of a heart attack. The magnesium is given as salts in solution directly into a vein during the first 24 hours after a heart attack."
"making weight","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>making weight</b><div class=""content"">Jockeys, boxers, and wrestlers are among sports people who compete within strict weight categories. They often have to lose weight quickly. Traditionally, if a boxer was slightly overweight immediately prior to a match, he would sweat it off by exercising. This, combined with severely restricting fluid and food intake, would usually enable him to make weight. Then he could take in a large volume of fluid to rehydrate. Unfortunately, the dehydration-rehydration regime leaves a boxer weakened. The dehydration reduces the blood volume which cannot be restored completely in a short time by the rehydration. This reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen, and lowers endurance.<br class=""nLine"" />Some sports people resort to taking diuretic drugs (sometimes called water pills) to lose weight, even though the drugs are banned by the International Olympic Committee. Diuretics help to eliminate water but leave a person prone to dehydration and its harmful effects.<br class=""nLine"" />If you need to make a particular weight category, it is best to adopt a long-term strategy. Eat sensibly and exercise so that if you need to lose weight, you do so gradually without harming your performance or putting your health at risk."

The psychological effects of marijuana include sedation, relaxation, and euphoria. It may disturb the sense of balance and reduce aggression. Persistent marijuana smoking is incompatible with serious training because it tends to demotivate exercisers.<br class=""nLine"" />Many people argue that, compared to alcohol, marijuana is harmless and should be legalized.

"martial arts","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>martial arts</b><div class=""content"">The martial arts were originally concerned with preparing men for battle. They no longer have a military role, but still retain an aggressive element. There are many forms, including aikido (meaning ‘way of harmony’); hapkido (a Korean form of martial art, very similar to aikido); jiu-jitsu (‘compliant techniques’); judo (‘compliant way’); karate (‘way of the empty hand’); kung-fu (a form of Chinese boxing); and tae kwon do (‘foot, hand, way’). Many of the techniques in martial arts have developed from jiu-jitsu which was first used in Japan as a ruthless means of self-defence involving throws, strangleholds, arm- and wrist-locks, kicks, punches, and chops. However, each modern form of martial art requires its own particular combination of skills. Some emphasize dynamic, precise, and direct movement (e.g. karate); others utilize softer, slower, and more continuous movements (e.g. aikido). Each martial art also has its own fitness requirements including strength, flexibility (especially around the pelvis), muscle coordination, and endurance.<br class=""nLine"" />Martial arts are performed by males and females of a wide age range. Karate and tae kwon do have more than 200 000 participants in the USA, including 40 000 children. People choose to study martial arts for a variety of reasons: to acquire self-defence techniques; to improve cardiovascular fitness, strength, flexibility, and self-esteem; and to enjoy the artistic expression of the sport.<br class=""nLine"" />Although martial arts are contact sports, injuries are relatively rare. This is probably due to the excellent supervision in most clubs and the insistence on high levels of self-discipline. In a comparison of injuries per 100 000 participants, martial arts came bottom of the list (16.9) with the most common injuries being bruises, contusions, sprains, and strains. Basketball was top of the list (188.0) and even dancing (18.8) had a higher injury rate than martial arts. Unlike most dancing injuries, however, some of the injuries sustained doing martial arts can be serious. These include concussion, fractures, and paralysis. On at least three occasions, blows to the front of the abdomen or chest have resulted in fatalities because of damage to soft organs. However, fatalities are very rare. A more common serious risk is an injury to the head from kicks, punches, and chops (prohibited in some martial arts, such as judo). Repeated head injuries, even if there is no concussion, can cause brain damage (see <a href=""entry://punch-drunk syndrome""><span class=""links"">punch-drunk syndrome</span></a>). Because of the potential dangers, both physical and psychological, it is important that prospective participants join reputable clubs with competent instructors."
"massage","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>massage</b><div class=""content"">Rubbing, kneading, and tapping of body parts. It has been called the world's oldest therapy. It is used by exercisers to warm, stretch, and relieve tension in muscles prior to and immediately after strenuous activity. Massage may increase blood flow through muscle, helping the body to remove lactic acid that has built up during strenuous exercise. Many people also use massage to relieve fatigue and pain caused by injury to muscles and soft tissues. Massage may orientate collagen fibres in scar tissue so that subsequent stretching is less likely to result in an injury. Many experts believe, however, that massage has little beneficial effect on recovery and, if used immediately after injury, can be harmful.<br class=""nLine"" />Massage often forms part of a weight-reducing regime in health clinics. Some masseurs claim that, by stimulating circulation, massage can decongest tissue and help remove fat. A special form of massage, called connective tissue massage, is directed at pummelling surplus flesh in an attempt to break up hard, adhesive fat, and flatten unsightly bulges. However, the massage itself will not reshape or slim the body.<br class=""nLine"" />Other common forms of massage used by exercisers and slimmers are: <blockquote>•&nbsp;CROSS FRICTIONAL MASSAGE, in which the masseur applies firm pressure for short distances across the line of the muscle or tendon growth. It is thought to break down scar tissue<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;DEEP MASSAGE, in which a firm pressure is applied to treat deep muscle injuries<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;DEEP STROKING, performed by moving the pads of the thumbs along the length of a muscle, starting from the point farthest from the heart and moving towards it. Deep stroking moves blood and lymph through the muscle, removing fluid built up during exercise. This type of massage can be painful, causing tension that can be relieved by another form of massage called jostling<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;EFFLUAGE (OR EFFLEURAGE), consisting of superficial or deep stroking movements, administered with the flat of the hand and fingers. It stimulates circulation of the blood and lymph<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;FANNING, in which the masseur begins with hands together, then spreads them out to cover a muscle by moving away from a central point out to the edges of the muscle. Fanning is applied to muscles such as those of the chest and abdomen which radiate from the body's centre. It provides equal pull and pressure over the whole muscle to improve circulation<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;JOSTLING, in which a relaxed muscle is grasped at its fixed attachment point (the origin) and shaken gently back and forth. The stroke continues all the way down the muscle to the opposite point of attachment (insertion) and then back again<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;KNEADING, in which groups of muscles are held between the thumb and fingers of both hands and squeezed. Each hand works alternately in a rhythmical way up and down the muscle in a manner reminiscent of kneading dough. Kneading is used to assess the state of muscle tension. It may also help to pump blood and tissue fluids through muscle, accelerating recovery by helping to remove the waste products of exercise<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;LOCAL CROSS-FIBRE STROKE, is a gentle but deep massage applied with the thumb or fingertips across muscles in which there are problem areas that feel hard. It is used during rehabilitation but not on newly injured areas<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;TAPOTEMENT, massage technique in which the fingertips, palms, and sides of the hands create tapping and slapping movements. It stimulates circulation and helps to remove the waste products to exercise.<br class=""nLine"" />
</blockquote>Although massage may be beneficial, it can also be harmful if applied incorrectly: massage of recently damaged tissue may disturb a clot and cause further internal bleeding. People suffering from heart, circulatory (e.g. varicose veins), or skin problems should not subject themselves to a massage."

"maximal heart rate","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>maximal heart rate</b>
<i>(HRmax)</i><div class=""content"">The highest heart rate that can be achieved during exercise. It can be determined directly on a heart rate monitor when running to exhaustion, but this is not always a safe or practical procedure. It should be attempted only with a doctor's approval. Therefore it is usually assumed that the absolute maximal heart rate is 220 and that it decreases by a value of one beat per year of life. Thus, an individual's maximal heart rate (HRmax) can be estimated using the formula: <div class=""expo"">HRmax = 220 &ndash; age (in years)</div> The estimate may be subject to errors of 10 per cent or more and actual values may exceed the theoretical limit. For example, maximal heart rates of 250 beats per minute have been recorded in cross-country skiers subjected to intense workloads. Values vary according to the type of exercise performed: for example, HRmax is about 13 beats per minute less for an activity which uses mainly upper body muscles (e.g. swimming), than for an activity which uses mainly lower body muscles (e.g. cycling). Maximal heart rate is often used as a guide to exercise intensities. Exercise physiologists recommend that unconditioned people train at a heart rate of between 60&ndash;70 per cent maximal heart rate. Thus a forty-year-old person with a maximal heart rate of 180 would maintain a training heart rate of between 108 and 126 beats per minute. The generally recommended training heart rate for a moderately fit person is between 70 and 80 per cent HRmax, and that for a highly-conditioned, competitive athlete is more than 80 per cent HRmax."
"maximal oxygen consumption","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>maximal oxygen consumption</b><div class=""content"">Maximal oxygen consumption (often abbreviated to VO<sub class=""ind>2</sub> max) is the maximum volume of oxygen consumed per minute. The fitter a person is, the more oxygen he or she can draw from the blood. Oxygen is extracted from air in the lungs, transported in the blood, and then utilized by respiring tissues to release energy from food. The energy that is released is used to synthesize ATP, a high energy compound which is the only direct source of energy for the body's activities. Maximal oxygen consumption is therefore a measure of a person's ability to use aerobic respiration as a source of energy. As such, it also reflects a persons aerobic work capacity, endurance capacity, and maximal aerobic power.<br class=""nLine"" />Maximal oxygen consumption is usually expressed in units of millilitres of oxygen consumed per kilogram body mass per minute. It is determined during a large muscle group activity (e.g. cycling or running). The intensity of the activity is progressively increased until exhaustion. Sometimes maximal oxygen consumption is expressed as litres of oxygen consumed per minute, to indicate total work capacity. The average value for a 20-year-old female is between 32&ndash;38 ml/kg/min; for a 20-year-old male it is 36&ndash;44 ml/kg/min.<br class=""nLine"" />Maximal aerobic capacity can improve with training. The amount of improvement is highly individualized and inversely related to the initial level of fitness. A sedentary person may experience as much as a 25 per cent increase in VO<sub class=""ind>2</sub> max after only 8 weeks training; someone used to aerobic exercise may experience 5 per cent improvement or less in the same time. There is an upper limit of oxygen consumption beyond which training has no effect. This limit seems to be genetically determined and may be reached after 18&ndash;24 months of intensive endurance training."

<b>McCutchen's weeping lubrication theory</b><div class=""content"">The theory that when a joint is moved during a load-bearing exercise, the fluid within the joint cavity (synovial fluid) is squeezed in and out of the articular cartilage (cartilage lining the ends of the bones forming the joint). Synovial fluid contains nutrients that nourish the cartilage, and help it to grow and repair itself. This may be one reason why moderate exercise is beneficial to joint mobility. Of course, excessive exercise may wear down the cartilage faster than it can be repaired and reduce joint mobility."
"meal replacement diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>meal replacement diet</b><div class=""content"">An artificial diet especially formulated to replace food eaten at a normal meal. Meal replacement diets are designed to replace one or two meals per day as part of a calorie controlled diet. They usually come in the form of milkshakes, soups, biscuits, bars, and drinks. Most are made from sugar and milk, and contain a filler or bulking agent (e.g. plant fibre or gum; see <a href=""entry://guar gum""><span class=""links"">guar gum</span></a>) which helps you to feel full, as well as sufficient vitamins and minerals to meet or exceed requirements. Some manufacturers claim that the cellulose they use as a filler also reduces appetite. This claim has not been substantiated to the satisfaction of the food authorities in the United States, who have banned the use of cellulose in over-the-counter diet products. Some meal replacement diets incorporate additional substances that are claimed to aid weight loss, for example, by reducing appetite or increasing metabolism.<br class=""nLine"" />Meal replacement diets may be effective if used properly because they provide fewer calories per day than the average person requires to maintain weight. It is, however, important to follow the instructions carefully and include real meals in your eating plan. A major criticism of most meal replacement diets is that they do not help overweight people adopt good eating habits that would enable them to maintain weight loss without continually returning to the diet.<br class=""nLine"" />Some meal replacement diets that include fillers or bulking agents are not suitable for certain groups of people (e.g. those with high blood pressure) because they may cause problems similar to those caused by very low calorie diets (e.g. fatigue and heart irregularities). Many of the problems seem to be due to dehydration associated with consuming the fillers and bulking agents. The problems can be avoided by drinking plenty of water. You are, nevertheless, advised to consult your doctor before starting a meal replacement diet. Remember, doctors do not recommend diets of less than 1000 Calories per day without medical supervision.

A typical session for one exercise in which the ball is thrown from a standing position, would consist of five sets of 10 repetitions with one minute rest between each set."
"Mediterranean diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Mediterranean diet</b><div class=""content"">Typically, a diet rich in pasta, bread, fruit, and vegetables, with moderate amounts of poultry and fish, cooked in olive oil and washed down with red wine. The Mediterranean diet is reputed to be among the healthiest in the world. Epidemiological studies show that Mediterraneans suffer less heart disease than people from northern Europe. Nutritionists believe that the typical Mediterranean diet reduces fat and increases the level of natural antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, significantly reducing the risk of heart attack.<br class=""nLine"" />Some people question the wisdom of a having a diet in which up to 40 per cent of the calories come from fat, and which encourages the use of alcohol. However, the fats in a Mediterranean diet are of a particular kind. Olive oil, the main fat in many meals, is very rich in monounsaturates. These are believed to protect cell membranes against the harmful effects of free radicals. The oily fish used in a Mediterranean diet (e.g. sardines and mackerel), are rich in long chain fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (ESA). This acid apparently makes the blood less likely to clot and also makes the heart less prone to dangerous irregular contractions. The Mediterranean diet (especially of Cretans) often includes a salad made of walnuts and purslane. This is rich in alpha-linolenic acid, a fatty acid known to protect heart attack patients from further attacks. In moderate amounts, red wine is believed to reduce the risk of heart attacks by making blood less likely to clot. (This effect of wine is thought also to explain the ‘French paradox’; the relatively high longevity of French people despite their notoriously high alcohol consumption.)<br class=""nLine"" />The benefits of a Mediterranean diet could, therefore, be due to any of a number of dietary factors. Some researchers think that the lifestyle of Mediterraneans also has health benefits. Many Mediterraneans still tend crops and live stock. This will give them the same benefits as regular, vigorous aerobic exercise."

"megavitamin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>megavitamin</b><div class=""content"">A large dose of a particular vitamin. Megavitamins are sometimes used under medical supervision to treat specific diseases. Generally, they are not recommended for use except by those suffering from a vitamin deficiency. Some vitamins, for example, vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub>, niacin, and the fat-soluble ones like vitamins A and D, can be poisonous in high doses. However, Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize winning biochemist, suggested everyone would benefit from taking megadoses of vitamin C. He recommended 1 or 2 grams per day, 20&ndash;40 times the Recommended Daily Amount, to protect the body from cold viruses and other diseases. Preliminary tests of Pauling's claims indicate that there are only a few instances in which taking more than 100&ndash;300 milligrams per day is beneficial; when more than 100 mg is taken in one day, most of the vitamin is excreted unchanged in the urine. Doses of more than 1000 milligrams (1 gram) per day may be harmful to certain people causing nausea, abdominal cramps, and diarrhoea. Pauling's most controversial suggestion was that megadoses of vitamin C might be effective against certain cancers. There is no doubt that adequate amounts (i.e. between 30 and 100 milligrams per day) of vitamin C are needed to defend the body against the onset of cancer, but there is no evidence that megadoses of vitamin C act as a cancer cure."
"menarche","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>menarche</b><div class=""content"">The onset of menstruation defined by the first appearance of menstrual flow. The age of menarche varies from country to country, but in the USA and UK it generally begins at about 12 to 13 years of age. The age of menarch has come down on average over the last two generations, with diets being generally more adequate during childhood. However, girls who exercise strenuously, particularly female athletes with long, lithe bodies, may have their menarche delayed until their late teens. It is not clear whether this has long-term beneficial or harmful effects, but generally the later the menarche the higher the incidence of subsequent menstrual irregularities. See also <a href=""entry://amenorrhoea""><span class=""links"">amenorrhoea</span></a>."
"meniscus","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>meniscus</b> (pl. menisci)<div class=""content"">A semi-lunar disc or wedge of cartilage within a joint such as the knee. Menisci may modify the shape of the surfaces of articulating bones and increase joint stability during complex movements. They also improve resistance to large, compressive loads by absorbing energy and reducing the mechanical shock that other joint structures would otherwise have to withstand.<br class=""nLine"" />Meniscal injuries are quite common. The inner meniscus of the knee is especially susceptible to damage by rotatory stresses and to excessive pressures (e.g. those produced by a weight-lifter performing full squats). Repeated twisting movements and changes in direction, such as those performed by footballers, may result in a torn cartilage (meniscal tear). The injury can be so painful that it can cause the knee to ‘give way’. Movement is restricted because the knee can no longer be fully extended. The injury may also lead to the development of cysts which do not heal.<br class=""nLine"" />Meniscal tears may require surgery to remove detached fragments. Once removed, the space occupied by the meniscus is filled by a replacement material, but this is not of the same type or quality as the original meniscus. Consequently, joint stability becomes marginally worse and the likelihood of arthritis in later life is significantly increased."
"menopause","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>menopause</b><div class=""content"">Menopause is, strictly speaking, a woman's last menstrual period, but the term is commonly used to refer to the changes that lead up to the last time ovulation and menstruation take place. Menopause usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age, but may start when a woman is in her thirties. Menopause is associated with changes in hormonal balance, which can lead to some unpleasant emotional and physical effects. Post-menopausal women have lower levels of the reproductive hormones, oestrogen and progesterone. Low concentrations of these hormones are linked to bone loss and osteoporosis (brittle bone disease).<br class=""nLine"" />Many post-menopausal women minimize or delay the effects of menopause by taking hormone replacement treatment (HRT) consisting of low doses of oestrogen and progesterone administered in pill form or as a skin patch. John Studd, a gynaecologist at King's College Hospital in London, is quoted as saying that HRT was probably ‘… the most important advance in preventive medicine in the Western world for half a century.’ (<i>New Scientist</i>. <b>140</b>:21. October, 1993.) HRT can slow down bone loss and protect against heart attack. There is also some evidence that HRT may reduce the risk of uterine cancers, but other evidence suggests that some forms of HRT may actually increase uterine cancers. In the UK, the number of post-menopausal women taking HRT doubled between 1990 and 1993, from 9 per cent of women to 18 per cent. However, HRT is not suitable for all women; it is contraindicated for some who have had breast cancer, or who suffer from diabetes, asthma, heart disease, and some other disorders. For these people, and for those not wishing to take HRT, exercise may offer some benefits. Regular load-bearing exercise can increase spinal bone density up to 20 per cent, even in women who do not take hormone replacement treatment. As well as reducing the risk of osteoporosis, moderate exercise enables many women to cope with the psychological stresses of menopause by helping them to relax, and by boosting their self-esteem."
"menstruation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>menstruation</b><div class=""content"">The discharge of blood and fragments of the uterine wall at approximately monthly intervals during the menstrual cycle. The cycles begin at puberty and end at menopause. During menstruation, most women experience feelings of lassitude or fatigue. Women who exercise strenuously are particularly susceptible to iron-deficiency anaemia because of blood losses. They need higher than normal levels of haemoglobin to carry the oxygen they require for exercise. Athletes can take hormones, such as oestrogen, progesterone, and progestogens, to adjust the time of menstruation. Although most sports women perform less well during menstruation, a few perform better. World and Olympic titles have been won at all stages of the menstrual cycle.<br class=""nLine"" />The effects of exercise on menstruation varies from one individual to another but reported effects include the following: <blockquote>•&nbsp;delayed onset of the first menstruation, common in participants in sports such as gymnastics that require a slim physique<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;shortening of cycle by up to 4 days<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;reduced menstrual pain associated with regular aerobic exercise<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;increased failure to ovulate or menstruate in up to 50 per cent of competitive track and field athletes.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> See also <a href=""entry://amenorrhoea""><span class=""links"">amenorrhoea</span></a> and <a href=""entry://premenstrual tension""><span class=""links"">premenstrual tension</span></a>."

Individuals who have good mental health are well-adjusted to society, are able to relate well to others, and basically feel satisfied with themselves and their role in society.<br class=""nLine"" />Breakdown of mental health is a major problem in Western societies: it has been estimated that at least one in four adults will suffer from some form of mental disorder, such as depression, during their life. Many physicians and psychologists believe that individuals are physical, mental, and spiritual beings and that these aspects are interrelated. Consequently, mental health is not possible without both physical and spiritual health.<br class=""nLine"" />Although there is no clear cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and mental health, aerobic exercise can improve self-esteem, lessen anxiety, and relieve depression. Exercise can act as a form of meditation, changing the state of consciousness and providing a distraction from stressful situations. Many doctors believe that exercise improves mental health and prescribe exercise to relieve depression and anxiety. Walking is the most frequently prescribed exercise, followed by swimming, bicycling, strength training, and running."

Minerals play a vital role in blood formation; blood clotting; regulation of heart rate; nerve and muscle activity; bone formation; and digestion. Soluble mineral salts also help to control the composition of body fluids. Several minerals, known as macrominerals, are needed in large amounts. These include calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and sulphur (mainly present as part of the amino acids methionine and cysteine). Chlorine is also required in large amounts and is obtained mainly as sodium chloride. Minerals required in very small amounts (milligrams or micrograms per day) are called trace elements or microminerals. Trace elements known to be important include chromium, cobalt, copper, fluorine, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and selenium. A number of other minerals are known to be important for other animals, but their role in humans has not been clearly demonstrated. These include nickel, tin, silicon, and vanadium."

<b>mode of exercise</b><div class=""content"">One of the four main exercise variables affecting the attainment of physical fitness. The others are duration, frequency, and intensity of exercise. Most people exercise to develop or maintain their cardiorespiratory fitness. To achieve this, the exerciser should choose a rhythmical aerobic activity that uses large muscle groups. The exercise should also allow the intensity to be sustained for long periods. Activities that fulfil these criteria include aerobic dance, cycling, jogging, cross-country skiing, rowing, swimming, and walking. Similar cardiorespiratory benefits are gained from each of these activities as long as the intensity, duration, and frequency of each is the same and basic training principles are followed. According to a survey by the National Sporting Goods Association, the most popular mode of exercise in the USA is walking (64.4 million participants), with swimming ranked second (61.4 million)."

"mood swings","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>mood swings</b><div class=""content"">It is common knowledge that what you eat can affect how you feel and, conversely, that how you feel can affect what you eat. Many people feel depressed, agitated, and tense before eating carbohydrate-rich foods, but happy and relaxed afterwards. High protein, low carbohydrate diets are sometimes associated with feelings of depression and an intense craving for foods such as chocolate.<br class=""nLine"" />Until about 30 years ago, most nutritional scientists denied that mood can be affected by diet. They believed that the membrane separating the blood from the brain (the blood-brain barrier) effectively kept dietary chemicals out of the brain. More recent research has forced many of these scientists to change their mind. It has been demonstrated that certain chemicals, such as the amino acid tryptophan, can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and affect behaviour. Mood appears to be affected by a complex interaction between diet and other factors, including sex, hormone levels, time of day, and even time of month. After eating carbohydrates, men tend to become calmer and women sleepier. A high carbohydrate meal eaten for breakfast usually has less effect than the same meal taken at lunch. Women tend to have a keener desire for carbohydrates for the 10 days before menstruation than during the 10 days after.<br class=""nLine"" />Although most scientists now agree that diet can cause mood swings, they are still unsure about the precise mechanisms involved. As yet, they are unable to predict with certainty the effects of specific types of food on the mood of a particular individual.

"motivation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>motivation</b><div class=""content"">High motivation is the key to success in any endeavour. It may come from within a person (intrinsic motivation) or from external influences (extrinsic motivation). For example, intrinsic motivation is derived from engaging in exercise for its own sake, for the satisfaction and the sheer enjoyment it brings, and for no external reason. Those who are intrinsically motivated give up less easily and generally achieve higher levels of fitness than those who are solely motivated by external rewards such as praise, money, and trophies.<br class=""nLine"" />The motivation to lose weight may also have intrinsic and extrinsic components: the dieter may get a great sense of well being from eating healthily (intrinsic motivation), or may be dieting mainly to acquire a body shape that gains praise and acceptability (extrinsic motivation).<br class=""nLine"" />Coaches and trainers recognize the importance of motivation and often adopt special strategies to improve or maintain it. Motivational strategies include providing competition; giving pep talks, praise and constructive criticism; and setting appropriate short-term goals (see <a href=""entry://goal""><span class=""links"">goal</span></a>). In order to train successfully, exercisers must have sufficient motivation to expend time and energy on their training and be able to endure a certain amount of fatigue, boredom, and discomfort. Many coaches adopt the attitude encapsulated in the phrase ‘No pain, no gain!’, but this should not be taken as an exhortation to overtrain and become injured or ill."

The trainee can assume a starting position without having to support any weights; there is no fear of losing balance or of the weights slipping; and the weights can be released without danger at any time.<br class=""nLine"" />Multi-gyms are also simple and convenient to use. Multiple weights enable a trainee to vary resistance almost instantaneously, and it is easy to shift from one exercise to another. Since their introduction, multi-gyms have become very popular in sports clubs, fitness clubs, and even in the home. Because of their safety, simplicity, and convenience, they are especially valuable for the beginner. However, many experienced weight-lifters prefer free weights (barbells, dumbbells etc.) which allow them to perform complex movements.

There is little evidence about its efficacy or safety."
"muscle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>muscle</b><div class=""content"">There are three main types of muscle: cardiac (heart) muscle, smooth muscle, and striated (or skeletal) muscle. They all contain cells specialized for contraction. The cells convert chemical energy from food into mechanical energy, producing tension and movement.<br class=""nLine"" />Cardiac muscle is very odd in that it contracts rhythmically, even when removed from the body. This inherent rhythm is the basis of the heartbeat, variations of which are controlled by signals from nerves and hormones (e.g. adrenaline). Cardiac muscle is unique in never suffering fatigue. However, it will stop contracting if starved of oxygen or nutrients, or if the tissue fluid is of the wrong chemical composition.<br class=""nLine"" />Smooth muscle occurs in many parts of the body (e.g. gut and womb lining) where it produces slow, long-term contractions. Although smooth muscles usually contract involuntarily, it is possible to bring them under conscious control by training. Infants learn quite quickly (but probably never quickly enough for parents) to control the smooth muscle of the anal sphincter. Unfortunately, some people, especially elderly women, have great difficulty maintaining control of these sphincter muscles and suffer from incontinence. Special exercises (see <a href=""entry://pelvic floor exercises""><span class=""links"">pelvic floor exercises</span></a>) can help to improve control.<br class=""nLine"" />Skeletal muscles are attached to bones (figures 42, 43, and 44). When they contract they pull bones closer together or enable parts of the body to resist external forces. They are responsible for locomotion and movements used in physical activities. Contractions are usually under conscious control, therefore the muscle is sometimes referred to as voluntary muscle. There are approximately 600 skeletal muscles, each consisting of contractile muscle fibres wrapped in connective tissue, and supplied with blood vessels and nerve fibres. A muscle fibre is a cell with many nuclei. Under the microscope, it appears to consist of bands of light and dark fibres. Each muscle block comprises between 10 000 and 450 000 fibres.

"muscle balance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>muscle balance</b><div class=""content"">When weight training, it is good to work muscles on both sides of a joint. This achieves muscle balance. It reduces the risk of injury and improves physical performance. Muscle balance in the upper arm, for example, is achieved by training both the biceps (flexors that straighten the elbow) and triceps (extensors that bend the elbow). See also <a href=""entry://superset system""><span class=""links"">super-set system</span></a>."
"muscle bulk","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>muscle bulk</b><div class=""content"">The absolute volume of muscle in the body. A large muscle bulk is advantageous in contact sports both to give protection against opponents and to provide the momentum to dislodge opponents. Muscle bulk tends to decrease with age, but regular aerobic exercise delays this degeneration. It also decreases with inactivity (see <a href=""entry://atrophy""><span class=""links"">atrophy</span></a>). Unlike fatty tissue, muscle has a high metabolic activity and people with a large muscle bulk have a higher basal metabolic rate than those with low muscle bulk."
"muscle contraction","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>muscle contraction</b><div class=""content"">The electrochemical process of generating tension within a muscle. You would be forgiven for thinking that when a muscle contracts it shortens. This does happen in some types of contraction (concentric contractions), but muscles can also lengthen during a contraction (eccentric contractions), or stay the same length (isometric contractions). Consequently, many exercise physiologists prefer to use the phrase ‘muscle action’, because this does not imply a change in muscle length.<br class=""nLine"" />Concentric contractions occur when a muscle develops sufficient muscle tension to overcome a resistance. The muscle shortens visibly to move a body part. Concentric contractions may be isokinetic or isotonic.<br class=""nLine"" />During isokinetic contractions a muscle shortens at constant speed (or constant angular velocity) over the full range of motion. During a full isokinetic contraction, the tension developed by a muscle is at its maximum throughout its whole range. To perform a controlled isokinetic contraction, special equipment is needed which contains a speed governor so that the speed of movement is constant no matter how much tension is produced by the contracting muscle. Training that uses isokinetic contractions is thought to increase the blood supply to skeletal and cardiac muscle, and therefore it improves muscle strength, endurance, and cardiac fitness. Because high muscle tensions are exerted at each phase of movement, isokinetic contractions strengthen the whole muscle. In addition, isokinetic exercises can be designed to mimic the actual speeds of sports-specific activities. This is thought to improve neuromuscular coordination so that more muscle fibres can be recruited and muscles can contract more efficiently. The major disadvantages of isokinetic exercises are that they can only be performed properly on machines which are usually expensive, and the types of movement that can be performed are rather limited.<br class=""nLine"" />Isotonic contractions are the most common type of contraction (figure 48). The muscle changes length and takes a joint through a specific range of motion against a fixed resistance; the muscle may shorten (concentric contraction) or lengthen (eccentric contraction). Isotonic exercises often involve raising and lowering a weight. The speed of movement is controlled by the exerciser but the load remains constant. Isotonic exercises are good for developing strength and cardiovascular endurance. Unfortunately, the efficiency of joints vary with joint angles; consequently, unlike isokinetic contractions, a fixed resistance may not provide a sufficient workload over the complete range of motion to give maximum training benefits. <center class=""centre""><img src=""000064.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 48 Pain cycle</center><br class=""nLine"" />An eccentric contraction causes a muscle to lengthen under tension. Such contractions are used to resist external forces such as gravity. The quadriceps muscles, for example, undergo eccentric contractions when a person walks down steps, runs downhill, or lowers a weight. Eccentric contractions also occur during the deceleration phases of running.<br class=""nLine"" />Training in which eccentric contractions predominate tends to cause significantly greater muscle soreness than other forms of training, though it may protect against future muscle soreness. Strong muscle fibres may replace weak ones, and neuromuscular coordination improve, so that forces are distributed more effectively. To get the maximum benefit from weight training using eccentric contractions, the weights must be lowered slowly and in a controlled manner.<br class=""nLine"" />Isometric contractions are static contractions during which muscle fibres do not change length. There is no movement of the joint to which the muscle is attached but energy is expended resisting a force that does not move. Isometric contractions occur when a rugby front row forward pushes against opponents in a static scrum, when American footballers perform a block tackle, or when a weight-lifter holds a barbell above his head for a few seconds.<br class=""nLine"" />Exercises involving isometric contractions are good for developing strength, but poor for developing cardiovascular fitness. People suffering from cardiovascular disease (e.g. high blood pressure) are advised not to do them (see also <a href=""entry://isometrics""><span class=""links"">isometrics</span></a>). <center class=""centre""><img src=""000044.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 45 Muscle contraction</center>"
"muscle fibre types","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>muscle fibre types</b><div class=""content"">Top athletes should be careful in their choice of parents. Their ability to compete in a sprint or marathon may be determined more by the type of muscle fibre they inherit than by the training they do. Muscle fibres are multinucleated cells responsible for muscle contractions. Each muscle has between 10 000 and 450 000 fibres. There are two main types that can be distinguished by their colour. Red muscle fibres (also called Type 1 or slow-twitch fibres) acquire their colour from their good blood supply and high myoglobin content. They fatigue slowly, and use glycogen and fat as their fuels. White muscle fibres (also called Type 2 or fast-twitch fibres) have a more moderate blood supply, only use glycogen as fuel, and fatigue more quickly than the red fibres. However, they are bigger than the red fibres and their contractions are much more powerful. Red muscle fibres are adapted for aerobic activities of long duration. White fibres are adapted for short bursts of explosive anaerobic activity. Human muscle has a mixture of fibre types, but endurance athletes have a preponderance of red, slow-twitch fibres while sprinters have a preponderance of white, fast-twitch fibres, as the following table<sup class=""expo""></sup> shows: <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1"" Muscle fibre types <tr><td>AVERAGE % COMPOSITION OF FIBRE TYPE IN THE GASTROCNEMIUS MUSCLES OF ELITE ATHLETES</td></tr>

</table></center> Although the proportion of the main fibre types is largely inherited, there is some evidence that a small proportion of white fibres might be converted into red fibres by endurance training, and total inactivity may result in a decrease of red muscle fibres. The situation is complicated by the fact that there are at least two types of fast-twitch fibre, one of which has properties intermediate between red and white muscle fibres. This is called a fast-twitch oxidative fibre. It is thought that endurance training results in the conversion of some of the extreme type of white fibre (called fast-twitch glycolytic fibre) into the intermediate type, enabling speed to be sustained for longer periods.<br class=""nLine"" />There appears to be a relation between fibre type and body shape, at least in men: slim men tend to have a higher proportion of red muscle fibres than obese men. Red muscle fibres burn up more fat than white fibres. Therefore, if fibre type is largely inherited, it may explain why some people are genetically predisposed to become fat whilst others are predisposed to slimness. Since white fibres fatigue more quickly than red fibres, it may also explain why some obese people find it more difficult to take exercise."

"muscle growth","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>muscle growth</b><div class=""content"">Muscles get bigger mainly by an increase in the size of individual muscle fibres (hypertrophy). However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that growth may also result from an increase in the number of fibres (hyperplasia). Animal experiments have shown that regular, intense resistance exercises can cause fibres to split longitudinally. This fibre splitting is also thought to occur during high-resistance weight training in humans, but it has not been demonstrated conclusively.

"muscle soreness","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>muscle soreness</b><div class=""content"">The muscles of exercisers often become sore. There are two main types of muscle soreness: acute muscle soreness and delayed onset muscle soreness.<br class=""nLine"" />Acute muscle soreness develops during and immediately after exercise. It is thought to be due to an inadequate blood flow to active muscle, resulting in the accumulation of metabolic waste products such as lactic acid.<br class=""nLine"" />Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) develops one or two days after the completion of exercise. The discomfort associated with DOMS may be due to torn muscle fibres or muscle spasms but is most likely to be due to disruption of the connective tissue. DOMS is usually accompanied by increased levels of hydroxyproline in the urine. Hydroxyproline is a chemical similar to an amino acid and is found only in connective tissue. Its presence in the urine is, therefore, an indication of tissue damage.<br class=""nLine"" />DOMS typically affects those who only exercise occasionally or who perform strenuous exercises to which they are unaccustomed. It is greatest following activities that use mainly eccentric contractions in which the muscle lengthens (such as running downhill). Treatment consists of rest and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as aspirin or ibuprofen, to relieve the pain. The degree of muscle soreness is correlated to the amount of tissue damage. Therefore, the greater the muscle soreness after an activity, the longer the recovery time required. Slight discomfort may require only a few extra days rest, but severe pain that makes walking difficult may require a month or more of reduced training. Of course, if symptoms persist, medical advice should be sought."
"muscle strain","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>muscle strain</b>
<i>(muscle pull)</i><div class=""content"">An injury in which a muscle is damaged by being excessively stretched or overworked. It may result from a direct impact that pushes the muscle against an underlying bone. However, many muscle strains in sport are distraction strains, which occur when a muscle accidentally contracts as it is being stretched. They are relatively common in those who attempt to do vigorous exercise without a sufficient warm-up, or in those suffering fatigue and impaired reflexes. The strains may be slight, causing little discomfort and swelling (first degree strain); they may be quite painful but with no muscle tear (second degree strain); or they be very painful and involve a complete tearing of the muscle when the muscle is stretched beyond its tolerance levels (third degree strain, or distraction rupture). Muscle tears most commonly affect muscles that span two joints. For example, contractions of the hamstring cause the knee and hip to move in opposing directions, normally at different times but if both actions occur simultaneously there is a high risk of a muscle tear.

<b>muscle triglyceride</b><div class=""content"">Fat stored in muscle. Fatty acids and glycerol carried to the muscle by the bloodstream are either metabolized (mainly to release its energy), or recombined to make triglycerides, which are stored. Each triglyceride molecule consists of glycerol bound to three fatty acid chains. Recent evidence shows that muscle triglycerides are an important source of energy during prolonged endurance activities, sparing muscle glycogen. Regular aerobic exercise increases the stores of muscle triglycerides."
"muscle-bound","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>muscle-bound</b><div class=""content"">A colloquial term used pejoratively to describe someone with well-developed muscles which limit the range of movement. The term is often associated with weight training. Although large muscles and their tendons can restrict joint movement, the idea that weight training always results in a person becoming muscle-bound is a myth. The risk of muscle bulk developing at the expense of joint mobility occurs only with high-resistance, low repetition exercises that do not incorporate stretching."
"mycoprotein","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>mycoprotein</b><div class=""content"">A protein produced by fungi. One particular fungus, a mould called <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, has been the source of a new type of protein-rich food that goes under the trade name of Quorn. It was first approved for food use in the UK in 1984. The mould is fermented for about six weeks after which the resultant liquid is filtered off and the mycelium heat treated. Flavours and colourings are added, along with a little egg albumen to bind the protein, to form the edible mycoprotein. It is marketed as a versatile meat substitute. Quorn is low in fat and a good source of zinc and thiamin."

<b>myocarditis</b><div class=""content"">Inflammation of the middle, muscular lining of the heart caused by a bacterial or viral infection. The immediate effects of the inflammation can be serious and may lead to heart failure, but full recovery is possible. The risk of contracting myocarditis during a viral infection, such as a cold, increases if you continue strenuous physical exertion. In the past, exercising during a bout of myocarditis was believed to be very dangerous and an important factor in the cause of sudden exercise-related deaths. Recent studies suggest that sudden cardiac death during the presence of viral myocarditis is a rare event. Nevertheless, it would be very foolish for anyone to test the latest opinion by exercising during a fever."
"myoglobin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>myoglobin</b><div class=""content"">A red iron-containing protein present in muscle. It combines with oxygen to form oxymyoglobin which acts as a small oxygen store of about 10 millilitres per kilogram of muscle. This source of oxygen seems to be particularly important during intermittent bursts of activity. Oxygen is released during activity and the oxymyoglobin restored during recovery periods. Muscle rich in myoglobin is sometimes called red muscle. It has a preponderance of slow-twitch muscle fibres and is adapted to endurance activities."
"narcotic","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>narcotic</b><div class=""content"">A drug which when swallowed, inhaled, or injected induces stupor, sleep, and insensibility. Most narcotics are derived from opium, the dried latex of the poppy, <i>Papaver somniferum</i>. Some narcotics, especially morphine and its derivatives, are used in medicine to control moderate to severe pain. However, most have severe side-effects: for example, high doses can reduce breathing movements to the point of asphyxiation. In addition, narcotic use carries a high risk of physical and psychological dependence.<br class=""nLine"" />Narcotics have been used as analgesics (painkillers) in sport, enabling athletes to continue to compete with injuries that otherwise would be incapacitating. There is also evidence that some athletes use them to induce a sense of euphoria and reduce feelings of fatigue. The International Olympic Committee has banned their use. Its list of banned substances includes codeine which, in the UK, is readily available in over-the-counter cough and cold medicines.<br class=""nLine"" />The human body produces its own natural narcotics, encephalins and endorphins. These have pain-relieving effects very similar to those of morphine and they also induce a sense of euphoria (see <a href=""entry://runner's high""><span class=""links"">runner's high</span></a>)."

Training often includes running and agility practice (e.g. doing shuttle sprints, dodging around a series of cones). The quick changes of direction, and landing from jumps, impose considerable strain on the feet and legs. Players should wear shoes specially designed to meet these demands.

<b>niacin</b>
<i>(nicotinamide; nicotinic acid; vitamin B<sub class=""ind>3</sub>)</i><div class=""content"">A water-soluble nutrient belonging to the vitamin B complex. Like other B vitamins, niacin plays an important role in carbohydrate metabolism. It is also indispensable for fat and protein metabolism, and inhibits cholesterol synthesis.<br class=""nLine"" />The link between niacin (specifically nicotinic acid) and cholesterol reduction was first made by Dr R. Altschul in 1955, but it was brought to public attention in 1990 by Robert Kowalski in his book entitled <i>The 8-week cholesterol cure</i>. As a result, some people have taken excessive amounts of niacin in the belief that it will protect against high blood cholesterol levels. This practice is potentially dangerous. High doses (greater than 500 mg per day), or slow-release preparations of niacin which elevate blood concentrations for a long time, can lead to irreversible liver damage. Large doses of niacin can also decrease fat mobilization and the ability to do physical work.<br class=""nLine"" />Although the precise amount varies depending on energy expenditure, approximately 20 milligrams of niacin are needed per day. The body stores very little. It can synthesize niacin from the amino acid tryptophan. This synthesis may be enough to meet the daily requirement, but niacin can also be obtained from foods such as meat, fish, brown rice, beans, and yeast extract (the richest source, with as much as 67 mg per 100 g). Deficiency can result in a disease called pellagra, early symptoms of which include muscular weakness, general fatigue, loss of appetite, indigestion, and minor skin complaints. Pellagra is unlikely to occur in individuals who eat a balanced diet."

"nitrates","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>nitrates</b><div class=""content"">Nitrogen-containing ions (electrically charged atoms) that occur naturally in soils. Soil nitrates are essential for plant growth and levels are increased by artificial fertilizers. Unfortunately, about half the nitrate leaches out into the groundwater and, after a delay of up to 30 years, this nitrate can find its way into public water supplies. After drinking the water, the nitrate may be converted to nitrite by bacteria in the mouth. Once absorbed into the bloodstream, the nitrites can combine with haemoglobin to form a blue pigment, methaemoglobin. The presence of methaemoglobin in the blood reduces its ability to carry oxygen. This can be particularly serious in babies, causing the life threatening ‘blue baby syndrome’. In the UK, nitrate levels in drinking water are monitored. The public are advised (e.g. to give babies bottled water, low in nitrates) when safe levels are exceeded. Nitrate and nitrites are present in small amounts in living animal and plant tissue. Their concentration is significantly higher in preserved cured meats (e.g. bacon and hot dogs) in which they are used to prevent bacterial infections. Nitrates and nitrites have been found to promote cancers of the oesophagus and stomach in laboratory animals, possibly by being converted to carcinogenic nitrosamines. However, the evidence that nitrates cause human cancer is weak and inconclusive. Nevertheless, if nitrates are carcinogenic in humans, vitamin C may offer some protection by inhibiting the conversion of nitrates or nitrites to nitrosamines."

"Nutron diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Nutron diet</b><div class=""content"">A food intolerance diet devised by Dr Patrick Kingsley and Ian Stoakes. Before taking the diet, you have a blood test to find out if you are intolerant to any of about 100 common foods. After the blood test you are given a personal diet plan. The main tenet of the diet is that people can become overweight because of excess water retention associated with the food intolerance. If foods to which an overweight person is intolerant are eliminated, then fluid is no longer retained and weight is lost. Although 15 000 doctors in the UK are willing to carry out blood tests for people who wish to take the Nutron diet, the theory of food intolerance as described by Dr Kingsley is not accepted by the medical profession as a whole. You might lose weight on this diet but it may not be because of the reasons given by Patrick Kingsley and Ian Stoakes. The diet restricts the choice of foods and you are advised to cut out alcohol for a month. This will probably reduce overall energy (calorie) intake."
"obesity","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>obesity</b><div class=""content"">Obesity is due to the excessive storage of fat in the body, particularly under the skin and around certain internal organs. In 1985, 34 million Americans were obese. Of British adults surveyed in 1991, 13 per cent of men and 15 per cent of women were obese; double the percentage of people who were obese in 1981. A 1995 survey indicates that these figures are continuing to rise. Obesity can be caused by diseases, such as certain cancers, gall-bladder diseases, and hormonal imbalances, but these causes are rare. Many obese people suggest that their condition is due to underactive thyroid glands, but this accounts for less than one in a thousand cases. Most obesity results from eating too much and not exercising enough. This results in a positive energy balance, more energy is consumed than expended. For every 3500 Calories consumed above requirements, approximately one pound of fat is stored in the body.<br class=""nLine"" />Obesity is difficult to define quantitatively without knowing how much fat is normal for a given person. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that the proportion of fat in the body should not exceed 20&ndash;25 per cent in men and 28&ndash;30 per cent in women. Many medical authorities use body mass as an indicator (see <a href=""entry://body mass index""><span class=""links"">body mass index</span></a>); people with a body mass index exceeding 30 are considered obese. However, obesity is not the same as being overweight. A very muscular person may be heavy but still have a very low fat content. Heavy body-builders often have less than 10 per cent body fat. There are two main types of obesity: childhood onset obesity and adult onset obesity.<br class=""nLine"" />Childhood onset obesity may develop because of hormonal imbalances or some other illness, but it is usually caused by overeating when young. This results in the production of an abnormally high number of adipocytes, cells specialized for fat storage. Adults who were obese as children tend to retain a high number of adipocytes, even if they are thin and have a low fat diet. The high number of adipocytes means that a large storage space is always available for fat. Thus adults who suffered childhood onset obesity are generally predisposed to obesity.<br class=""nLine"" />Adult onset obesity occurs when a person becomes obese for the first time after reaching adulthood. He or she usually has a normal number of adipocytes but each one is enlarged with fat. Slimming leads to the fat cells returning to normal size. Adults who have suffered adult onset obesity usually find it much easier to control their weight than adults who were obese as children.<br class=""nLine"" />Obesity is a major health hazard. Obese people are predisposed to a number of diseases, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular diseases. Some medical experts suggest that life expectancy decreases by approximately 1 per cent for each pound of excess fat carried by an individual between the ages of 45 and 50."
"obesity gene","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>obesity gene</b><div class=""content"">Forty-five years ago a genetic defect was identified in mice which leads them to become morbidly obese. The gene concerned was called ‘ob’. When functioning correctly, it instructs fat cells to secrete a hormone as they become inflated with fat. The hormone depresses appetite and increases metabolism. Mice with defective genes become obese. In 1994, scientists unravelled the genetic sequence of the ob gene. Since then the gene has been cloned and a genetically engineered ob protein manufactured. Fat mice have been made thin by daily injections of the protein. Humans are believed to have a gene similar to the ob gene of mice. The gene is for a protein hormone that somehow controls appetite on a long-term basis. Although lack of this gene explains obesity in mutant mice, there is no evidence that injections of the protein hormone will help treat human obesity.<br class=""nLine"" />A third of adults in the US are 20 per cent or more overweight. Huge amounts of money are spent on dieting and treatments for obesity. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have been quick to realize the commercial possibilities of anti-fat drugs for human use. One biotechnology company (Amgen) is planning clinical trials of the ob protein on humans in 1996. If these prove to be both safe and effective, they will have an injectable ‘cure’ for fatness that could reap enormous rewards. However, those suffering from obesity should guard against premature optimism. There is an enormous leap from something that works on obese mice to something that works on people. It has been estimated that less than 25 per cent of human obesity is due to genetic problems; most is probably due to inactivity and eating high-fat food."

<b>oesophagitis</b><div class=""content"">Inflammation of the oesophagus usually caused by regurgitating acidic contents of the stomach. Regurgitation may occur if the sphincter muscle between the oesophagus and stomach cannot close tightly enough, or if there is a hiatus hernia in which the top of the stomach protrudes into the thoracic cavity. The oesophagus has little protection against stomach acids which irritate and inflame its lining, causing pain behind the breastbone similar to that associated with some heart conditions. The pain is usually relieved by taking antacids. Sufferers should reduce their intake of fatty foods, refrain from smoking, and moderate their alcohol intake. However, effective treatment requires first identifying and then dealing with the underlying cause."
"oestrogen","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>oestrogen</b><div class=""content"">A steroid, sex hormone produced by the ovary, the placenta and, in small amounts, by the male testis and adrenal cortex. Oestrogen causes the development of secondary sexual characteristics (e.g. breasts) in adolescent girls, and is involved in repairing the uterine wall after menstruation. Oestrogen also plays a role in calcium uptake and balance. Lack of oestrogen in post-menopausal women results in demineralization of bones, a major cause of fractures in the elderly (see <a href=""entry://osteoporosis""><span class=""links"">osteoporosis</span></a>). Oestrogen hormone replacement therapy for post-menopausal women is effective in slowing down osteoporosis.<br class=""nLine"" />Synthetic oestrogens are major constituents of many contraceptive pills. Excessively high levels can cause nausea, vomiting, irregular vaginal bleeding in women, and feminization (development of female secondary sexual characteristics) in men. They may also be linked to certain cancers and an increased risk of deep vein thromboses. This is why oestrogen levels have been reduced or eliminated in most modern contraceptive pills.<br class=""nLine"" />There are alarming reports of high levels of oestrogen, or chemicals with very similar effects, in lakes and rivers used as sources of drinking water, and in hormone-rich dairy products. These chemicals may cause male alligators to develop tiny, useless penises, and fish to become sterile. Some scientists believe that they are responsible for the increased incidence of testicular, breast, and womb cancers, and the reduction of human male fertility.<br class=""nLine"" />In the mid 1980s, new oestrogen-like chemicals were discovered in human urine. The chemicals were derived from plants so they were called phytoestrogens. Soya bean products and some other tropical legumes are particularly rich sources. Phytoestrogens are so similar to oestrogens that they bind on to the same receptor sites but do not cause the same responses. Although research is in its early stages, it has been tentatively suggested that phytoestrogens may reduce the risk of breast cancer by preventing true oestrogens from attaching onto cells, diluting their impact, and protecting the body against too much exposure."
"omega-3 fatty acids","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>omega-3 fatty acids</b><div class=""content"">A group of unsaturated fatty acids found in some fish oils and linseed oil. Omega-3 fatty acids may change the chemistry of blood, reducing the risk of heart disease. Consumption of foods with high levels of these fatty acids may be ‘cardioprotective’ because they help to lower blood cholesterol and prevent arteries from being clogged with cholesterolrich plaques. It has been suggested that one oily-fish meal a week provides the same protection as three or more. Fish oil capsules containing omega-3 fatty acids are now on the market, but according to the American Medical Association, the capsules may not be as effective as eating fish and other oily seafood. It is possible that the fatty acids only work effectively with other components in fish that are absent from the capsules. Moreover, there is insufficient clinical research data to determine the proper dosage of the fish oils. See also <a href=""entry://cholesterol""><span class=""links"">cholesterol</span></a>."

"orienteering","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>orienteering</b><div class=""content"">Orienteering was invented by a Swede, Major Ernst Killander, in 1918. Sometimes called ‘cunning running’, it combines the physical skills of cross-country running or skiing with the mental skills of route finding. Competitors set off at timed intervals and find their way around a course, using a map and compass, via a number of checkpoints. It is an excellent aerobic activity for the whole family and caters for a wide range of abilities. At the recreational level, mothers and fathers can be seen at local events carrying their infants in backpacks. However, orienteering can be extremely competitive. World championships have been staged since 1966. These demand very high levels of stamina and map reading. Elite orienteers are usually outstanding distance runners. Training and competing regularly over rough terrain tends to reduce flexibility and muscle strength, and reduce maximum running speed. Hence, elite orienteers often incorporate circuit training and interval running into their training schedules.<br class=""nLine"" />In recent years, orienteering has gained notoriety because of a number of sudden deaths among young participants. In 1993, Sweden withdrew its ski orienteers from an international meeting following the deaths of seven young athletes from sudden heart failure. The Swedish federation also banned intensive training for both foot and ski orienteering because of evidence that vigorous exercise during a respiratory infection can cause death. Doctors at Uppsala hospital conducted an investigation which suggested that a bacterium called TWAR (Taiwan Acute Respiratory Infection) or a related micro-organism was responsible; it causes inflammation of the heart, disrupting normal heartbeat."

Many long-distance runners use soft inlays to reduce mechanical shock on the ball of the foot; semi-rigid orthotics are often used to relieve plantar fasciitis (inflammation of connective tissue on the sole of the foot). The use of orthotics to correct anatomical abnormalities of the bones or joints, is controversial.

The injury commonly occurs in children who take part in sports such as skating, gymnastics, and football. These sports require a lot of knee bending and jumping and expose the bony outgrowth to great tensile stress. This may damage the cartilaginous growth zone (epiphyseal plate), causing it to separate from the surrounding bone. The condition usually heals spontaneously after rest, but it may lead to permanent damage if the sufferer does not rest; activity may have to be restricted for several months.

<b>osteoarthritis</b><div class=""content"">Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease of the cartilage overlying bone within a joint. It may progress into the bone itself, causing pain and stiffness. Although osteoarthritis affects some children, it is more common in the elderly. It results in more than 50 000 hip and knee replacements each year in the UK. Its development is associated with obesity, low bone density, abnormalities in the structure of the joint, and repeated mechanical stress. However, a comparison of the incidence of osteoarthritis in pairs of identical twins and non-identical twins, indicates that between 39&ndash;65 per cent of the disease is genetically determined.<br class=""nLine"" />The relationship between exercise and osteoarthritis is complex. In some cases, the wear and tear incurred during exercise may accelerate degeneration. This is particularly likely if people are genetically predisposed to osteoarthritis, or are already suffering from a joint defect and take part in activities, such as running, which impose high impact forces on the joints. However, there is no scientific evidence that people who are not genetically predisposed to the disease and who have normal joints are at risk of osteoarthritis because they exercise. On the contrary, many experts claim that exercise provides some protection against the development of osteoarthritis by helping to reduce body weight, improve muscle tone and strength, and increase flexibility. In addition, exercise stimulates the secretion of synovial fluid which lubricates and nourishes the joints. Non-weight-bearing exercise, especially swimming, is often promoted as treatment for mild forms of osteoarthritis. However, those suffering from joint disorders should avoid exercise which puts great stress on the joints.<br class=""nLine"" />Osteoarthritis can be kept under control for many years by proper treatment which usually includes the use of analgesics."

"osteoporosis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>osteoporosis</b>
<i>(brittle bone disease)</i><div class=""content"">A group of diseases characterized by a reduction in bone mass due to bone reabsorption outpacing bone deposition. The disease is usually associated with loss of weight. Other symptoms include feelings of lassitude, bone pains, and acute back pain. However, the most harmful effect of the disease is that bone becomes porous, brittle, and inclined to fracture. Over 250 000 Americans, most of them elderly, fall and break their hips each year, resulting in a $10 billion medical bill. Worldwide, the disease affects 1.7 million people each year. The number is expected to grow to over 6 million a year by 2050. A quarter of these people are expected to die within six months because of complications, usually linked to hip fractures.<br class=""nLine"" />Osteoporosis is an age-related disease, primarily affecting post-menopausal women, although it can occur much earlier in life (figure 47). There is always some degree of bone weakening with age, but insufficient exercise and a low calcium diet (especially in early life) may exacerbate this. Excessive exercising and weight-loss dieting are also linked with development of the disease. Development of the disease may be determined to some extent by a single gene. A gene affecting Vitamin D metabolism has been found in Australians which may be responsible for more than 75 per cent of the genetic variation in their bone density. If this gene occurs in a broader population, it may not be long before genetic screening can be used to identify those who are predisposed to the disease, so that preventative measures can be taken.<center class=""centre""><img src=""000011.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 47 Osteoporosis. Images such as these have been used by the National Osteoporosis Society (UK) to heighten awareness and to encourage women to take preventative measures</center><br class=""nLine"" />Physical exercise reduces the risk of osteoporosis. Moderate weight-bearing exercises, such as leisurely cycling, dancing, walking, and tennis, stimulate the deposition of calcium, strengthen bones, and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. However, young people benefit most from exercise; strong and healthy bones are more easily established in adolescents and young adults. A modest amount of jumping (as little as 50 jumps a day) can increase the density of hips in premenopausal women by as much as 3 per cent. Although exercise may offer some protection against acquiring the disease, those already suffering from osteoporosis should avoid contact sports and exercise that put undue stress on bones and joints. In particular, flexion exercises of the spine (e.g. sit ups) should be avoided because of the risk of vertebral fractures. Swimming is an especially good exercise for those with the disease.<br class=""nLine"" />Slightly overweight post-menopausal women are less likely to suffer from brittle bones than slim women. Possible reasons are that fat acts as a protective cushion; bones of plump women may be heavier and stronger; and the extra fat of plumper women enables them to produce more oestrogen which offers some protection against demineralization of bones.<br class=""nLine"" />A diet that includes a good intake of calcium-rich food (e.g. milk, yogurt, and cheese) may help prevent and minimize problems associated with this disease. It appears that it is particularly important for pre-menopausal women to have adequate calcium intakes so that they can achieve maximum peak bone densities. At present, the UK Reference Nutrient Intake is thought by The National Osteoporosis Society (UK) to be too low. They recommend the following calcium intakes: <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""<tr><td>• children 7&ndash;12 years</td><td>800 mg per day</td></tr><tr><td>• teenagers/adults</td><td>1000 mg per day</td></tr><tr><td>• women over 45 (not on HRT)</td><td>1500 mg per day</td></tr><tr><td>• women over 45 (on HRT)</td><td>1000 mg per day</td></tr><tr><td>• pregnant and lactating teenagers</td><td>1500 mg per day</td></tr><tr><td>• pregnant and lactating adults</td><td>1200 mg per day</td></tr><tr><td>• men over 45 years</td><td>1500 mg per day</td></tr></table></center><br class=""nLine"" />Some doctors believe that the best way to prevent osteoporosis in post-menopausal women is hormone replacement therapy (see <a href=""entry://menopause""><span class=""links"">menopause</span></a>), but this treatment is not suitable for all women.

Training fatigue occurs but this can be reversed by a slightly longer than normal period of rest. Overreaching is sometimes planned as part of a training programme. As long as it is followed by sufficient rest, it can stimulate the body to adapt to increased training loads. However, overreaching is often unplanned, and results in poor performance and feelings of frustration. Exercisers usually respond to these feelings by training even harder in order to improve. Unfortunately, the effects may be opposite to those intended. Without sufficient rest, overreaching can quickly degenerate into a chronic overtraining syndrome, difficult to reverse."

"overtraining","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>overtraining</b><div class=""content"">Overtraining is a major concern to coaches and competitors. It is defined by experts at the British Olympic Medical Centre as prolonged fatigue and under-performance following a period of heavy training or competition lasting at least two weeks. It often occurs because of the false belief that, since training is a good thing, harder training must be better. In fact, the opposite is true. Beyond a certain optimum level of training, further increases in training intensity lead to poorer performances. More good athletes fail because they do too much training than too little. Overtraining is a particular problem for elite competitors, especially endurance athletes, who feel compelled to train up to their physiological limits to succeed. The signs and symptoms associated with overtraining are well documented by sports physicians. They include:<blockquote>•&nbsp;intestinal disturbances<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;decreased libido<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;a persistent drop in quality or quantity of sleep<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;persistent fatigue and loss of vigour<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;decreased appetite<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;rapid or persistent loss of body weight<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;increased basal metabolic rate<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;increased incidence of infections (e.g. mouth ulcers)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;slow healing of wounds and injuries<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;increased resting pulse rate.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><br class=""nLine"" />Some endurance athletes have very consistent resting pulse rates (usually less than 50 beats per minute) and if they experience increases of even two beats per minute they become concerned. However, overtraining can occur without a rise in resting heart rate.<br class=""nLine"" />Overtraining may also cause complex hormonal changes with a disturbance in the secretion of stress hormones (e.g. adrenaline) and a decrease in testosterone (male sex hormone) levels. If you respond to the occurrence of overtraining symptoms immediately by taking some rest, you can avoid its worse effects. However, if you ignore the symptoms and continue to train hard, you are likely to suffer from chronic overtraining. To recover completely from this, you may need to take weeks or months of rest."
"overuse injury","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>overuse injury</b><div class=""content"">An injury resulting from an imbalance between training and recovery. The mechanical stresses imposed by training damages tissues (especially muscles, tendons, and ligaments) at a rate faster than they can be repaired during the rest period. Internal factors contributing to overuse injuries include age, malalignments of joints, muscle imbalances, and inflexibility; external factors include errors in technique, poor equipment, poor environment, and overtraining. Overuse injuries range from those which cause mild pain during the activity only, to those which severely limit performance and produce chronic, unremitting pain. Overuse injuries are common in aerobic activities involving repetitive movements over a long period of time. Certain sites, such as the tendons of the shoulders, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles are particularly susceptible to overuse injuries. The injuries are usually quite easy to treat in the early stages with a combination of relative rest, ice, stretching, and progressive resistance exercises. If, however, a person continues to train with an overuse injury, it may become much more difficult to treat; anti-inflammatories and other more intrusive treatments, including surgery, may be needed to resolve the condition."
"overweight","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>overweight</b><div class=""content"">There is no universally agreed definition, but most people are considered overweight if they are 15&ndash;20 per cent greater than their ideal weight as determined by standard tables. These tables usually take into account age, height, build, and sex. Excess weight can put great strains on the body, particularly the joints in the legs and back. Although there is a connection between overweight and obesity, not all overweight people are obese. Muscle has a higher density than fat, so highly muscular people may be overweight but not obese. Conversely, a sedentary person with normal body weight could have a small muscle mass, large fat stores, and be suffering from obesity.

<b>oxalic acid</b><div class=""content"">A naturally occurring chemical found in vegetables such as beetroot, spinach, and rhubarb. Oxalic acid also occurs in relatively high concentrations in tea, chocolate, and other cocoa products. It combines with calcium and magnesium in the gut to form insoluble salts which impede the absorption of these essential minerals. High concentrations of oxalic acid are toxic, which is why we do not eat rhubarb leaves (they contain very much more oxalic acid than the stems). Oxalic acid is also produced in the human body.

<b>oxygen</b><div class=""content"">An odourless, colourless gas that makes up about one-fifth of the atmosphere. It is essential for survival. A person completely starved of oxygen would die after only a few minutes. Artificial supplies have been used to improve athletic performance and to aid recovery after exertion. However, routine administration of supplemental oxygen for brief periods before, during, or after exercise has minimal benefits, unless the normal oxygen supply to the tissues is in some way restricted. Supplemental oxygen will benefit people exercising at high altitudes and those suffering from a medical condition (e.g. a disease of the heart, lungs, or blood) that reduces the ability to absorb and transport oxygen. The greatest benefits to a healthy person are gained when oxygen is continuously supplied during exercise, but this has little practical use because of the problems of administering the gas to an active exerciser. Oxygen inhaled under high pressure may be an effective therapy for some sports injuries (see <a href=""entry://hyperbaric oxygen therapy""><span class=""links"">hyperbaric oxygen therapy</span></a>), but it should be administered only under medical supervision because of the danger of poisoning (see <a href=""entry://oxygen poisoning""><span class=""links"">oxygen poisoning</span></a>)."

<b>oxygen debt</b><div class=""content"">The name given to the volume of extra oxygen consumed after exercise. This is most obvious immediately after short bursts of intense activity when a person breathing heavily is said to be ‘paying off the oxygen debt’. The term implies that the oxygen has been borrowed from a store during activity and replaced afterwards. Indeed, some of it is used to reoxygenate myoglobin, the special red pigment which acts as a small oxygen store in muscle. However, only a small proportion is used for this purpose; most is used to convert lactic acid, produced by anaerobic respiration during exercise, into glucose and glycogen (animal starch), or to break down lactic acid to carbon dioxide and water. Therefore, most exercise physiologists prefer to describe the extra oxygen as recovery oxygen or excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), rather than oxygen debt."

High ozone levels in cities hosting endurance activities have caused respiratory distress in some participants.<br class=""nLine"" />It seems that we cannot win with regard to ozone levels. Although we have too much in our cities, the ozone layer above the poles is being depleted due to chlorofluorocarbons and other pollutants. This atmospheric ozone protects us against harmful ultraviolet light. Its depletion may increase the incidence of skin cancers."

<b>P/S</b><div class=""content"">A measure of the relative amounts of polyunsaturates in the diet, where P is the amount of polyunsaturated fats and S is the amount of saturated fats. Many dietitians believe we should aim to increase our P/S values by eating more fats of plant origin. Butter, for example, has a P/S value of 0.05, while margarine made only from polyunsaturated vegetable oils has a P/S of 3.15. The World Health Organization recommends a P/S of 1.0 or higher.

"pain","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pain</b><div class=""content"">Scientists do not know exactly how we feel pain, but it involves the stimulation of specialized nerve-endings. Individuals vary in their sensitivity according to their pain threshold (minimum intensity of stimulation which can evoke pain) and pain tolerance (ability to put up with feelings of pain). Some chemical substances released in the body increase sensitivity. These include bradykinins, histamine, potassium, and serotonin, all of which may be released at sites of tissue damage.<br class=""nLine"" />Many sedentary people believe that all exercisers have to experience pain if they are to become fitter: this belief is encouraged by the well known training motto: ‘No pain, no gain’. Sensible people interpret this as meaning that it takes effort, dedication, and commitment to improve fitness; it does not mean that exercise has to be a masochistic ordeal. On the contrary, if real pain is experienced, an exerciser should stop. Of course, an athlete who is training for top-class competition must be able to tolerate greater discomfort than a recreational athlete, but even an elite athlete must learn to distinguish between real pain and discomfort. Real pain acts as an important warning signal that something is wrong. If the signal is ignored, serious injury may result.<br class=""nLine"" />Pain can be relieved by a variety of means including cold therapy (e.g. application of ice), acupuncture, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, and analgesic drugs. Used correctly, these can provide relief and accelerate recovery. However, used incorrectly they can make a bad condition even worse. Many injured athletes unwisely take painkillers to enable them to continue training or competing. This often leads to further damage and the need for stronger painkillers; a vicious cycle ensues which can only be broken by rest. See also <a href=""entry://muscle soreness""><span class=""links"">muscle soreness</span></a>."
"pain cycle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pain cycle</b><div class=""content"">A vicious cycle resulting from training when in pain (figure 48). Initially, pain may follow an intensive training session. Instead of taking this as a warning sign of an injury, an exerciser may attempt to train through it, fearing that fitness will be reduced if training sessions are lost. The pain often disappears during the warm up, creating a false impression that all is well. This encourages the exerciser to continue the training session which may aggravate the injury. Pain may develop again after the training but, unless it is severe, this may not prevent further training. The cycle continues until the exerciser suffers a chronic injury that prevents training, or until the cycle is broken by rest and treatment of the injury. Of course, the earlier the escape from the pain cycle, the less rest is required, and the easier the treatment."
"palpitation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>palpitation</b><div class=""content"">Irregular or forceful heartbeats. Palpitations may have a number of causes including excitement, indigestion, alcohol, caffeine, or nicotine in cigarettes. They may also be associated with food intolerance and deficiencies of certain minerals (e.g. magnesium, copper, and potassium), and vitamins (e.g. B<sub class=""ind>1</sub>, and B<sub class=""ind>6</sub>). Many very fit people have slow heart rates and become aware of extra beats at rest. Although unpleasant and worrying, palpitations are not usually caused by heart disease. Moderate exercise often alleviates them. However, if the heart palpitates rapidly at rest, or if palpitations occur suddenly during exercise, medical advice should be sought."
"pancreas","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pancreas</b><div class=""content"">A gland that secretes digestive juices into the small intestine, and hormones (insulin and glucagon) into the bloodstream. The pancreatic digestive juices contain enzymes which break down starch, fats, and proteins. If the pancreas becomes inflamed, a condition known as pancreatitis occurs. It is often linked with a blockage of the bile duct. The inflammation it causes may lead to obstruction of the pancreatic duct and pancreatitis. Heavy drinkers of alcohol often suffer from pancreatitis. Traumatic pancreatitis can also result from an injury to the abdominal region inflicted during a contact sport such as karate. Symptoms include abdominal pain (which often radiates to the back), fever, and vomiting. Traumatic pancreatitis can be dangerous if accompanied by bleeding, and may require surgical correction. Chronic pancreatitis leads to tiredness and loss of weight because of reduced secretion of digestive enzymes."

Nevertheless, in the form of calcium pangamate and sodium pangamate, it is marketed as one of the ‘super-vitamins’, essential for those who wish to maximize their physical performance. The marketing claim is based on reports that pangamic acid stimulates oxygen carriage from the blood to active muscles. It has also been suggested that pangamic acid is involved in fat mobilization, formation of anti-stress hormones, and detoxification of poisons and free radicals, but there is little evidence to support the suggestion.<br class=""nLine"" /> It has been claimed that a one-week course of pangamic acid can improve running endurance on a treadmill by up to 24 per cent. Tim Noakes, an eminent exercise physiologist, personally tested this claim during a marathon race and reported that it was an ‘unmitigated failure’.<br class=""nLine"" />Some nutritionists believe that, far from being beneficial, some sources of pangamic acid may be potentially poisonous.

<b>pantothenic acid</b>
<i>(vitamin B<sub class=""ind>5</sub>)</i><div class=""content"">A water-soluble vitamin, and a member of the B complex. Pantothenic acid is a constituent of coenzyme A which plays an essential part in the intermediate stages of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Pantothenic acid also plays a role in antibody formation, detoxification of drugs, and the conversion of cholesterol to anti-stress hormones. Some studies indicate that pantothenic acid supplements improve physical fitness, but it is generally agreed that more detailed experimentation is needed to confirm these effects.<br class=""nLine"" /> Pantothenic acid was discovered because deficiency caused the hair of black rats to turn grey. It was called ‘anti-grey hair factor’ at one time, but there is no evidence that it affects hair colour in humans. Nevertheless, it is used in some hair care preparations as ‘pro vitamin B<sub class=""ind>5</sub>’.<br class=""nLine"" />Deficiencies do not cause any specific disease in humans but can lead to a condition known as ‘burning feet syndrome’ when the feet ache, burn, and throb. Other deficiency symptoms include a wide range of mental and physiological disorders, among them headaches, depression, arm and leg cramps, respiratory infections, digestive disorders, and irregularities of heartbeat.<br class=""nLine"" /> Good sources of pantothenic acid include dried brewer's yeast, pig liver, peas, and other legumes. Pantothenic acid is widespread in foods except fats, oils, and sugar. Healthy people are rarely at risk from deficiencies. The US RDA is 10 mg. There is no RNI in the UK."

<b>parathyroid hormone</b>: <i>(parathormone;</i> PTH)<div class=""content"">A hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands (four small glands located behind the thyroid). It controls the distribution of calcium and potassium in the body. High levels of PTH cause calcium to be transferred from bones to blood; abnormally low levels result in lowering of blood calcium levels which can lead to tetany (twitching and spasm of muscles). Deficiencies can be compensated for by injections of the hormone.<br class=""nLine"" /> An overproduction of parathyroid hormone has been linked recently to the development of fragile bones in a group of 14 female long-distance runners. After strenuous workouts they produced abnormally high quantities of parathyroid hormone and abnormally low quantities of another hormone called calcitonin. Calcitonin stimulates bone growth. It is not clear how general is this effect of endurance exercise on females, but it may contribute to the development of osteoporosis (brittle bone disease) in thin athletes."
"passive exercise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>passive exercise</b><div class=""content"">Exercise performed with the assistance of a partner who moves a completely relaxed part of the body. Such exercises are sometimes called passive mobility exercises because they are often performed to increase the range of movement of a joint. The partner gently exerts pressure against a joint to move it into its end position (i.e. the normal limit of its movement). If conducted properly, passive exercises can improve flexibility. They are particularly effective at maintaining mobility when active exercises are not possible, because of, for example, injury. However, there is a danger that an inexperienced and overenthusiastic partner will overextend the joint, and push it beyond its normal range, damaging it. The exercise should stop when pain is felt (see <a href=""entry://stretch stress""><span class=""links"">stretch stress</span></a>)."

<b>patellofemoral malalignment</b><div class=""content"">A knee disorder with characteristics similar to those of chondromalacia patellae. Both conditions are painful and cause a cracking sound (crepitation) in the knees. However, chondromalacia patellae is due to deterioration of the articular cartilage. Patellofemoral malalignment is due to an abnormal angle of pull of the quadriceps tendon. This tendon passes over the kneecap to attach the quadriceps (the large group of four muscles at the front of the thigh) onto the lower leg. The abnormal angle of pull of the tendons imposes unusual strains on the bones of the knee joint, pulling them out of alignment. Treatment includes rest and the application of heat. Special leg exercises are performed to restore muscle balance and realign the bones of the knee joint. If the condition persists, surgical realignment is sometimes necessary.

<b>pattering</b><div class=""content"">A simple aerobic exercise devised in 1956 by Gordon Richards to train athletes for the Olympic Games. Pattering is similar to running on the spot. The exerciser steps quickly on the spot with the feet moving backwards and forwards but barely leaving the ground. The knees are not lifted, and the arms and legs move in a coordinated manner. Recommended speeds for a slow patter are about 50 steps per 10 seconds; for fast pattering, step as fast as possible. Pattering is tiring and beginners should start slowly doing only about 5&ndash;30 seconds a day (depending on age), gradually extending the session over a period of weeks.

In sport, peak experiences often occur during personal best performances and are marked by a heightened sense of awareness. The experiences are usually described as being beyond one's control, temporary, and unique, standing apart from normal happenings and experiences.

<b>peaking</b><div class=""content"">In sport, achieving an optimal performance on a specific occasion or for a given period of time. Ideally, peaking should occur on the very day, even the very minute, of an important competition. It requires a thorough knowledge of training and its effects so that a training programme can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of an individual. Peaking for vigorous activities usually requires a short period of high-intensity, low-volume training (so-called peaking training) near the time of competition, but not immediately before it when training should taper down.<br class=""nLine"" /> Training to peak has to be done sparingly because it is very demanding. It is believed to use up energy (see <a href=""entry://adaptation energy""><span class=""links"">adaptation energy</span></a>), increasing susceptibility to infection and injury. There is a fine dividing line between optimizing performance and underachieving. Most coaches agree that peaking training should continue for only short periods (no more than about 8&ndash;12 weeks). Although an optimal performance can occur only once, high-level performances may be maintained for about 6 weeks or so before they begin to fall. If training intensity is lowered during peaking training, the duration can be extended and the high performances maintained for a longer period. However, the peak performance will probably be lower."

"peptic ulcer","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>peptic ulcer</b><div class=""content"">A breach in the lining of the stomach or the first part of the duodenum. The lining is covered by a layer of mucin which protects it against acids and pepsin secreted by the stomach. It is thought that ulcers are caused when the stomach secretes excessive amounts of acid and pepsin (a protein-digesting enzyme) or when the wall of the stomach or duodenum is damaged. Until recently, the disease has been attributed to stress and poor dietary habits which result in oversecretion of acids. Traditionally, treatment of peptic ulcers has been with antacids, drugs that control gastric acid secretion (these permit the ulcer to heal), and, in severe cases, surgery. But in the last few years research in Australia has suggested that the formation of peptic ulcers is linked with the presence in the stomach of bacteria belonging to the genus <i>Helicobacter</i>. Several patients have been treated successfully with a special concoction of antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria; their ulcers have disappeared and there has been no recurrence of the disease. However, the treatment requires large doses of antibiotics and can cause side-effects (e.g. nausea and diarrhoea). This research disproved the previously-held belief that the stomach is too hostile an environment for any bacteria to survive. Whether the bacteria are the direct cause of peptic ulcers is still a subject of debate."

A record of perceived exertion in a training diary can be a very useful means of monitoring exercise intensity and fitness. As fitness improves, a person should be able to exercise at higher ratings of perceived exertion with less fatigue. If a person feels unusually tired after exercising at low ratings of perceived exertion, it probably means that he or she needs a rest."

<b>periodization</b><div class=""content"">A training programme which divides training into periods with different objectives. A typical example consists of five periods, each about 4&ndash;6 weeks in length: <blockquote>1&nbsp; PREPARATION (whole-body conditioning)<br class=""nLine"" /> 2&nbsp; STRENGTH PERIOD<br class=""nLine"" /> 3&nbsp; STRENGTH/POWER PERIOD (completion of strength development and major work on power and speed)<br class=""nLine"" /> 4&nbsp; MAINTENANCE PERIOD (competition period)<br class=""nLine"" /> 5&nbsp; TRANSITION PERIOD (active rest to enable recovery from competition).<br class=""nLine"" />
</blockquote>During the first three periods, training gradually changes from non-specific, general conditioning activities of long duration and short intensity, to more specific, special training of high intensity and short duration. The programme is designed so that athletes peak during the maintenance period and this is timed to coincide with major competitions. The precise duration of the periods and the total length of the complete cycle depends on when the athlete wants to peak. Most training programmes adopt a single periodization per year; some adopt a double periodization in one year so that the athlete can peak twice; and others have periodization lasting 2&ndash;4 years (for example when preparing for the Olympic Games) or even longer."

<b>peritendinitis</b><div class=""content"">Inflammation of the paratenon, the tissue which surrounds and nourishes a tendon. Peritendinitis produces a crackling sensation over the area involved. It is a common overuse injury experienced by overenthusiastic exercisers. If not treated properly, the injury is potentially disabling. It is important for the damaged tissue to heal completely before training is resumed. If an injured person persists in training, there is a danger of the condition becoming chronic; permanent scarring of tissue may develop, increasing the thickness of the paratenon and reducing mobility, in which case surgery may be needed."
"peritonitis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>peritonitis</b><div class=""content"">Inflammation of the peritoneum, the membrane lining the organs within the abdomen and the wall of the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis is classified as bacterial, chemical, or haemorrhagic, depending on the cause. Bacterial peritonitis can be caused by perforation of an infected organ, such as the appendix. Chemical peritonitis can be caused by chemicals released from the digestive tract, such as bile or stomach acids. Haemorrhagic peritonitis may be caused by a violent blow to the abdomen causing internal bleeding. Whatever the cause, peritonitis is a grave condition and usually requires surgical treatment and hospitalization."
"pernicious anaemia","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pernicious anaemia</b><div class=""content"">A progressive decrease in the number, but an increase in the size, of red blood cells resulting from a lack of vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> in the diet or an inability to absorb the vitamin (see <a href=""entry://intrinsic factor""><span class=""links"">intrinsic factor</span></a>). It shares the same symptoms as other forms of anaemia (e.g. breathlessness when exercising and lethargy) but victims of pernicious anaemia also often have a sore tongue, fever, and abdominal pain. Strict vegetarians who do not consume any supplements are at risk of deficiency because there are no plant sources of B<sub class=""ind>12</sub>. However, the vitamin does occur in micro-organisms, including yeast."
"personality","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>personality</b><div class=""content"">The sum of an individual's underlying behaviour traits; the relatively stable and enduring attributes of character, temperament, intellect, and physique that make an individual unique. Each trait refers to the way a person behaves in a particular situation. People who always believe they can succeed in a sports competition, for example, have the trait of ‘self-confidence’.<br class=""nLine"" /> Several studies have shown that regular exercise over a period of several years can change personality by increasing vitality; improving patience and humour, and making a person better tempered and more easy-going. They also show that high levels of fitness are often associated with high levels of self-assurance, self-confidence, and emotional stability. These studies refer to ordinary people. They seem to be contradicted by the behaviour of some elite sports people, especially those participating in highly competitive sports such as tennis and football. By their very nature, these sports attract people with aggressive, competitive personalities. However, who is to say that tennis players and footballers would not be much more aggressive if they did not have their sport as an emotional outlet!<br class=""nLine"" />Exercisers may suffer less from anxiety, depression, and tension than non-exercisers. This finding is supported by psychological profiles of elite athletes, who tend to score low on negative mood states and high on vigour (see Profile of Mood States). Many sports psychologists are convinced that vigorous, regular exercise has important social benefits, helping to develop qualities such as dependability, perseverance, and determination.

"phenylalanine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>phenylalanine</b><div class=""content"">An essential amino acid contained in many foods, especially meat and dairy products. It is also one of the amino acids in the artificial sweetener, aspartame. Excess phenylalanine is not stored in the body and has to be broken down by a specific enzyme. People lacking this enzyme develop the condition known as phenylketonuria. For this reason, aspartame products carry a warning that they contain phenylalanine."
"phenylbutazone","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>phenylbutazone</b>
<i>(bute)</i><div class=""content"">A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug introduced in 1949 to treat arthritis. It is a very powerful painkiller. Unfortunately, it has harmful side-effects and has been implicated in a number of fatalities. Consequently, its use has been restricted. Nevertheless, many physicians still believe that it is a very good drug for treating certain conditions, including ankylosing spondylitis (abnormal rigidity of the backbone, sometimes called ‘bamboo spine’). Other physicians think that it is too dangerous for human use although it has been used frequently in a form known as ‘bute’ for the treatment of soft tissue injuries in horses."
"phenylketonuria","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>phenylketonuria</b><div class=""content"">A genetic defect resulting in a lack of the enzyme needed to metabolize phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid used to make proteins, but excessive amounts damage the central nervous system. Phenylketonuria is especially dangerous to infants because it can damage the developing brain and cause severe mental retardation. The disease can be prevented by dietary restriction provided treatment is begun within 60 days of birth. The adverse effects of phenyl-ketonuria are avoided by restricting the amounts of phenylalanine in the diet. Aspartame (an artificial sweetener) may not be suitable for those suffering phenylketonuria because it contains phenylalanine."
"phenylpropanolamine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>phenylpropanolamine</b> (PPA)<div class=""content"">A stimulant drug used in many slimming pills. In high doses, PPA has effects similar to amphetamines or ‘speed’.

"phosphagen","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>phosphagen</b><div class=""content"">An energy-rich phosphate compound. Breakdown of a phosphagen such as creatine phosphate enables ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to be generated very quickly without oxygen. ATP is the only chemical energy which can be used directly by contracting muscles."
"phosphagen system","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>phosphagen system</b>
<i>(ATP-PCr system)</i><div class=""content"">The quickest, and most powerful source of energy for muscle movement. The phosphagen system is a form of anaerobic metabolism. It uses creatine phosphate to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate, the chemical which provides energy for all body processes). Unfortunately, it will support activity for only about 10 seconds, just enough time for top-class runners to complete a 100 metre sprint. Although the phosphagen system produces only a little ATP, it generates energy very quickly. This provides the maximal power needed for short bursts of activity, such as when a sprinter explodes out of the blocks, or when a weight-lifter performs a clean-and-jerk. Creatine phosphate is stored in muscle and its depletion causes fatigue. Dietary supplements which increase creatine phosphate levels in muscles may delay fatigue and improve the explosive power of sprinters and other athletes.

"phosphorus","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>phosphorus</b><div class=""content"">A non-metallic element which is an essential component of the diet. It is a constituent of many vital compounds in the body, including ATP, DNA, and phospholipids (see separate entries), but it is found mainly in bones. Vitamin D and calcium regulate the availability of phosphorus for bone formation. Most meats and fish are rich sources of phosphorus; deficiencies lead to rickets and poor growth, but this is rare compared with the effects of calcium and vitamin D deficiency on bone development."
"Physical Activity Level","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Physical Activity Level</b> (PAL; Physical Activity Index; PAI) and <b>Physical Activity Ratio</b> (PAR)<div class=""content"">The energy used for a particular activity can be calculated by multiplying the basal metabolic rate (BMR) by a factor appropriate to that activity. This factor is known as the Physical Activity Ratio (PAR) and is calculated as follows: <div class=""expo"">PAR = energy cost of an activity per minute/energy cost of BMR per minute</div> Thus the energy cost of sitting at rest is 1.2; for walking at a normal pace, 4; and for jogging, 7. The sum of the cost of all the activities over a 24-hour period can be used to calculate the daily physical activity, and is expressed as the Physical Activity Level (PAL) or Physical Activity Index (PAI): <div class=""expo"">PAL = total energy required over 24 hours/BMR over 24 hours</div> According to World Heath Organization statistics, the desirable PAL for cardiovascular health is 1.7; the average PAL in the UK is 1.4, with only 13 per cent of women and 22 per cent of men achieving a PAL of 1.7. For those engaged in hard physical activity, the PAL is 2.14. In a group of novice athletes training for the half marathon, the average PAL at the start of training was 1.66, and after 10 weeks of training it was 2.03."
"physical fitness","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>physical fitness</b><div class=""content"">If you are physically fit, you are free from illness, and able to function efficiently and effectively, to enjoy leisure, and to cope with emergencies. Health-related components of physical fitness include body composition, cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, muscular endurance, and muscle strength. Skill-related components include agility, balance, coordination, power, reaction time, and speed."
"physical recreation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>physical recreation</b><div class=""content"">Physical activity pursued for enjoyment and to refresh health and spirits. Physical recreation is usually more purposeful and planned than play, but tends to be less organized than competitive sport. Nevertheless, some highly competitive sports are pursued as recreation, in which case the main motivation for taking part is to gain refreshment and not to compete.

"physiological limit","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>physiological limit</b><div class=""content"">The level of physical activity beyond which an individual cannot normally go. In ordinary circumstances individuals do not reach their physiological limit, although it might be approached in the heat of competition when motivation is very high. Often a plateau is reached in training when people believe they have reached their physiological limit."
"physiotherapy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>physiotherapy</b><div class=""content"">The use of physical methods to assist recovery of damaged tissue, especially in muscles and joints. Sports physiotherapists are specially trained to treat sports injuries. Their role is to return an exerciser to full fitness using the safest and quickest methods. Many exercisers consult physiotherapists only when they have a serious injury which is not getting better. However, most, even those with minor injuries, would benefit from early advice and treatment.

"phytic acid","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>phytic acid</b><div class=""content"">A combination of inositol (a substance related to hexose sugars) and phosphorous. In the gut, phytic acid reduces the absorption of some minerals (e.g. calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc) by forming insoluble salts with the minerals. Relatively high concentrations of phytic acid occur in wholegrain cereals and some other foods rich in fibre.<br class=""nLine"" /> Calcium was first added to flour because of the suspicion that high levels of phytic acid in bread interfere with calcium absorption and cause rickets. However, the link between rickets and foods rich in phytic acid is far from conclusive and it is not certain to what extent these foods interfere with mineral absorption. There is some evidence that those who regularly eat high fibre diets adapt to the high phytic acid content by secreting an enzyme which can break phytic acid down into inositol and phosphorus."
"phytochemical","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>phytochemical</b><div class=""content"">A member of a wide range of chemicals found in fruits and vegetables that may have beneficial effects on human health. Phytochemicals are biologically very active. They include antioxidants, phyto-oestrogens, and compounds that modify potential toxins and carcinogens. In plants, they are not involved in photosynthesis, respiration, or protein synthesis, but they may function as attractants for pollinating insects or repellants against insect pests. Some phytochemicals are known to have medically important effects. Isoflavanoids from soya beans, for example, may reduce the risk of cancers induced by excessive intakes of synthetic oestrogen (see <a href=""entry://oestrogen""><span class=""links"">oestrogen</span></a>). Allicin, a component of garlic, may offer some protection against heart disease. In 1989, the National Cancer Institute started a multi-million dollar project that includes the study of phytochemicals. It is likely that many new phytochemicals will be discovered which have an important effect on human health and disease."
"pica","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pica</b><div class=""content"">A craving for substances not normally considered to be nutrients. The curious behaviour of some pregnant women who crave for ice (pagophagia) or eat mouthfuls of clay (geophagia) may be caused by a real need for extra minerals, especially iron and zinc. If pica is due to a mineral deficiency, it clears up very quickly after the appropriate mineral supplement is taken."
"Pilates","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pilates</b><div class=""content"">A system of training popular among dancers and other performers. Exercises, designed to strengthen the whole body without strain or injury, are performed lying down on a machine fitted with springs, the tension of which can be varied to suit the user. During Pilates, the emphasis is on relaxed, rhythmic breathing while performing smooth, coordinated movements. The movements, based on yoga and dance exercises, are particularly good at strengthening the stomach, thigh, and buttock muscles. The resistances are relatively low so that the exerciser is more likely to develop a sleek appearance rather than a muscular physique.<br class=""nLine"" /> The training system has a very low risk of injury because there are virtually no impact forces on the joints and bones. Consequently, it is suitable for people of a wide fitness range, but it is probably not sufficiently vigorous to improve aerobic fitness."

"pituitary","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pituitary</b><div class=""content"">An endocrine gland at the base of the brain. It is sometimes called the ‘conductor of the endocrine orchestra’ because it coordinates the activities of many other endocrine glands. Some of its hormones are banned by the International Olympic Committee (see <a href=""entry://growth hormone""><span class=""links"">growth hormone</span></a>)."
"placebo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>placebo</b><div class=""content"">An inert, harmless substance which resembles a medicine. Placebos are used in research when new medicines and dietary supplements are tested. They enable a researcher to distinguish between the psychological effects of a treatment and its physiological effects. If a person expects a substance to be of benefit, it often is. This was demonstrated in a classic study of the effects of vitamin C on the frequency of colds. One group of subjects was given a placebo and told it was vitamin C, while another comparable group was given vitamin C and told it was a placebo. Surprisingly, the group taking the placebo reported fewer colds than the group taking vitamin C, illustrating how strong the power of suggestion can be. The placebo effect may be reinforced by overt suggestions; for example, by exaggerated claims of manufacturers that they have produced a new wonder drug. In properly controlled tests of a drug, neither the investigators nor the subjects should know who is taking the drug and who is taking the placebo.<br class=""nLine"" /> The placebo effect is often used by physicians who prescribe an inert, innocuous substance to patients who need the psychological boost of being given something they believe will heal them. This effect is also used by sports trainers. Placebo salves with no pharmacologically active ingredients have been used to relieve muscle fatigue. The placebo effect is also a major consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of a training system. Some of the physiological improvements associated with the training may be brought about by a psychological belief that the system works, independent of what the actual system is (as long as the system itself is not harmful). There is a suggestion that the placebo effect may be due to the release of chemicals in the brain which have an effect similar to morphine (see <a href=""entry://endorphins""><span class=""links"">endorphins</span></a>)."
"plantar fasciitis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>plantar fasciitis</b><div class=""content"">Inflammation of the plantar fascia (the thick band of tissue along the sole of the foot) at its attachment point to the heel bone. Plantar fasciitis is characterized by a gnawing pain or discomfort in the heel that radiates along the sole of the foot. It may be caused by mechanical stress and is common in exercisers who jump or run excessively. It usually responds well to treatment with anti-inflammatory medication, without the need for surgery. However, it can take a long time to resolve, in some cases as long as 4 years."
"plastic surgery","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>plastic surgery</b><div class=""content"">Surgery to revise or reconstruct tissue of superficial organs (i.e. those which can be seen easily) in a damaged area. Plastic surgery used solely to improve a person's appearance is more properly called cosmetic surgery."
"plateau","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>plateau</b>
<i>(arrested progress)</i><div class=""content"">A period during training or the learning of a skill when there is no apparent improvement in performance even though practice continues. This is sometimes called the ‘plateau of despond’ because it is so discouraging. The condition may be due to staleness or the need of the body to have time to adapt to the demands of training. If staleness is the cause, improvement usually follows quickly after a short rest or a change in the type of training. If staleness is not the cause and training continues, the plateau invariably passes and is often followed by a period of accelerated improvement. However, there is a risk of overtraining. See also <a href=""entry://physiological limit""><span class=""links"">physiological limit</span></a>."
"play","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>play</b><div class=""content"">Spontaneous, childlike physical activity producing immediate pleasure. There is no goal other than sheer enjoyment. Play involves some rules which are freely accepted by participants. Feelings of exhilaration and tension often accompany play, with mirth and relaxation following. Although it appears to be an unnecessary activity with no material purpose, sociologists and psychologists believe that play is a necessary part of physical development, learning, social behaviour, and personality development. Many of the best sports coaches and exercise trainers incorporate play into their regimes to reduce boredom and maintain motivation. Very few people sustain their commitment to exercise unless it has an element of fun."
"plumpness","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>plumpness</b><div class=""content"">Western society tends to denigrate plump people, regarding them as slobbish, lazy, and inherently unhealthy. There is no doubt that extreme obesity is unhealthy, but people with body fat slightly above average are unlikely to be jeopardizing their health. On the contrary, the general medical consensus is that moderate plumpness, particularly in younger women, has several health advantages. These include a lower risk of suffering osteoporosis and some other postmenopausal disorders. Plumpness in men may carry more risk, especially if the fat is distributed mainly around the waist (see <a href=""entry://Syndrome X""><span class=""links"">Syndrome X</span></a>). Nevertheless, even in men, slight plumpness is unlikely to be harmful.<br class=""nLine"" />It is often forgotten that the risks from being underweight can be as great or greater than those from being overweight. As far as health is concerned, there is probably an optimum weight and level of body fat for each individual dependent on a number of factors, including height (see <a href=""entry://body mass index""><span class=""links"">body mass index</span></a>) and body build. As a person's weight diverges from this optimum, the risks to health increase. Because of Western society's obsession with slimness, the body weight that most people prefer is probably less than the optimal weight for health."
"plyometrics","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>plyometrics</b><div class=""content"">Exercises, including hops, bounds, and jumps, in which maximum effort is expended while a muscle group is lengthening. During plyometrics, a concentric contraction (shortening) of muscle is immediately followed by an eccentric contraction (lengthening). Plyometrics forms part of the training programmes for most sprinters, jumpers, and throwers because they improve explosive power. However, there is a high risk of injury for those who are not well conditioned."

"polyunsaturated fat","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>polyunsaturated fat</b>
<i>(polyunsaturates)</i><div class=""content"">Fats that have carbon chains with more than one double bond. A polyunsaturated fat has four or more fewer hydrogen atoms than its equivalent saturated fat. Polyunsaturates are classified as cis and trans fatty acids according to the arrangement of the hydrogen atoms closest to the double bond. In the cis form, the two hydrogen atoms are on same side of the double bond; in the trans form, they are on opposite sides of the double bond. In nature, polyunsaturated fatty acids are usually in the cis form, but hydrogenated polyunsaturates (e.g. some margarines) have a greater proportion in the trans form. This has important dietary implications because trans fatty acids have characteristics very similar to saturated fats and are regarded as being more harmful than cis fatty acids. Consequently, although it is recommended that up to 6 per cent of food energy may be obtained from polyunsaturates, no more than 2 per cent of food energy should be obtained from trans fatty acids.<br class=""nLine"" />Polyunsaturated fatty acids include the essential fatty acids, linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. A number of other polyunsaturated fatty acids occur in high concentrations in fish and vegetable oils and are thought to be particularly beneficial to health (see <a href=""entry://eicosapentaenoic acid""><span class=""links"">eicosapentaenoic acid</span></a> and <a href=""entry://gamma-linolenic acid""><span class=""links"">gamma-linolenic-acid</span></a>). Nutritionists advise us to make sure that we have sufficient quantities of the essential fatty acids in our diets (in the UK, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy, recommend that linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid should provide at least 1.0 and 0.2 per cent, respectively, of total dietary energy). At the same time, however, we are also told to make sure that our total fat intake does not exceed 35 per cent of dietary intake.

"postural hypotension","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>postural hypotension</b>
<i>(orthostatic hypotension)</i><div class=""content"">A fall in blood pressure that occurs when a person stands up quickly after sitting or lying down. When sitting or lying down, blood accumulates or pools in the lower part of the body. When you stand up there is a temporary shortage of blood to the brain that may cause dizziness for a few seconds. Fit, active people are particularly susceptible to postural hypotension. After a strenuous workout, the blood vessels are usually highly dilated. This encourages pooling. Consequently, if a fit person stands still after exercise he or she may faint due to lack of blood returning to the heart. Lying down allows the heart to receive blood once again and to perfuse the brain. A cooling down procedure, such as walking or mild exercise, prevents pooling."
"postural proteinuria","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>postural proteinuria</b>
<i>(orthostatic proteinuria)</i><div class=""content"">The occurrence of proteins in the urine as a result of prolonged standing or prolonged exercise; it occurs particularly in young adults. Protein in the urine is usually a sign that all is not well with the kidneys, but postural proteinuria is relatively benign and quickly disappears after bed rest."
"posture","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>posture</b><div class=""content"">The position or attitude of a person's body. Static posture is the posture of a person standing, sitting, or lying still; dynamic posture is posture in movement. Correct posture results in the body being aligned so that the centre of gravity passes through the centre of the body and the position is maintained with a minimum of effort. If the body is off-centre, compensatory movements are made. This sets up stresses and strains that can result in aches and pains, particularly in the back. Posture is maintained largely subconsciously, but it can be improved by training. You can improve posture by exercising to improve muscle tone, muscular strength and endurance, and flex-ibility. If you have bad posture, you will need to make a conscious effort to establish correct body positioning."
"pot belly","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pot belly</b>
<i>(paunch)</i><div class=""content"">A large, extended abdomen, due to the accumulation of body fluids and fat. It can sometimes be the result of malnutrition (e.g. in children deprived of protein, a pot belly may develop due to the infiltration of fat into the liver; see <a href=""entry://kwashiorkor""><span class=""links"">kwashiorkor</span></a>), but is more often due to overindulgence in food and alcohol, and poor abdominal muscle tone.

"potassium","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>potassium</b><div class=""content"">An important mineral element in the human body. Optimal levels of potassium in the blood help to strengthen arteries, may reduce the damage to blood vessels associated with ageing, and are essential for the efficient functioning of the heart. Potassium-rich diets may reduce blood pressure and counteract some of the harmful effects of high sodium intakes. Some nutritionists suggest that the addition of one piece of potassium-rich fruit or vegetable per day may reduce the risk of a fatal stroke by 40 per cent.<br class=""nLine"" />Although deficiencies are rare, they may result from severe diarrhoea, sweating, or vomiting. Mild deficiencies can lead to muscular weakness, increased heart rates, and nausea. Severe deficiencies may lead to heart failure unless supplements are given.<br class=""nLine"" />Potassium is found in many foods (including apricots, meat, fish, and poultry). Fruit and vegetables are especially valuable sources of potassium because they tend be relatively low in sodium. Bananas are an excellent recovery food for replacing potassium lost in sweat and they are very convenient (the original prewrapped food!). For these reasons, many professional cyclists eat bananas during races.<br class=""nLine"" />Potassium toxicity is rare, but excessively high intakes can lead to muscular weakness and heart complaints, and may accompany kidney disease. The daily potassium requirement is about 2&ndash;4 grams (UK recommended level for adults is 3.5 g per day)."

Bend your knees quickly and force your elbows under the bar to ‘catch’ it. Hop slightly forward between the extension and catch and bend your knees into a slight squat position to receive the barbell at your shoulders. Do not hook the bar over in an arch at the top of the pull. This will cause the bar to hit your chest, pushing it backwards and imposing an unnecessary strain on your lower back.

"pre-competition meal","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pre-competition meal</b><div class=""content"">Many athletes treat the pre-competition meal as a ritual which must be followed to ensure success. A thick steak with all the trimmings, the traditional meal of footballers, may have psychological benefits but is not nutritionally sound. The advice of most sports nutritionists is to avoid protein-rich foods for at least 12 hours before intensive exercise. Protein stimulates the secretion of acids in the stomach which can act as an irritant. It is also the most difficult type of food to digest. Other advice generally given to those about to compete or exercise intensively includes the following. <blockquote>•&nbsp;EAT SOMETHING ON THE MORNING OF COMPETITION. Liver glycogen stores will have been reduced by 50&ndash;60 per cent overnight.<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;AVOID SALTY, SPICY, AND GREASY FOODS.<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;AVOID VERY SUGARY FOODS. Paradoxically, they may reduce the blood glucose levels (see <a href=""entry://insulin rebound""><span class=""links"">insulin rebound</span></a>), and they may delay fluid absorption, increasing the risk of dehydration.<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;LIMIT YOUR INTAKE OF HIGH FIBRE FOODS. Vigorous physical activity stimulates movement of food along the gut. If this is further accelerated by high fibre foods, the results could be uncomfortable or even embarrassing.<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;EAT AT LEAST 2&ndash;3 HOURS BEFORE COMPETITION. This allows digestion to take place.<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;EAT COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES. Pasta, for example, does not cause wild fluctuations in blood glucose levels (see <a href=""entry://glycaemic index""><span class=""links"">glycaemic index</span></a>); avoid simple sugars such as honey, sweets, or candies.<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;EAT FAMILIAR FOODS. Eat foods you know you can digest easily. A pre-competition meal is not the time to surprise your digestive system with new foods.<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;DO NOT OVEREAT. During exercise, blood flow is diverted from the gut to the muscles and the food remains undigested, trapped in the gut. This may lead to constipation and stomach cramps.<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;RELAX AFTER YOUR PRE-COMPETITION MEAL. Do not rush around as this will upset digestion.<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;DRINK PLENTY OF FLUIDS (see <a href=""entry://water replacement""><span class=""links"">water replacement</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />
</blockquote>If the competition lasts a long time, make sure you replace fluid and energy losses. Starchy carbohydrates (e.g. bananas) are a good source of energy and minerals. Many athletes use commercial carbohydrate drinks specially formulated for this purpose (see <a href=""entry://energy drink""><span class=""links"">energy drink</span></a>)."

"pre-fatigue method","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pre-fatigue method</b>
<i>(pre-exhaustion system)</i><div class=""content"">A method used to ensure that, during weight training involving the simultaneous action of two muscles of different strength, both muscles are fully stimulated. Normally, the training would have to stop when the weaker muscle becomes fatigued, long before the stronger one is fully stimulated. To overcome this problem, a preliminary exercise (called an isolation exercise) is performed using only the stronger muscle so that it is ‘pre-fatigued’. When the two-muscle exercise is performed immediately afterwards, both muscles will have a similar relative strength and will have to work equally hard during the training. The pre-fatigue method is used, for example, before the incline press which involves the pectorals and the weaker triceps. Either dumbbell flyes or cable crossovers are used as the isolation exercise, pre-fatiguing the pectorals."

"pregnancy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pregnancy</b><div class=""content"">Although women with a history of poor health may be prescribed rest at various stages of pregnancy, it is now generally accepted that moderate exercise can be beneficial. The reported benefits include: <blockquote>•&nbsp;maintenance of physical fitness<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;avoidance of excessive weight increase<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;decreased risk of problems such as constipation, backache, and varicose veins<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;improved sleep<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;improved self-image and less risk of postnatal depression<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;easier labour.<br class=""nLine"" />
</blockquote>An exercise programme for pregnant mothers should take into consideration physiological and anatomical changes. The mother's heart, lungs, and other vital organs are working much harder than usual, and hormonal changes make some joints less stable. Pregnancy is not the time to start a fitness programme, but most regular exercisers can continue their normal exercise programme, with their doctor's permission.<br class=""nLine"" />Several elite athletes have continued to train and compete successfully during the early stages of pregnancy. Three gold medallists in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics were pregnant when they competed. During the later stages of pregnancy (usually after the 5th month) strenuous physical activity is not recommended.<br class=""nLine"" />Exercises which are particularly beneficial during pregnancy should be learned in special, medically-approved antenatal classes. These include exercises to improve posture and general mobility; pelvic floor exercises to maintain the perineal muscles and reduce the risk of stress incontinence in later years; and relaxation exercises, to improve neuro-muscular control and the ability to cope with the pain of labour. Many experts advise against excessive stretching because the hormone relaxin is present in the body during pregnancy. Relaxin causes ligaments to relax, particularly those in the pelvis, which needs to widen during birth. Lax ligaments mean that joints can be overstretched easily, causing long-term problems of joint instability. During pregnancy the rectus abdominis (one of the stomach muscles) separates to accommodate an enlarged uterus. Sit-ups, or other strenuous abdominal exercises, can exaggerate the separation and result in an enlarged abdomen after giving birth. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' guidelines for exercise during pregnancy state that pregnant mothers should be especially careful to take plenty of fluids before and during exercise to limit the risk of dehydration and assist cooling (maternal body temperature should not exceed 38°C).<br class=""nLine"" />During pregnancy, the mother is eating for both herself and her baby. At least in the later stages of pregnancy, she needs to consume more energy than usual, but this does not mean eating twice as much. The average weight gained during pregnancy is about 10&ndash;12.5 kg (22&ndash;28 lb). There is no merit in putting on less than that, but there are disadvantages in gaining much more. Carrying excess weight is tiring. It can also increase the risk of problems such as backache, diabetes, and varicose veins. On average, pregnancy demands 200 additional Calories daily. In the UK, the Health Education Authority recommend that these extra calories should be taken only during the last three months of pregnancy. It is only then that the energy cost of providing for the baby is high enough to necessitate a greater food intake, but this assumes that activity levels are reduced during pregnancy.<br class=""nLine"" />Pregnancy also increases nutrient requirements. It is important that the mother's diet contains sufficient protein, iron, calcium, folate, and vitamins C and D for the formation of the baby's muscles, bones, and teeth, and to make haemoglobin. Most extra nutrients are obtained simply by eating a balanced diet that satisfies the increased energy requirements. However, all women should take folate supplements to reduce the risk of neural defects in their babies (see <a href=""entry://folic acid""><span class=""links"">folic acid</span></a>). Pregnant women are advised not to eat liver or liver products although they are rich in folate, because of the possible harmful effects of their high vitamin A content on the health of the baby. Supplementary iron and vitamins C and D are often recommended, but iron tablets can cause constipation and other distressing effects in some people. Any supplements should be taken only after consultation with a medicallyqualified person or dietitian."
"premenstrual tension","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>premenstrual tension</b> (PMT)<div class=""content"">As many as 90 per cent of women suffer from premenstrual tension (also known as premenstrual stress and premenstrual syndrome). The disruptive emotional and physical symptoms (including appetite changes, irritability, and headaches) that precede menstruation may last up to two weeks or longer. The symptoms vary considerably in intensity from very mild and barely perceptible, to so severe that work and domestic harmony are threatened. Physical changes associated with premenstrual tension are an increase in breast size, increased fluid retention with associated weight gain, abdominal distension, and an increase in skin pigmentation.<br class=""nLine"" />There appears to be no single cause of PMT, but it is probably linked to a hormonal imbalance (such as lack of progesterone during the second half of the menstrual cycle). Some experts suggest that nutritional deficiencies can disrupt the body's delicate hormonal balance. These include a lack of gamma-linoleic acid (GLA), vitamins, and minerals (such as zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub>). There is, however, no conclusive evidence that supplements of these nutrients have any beneficial effects, and there is a risk of toxicity if doses higher than 50 mg per day of vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub> are taken. Other factors (alcohol, stress, ageing, a diet high in saturated fats, and viral infections) may also precipitate PMT. Sufferers are generally advised to reduce their intake of saturated fats and salty foods, increase their consumption of fruit and green vegetables, and drink plenty of fluids during attacks; even if this has no effect on PMT, the dietary changes should improve overall health.<br class=""nLine"" />Some gynaecologists believe that fatigue can cause PMT and recommend that women rest before a period is due. However, moderate exercise significantly reduces the severity of premenstrual symptoms in many women. In addition to improving fitness, regular aerobic training can reduce feelings of depression and anxiety."

It was tested at the Longevity Research Institute, California as part of the treatment for heart patients.<br class=""nLine"" />Pritikin believed that we should keep our intake of salt, sugar, fats, and proteins to an absolute minimum. Coffee and tea are avoided, and alcohol greatly restricted. Consequently, the diet consists of 80 per cent unrefined carbohydrates, 10 per cent fats, and 10 per cent proteins. Because the diet consists mainly of vegetable material, you have to eat a large amount of food each day. To supply 700 Calories, about 2 kg (41b) of food are required. Pritikin also incorporated exercise plans in his weight-control programmes.<br class=""nLine"" />The Pritikin diet is generally regarded as nutritious but some people complain that the high fibre intake causes flatulence and makes them feel bloated.

"programme setting","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>programme setting</b><div class=""content"">If you are to benefit from long-term exercise, you should plan an exercise programme to suit your individual needs. For general fitness, you should exercise for at least 20 minutes, three to four times each week. Swimming, jogging, cycling, and brisk walking are all popular and highly beneficial activities. Each exercise session should consist of warm-up and cool-down exercises which enable you to stretch all parts of your body. Many general fitness exercisers benefit from incorporating at least one strength-training session into their weekly exercise programme. It should include at least one arm and shoulder exercise (e.g. bench press), one trunk exercise (e.g. trunk twist), and one leg exercise (e.g. leg press) with two or three supplementary exercises to strengthen specific muscles. When setting your exercise programme, you should predetermine the exercise intensity and total workload. For strength training this will include planning the number of sets, repetitions, and weights to be used in each session. Be careful to conform to fundamental training principles (see <a href=""entry://overload principle""><span class=""links"">overload principle</span></a>; <a href=""entry://progression""><span class=""links"">progression</span></a>; and <a href=""entry://specific-training principle""><span class=""links"">specific training principle</span></a>) so that you obtain maximum benefits from the exercise."
"progression","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>progression</b><div class=""content"">A major training principle which states that the benefits accrued from training will continue only if training workloads are gradually increased. Workloads should also be higher than usual (see <a href=""entry://overload principle""><span class=""links"">overload principle</span></a>). The minimum level of training which satisfies the overload principle increases as fitness improves. Consequently, workloads have to be increased progressively. This can be achieved by varying the frequency, duration, and intensity of training. Changes in intensity have the greatest effect on fitness, but they also present the greatest risk of sports injuries. Therefore, most coaches and exercise physiologists agree that it is best to vary first the frequency, keeping the intensity low until the desired number of sessions per week are reached (e.g. three); then to increase duration; and finally to increase intensity when the fitness level is sufficiently high to cope with the demands. The key to successful training is to increase the workload gradually over a long period so that improvements can be maintained and overtraining avoided. Workloads which are too high, and abrupt increases in frequency, duration, or intensity, can provoke overuse injuries."
"progressive muscle relaxation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>progressive muscle relaxation</b> (PMR)<div class=""content"">A highly-effective relaxation technique used to reduce stress, tension, and worry. Individual muscle groups are tensed for a few seconds and then relaxed in sequence, starting with those in the toes and feet, and progressing up the body to those in the neck and face. All the major muscle groups are contracted. A typical sequence might be: toes, feet, calves, thighs, hips, lower back, stomach, chest, upper back, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, and face. Tensing the muscles really hard produces a correspondingly high level of relaxation in the muscle. It also enables a person to recognize and learn the difference between tense and relaxed muscles. With practice, it is possible to become fully relaxed in a matter of seconds. The technique is used by those who have trouble getting to sleep, and by elite athletes to prevent overarousal and the needless dissipation of nervous energy prior to competition. PMR is best practised in a quiet, comfortable room, free from distraction. To be effective, it should be practised regularly every day. Typically, the complete routine takes about 15 minutes and is performed up to three times a day, with the last session just before going to sleep. Significant benefits are usually gained in a few weeks."
"progressive resistance exercise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>progressive resistance exercise</b><div class=""content"">An exercise in which the workload is increased in predetermined steps. Ideally, the increments are sufficient to stimulate improvements (see <a href=""entry://overload principle""><span class=""links"">overload principle</span></a>) but not great enough to cause damage (see <a href=""entry://overtraining""><span class=""links"">overtraining</span></a> and <a href=""entry://overuse injury""><span class=""links"">overuse injury</span></a>). In weight training, progressive resistance exercises are generally based on the repetition maximum (RM). The RM is the maximum load a muscle group can lift for a given number of repetitions, so that a 10-RM is the maximum load that can be lifted 10 times. Typically, in one session several sets of exercises are performed, each at a higher intensity than the preceding one. The following example consists of three sets of repetitions with a short rest of 1&ndash;2 minutes between each: <blockquote>•&nbsp;set 1 at 50 per cent 10-RM<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;set 2 at 75 per cent 10-RM<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;set 3 at 100 per cent 10-RM.<br class=""nLine"" />

Prostaglandins are found in cell membranes. Their effects include stimulating the smooth muscle in the uterus and gut to contract, and regulating blood pressure. They are also involved in the inflammation response after injury. They dilate blood vessels and increase their permeability to fluid and proteins. This results in a rise in temperature and swelling of the affected area. Prostaglandins also increase the sensitivity of nerve endings to pain. Some of the beneficial effects of aspirin, linolenic acid, and omega-3 fatty acids may be due to their action on prostaglandins: aspirin tends to reduce prostaglandin synthesis; linolenic acid and omega-3 fatty acids affect the proportion of the different types of prostaglandins."

According to the UK Dietary Reference Values, the amount of protein sufficient for most individuals aged 19 or over is 0.75 g per kg per day (about 45 g for the average female and 55.5 g for the average male). Those who are very active, suffering from severe illness, or recovering from surgery need more protein. For example, in a report of an international conference on <i>Foods, Nutrition and Soccer Performance</i> held in Zurich in 1994, sports nutritionists stated that soccer players require between 1.4 to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. Protein requirements are also relatively high in children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers. Very active people can meet the body's demands for extra protein by having a well-balanced diet adjusted to their higher energy requirements. Attempts to increase muscle size artificially by consuming excessively high protein diets are thought by most dietitians to be useless. As protein in the diet increases, proportionately less is absorbed from the intestine. Amino acids not needed for growth or repair of body tissues are broken down and excreted as urea, or converted into either glucose (to be used as an energy source) or body fat. One gram of protein yields about 4 Calories. Protein can supply up to 10 per cent of the energy needed to sustain prolonged exercise.<br class=""nLine"" />Consumption of excess protein may cause dehydration and constipation, and can lead to obesity. It may also cause deficiencies in vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub>, and a loss of calcium with an increased risk of osteoporosis, but these effects are not fully established. Protein deficiency causes profound weight loss, mental and physical retardation in children, oedema, and anaemia.<br class=""nLine"" />Protein-rich foods include meat products, grains, legumes, and vegetables.

Some very low-calorie diets have inadequate protein, causing body muscles to waste away. The PSMF diet relies on protein as the main energy source, thus sparing body protein and minimizing muscle wasting.

"proteinuria","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>proteinuria</b><div class=""content"">Exercise can produce effects on the human body which, in a sedentary person, may indicate a serious disease. One such effect is proteinuria: the occurrence of abnormally large amounts of protein in the urine. At one time, this was regarded as a very reliable indicator of kidney damage because protein molecules were thought to be too large to pass from blood into the urine unless the kidney was damaged. However, it is now recognized that moderate proteinuria after heavy exertion is common in healthy, young adults. This condition is sometimes called athletic pseudonephritis because the symptoms are similar to those of a very serious kidney disease, glomerular nephritis. Unlike the disease, athletic pseudonephritis is not pathological and is quickly reversed when the exerciser lies down and rests."
"prozac","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>prozac</b><div class=""content"">Prozac (fluoxetine) has been hailed as a new miracle cure. It was first marketed in 1988 and is now widely used in the USA as an antidepressant. It has been prescribed for eating disorders and chronic fatigue. Some sports doctors also believe that it may reduce feelings of run down and mental fatigue associated with overtraining. Its use by athletes gained publicity in October 1994 when Alberto Salazar said that it helped him to win the Comrades Marathon in South Africa. This event is generally accepted as one of the most gruelling ultradistance events in the world, and Salazar's form for several years prior to the event had not been good.<br class=""nLine"" />In medical parlance, prozac is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Although we are not sure exactly how it works, it seems to increase the level of serotonin and acts as a relaxant. Therefore, its apparent positive effects on Salazar's endurance were a surprise to some sports scientists. Another SSRI actually reduces endurance capacity. However, it is possible that prozac improves the performance of athletes who have been mentally depressed.<br class=""nLine"" />Prozac does not benefit everyone. One psychiatrist said that it is ‘…helpful to some, but wretchedly unhelpful to others’. Side-effects are not experienced by everyone, but they can include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and akathisia (a disorder characterized by extreme restlessness and an inability to sit still)."

<b>psyche</b><div class=""content"">An ancient Greek word meaning soul or mind. In addition to psychology and related terms, several sporting expressions are derived from the word ‘psyche’. These include ‘psyching-up’ and being ‘psyched-out’.<br class=""nLine"" />Psyching-up is a motivational strategy used in sport to increase arousal so that a competitor responds more readily to the demands of competition. It often takes the form of an exhortation from a coach or manager to try harder (see also <a href=""entry://pep talk""><span class=""links"">pep talk</span></a>). Sometimes, the exhortation is too stimulating. The competitor becomes over-aroused and even anxious, resulting in a disturbance of mental balance, known as being ‘psyched-out’. This usually leads to poorer performances. Psyching-out is also sometimes attempted by competitors who try to make their opponents over-aroused by purposely irritating them.

<b>psychoneuromuscular theory</b><div class=""content"">A theory explaining the positive effects of mental practice during which a person only imagines performing an activity successfully. It is suggested that a vivid, imagined activity produces electrical responses in the muscles and nerves similar to those produced during an actual activity. Slight movements corresponding to those produced during the activity may also occur, but these may be so small that they are barely detectable without sensitive recording equipment. Support for the theory comes from electromyography of skiers using an instrument to measure muscle excitability and electrical activity. The electromyograph patterns in the muscles of skiers who were asked to imagine that they were performing a downhill slalom, closely approximated the pattern recorded when skiers were actually negotiating the slalom."

<b>puberty</b><div class=""content"">The period between the first appearance of pubic hair and (in females) the first menstrual flow, or (in males) the first development of active sperm. The age of puberty varies: in females it is usually between 9 and 15 years, and in males between 11 and 14 years. During puberty, young people undergo quite dramatic physical and psychological changes. Regular, well-structured exercise and sport can help them to cope with these changes by providing emotional and physical release. Involvement in sport can also encourage personal responsibility for health and an interest in sound nutrition. In addition to its cardiovascular benefits, regular aerobic exercise may also help to ease menstrual pain in girls. Despite all these advantages, some types of exercise are dangerous during puberty because bones are still growing and the cartilaginous growth zones (epiphyseal discs) are easily damaged. Consequently, hard anaerobic exercise and training with heavy weights should not take place until two years after the final growth spurt, which may be any time between 10 and 18 years. Excessive aerobic activity, such as long-distance running, can also place intolerable stresses on joints and soft tissues causing permanent damage."

"pulse","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pulse</b><div class=""content"">The pulse is a rhythmic expansion and recoil of the arteries. It results from a wave of pressure produced by the contraction of the heart. You can feel your pulse in any artery that passes over a bone sufficiently close to the body surface.<br class=""nLine"" />Many training programmes prescribe exercise intensities in terms of target heart rates. In healthy individuals, pulse rates are usually identical to heart rates. Most exercisers find it easier to take their pulse rate and generally use that as an indicator of exercise intensity.<br class=""nLine"" />The best site for checking the pulse is in the groove directly above the base of the thumb on the underside of the wrist (figure 54). This is called the radial pulse because it is where the radial artery passes alongside the radius. To count the pulse, simply press the fingertips of your middle and index fingers gently but firmly against the radial artery. The pressure should be sufficient to feel the pulse, but not so great that the artery is blocked. It usually takes a few seconds to become aware of the pulse and a few seconds more to become sensitive to its rhythm. Once this is established, an accurate count can be made over a period of 10 or 15 seconds and the pulse rate per minute calculated. (If an exerciser stops to take the pulse for a full minute, the heart rate will have slowed down by the time the minute has elapsed). Sometimes the carotid pulse is taken by pressing the carotid artery which lies along the forward side of the throat, but this pulse can produce inaccurate results. Also, pressure against the artery can affect a sense organ, the carotid sinus (see <a href=""entry://carotid artery""><span class=""links"">carotid artery</span></a>), which may cause the heart rate to decrease by more than 15 beats per minute. <center class=""centre""><img src=""000065.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" /> Figure 54 Taking the radial pulse.</center>"

<b>pumping-up</b><div class=""content"">A body-builder's term to describe the process of increasing the apparent size of muscle by lifting comparatively light weights many times in quick succession. The contraction of muscle compresses veins so that less blood leaves the capillaries than enters through the arteries. The pressure within the capillaries is raised, forcing some of the fluid out into the tissue spaces and increasing the size of the muscles. Shortly after exercise, the pressure is reduced as the excess fluid in the tissue spaces returns to the blood, and the size of the muscle returns to normal."

<b>Q-angle</b> (quadriceps angle)<div class=""content"">An important indicator of biomechanical function, the Q-angle is the angle formed between the longitudinal axis of the femur, representing the line of pull of the quadriceps muscle, and a line that represents the pull of the patellar tendon. The patellar tendon is a band of strong connective tissue attaching the shin bone to the knee cap. When the quads are relaxed, the Q-angle is normally less than 15 degrees in men and less than 20 degrees in women. An abnormally large Q-angle usually results in a disorder called abnormal quadriceps pull. When the quadriceps muscle contracts, it pulls the kneecap sideways resulting in an overpronation and internal rotation which can lead to knee problems."
"quad stretch","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>quad stretch</b><div class=""content"">A simple exercise that stretches the quadriceps muscles at the front of the thighs (figure 55).

<br class=""nLine"" />❏<i> Stand upright on your left leg, grasp your right foot around the ankle and slowly move the heel towards your buttocks. Hold the stretched position for about 10 seconds; during the hold, contract your buttocks muscles, drawing them downwards to increase the stretch on the quadriceps muscles. To minimize the risk of injury, try not to allow your back to arch during the exercise, and keep your right knee pointing directly downwards throughout the stretch. This will ensure that the bones and muscles of the leg are correctly aligned. Repeat the stretch on the other leg.</i>"
"quadriceps","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>quadriceps</b>
<i>(quads)</i><div class=""content"">A group of four muscles (rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis) which extend down the front of the thigh. The rectus femoris originates in the pelvis but the others originate from different points on the thigh bone. The four muscles join in a single tendon which crosses the knee cap to insert onto the shin bone. They are usually the most powerful muscles in the body and are the major extensors for straightening the leg. They play a vital role in any activity that involves running, walking, jumping, or even standing. Overextension, for instance when kicking, commonly results in the quads being strained (quadriceps muscle-pull). The leg hurts when touched and feels sore when the quads contract, for example, when going up stairs, hill running or doing squats. Overuse can also lead to a strain in the tendon, causing pain just above the knee cap. The quads are also actively involved in restraining the leg during downhill movements; the muscles contract eccentrically to resist the pull of gravity. Consequently, excessive downhill running is a common cause of muscle soreness in the quads. See also <a href=""entry://Q-angle""><span class=""links"">Q-angle</span></a>."

"range of movement","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>range of movement</b><div class=""content"">The extent to which a joint can be moved through the arc of a circle. Range of movement is determined by a number of factors, including the shape of the joint's bony surfaces, the length of its ligaments, and the elasticity of its connective tissue. Muscle contractions and gravity are the main forces which can both cause and resist joint movements.<br class=""nLine"" />There are a number of ways to describe range of movement. A joint's maximum passive range of movement is the range that can be produced by any means (e.g. manipulation by a partner). For example, a knee joint which forms an angle of 30 degrees when fully flexed, and 165 degrees when fully extended, has a maximum passive range of 135 degrees. This is greater than the extent achieved during normal movements (the normal active range), or the maximum movement which an individual can actively perform (the maximum active range).<br class=""nLine"" />The complete range of movement of a joint is divided into three equal parts: the inner range, during which the muscle responsible for the movement is fully contracted; the outer range, in which the muscle is becoming fully stretched; and a middle range between the two extremes. When the muscle is fully stretched at the limit of the outer range, it is said to be in its end position.<br class=""nLine"" />An increase in range of movement is unlikely unless a joint is taken to its end position during stretching and flexibility training. In sports like gymnastics, range of movement is kept as great as possible. However, joints may become unstable and weak unless strength training is combined with flexibility training.

"rate-pressure product","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rate-pressure product</b><div class=""content"">An indicator of the oxygen requirements of the heart. Rate-pressure product is calculated as the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure (the maximum pressure exerted by the blood on vessel walls).<br class=""nLine"" />The heart is a living pump which needs a good supply of oxygen and nutrients in order to work. If these supplies are inadequate, heart failure results. During aerobic exercise, heart rate and systolic blood pressure are the two main factors determining the workload on the heart. If these factors increase, the heart has to work harder, and will require more oxygen and nutrients to keep going. The response of the heart rate and blood pressure to a fixed level of exercise tends to decrease with regular, vigorous aerobic exercise. Therefore, a well-trained person is better able to satisfy the demands of the heart for oxygen and nutrients during exercise than an untrained person. For the same reasons, training is also thought to offer some protection if there is any disruption of the blood supply to the heart muscle."

The Ratzeburg method is a combination of interval training (to achieve peak aerobic fitness) and weight lifting (to obtain strength endurance). The interval training was based on that used by track athletes, but was performed in boats. Rowers were encouraged to use the same weight-lifting techniques as competition lifters, and were expected to move the barbell swiftly; rest between sets was kept to a minimum.

<b>reaction time</b><div class=""content"">The delay between the presentation of a stimulus (e.g. the sound of a starting pistol) and the initiation of a response. The delay is due to all the events which have to take place before a person is able to respond. Information in the form of nerve impulses has to travel from the sense organ along nerves to the central nervous system (i.e. the brain or spinal cord) where it is processed. Then a message has to be conveyed to the muscles before they respond. It takes about 14&ndash;16 hundredths of a second to respond to an acoustic stimulus (excluding the time it takes for the sound to reach the ear), and 16&ndash;18 hundredths of a second to respond to optical stimuli. Reaction times can be improved by training, but even well-trained, elite sprinters cannot respond physiologically in less than 10 hundredths of a second without anticipating the signal; in electronically-timed competitions, any starts quicker than this are regarded as false starts.<br class=""nLine"" />You may assess the speed of your reactions by doing the ruler drop test (sometimes called the stick test). <br class=""nLine"" />❏<i> Get a partner to hold the top of a metre rule with the thumb and index finger.

<b>Recommended Dietary Allowance</b> (RDA)<div class=""content"">A set of reference levels for nutrient intakes. In the USA, the RDA is an estimate of the average safe amount of nutrients and energy needed to maintain good health in a person who is already healthy. RDAs are adjusted for men, women, and children, and for different age groups, as well as for pregnant women. The further below the RDA intake is, the greater the risk of deficiency; the further above the RDA, the greater the risk of toxic effects. RDAs were revised in 1989 by a panel of nutrition specialists. RDAs were based on their expert opinion rather than proven fact. RDAs form the basis of Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs). The Nutrition and Labeling Education Act of 1990 mandates that nearly all foods in the USA should have RDIs on their labels.<br class=""nLine"" />Until 1991, RDAs were also published in Britain when they were replaced with Dietary Reference Values. There were considerable differences between the British RDAs and those set in the USA.

"recommended dietary goals","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>recommended dietary goals</b><div class=""content"">Many governments have recognized the importance of diet in relation to their nation's health and economic prosperity. Accordingly, some departments responsible for health have provided guidelines about the quantity of specific nutrients people should eat to ensure adequacy and prevent nutrient deficiency (see <a href=""entry://Recommended Dietary Allowance""><span class=""links"">Recommended Dietary Allowance</span></a>). In addition, some government bodies (such as the US Senate Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs) have made more general dietary recommendations aimed at reducing nutrition-related diseases. Most of these recommendations advise adults to: <blockquote>•&nbsp;MAINTAIN DESIRABLE WEIGHT. Consume the same amount of energy (calories) as you expend to keep in energy balance. (For male adults, this is about 2500 Calories each day, and 2000 Calories for females)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;INCREASE THE CONSUMPTION OF COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that 70 per cent of our total calorie intake should be complex carbohydrates which include fruit and vegetables, pulses, and grains<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;DECREASE REFINED SUGAR INTAKE. Added sugar should contribute no more than 10 per cent of energy intake<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;REDUCE TOTAL FAT CONSUMPTION. Countries vary in their recommendations. UK guidelines suggest a decrease in the average fat intake from about 40 per cent to 35 per cent. WHO suggest that only 15&ndash;30 per cent of food energy should come from fat with a maximum of 10 per cent as saturated fat<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;MODERATE PROTEIN INTAKE. This should be about 10&ndash;15 per cent of calorie intake<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;REDUCE CHOLESTEROL INTAKE. Restrict consumption to less than 300 mg per day<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;EAT LOW-FAT SOURCES OF CALCIUM-RICH FOODS. This is especially important for adolescent and premenopausal women to reduce the risk of osteoporosis<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;INCREASE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE. Leafy green and yellow vegetables are particularly good sources of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The WHO recommend that we eat more than 400 g each day (about five servings a day)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;INCREASE DIETARY FIBRE INTAKE. Adults should eat about 30 g of fibre each day (18 g of non-starch polysaccharide)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;AVOID OVERCONSUMPTION OF SUPPLEMENTS. Supplements are necessary for some people, but most people can obtain adequate nutrients from a varied, balanced diet. Supplement use can lead to toxicity<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;DECREASE SALT CONSUMPTION. Sodium intake should be less than 1.6 g per day (equivalent to about 4 g of table salt a day)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;RESTRICT ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. Consume no more than one ounce of pure alcohol a day (approximately 3 units, equivalent to about two glasses of wine).<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> Most dietitians emphasize the advantages of eating a variety of natural, unrefined foods to ensure that we obtain sufficient nutrients.

"recovery","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>recovery</b><div class=""content"">The physiological processes that restore the body to its pre-exercise condition after exercise. Recovery includes replenishment of muscle glycogen and phosphagen (the energy stores in the muscles); removal of lactic acid and other metabolites (the waste products of muscle activity); reoxygenation of myoglobin (the special respiratory pigment which provides muscles with an extra source of oxygen); and replacement of protein (needed to repair muscles damaged during exercise). Recovery can be accelerated by ensuring body fluids lost in sweat are replaced with water; by replacing mineral salts lost in sweat (especially sodium and potassium); and by eating enough nutrients (especially foods that can be converted to muscle glycogen) to replace those lost during the exercise.

"rehabilitation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rehabilitation</b><div class=""content"">The process of restoring an injured person to the level of physical fitness enjoyed before the injury. In the past, rehabilitation usually followed the treatment of an injury, but now treatment and rehabilitation tend to take place simultaneously. The aim of rehabilitation is to restore athletes to full fitness safely and in the shortest possible time so that they can train and compete at a standard as high as, or even higher than, before the injury. Speedy rehabilitation is particularly important to ageing athletes because the longer they are unable to train properly, the harder they must work to regain full, competitive fitness. It takes about twice as long for an athlete aged 60 to recover from an injury as someone aged 20. A rehabilitation programme should include all aspects of physical fitness, especially flexibility, strength, endurance, balance, muscle coordination, agility, and skill. In this respect, it is similar to a conditioning programme. However, in every phase of rehabilitation recovery from injury must have prime consideration and additional stress to the injured area must be avoided. If an athlete returns to competition before complete rehabilitation, there is a high risk of recurrence of the injury or development of a new one.

<b>relative weight</b><div class=""content"">The ratio of a person's weight to the midpoint of the weight range for people of the same height, body build, and sex, based on standard height/weight charts published by insurance companies. Relative weight is often used to assess the extent to which a person is overweight or obese, but it is not a very reliable or accurate estimate.

"relaxation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>relaxation</b><div class=""content"">Relaxation is characterized by a reduction or complete absence of muscle activity and a controlled, relatively stable level of arousal that is lower than the normal waking state. Relaxation is incompatible with feelings of worry and anxiety. The famous physiologist, William James, stated long ago: ‘If muscular contraction is removed from emotion, no emotion is left’.<br class=""nLine"" />Relaxation is a skill anyone can learn. It is possible to reduce muscular activity consciously to induce a state of relaxation and obtain optimal levels of arousal (see <a href=""entry://progressive muscle relaxation""><span class=""links"">progressive muscle relaxation</span></a>). Programmes of muscular relaxation have been used to control anxiety, and to treat high blood pressure, insomnia, nervous headaches, stomach distress, and menstrual distress. It has also been used to increase tolerance to loud noises and other painful stimuli.<br class=""nLine"" />Other relaxation techniques include psychological strategies such as behaviour therapy, biofeedback training, and meditation. A number of tranquillizer drugs are used as relaxants, but most have unpleasant side-effects such as drowsiness and dizziness. In high doses they can cause abnormal movements and actions. Prolonged use of some tranquillizers may lead to dependence."
"relaxin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>relaxin</b><div class=""content"">A hormone secreted by the placenta in the terminal stages of pregnancy. It causes a softening of connective tissues (cartilage and tendons), so that the bones at the front of the pelvis can separate, making it easier for the baby to be born. Unfortunately, relaxin also affects the tissue of other joints, loosening them. These changes may persist for several weeks after delivery. Therefore, most physicians advise expectant mothers to avoid vigorous weight-bearing exercises during the later stages of pregnancy and for a few weeks after birth."

<b>renin</b><div class=""content"">An enzyme released by the kidneys in response to exercise and stress. It helps maintain the correct salt and fluid balance in the body. It reacts with a substance produced by the liver to form angiotensin which increases blood pressure; overproduction of renin can cause hypertension."
"rennin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rennin</b><div class=""content"">An enzyme produced in the stomach to coagulate milk protein and delay its passage into the small intestine. The delay enables other enzymes to break the protein down into absorbable amino acids. Relatively large amounts of rennin are present in the gastric juice of infants, but it may be absent in adults. A derivative of rennin, rennet, is used in junket- and cheese-making. Some vegetarians (lacto-vegetarians) will eat dairy products but not other animal products. Cheese for these vegetarians is made using edible plant enzymes or genetically-engineered enzymes which have the same action as rennin. In fact, because they are cheaper, genetically-engineered enzymes are gradually replacing rennet in other cheese-making."
"repetition maximum","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

"repetition training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>repetition training</b><div class=""content"">A form of training, similar to interval training, used by runners, swimmers, cyclists, and other sports people. It differs from interval training in the length of the work interval and the amount of recovery between repetitions. For runners, it consists of running a given distance in a predetermined time with almost complete rest and recovery (usually walking) after each run. The run is usually at, or near, race pace."

"repetitive strain injury","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>repetitive strain injury</b> (RSI)<div class=""content"">An injury to soft tissues (especially tendons) caused by repeated use of a muscle or muscle group. RSI is a generic term for a whole group of overuse injuries including carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and tenosynovitis. These were once thought to be mainly the preserve of overenthusiastic exercisers. In fact, RSIs are so common in some sports that they have acquired a sporting epithet (for examples, see <a href=""entry://golfer's elbow""><span class=""links"">golfer's elbow</span></a> and <a href=""entry://tennis elbow""><span class=""links"">tennis elbow</span></a>). In recent years there appears to have been an epidemic of RSIs not associated with sport: the British Trades Union Congress estimated that more than 200 000 people per year miss work because of the condition, and in 1992 the US Bureau of Labour Statistics reported 282 000 confirmed cases of RSI, a 26 per cent increase on the previous year. The increase has been linked to the advent of personal computers. Repetitive speed-typing on computer keyboards may result in pain and stiffness in the hands, wrists and arms. The pain may be so severe that sufferers cannot drive, or carry bags. In the UK, keyboard-induced RSI has been called Work Related Upper Limb Disorder by the Health and Safety Executive. A few physicians deny the existence of RSI and regard it as largely psychosomatic. However, most treat it in the same way as other overuse injuries, with rest, anti-inflammatories, physiotherapy and, in extreme cases, surgery."

"resistant starch","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>resistant starch</b><div class=""content"">Dietary starch which behaves like fibre because it remains relatively undigested until it reaches the large intestine. Although it may form only a small percentage of the total starch in a food, it can form a large percentage of its total fibre. For example, some white bread contains only 0.7 per cent resistant starch, but this may make up 30 per cent of its fibre. The proportion of resistant starch in a food varies widely with the extent and type of cooking, freshness of the food, and other factors. Some estimates of dietary fibre ignore the contribution of resistant starch and include only non-starch polysaccharides.

"respiration","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>respiration</b><div class=""content"">The chemical process by which food is converted into a form of energy that can be used by the body. During this internal or cellular respiration, carbohydrates and fats (and proteins in extreme circumstances) are broken down either without oxygen (anaerobic respiration) or with oxygen (aerobic respiration) to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the only chemical which can be used directly as a source of energy by the body."

"respiratory quotient","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>respiratory quotient</b> (RQ)<div class=""content"">The ratio of the volume of carbon dioxide produced to the volume of oxygen consumed during respiration. The RQ can be used to determine which foods are being used as an energy source. During aerobic respiration, respiration of fat gives an RQ of 0.7; respiration of protein gives an RQ of 0.9; and respiration of carbohydrate gives an RQ of 1.0. An RQ of more than 1.0 indicates that anaerobic respiration is taking place."
"rest","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rest</b><div class=""content"">Rest is often a forgotten or underestimated element of an exercise programme. However, periods of proper rest are essential. Rest gives the body time to adapt to the demands of vigorous exercise. Without it, there is a serious risk of overtraining and overuse injuries. Lack of rest is a major reason for underachieving in competitions. Rest not only enables you to recover physically from the stress of exercise, it also gives you time to recuperate mentally. Sensible exercisers incorporate at least one day of complete rest each week into their exercise programme. They also avoid training hard on consecutive days. Serious, competitive sports people usually have a long rest period of 6&ndash;8 weeks in their yearly schedules.<br class=""nLine"" />Bruce Fordyce, the brilliant distance runner and one of the most successful ultramarathon runners ever (he won the Comrades Marathon every year from 1981 to 1990), gave the following training advice: ‘During the hard training phase never be afraid to take a day off. If your legs are feeling unduly stiff and sore, rest; if you are at all sluggish, rest; in fact, if in doubt, rest.’<br class=""nLine"" />It is worth remembering that when you are older, it takes longer to recover from intense exercise, and that you will require longer rest periods.

"rest-pause training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rest-pause training</b><div class=""content"">A method of weight training that enables a lifter to perform several repetitions with a weight that normally could be used only once. Ten to fifteen seconds rest is taken after each repetition, allowing the blood to flow back into the muscles. This allows the muscles to recover before another maximum effort.

"rheumatoid arthritis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rheumatoid arthritis</b><div class=""content"">A chronic inflammation affecting the lining and fluid of joints. It causes stiffness and pain. Treatment may include exercise and changes in diet. Exercise is sometimes beneficial, but sufferers should consult their doctor to find out what type of exercise, if any, is best for them. Some are helped by gentle mobility exercise and others by muscle-building.<br class=""nLine"" />There is controversy concerning the affect of diet on rheumatoid arthritis. The Arthritis and Rheumatism Research Council advises those with rheumatoid arthritis to follow a normal, prudent diet and moderate their intake of fats, especially saturated fats. Most doctors endorse the view that a diet low in saturated fat with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables may help sufferers, if only because this diet is healthy. However, there is less agreement about prescribing specific foods (e.g. fish oil supplements and evening primrose oils) to reduce inflammation and pain. The greatest disagreement surrounds the use of elimination diets to discover which foods aggravate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Many doctors are sceptical about interpretations. For example, if a sufferer eliminates chocolate and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms disappear, the sufferer will tend to blame the chocolate for the symptoms, but the effects may be merely coincidental. Nevertheless, some doctors claim that up to a third of their patients manage to control rheumatoid arthritis by dietary changes alone. Foods commonly eliminated include red meat, alcohol, dairy produce, and citrus fruits."

"RICE","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>RICE</b><div class=""content"">An acronym for the first phases of the rehabilitation of an acute musculo-skeletal injury: ‘R’, rest the injured body part; ‘I’, apply ice; ‘C’, apply compression; and ‘E’, elevate the injured extremity above heart level. This treatment helps to reduce swelling and restrict the spread of bruising, accelerating the healing process. Rest varies from absolute rest to relative rest, depending on the severity of the injury. Ice is never applied directly to the skin. As well as reducing swelling, the ice also acts as a local anaesthetic, decreasing pain. Compression is usually by means of a bandage wrapped tight enough to reduce swelling, but not so tight that blood flow is restricted. Elevation helps to drain excess fluid to the heart. RICE is one of the best forms of immediate treatment for almost any sports-related musculo-skeletal injury and should be continued for as long as pain and swelling persist. However, the ice should not be applied for longer than 15&ndash;20 minutes at any one time as it may impair circulation and damage tissues."

<b>Rockport Fitness Walking Test</b><div class=""content"">A test developed in the United States by cardiologists and exercise physiologists to determine fitness and monitor progress during an exercise programme. The fitness ratings are based on the speed at which you can walk exactly 1.6 km (1 mile) on a flat course, and the effect of the walk on your heart rate (assessed from a 15 second count of pulse rate immediately after the walk is completed). The faster you can complete the walk and the lower the effect of walking on heart rate, the fitter you are (figure 56). You are advised to warm-up for 10&ndash;15 minutes before the test, and to wear loose clothing and good shoes suitable for walking.<center class=""centre""><img src=""000000.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 56 Rockport Fitness Walking Test</center><br class=""nLine"" />The test is generally regarded as quite safe and can be used by anyone.

"rope jumping","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rope jumping</b><div class=""content"">Rope jumping or skipping has long been regarded by boxers and their trainers as an excellent activity for developing aerobic fitness, strength, agility, and coordination. It has also been endorsed by the American Heart Association as a good exercise for cardiorespiratory fitness. However, it can be very strenuous and it is not easy to control exercise intensity. Jumping at 80 skips a minute can require 9 METS (that is, you will use nine times the amount of oxygen used at rest).<br class=""nLine"" />There are many kinds of rope jumping, from the very simple to the very difficult. The basic bounce consists of jumping with both feet just one or two inches above the floor, and landing on the balls of the feet with knees bent slightly. You should keep feet, ankles, and knees together. Have your forearms out at right angles, and turn the rope by making small circles with your hands and wrists. Keep your body upright with your head and eyes up. You should start slowly and maintain a steady rhythm. The rope is of the correct length if, when you stand on its centre, the handles reach from armpit to armpit."
"rotation diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rotation diet</b><div class=""content"">A diet that alternates periods of low calorie intake with periods of moderate intake. This rotation of low and moderate energy intakes is aimed at preventing the body from lowering its metabolic rate as an adaptation to long-term low calorie intakes. In fact, the whole regime, which includes regular daily exercise, is designed to increase metabolic rate. This chop-and-change system also makes the diet less demanding on willpower than a continuous low-diet regime.<br class=""nLine"" />The menus appear to provide a healthy balance of protein, low fat, and high fibre complex-carbohydrate foods, with a strong emphasis on fruit and vegetables. However, this diet, like other low calorie diets, is potentially harmful to certain groups of people. The deviser provides an alternative higher-calorie scheme for diabetics, but anyone wishing to follow the diet should consult their dietitian or doctor first."
"rotator cuff","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rotator cuff</b><div class=""content"">Four small muscles which stabilize the shoulder joint. These muscles are the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor. They hold the ball-shaped head of the humerus bone (the long bone in the upper arm) in the socket in the scapula. The rotator cuff assists in some shoulder and arm movements. During throwing activities, the muscles undergo rapid eccentric contractions (they are lengthened under tension) as they decelerate the arm. This puts considerable stress on the tendons of the muscles making them susceptible to overuse injuries."
"rowing","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rowing</b><div class=""content"">Rowing in a boat with a sliding seat is considered to be one of the best forms of aerobic exercise. It uses muscles in the arms, legs, and torso, providing an all body workout. This increases bone density in the spine which may offer some protection against osteoporosis.<br class=""nLine"" />Rowing is a sport which can be enjoyed at many levels. Even some octogenarians with a modest fitness level row regularly for exercise and pleasure. Many stable types of boats have been developed for non-competitive, recreational rowers. Elite rowers require supreme levels of fitness. World-class rowers have extremely high maximum oxygen consumptions (a measure of aerobic fitness), second only to cross-country skiers.<br class=""nLine"" />One attraction of rowing is that the boat supports the body so there is little jarring of the joints and a low risk of stress injuries such as shin splints and sore knees. Nevertheless, because the primary power for rowing comes from the leg muscles linked to the back, injuries to the lower back are relatively common. These injuries are often caused by poor conditioning or poor technique, for example, by overworking the flexible thoracic spine rather than using the combined power of the upper and lower body. To reduce the risk of injury, all rowers should do conditioning training and master the correct techniques. They should also train to develop their aerobic fitness, muscular strength, endurance, and flexibility, so that they can improve their performance and enhance their enjoyment. Training on water usually includes long stretches of rowing at two-thirds maximum effort interspersed with bursts at maximum energy output. Land-based training may involve calisthenics, weight training, running, cycling, and the use of rowing machines.<br class=""nLine"" />Despite low injury rates, serious accidents can occur if rowers capsize. All rowers should be able to swim and be fully aware of survival techniques in case of accidents."
"Royal Canadian 5BX and XBX Programs","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Royal Canadian 5BX and XBX Programs</b><div class=""content"">Progressive exercise plans designed by the Royal Canadian Airforce to develop and maintain the physical fitness of their military personnel. The programs have been widely adopted by the public. The basic exercises can be performed without any special equipment and in a confined space.<br class=""nLine"" />The 5BX programs are arranged in six charts, each with five exercises. Warming-up is incorporated into the exercises. For example, the first exercise (toe touching for 2 minutes) stretches and loosens the muscles. You start the first exercise easily, and gradually increase vigour and speed. The exercises are graded so that a person increases the number of repetitions of each exercise described on one chart and then progresses to more demanding exercises in the next chart as fitness improves. The exercises in chart one are:<blockquote>•&nbsp;toe touching: 2 minutes<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;partial sit-up (sufficient to see heels): 1 minute<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;leg lifts: 1 minute<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;push-ups: 1 minute<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;stationary running: 6 minutes.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>The exercises are completed in about 11 minutes.<br class=""nLine"" />The XBX program consists of four charts of 10 exercises, arranged in progressive order of difficulty. As with the 5BX charts, as your fitness improves, you perform more repetitions and then move on to a more difficult chart. The exercises in chart one are, in the order performed:<blockquote>•&nbsp;toe touching: 30 seconds<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;knee raising: 30 seconds<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;arm circling: 30 seconds<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;partial sit-ups: 30 seconds<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;chest and leg raising: 2 minutes<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;side leg raising: 1 minute<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;push-ups (from a kneeling position): 2 minutes<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;leg lifting: 1 minute<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;run and hop: 3 minutes.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>The 10 exercises are completed in about 12 minutes."

<b>rubber suit</b><div class=""content"">A suit made of material impermeable to water. A sensible use of rubber suits is in water sports, but other rubber and plastic suits are designed and marketed specifically for weight reduction during exercise. These are sometimes called sauna suits. They are worn during exercise to raise body temperature. Perspiration increases and body weight is reduced. However, the weight reduction is almost entirely through water loss and is quickly regained. Such suits can be dangerous because they prevent evaporative cooling of the body. This may cause heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and death even in cold weather if the suits are used during heavy physical exertion."
"rugby","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rugby</b><div class=""content"">Rugby is a fast-flowing contact sport played by men and women. Each position offers its own particular combination of physical challenges. Forwards require great upper body strength combined with powerful legs to drive in the scrum, and backs need great sprinting speed. All players need endurance and good ball-handling skills. High levels of aerobic fitness enable players to maintain their skills at high speed throughout the whole game. Players can improve their endurance through running, cycling, or on rowing machines. They can develop strength by weight training, muscle endurance by circuit training, and powerful sprinting by sprint drills and plyometrics. It is also important that players perform stretching and mobility exercises to compensate for the shortening and tightening of muscles during a game.<br class=""nLine"" />Rugby is a hazardous sport. Injuries are frequent and sometimes severe enough to cause death or complete quadriplegia. The most vulnerable age group is that between 15 and 21. Injuries are often related to dangerous or aggressive play. Rule changes have been introduced to reduce the incidence of serious injuries: players must keep their heads and shoulders above hip level; they are not allowed to charge; and penalties are incurred for popping, collapsing, or wheeling the scrum.

"salicylates","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>salicylates</b><div class=""content"">Compounds which are salts of salicylic acid, a drug with bactericidal and fungicidal properties. If salicylic acid is applied to the skin it causes peeling and is used to remove warts and corns. Salicylates can be synthesized but they also occur naturally in many foods and drinks, including dried fruits, some vegetables (e.g. chicory, green peppers, green olives, and radishes), herbs, teas, and some coffees, wines, and beers.<br class=""nLine"" />Many salicylates have properties similar to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) which is also prepared from salicylic acid. They are administered to reduce swelling and relieve the pain associated with muscle and joint injuries. Overdoses of salicylates and related compounds (including aspirin) can lead to a form of poisoning called salicylism. This is characterized by dizziness, impaired hearing, drowsiness, sweating, and, in extreme cases, delirium and collapse. Even in low doses, salicylates may cause salicylism in some people. Also, hyperactivity in children is sometimes caused by an adverse reaction to salicylates and is treated with a salicylate-free diet."

In the USA, it is estimated that <i>Salmonella</i> infects up to 4 million people annually. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The disease can be fatal in infants, the elderly, and individuals with a weakened immune system.<br class=""nLine"" />Most salmonellosis is probably due to poor hygiene in food handling, but some people have attributed the increase in salmonellosis to the use of antibiotics in animal feeds. The antibiotics are administered to improve growth. However, if dosages are not sufficiently high to kill all <i>Salmonella</i>, they may enable antibiotic-resistant strains to develop. If the meat is then not handled properly, these super-strains of bacteria could infect humans. In recent years, another source of <i>Salmonella</i> has been raw eggs, which may become infected with bacteria from inside the hen."
"salt","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>salt</b><div class=""content"">A member of a wide range of chemicals formed when one or more hydrogen atoms of an acid has been replaced by a metal.

"saturated fat","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>saturated fat</b><div class=""content"">A fat or triglyceride having the maximum number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms. Because of its chemical structure, molecules of saturated fat can pack tightly together. Consequently, they tend to be solid at room temperature. Consuming large amounts of saturated fats can result in fatty substances such as cholesterol being deposited in the walls of arteries. This may lead to atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries) and high blood pressure. Saturated fats come mainly from animal sources (such as beef, butter, whole-milk dairy products, the dark meat of poultry, and poultry skin) as well as some tropical vegetable oils (such as coconut and palm oils). Many governments throughout the world have recommended a decrease in the consumption of saturated fat to reduce the risk of heart disease.

"sauna baths","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sauna baths</b><div class=""content"">A type of bath originating in Finland. The bather is immersed for a period in hot steam and then subjected to cold water. Some people take a sauna in order to lose weight. Saunas may be invigorating and boost morale, but they result in only a temporary weight reduction due to water loss. When fluids are consumed, weight is regained.<br class=""nLine"" />Taking a sauna immediately after strenuous exercise can be dangerous. A 33-year-old Israeli man who had a sauna 15 minutes after a strenuous weight-lifting session, produced an abnormally dark urine. On examination, he was found to be suffering from rhabdomyolitis, a destructive muscle condition usually associated with heat exhaustion. It can cause kidney failure and fluid congestion of heart and lungs. Physicians advise against taking very hot saunas immediately after a hard training session. It is also advisable not to take a sauna immediately after a large meal."

"Scarsdale diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Scarsdale diet</b><div class=""content"">A weight-loss diet devised by Dr Herman Tarnower in 1979. The dietary regime has two stages which alternate fortnightly. The first stage consists of the medical diet, a strictly prescribed high protein, low carbohydrate, low fat diet. Protein constitutes about 43 per cent of the diet but fats are restricted to about 25 per cent. Sugar, pasta, potatoes, and all bread (except a high protein variety) are excluded and between-meal snacks are restricted to carrots and celery. Tea or coffee can be taken freely, but alcohol is not allowed. The second stage consists of a keep-trim programme. This acts as a relief period from the very strict regime. More foods are allowed and alcohol can be taken in moderation. The diet during the keep-trim programme contains less protein.<br class=""nLine"" />Although the Scarsdale diet may result in weight loss, it is potentially harmful. The excessive amounts of protein and low carbohydrate in the medical diet can result in the accumulation of ketones, chemicals that are toxic in high concentrations. These may not be completely eliminated during the keep-trim programme. See also <a href=""entry://ketogenic diet""><span class=""links"">ketogenic diet</span></a>."

"scurvy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>scurvy</b><div class=""content"">A disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C. Initial signs include bleeding gums. This may be followed by anaemia, red spots in the skin where blood has leaked out of capillaries, degeneration of muscle and cartilage, and weight loss. Most of the symptoms of the disease can be attributed to the breakdown of collagen (a protein that forms an important part of skin). The effects are reversed by treatment with vitamin C supplements. Vitamin intakes as low as 10 mg/day will prevent scurvy.<br class=""nLine"" />Although scurvy is rare in Western societies, it still occurs in some infants fed bottled milk, in elderly people who restrict their intake of acidic fruits because of heartburn, and in people addicted to alcohol who do not eat enough food. It may also occur in people who abruptly cease taking megadoses of vitamin C (a condition known as rebound scurvy)."

In sport, this can be detrimental to performance and there are a number of psychological training methods to improve self-concept. In addition, to maintain good mental health, the public and ideal self should be compatible with the real self. See also <a href=""entry://body image""><span class=""links"">body image</span></a>."
"self-confidence","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>self-confidence</b><div class=""content"">A person's belief that he or she can succeed. Self-confidence is usually specific to particular tasks, but some people seem to display it in a wide range of activities. In sport, it has long been thought of as an important determinant of performance. It tends to be self-generating: confident athletes set themselves difficult training goals and persevere until they have achieved them. This generates feelings of competence which reinforce their confidence. Sport psychologists refer to situation-specific self-confidence as self-efficacy. According to one theory (Bandura's self-efficacy theory), self-efficacy is enhanced by four main factors: successful performances; vicarious experience; verbal persuasion (including praise and encouragement); and arousal (see <a href=""entry://catastrophe theory""><span class=""links"">catastrophe theory</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />In training, you can enhance your self-confidence in the following ways:<blockquote>•&nbsp;SET APPROPRIATE GOALS. Break down long-term goals into short-term, attainable goals so as to maximize feelings of success<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;VICARIOUS EXPERIENCE OF SUCCESS. Imagine yourself performing the target activities perfectly to maximize the vicarious experience of success (see also <a href=""entry://visualization""><span class=""links"">visualization</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;VERBAL ENCOURAGEMENT. Use positive self-talk, by verbally encouraging yourself (e.g. with phrases such as ‘This is a great session; I'm doing really well today…’) to reinforce feelings of self-confidence.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>"

"self-esteem","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>self-esteem</b><div class=""content"">Positive self-esteem is viewing yourself as a competent and worthy person, and feeling good about yourself. Regular aerobic exercise can enhance self-esteem.<br class=""nLine"" />Lack of self-esteem is often associated with being overweight; this is reinforced by the media which portray thinness as essential for success, health, and wealth. Low self-esteem can result in not caring about how one looks, and not bothering to eat well or exercise. Excessive eating and drinking may be pursued as a means of escape from feelings of worthlessness. Many people, particularly women, seek sweet foods, especially chocolates, when they are feeling low. These so-called ‘comfort’ foods may alter mood by changing brain chemistry. For example, carbohydrate-rich foods increase the concentrations of an amino acid, tryptophan, within the brain. The tryptophan is a building block of serotonin, a neurotransmitter which relieves depression and reduces irritability. Self-esteem can be enhanced by thinking positively: by focusing on successes rather than failures and concentrating on your good points rather than on what you think of as bad points."

"serotonin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>serotonin</b>
<i>(entramine; 5-hydroxytryptamine)</i><div class=""content"">Serotonin is a chemical derived from the amino acid tryptophan. It plays a key part in a number of reactions in the brain and other tissues. In the blood, it acts as a vasoconstrictor, narrowing blood vessels, and is involved in the inflammation response. In the brain, serotonin is a neurotransmitter, affecting the activity of nerve cells. Brain concentrations are affected by diet in quite a complex way depending on the ability of tryptophan to cross the barrier between blood and the brain. Generally, carbohydrate-rich diets increase tryptophan levels, accelerating serotonin production. Some protein-rich diets (those containing the amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine) compete with tryptophan to get across the blood-brain barrier, depress tryptophan uptake into the brain, and reduce serotonin levels.<br class=""nLine"" />Changes in serotonin levels can alter mood: increases have a calming effect, relieving depression, insomnia, and irritability; decreases are associated with wakefulness and greater sensitivity to pain. There is also a link between high serotonin levels and the early onset of fatigue: elevated levels induce lethargy and reduce the desire to exercise. Attempts have been made by some sports scientists to see if reducing serotonin levels can improve physical performance, but the results so far are inconclusive.

"set point theory","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>set point theory</b><div class=""content"">A theory suggesting that body weight is kept relatively constant by internal control mechanisms similar to those of a thermostat. According to the theory, each adult has a range of body weights that act as a norm or set point; changes in body weight trigger mechanisms to bring the weight back to this set point.<br class=""nLine"" />Some researchers believe that the set point is psychological. An individual establishes a perceived set point weight based on personal and cultural preferences. These preferences may be influenced by the person's appearance, body weight measurements, clothing size, health, and so on. Deviations of weight result in changes of physical activity and eating habits that return the weight back to the set point. Other researchers believe that the set point is physiological, but there are a number of different mechanisms proposed. One proposal is that the set point depends on the activity of the hypothalamus, a hormone-secreting gland at the base of the brain; another proposal is that a hormone is secreted by adipose tissue. In either case, it is suggested that deviations of weight result in a physiological corrective mechanism (e.g. change in basal metabolic rate) being switched on. Although dieting does not appear to affect the set point, exercise may lower it, making it easier to lose weight.

"set system","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>set system</b><div class=""content"">A system of weight-training in which the trainee performs an exercise for a given number of repetitions (the set), rests, and then does another set. Popular variations of the set system include supersets and the super multiple set system.<br class=""nLine"" />In supersets, one particular muscle group is exercised for a given number of repetitions, followed immediately by a set of exercises which use the antagonist (opposite) muscle group. For example, one superset may consist of a set of arm curls to exercise the flexor muscles (especially the biceps), followed by a set of arm extensions to exercise the extensor muscles (especially the triceps).<br class=""nLine"" />In super multiple set systems, the exerciser completes all the sets for a given muscle group before doing the same number of sets using the antagonist muscle group."
"sex and exercise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sex and exercise</b><div class=""content"">Heart rates of 180 beats per minute have been recorded during sexual intercourse. This compares with values of between 180 and 220 for athletes in top class condition during competition. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that many couples who engage in a regular programme of aerobic exercise report an increase in both the frequency and quality of their lovemaking. However, it should be noted that those with partners who overtrain complain that so much energy can be expended in the gym, or on the track or the playing field, that there is little energy left for anything else. Many sports coaches and managers ban their charges from having sexual intercourse immediately before competition on the assumption that it saps the strength. In answer to this, one leading sports doctor has written that ‘…from a scientific point of view it is probably fair to say that sex will interfere with sports performance only if both are attempted simultaneously’ and an American baseball coach stated: ‘It's not the sex but the staying up all night looking for it, that fatigues athletes.’"

"shin splints","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>shin splints</b><div class=""content"">A term used loosely to describe an overuse injury characterized by a dull aching pain brought on by exercise. The pain is felt on either the inside or outside of the shin bone (tibia). Shin splints are commonly caused by repetitive loading of the front of the lower leg. This often results from overtraining (particularly at the start of a season's training), running on hard surfaces in poor shoes, or poor running technique.<br class=""nLine"" />The term ‘shin splints’ is applied to several conditions in which either soft tissues or bones are damaged. These conditions include stress fractures of the tibia or fibula, inflammation of the tendons on the outer side of the ankle (peroneal tendinitis), increased pressure within muscle compartments (see <a href=""entry://anterior compartment syndrome""><span class=""links"">anterior compartment syndrome</span></a>), or inflammation of the membrane covering the tibia (medial tibial stress syndrome). Some physicians apply the term only to medial tibial stress syndrome. In all cases of shin splints, the irritation and pain spreads, and continues throughout activity. The symptoms stop only when activity ceases but the leg usually remains tender to the touch.<br class=""nLine"" />Treatment depends on the cause, but usually includes quite a long period of rest, indirect application of ice, anti-inflammatory medication, and special stretching exercises. To avoid shin splints:<blockquote>•&nbsp;wear training shoes that provide adequate protection<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;seek coaching advice to ensure that your running technique is correct<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;keep training intensities within tolerable limits<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;stop training and seek advice if your shins become sore.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>See also <a href=""entry://periosteum""><span class=""links"">periosteum</span></a>."

"shock","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>shock</b><div class=""content"">A general term for a life-threatening state associated with circulatory collapse. It is brought about by a drop in blood pressure to a level too low to maintain an adequate blood supply to tissues. Someone in shock has cold moist skin, a weak rapid pulse, irregular breathing, dilated pupils, and is distressed, thirsty, and restless. Shock may be induced by many causes. Some, such as dehydration, bleeding and severe injury, may be incurred during exercise; others, such as allergic reactions, may be diet related (see <a href=""entry://anaphylactic shock""><span class=""links"">anaphylactic shock</span></a>)."
"shock exercises","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>shock exercises</b><div class=""content"">Specialized form of exercise that involves jumping from an object several feet above the ground. Immediately on landing, the jumper rebounds upwards. The idea behind shock jumping is to stimulate the stretch-shortening cycle in muscles and to improve power output from the legs. When jumpers land, their muscles are stretched before contracting for the rebound. The combined action of stretching and shortening exerts greater power than can be exerted by shortening alone. The enhanced power output is thought to be due to the elastic behaviour of muscles and tendons immediately after they have been stretched.

"short leg","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>short leg</b><div class=""content"">Condition in which one leg is either functionally or anatomically shorter than other. In anatomical short leg, the actual lengths of the legs are different. In functional short leg, the legs are the same length, but because of some defect in gait (e.g. overpronation), one leg acts as if it is shorter than the other.

"sickle cell disease","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sickle cell disease</b><div class=""content"">An hereditary blood disease characterized by abnormal red blood cells. In the full version, sickle cell anaemia, a large percentage of blood cells are sickle-shaped and unable to carry oxygen efficiently. They are removed from circulation, causing anaemia. In the mild version, sickle cell trait, a smaller percentage of blood is abnormal. The disease is endemic in Africa where the trait confers some resistance to malaria. Black people of African origin are more likely to have the disease than whites: about 8 per cent of black Americans have the trait, but less than 0.01 per cent of whites. The trait sometimes produces mild anaemia, particularly when oxygen partial pressures are low (e.g. at altitude), but it usually causes no adverse symptoms. Those with the trait can lead a normal life and participate in sport, even at the highest level. However, extreme conditions (such as maximal exercise in hot weather or at altitude before full acclimatization) can precipitate a life-threatening syndrome called fulminant exertional rhabdomyolysis. Blood cells in limbs become sickle-shaped, leading to kidney failure, collapse, and even death. Dr E. Randy Eichner, Professor of Medicine at the University of Oklahoma and a specialist in anaemia, stated that ‘To avoid this syndrome, all athletes &ndash; with or without sickle cell trait &ndash; should train wisely, stay hydrated, rest when sick, heed environmental stress and early symptoms, and never charge recklessly into heroic exercise.’ (In Mellion, M.B.

<b>skeletal muscle</b><div class=""content"">Muscle attached to bone and, in some areas, skin. Contraction of the muscle moves parts of the skeleton. Skeletal muscle is sometimes called voluntary muscle because its actions are usually under conscious control. It is also called striated muscle because it contains fibres that appear under the microscope to have alternating dark and light bands. The muscle fibres may be of two main types: fast twitch fibres, adapted to produce quick, powerful movements; and slow twitch fibres, adapted to slower, endurance type movements.

"skier's thumb","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>skier's thumb</b><div class=""content"">A rupture of a major ligament in the thumb, adjacent to the web between the thumb and forefinger. Skier's thumb often occurs when a skier falls on an outstretched arm, and the ski-pole forces the thumb upwards and outwards. It is also common among over-aggressive ice hockey players when they throw off their gloves and attempt a thumb hold on an opponent's jersey. The opponent, trying to jerk free, damages the ligament. The injury is sometimes called gamekeeper's thumb, presumably because of the frequency with which gamekeepers buttonhole poachers who, understandably, are in a hurry to get away."
"skiing","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>skiing</b><div class=""content"">Skiing can be divided into cross-country skiing and alpine skiing. Cross-country skiing (or Nordic skiing) is a low-impact, aerobic activity that conditions the whole body. It is becoming increasingly popular. There are believed to be over 7 million enthusiasts participating in this sport in the United States. Although it is one of the most physically demanding activities (a cross-country skier has the highest recorded aerobic capacity at 80 ml/kg/min), it can be enjoyed even if you have a relatively low skill level. It does not require exorbitant lift fees, and it has a relatively low injury rate (cross-country skiing has an injury rate about 10 times less than alpine skiing). Unlike alpine or downhill skiers who use gravity, cross-country skiers propel themselves about 80&ndash;90 per cent of the time, and use muscles in the arms, legs, and trunk in about equal measure. This muscle activity demands a great deal of energy. It has been estimated that cross-country skiing continuously for 150 minutes burns up more than 3000 Calories.<br class=""nLine"" />Skiing uses more muscles than running and is less stressful on the legs. During the propulsive phase, skiing produces impact forces of about 1.5 times body weight; running produces forces of up to 3.5 times body weight during the driving phase. This reduces the incidence of overuse injuries common in running. Thanks to a number of manufacturers, you can now obtain the exercise benefits of cross-country skiing without leaving the convenience of your own home. Several home-fitness exercise machines are designed to simulate the demands of cross-country skiing.<br class=""nLine"" />Alpine or downhill skiing is a popular family sport shared by people of all ages and athletic abilities. It has less benefits for aerobic fitness than cross-country skiing because activity is usually in short bursts, but it is good for strengthening muscles particularly those in the upper leg. Alpine skiing is also a tough sport, particularly demanding on the legs. Recreational skiers often succumb to injuries of knee ligaments and ankle tendons because of lack of fitness or poor technique. Many of these injuries could be avoided if people conditioned themselves before embarking on a skiing holiday. Weight-training exercises to strengthen the muscles in the thighs and around the knees, and stretching exercises to improve overall joint mobility, reduce the risk of injury after an awkward fall. Simple activities, such as climbing stairs, brisk walking, jogging, and gentle running, help to develop overall stamina so that you can enjoy a day out on the piste. It is also important to warm-up immediately prior to skiing."
"skill","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>skill</b><div class=""content"">In sport, a special ability acquired through training. Skill acquisition involves learning to execute movements with the minimum effort to achieve predetermined effects. It is a complex process demanding high levels of sensory perception, integration within the central nervous system, and coordination of different muscle groups. There are many different kinds of skill. They form a continuum from fine motor skills, requiring delicate muscular control (used in activities such as putting and rifle shooting), to gross motor skills, requiring coordination of many muscle groups (used in activities such as running). Some are open skills, performed in an unpredictable situation (such as a football match), with outside factors dictating how and when the skill is performed. Others are closed skills, involving movements which can be planned in advance and usually performed in a stable, mainly predictable situation; examples include performing a handstand, serving in tennis, teeing off at golf, and diving from a platform."
"skin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>skin</b><div class=""content"">The first line of defence against disease and physical damage, the skin is a complex organ containing different types of tissue.<br class=""nLine"" />The surface layer consists of dead, keratin-containing cells which swell in response to moisture and are shed daily. Given time, this layer thickens and hardens in response to friction. If friction is excessive, burns, blisters, and corns can develop. One aim of training is to harden the skin gradually so that it can withstand the forces experienced during activity. This is particularly important in martial arts which use parts of the body to inflict blows.<br class=""nLine"" />Beneath the outer layer, lie the living cells of the epidermis, protecting the body from injury and invasion from parasites. This layer also helps to prevent dehydration. Epidermal cells are continually dividing to replace dead cells lost from the surface. Since these cells have such a short lifespan, signs of nutritional deficiency develop quickly and skin condition is a good reflection of inner health. Clear, moist, glowing skin usually indicates that a person is healthy and well nourished.<br class=""nLine"" />The middle layer of the skin, the dermis or corium, contains cells with a black pigment, melanin. Melanin shields the underlying layers from the potentially damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation. Also in the dermis, sensory receptors and nerves inform the body of changes in body temperature. They enable a person to respond, sometimes defensively, to pressure, touch, and pain. The dermis is well supplied with blood vessel and sweat glands. These, combined with the action of erectile hairs, form part of the temperature-regulating system in the body. Sebaceous glands associated with the hair secrete oils which keep the skin moist and contribute to waterproofing. The dermis is the region in which wrinkles originate.<br class=""nLine"" />The deepest layer in the skin is the subcutaneous layer containing the stores of fat which many people spend much effort and time trying to reduce.<br class=""nLine"" />A well-balanced diet with plenty of fluid intake, regular aerobic exercise, and moderate exposure to sunlight can help to maintain a healthy skin. Nutrient deficiencies may cause dryness, roughness, wrinkling, and slow healing of wounds. Particularly important dietary components are the essential fatty acids and vitamins, particularly A, C, E, niacin, and riboflavin, but in developed countries deficiencies of these nutrients are very rare.

Usually the measurements are taken with special calipers by holding a fold of tissue with the left thumb and index finger at specific sites on the body (figure 62). Such measurements (for instance on the back of the arm, below the scapula, and on the calf) are used to estimate the amount of fat in the body. They may also be used to monitor fat losses.

"sleep","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sleep</b><div class=""content"">We spend about one-third of our lives sleeping, but exactly why we need sleep is the subject of much dispute. Traditional views emphasize sleep's restorative value; another view emphasizes the advantages of a period of immobility, for example, in conserving energy. Lack of sleep is associated with lower reaction times, reduced muscular coordination, and poor vigilance. It can also produce distinct alterations in personality.<br class=""nLine"" />Although the average person sleeps between 7&ndash;8 hours a night, there is no single standard number of hours of sleep that can be applied to everyone. Each person has to determine his or her own optimum. Exercise often restores normal sleep patterns to people who suffer sleeping disorders, and those who exercise vigorously generally need more sleep than sedentary people.

<b>slide training</b><div class=""content"">A low-impact, aerobic exercise that strengthens the hips, knees, and ankles. Slide training is performed on a smooth plastic board with bumpers at either end to allow the exerciser to push off and slide. By swinging the arms and pushing with the legs, the exerciser can create a variety of sliding movements similar to those produced by a speed skater. A cloth over each training shoe makes sliding easier. It is a good exercise for promoting cardiovascular fitness, especially when incorporated into circuit training. Some running coaches have advocated slide training because it is especially effective at working the buttock muscles that help to stabilize the body during running, so it improves running economy. Slide training should be avoided by those suffering groin strain, lower back, or knee problems."
"slimming patch","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>slimming patch</b><div class=""content"">A 3 cm-square patch which is claimed by its US manufacturers to make weight loss easy. The patch is worn on hairless skin all day, but removed at night. According to the manufacturers, it contains extracts of a brown seaweed containing iodine which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Iodine is used by the body in the thyroid gland to make thyroxine, a hormone which increases metabolism. The manufacturers of the patch suggest that the absorption of additional iodine from the patch enables the production of extra thyroxine to burn off excess fat. Users are told that the patch will enable them to lose weight without any change in their lifestyle, but they are advised to drink at least eight glasses of water a day and follow a reasonably balanced diet. Loss of weight may be due to following this advice rather than to changes in metabolic rate. Some manufacturers have claimed that wearing the patches results in significant weight loss, particularly in those who are significantly overweight. These claims could not be substantiated to the satisfaction of the Food and Drug Administration and the patches were withdrawn from the US market in 1988, but they are still available in other countries. Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition at King's College, London, UK, is quoted in <i>The Times</i> newspaper (14 June 1994) as saying: ‘The only way to lose weight with one is to stick it over your mouth.’"

"smoking","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>smoking</b><div class=""content"">Many smokers claim that their habit helps them to relax, but there is no doubt that smoking is harmful to health and has a detrimental effect on athletic performance. Tobacco smoking is a major, preventable factor leading to death. Almost 20 per cent of deaths in the USA have been attributed to diseases associated with inhaling the products of combustion from the tobacco plant, <i>Nicotiana tobacum</i>. These products include nicotine, carbon monoxide, and tars.<br class=""nLine"" />The psychological and addictive effects of smoking cigarettes are attributed to nicotine, a drug that stimulates the central nervous system and enhances arousal. Nicotine affects blood pressure and heart rate directly, increasing the risk to smokers of coronary heart disease. It also affects hormone production. For example, cigarette smoking lowers blood oestrogen levels and therefore reduces bone mineralization. When inhaled, the carbon monoxide passes into the bloodstream where it combines with haemoglobin, reducing the ability of blood to transport oxygen. Among heavy, chronic smokers the reduction may be as much as 10 per cent, reducing their ability to take part in strenuous exercise, and accounting for the breathlessness experienced by most smokers. Tars inhaled during smoking are microscopic, organic substances which can stick onto cells in the lungs. Some tars release free radicals that may be carcinogenic and increase the risk of lung cancer. The high production of free radicals in smokers may explain why they break down vitamin C faster than non-smokers (vitamin C is one of the antioxidants that mops up free radicals). It is estimated that the vitamin C requirements of smokers may be twice as much as non-smokers. In the UK, the RNI for adult non-smokers is 40 mg but smokers require more vitamin C (possibly as much as an extra 80 mg); in the USA, the RDAs are 60 mg for non-smokers and 100 mg for smokers.<br class=""nLine"" />Smoking is highly addictive. Smokers who try to give up may suffer withdrawal symptoms including a persistent craving for tobacco, irritability, poor concentration, and weight gain. The weight gain is popularly attributed to eating more to compensate for the lack of oral gratification provided by smoking. However, the gain may also be due to metabolic changes because nicotine increases metabolic rate, particularly during exercise. It is sensible for ex-smokers to moderate the effects of weight gain by increasing their aerobic activity. They should also control their feeding habits carefully. For example, snacks should consist of nutritious, low calorie foods such as raw vegetables and fruit."

<b>snack</b><div class=""content"">A light, quick meal eaten between, or instead of, a main meal. Snacks have a bad reputation, but the wise use of nutritious snacks can improve the health and vitality of physically active people who lead a hectic lifestyle. Wholesome snacks that may boost energy, take the edge off appetite, and provide useful nutrients include dry cereal, fruits, nuts, seeds, and some vegetables which can be eaten raw, such as carrots. Not snacking can be detrimental since there is a danger of getting too hungry, developing a craving for sweet foods, and overeating at the earliest opportunity. However, the above comments should not be taken as a licence to over-indulge: it goes without saying that the consumption of large numbers of doughnuts (referred to by one nutritionist as ‘grease bombs’) and chocolate biscuits is not conducive to good health."

"soccer","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>soccer</b><div class=""content"">Soccer is played worldwide by young and old, male and female, amateur and professional. The game makes many and varied physical demands on players. Top-class soccer players require very high levels of fitness. During a 90-minute match, their average work rate is about 70 per cent maximum and they burn an extra 1000&ndash;1500 Calories. They may cover more than 10 kilometres and have to sprint and jump many times with little chance to recover between bursts of maximum effort. So, in addition to their ball skills, they need to develop sprinting speed, endurance, muscular strength, and muscular power. Training usually involves a mixture of running, weight training, and circuit training, as well as ball work (passing, shooting, ball control, and heading). Flexibility is one aspect of fitness which is often neglected, especially by recreational players. Repeated sprinting, jumping, and kicking tends to tighten muscles in the lower back and legs. Without appropriate flexibility training players are likely to strain or pull muscles and tendons. The most common sites of injury are the calf muscles, Achilles tendons, and hamstrings. Before a match, each player should warm-up by jogging for 5&ndash;10 minutes. This should be followed by some flexibility and mobility exercises (especially for the hamstrings and the adductor muscles in the groin), three or four sprints over distances of about 25 metres, and then specific ball skills, such as dribbling and passing."

Sodium plays a major role in water balance.<br class=""nLine"" />Sodium is one of the major components of table salt. An investigation, called the Intersalt Study, of 10 000 people from 32 countries, found that there was a very strong correlation between a high sodium consumption and high blood pressure, especially in sodium-sensitive people. The results can be interpreted in a number of ways, but most dietitians agree that high sodium intakes can be harmful. Sodium can also increase the risk of oedema (swelling, particularly in joints, caused by an accumulation of fluids). The current average sodium intake of adults in the UK is 3.2 g per day. The government recommends that this should be decreased to 1.6 g. One simple way of reducing sodium intake is not to add table salt to food.<br class=""nLine"" />Sodium deficiency is rare, but it can occur if losses from heavy sweating are not replaced.

<b>sodium bicarbonate</b><div class=""content"">A salt of sodium that neutralizes acids. Sodium bicarbonate is taken to treat stomach disorders, acidosis, and sodium deficiency. It is used as a raising agent in food (baking powder).<br class=""nLine"" />Sodium bicarbonate is also used in tablet form as an ergogenic aid in a process called bicarbonate loading. The extra bicarbonate is taken to increase the blood's alkalinity and buffering capacity so that more lactic acid can be neutralized. This would delay the onset of fatigue. There are conflicting views about its effectiveness, but ingesting at least 300 mg of bicarbonate per kilogram body weight 2&ndash;3 hours before exercise may delay fatigue and increase performance in bouts of maximal effort activity lasting more than 1 minute and less than 7 minutes. Bicarbonate loading has improved the performance of average 800 metre runners by several seconds, but it may not have such a marked effect on well-trained, elite athletes. In addition, bicarbonate loading causes unpleasant side-effects in some people, the most common being gastrointestinal distress (e.g. cramping, bloating, and diarrhoea). Improvements in performance can be achieved with less risk by appropriate training. In general, bicarbonate loading should not be given serious consideration by athletes."

<b>somatotype</b>
<i>(body-type)</i><div class=""content"">An individual's characteristic shape and physical appearance, irrespective of size. There are three main somatotypes:<blockquote>•&nbsp;ENDOMORPH: Characterized by a rounded body shape<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;MESOMORPH: Characterized by muscular and stocky physique of medium height<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;ECTOMORPH: Characterized by a tall, thin body.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>Individuals usually have elements of each type, and their composite somatotype is described in a three-figure rating system. In one system (the Heath-Carter somatotype system) the ratings are based on a number of factors, such as skinfold measurements, age, height, and weight; in another system (Sheldon somatotype classification), the ratings are based on photographs of an individual taken from three different perspectives. In both systems, each rating is from 1 to 7; 1 represents the least amount and 7 the maximum. The first figure represents the degree of endomorphy; the second, mesomorphy; and the third, ectomorphy. Thus, a somatotype of 1&ndash;6&ndash;2 would indicate no endomorphy, a high degree of mesomorphy, and a little ectomorphy.<br class=""nLine"" />Certain somatotypes tend to be associated with particular sports. It is not really surprising that distance runners tend towards ectomorphy and wrestlers tend towards mesomorphy. However, although somatotype may contribute to success in specific activities, it is by no means essential. Not all successful distance runners, for example, conform to their expected somatotype. A disadvantageous body shape can be overcome by emphasis on other factors such as skill and dedication.<br class=""nLine"" />Sheldon claimed that there is a strong link between somatotype and personality (Sheldon's constitutional theory). He believed that somatotype is inborn, and that it predetermines an individual's character. He suggested that endomorphs tended to be ‘viscerotonic’ (easy-going, sociable people who take pleasure in eating); mesomorphs tend to be ‘somatotonic’ (bold and competitive individuals who are risk-taking, adventure-seeking extroverts); and ectomorphs tend to be ‘cerebrotonic’ (solitary and hyperactive with over-fast reaction times).<br class=""nLine"" />Controversy surrounds Sheldon's work. Today, most scientists give little credence to these claims, but Sheldon's constitutional theory was part of mainstream thought in the 1940s and early 1950s. His somatotyping was based on an enormous collection of nude photographs. Thousands of men and women entering certain Ivy League universities were required to pose for photographs sometimes, apparently, against their will. It has been suggested that Sheldon's main purpose was eugenic; that he wanted to establish a planned breeding programme, encouraging individuals with superior physiques to reproduce, while discouraging those with inferior physiques."

"spleen","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>spleen</b><div class=""content"">The most commonly injured organ within the abdomen. The spleen lies just below the 9th and 11th ribs, making it very susceptible to puncture by a fractured rib or a direct blow to the trunk. It can even be ruptured during a non-contact sport as a result of very strenuous activity, especially if it has become enlarged by a viral infection (in athletes, nearly 40 per cent of splenic ruptures are associated with glandular fever caused by a viral infection called infectious mononucleosis). This is one of several important reasons for resting during a fever.<br class=""nLine"" />The spleen has a number of functions, including removing worn out red blood cells and dealing with some types of foreign body. In order to carry out these functions, it is very well supplied with blood, making it quite soft and fragile. A rupture often results in torrential internal bleeding which is difficult to stop. If untreated, this can lead to a serious lowering of blood pressure and death. Sometimes bed rest is sufficient treatment, but often surgical removal is the only viable course of action. Abdominal injuries are often underestimated in sports, especially when young people with enormous reserves of enthusiasm are involved. Consequently, a ruptured spleen may go unnoticed and untreated until the injured person loses so much blood he or she suffers from potentially fatal shock. Abdominal injuries are very difficult to diagnose, but expert medical assistance should always be sought if a person is suffering from persistent abdominal discomfort after a blow or after extreme exertion."

<b>spondylolysis</b><div class=""content"">A defect in the spine that causes acute pain on one side of the lower back. The pain is made worse by twisting and bending movements. Spondylolysis was once thought to be congenital. However, although some people are genetically predisposed to the condition, it is now believed to be a stress fracture of a vertebra (one of the bones that form the spinal column) caused by repeated hyperextensions of the lower back (i.e. bending backwards, a movement commonly performed during weight-training exercises). There is a high incidence of spondylolysis in young female gymnasts who perform front and back walk-overs, vaults, flings, and dismounts. Spondylolysis is often linked with another back injury, spondylolisthesis: the slippage of one vertebra on another (usually the fifth lumbar vertebra on the first sacral vertebra). Spondylisthesis reduces flexibility and usually results in tightening of the hamstrings. Physiotherapy, including abdominal strengthening exercises and hamstring stretches, is often sufficient for mild conditions. Surgical treatment may be necessary if, for example, there is more than 50 per cent vertebral slippage."

Participation usually demands a high level of commitment and takes the form of a struggle either with oneself or through competition with others, but it also has some of the elements of play.

"Sport Emotional Reaction Profile","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Sport Emotional Reaction Profile</b> (SERP)<div class=""content"">A number of psychological tools have been devised to measure traits that may be important in determining athletic performance. One of these tools is called SERP (sport emotional reaction profile). It was devised by Thomas Tutko and Umberto Tosi who regarded the following traits as important:<blockquote>•&nbsp;DESIRE. An indication of the ability to set realistic goals: low levels of desire suggest lack of motivation; levels which are too high indicate that unrealistic goals are being set<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;ASSERTIVENESS. A measure of an individual's determination to succeed. Low assertiveness suggests that an athlete will be intimidated by others; high levels indicate a tendency towards aggressiveness<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;SENSITIVITY. An indication of the amount of pleasure gained from success. A person with high sensitivity may be easily discouraged by lack of success. Low levels suggest resilience<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;TENSION CONTROL. The ability to cope with anxiety. Low tension control generally results in poor performance; high tension control is rarely a problem<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;CONFIDENCE. Belief in one's own ability. Both low confidence and overconfidence can be a problem and usually result in poor performance<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY. Ability to cope with failures and mistakes. A person with low personal accountability generally blames others for a lack of success; those with very high levels may blame themselves too much if they make even a small mistake<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;SELF-DISCIPLINE. The ability to persevere. Those with low levels of self-discipline give up easily and are generally not persistent trainers.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>Each trait is scored on a scale from 5 to 30. To determine the scores, athletes are given 42 statements, such as ‘I have nerves of steel during competition’, to which they may respond, ‘almost always’ (about 90 per cent of the time); ‘often’ (about 75 per cent of the time); ‘sometimes’ (about 50 per cent of the time); seldom (about 25 per cent of the time); and ‘almost never’ (about 10 per cent of the time).<br class=""nLine"" />SERP is not readily applicable to non-athletes and some sports psychologists doubt its reliability as a research tool. However, it may be useful for self-assessment if the questions are answered honestly. Individual athletes can compare their SERP with a ‘normal’ profile so that problem areas can be revealed and corrected by psychological training techniques. See also Profile Of Moods States."

It may surprise readers to see the low incidence of injury associated with martial arts, but the table shows the number, not the seriousness. Sports injuries tend to be more severe in contact sports.<br class=""nLine"" />Professor Greg McLatchie Director of the National Sports Medicine Institute at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK, conducted a survey of the sites of sports injuries in 1600 patients:<center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""<tr><td>SITE</td><td>PERCENTAGE OF INJURIES</td></tr><tr><td>lower legs</td><td>32.6</td></tr><tr><td>upper limbs</td><td>30.7</td></tr><tr><td>head</td><td>17.7</td></tr><tr><td>knees</td><td>10.4</td></tr><tr><td>trunk</td><td>6.4</td></tr><tr><td>upper leg</td><td>2.2</td></tr></table></center>Sports-related injuries are caused by three main groups of factors:<blockquote>1&nbsp;direct trauma (i.e. physical contact)<br class=""nLine"" />2&nbsp;overuse (see separate entries)<br class=""nLine"" />3&nbsp;environmental factors (those associated with extremes of weather, immersion in water, altitude etc.).<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>The risk of injury in seemingly innocuous activities such as aerobic dance and jogging, depends very much on environment. These activities subject the body to high impact forces as the foot strikes the ground. Therefore, the type of surface and the degree of protection offered by footwear are important. In addition, high impact sports tend to produce more overuse injuries than low impact sports such as swimming.<br class=""nLine"" />Sports injuries are more likely when there is a combination of factors in operation: for example, a rugby player is more likely to incur a knee injury when floored by a lateral tackle if it is a cold day, the pitch is frost-hardened, and the player's knee has already been weakened by overtraining or overplaying.<br class=""nLine"" />Many sports injuries are unnecessary and can be avoided by:<blockquote>•&nbsp;ensuring that you are fit for your activity<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;wearing the correct equipment<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;being aware of environmental hazards such as slippery surfaces<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;always warming-up and cooling down<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;allowing your body enough time to adapt to higher levels of activity.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>Most sports injuries involve strains, tears, and ruptures of muscle fibres, and are not life-threatening. Your chances of a speedy and complete recovery from these injuries improve if you receive quick, correct treatment. Most muscle injuries, such as bruises and strains, respond well to rest, ice, compression, and elevation (see <a href=""entry://RICE""><span class=""links"">RICE</span></a>). Heat should never be applied to an injured muscle in the first 48 hours of injury.<br class=""nLine"" />A variety of unpleasant and even fatal conditions, including multiple sclerosis, osteomyelitis (bone inflammation), and bone cancer may first appear as an apparent sports injury. For this reason, if for no other, sports injuries should be taken seriously and medical advice should be sought if symptoms persist."

It is becoming an increasingly important branch of medicine. More general practitioners are being trained in sports medicine than ever before.

"spot theory of fat reduction","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>spot theory of fat reduction</b>
<i>(spot-reducing)</i><div class=""content"">The idea that specific exercises or diets can reduce the amount of fat in a particular area of the body without affecting the amount in other parts. For example, many people intuitively believe that if they have too much fat around the waist, abdominal exercises will reduce the fatty tissue in that area.<br class=""nLine"" />Several writers have capitalized on this idea and have promoted spot-reducing diets. One of the most famous is The Hip and Thigh Diet devised by Rosemary Conley. She claims that her very low fat diet (no food with more than 12 per cent fat) and exercise programme can help you lose weight preferentially from the hips and thighs. Although her programme is one of the most commercially successful ever devised (her book has sold more than 2 million copies worldwide), experts do not believe that this or any other diet and exercise programme can help you shed fat from some parts of your body but not others. The idea was disproved several years ago when researchers studied tennis players who played more than 6 hours a week. They expected the arm used to hold the racquet to be more muscular and less fatty than the other arm. Although the racquet-holding arm was more muscular, the amount of fat was the same in both arms.<br class=""nLine"" />Other studies confirm that it is not possible to manipulate diet or use exercise to lose fat from specific parts of the body. Fat is lost through the creation of an energy deficit which results in some fat being withdrawn from all the fat stores."

The severity is graded by degree: with a first degree sprain, there is little damage; with a second degree sprain, partial tearing of the ligament occurs; and with a third degree sprain, there is complete disruption of the ligament.<br class=""nLine"" />The primary treatment for a sprain is rest, indirect application of ice, compression with a bandage, and elevation of the damaged joint (see <a href=""entry://RICE""><span class=""links"">RICE</span></a>). Secondary treatment may include administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen), physical therapy (e.g. ultrasound or heat treatment), and stretching exercises specific for each type of sprain. Sometimes supportive braces or other devices are useful and, in extreme cases (such as a third degree sprain of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee) surgery may be necessary. Individuals with excessive flexibility are more prone to sprains because the connective tissue surrounding the joint has been stretched and does not contribute so effectively to joint stability. Exercise addicts are also susceptible because they tend to overtrain. They are also reluctant to stop training when injured and do not give the sprain a chance to heal. It is unwise to continue training with a sprain, even with taping or bandaging, because there is a high risk of the sprain growing worse and becoming more resistant to treatment."
"spreads","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>spreads</b><div class=""content"">A general term for butter, soft margarines, and low fat spreads which may not be called margarine (the composition of which is legally defined). Margarines were first developed as a cheap alternative to butter. They were made mainly from hydrogenated plant oils. The addition of hydrogen transforms the oils into solid, saturated fats. They were cheap but difficult to spread after refrigeration and not very tasty. Responding to the demand for a more spreadable and tasty margarine, manufacturers produced soft margarines with a higher content of poly-unsaturated fats. These spreads have gained in popularity as people have learned that unsaturated fats are healthier that saturated ones. Some spreads have been developed with the additional advantage to weight-conscious consumers of being low in calories. This is achieved by increasing the water content of the spread or by using fat replacers. Care should be taken when buying spreads because some low calorie varieties have a relatively high percentage of saturated fats."
"sprint","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sprint</b><div class=""content"">A movement over a short distance at top speed in one continuous effort. The best training for sprinting is to run, cycle, swim, or canoe repetitively as fast as possible over short distances. This helps to develop fast-twitch muscle fibres (see <a href=""entry://muscle fibre types""><span class=""links"">muscle fibre types</span></a>) and the enzymes which enable them to contract quickly. However, the training has to be specific. The muscles used for sprint swimming, cycling, or canoeing are not exactly the same as those used for running. Therefore, someone good at sprint cycling may not be any good at sprint running. Although the muscles used differ, all forms of sprinting demand high power outputs. To create quick movements, muscles have to react quickly to instructions from the central nervous system, utilize energy quickly, and go through the mechanics of contraction quickly. Reaction times are sometimes improved by using speed balls (punch balls similar to those used by boxers). The utilization of energy and the mechanics of contraction are often improved by bounding exercises (see <a href=""entry://plyometrics""><span class=""links"">plyometrics</span></a>), and weight- and flexibility-training specifically designed to improve muscles used in particular forms of sprinting."

"squash","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>squash</b><div class=""content"">Squash is a game that requires agility, coordination, and good aerobic fitness. It is generally regarded as one of the most physically demanding sports. Noel Coward said it is ‘not exercise &ndash; it's flagellation’. A squash game may consist of long rallies and short recovery periods. A match between top-class players can last 90 minutes or more. Repeated bursts of activity within the confined space of a squash court can raise body temperature and elevate the heart rate to dangerously high levels. This can overload the heart of an unfit person. The Squash Rackets Association use the adage ‘Get fit to play squash. Don't play squash to get fit’, to encourage sensible participation. Most physicians discourage anyone over the age of 50 from taking up squash. The need for caution is emphasized by the table of exercise-related sudden deaths.<br class=""nLine"" />Although squash is at the top of the table, Robin Northcote emphasized that there is a very low statistical risk of sudden death from any sport and that the figures do not imply that squash is more dangerous than other sports. Nevertheless, his table does show that a significant number of squash players have probably died unnecessarily.<center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""Squash<tr><td>EXERCISE-RELATED SUDDEN DEATH IN THE MAINLAND UNITED KINGDOM 1978&ndash;87</td></tr><tr><td>SPORT/ACTIVITY</td><td>NUMBER MALE</td><td>FEMALE</td><td>MEAN AGE</td></tr><tr><td>squash</td><td>124</td><td>2</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>soccer</td><td>53</td><td>-</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>swimming</td><td>50</td><td>6</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>running</td><td>38</td><td>1</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>badminton</td><td>26</td><td>-</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>rugby</td><td>14</td><td>-</td><td>30</td></tr></table></center>Table adapted from Northcote, R.J.

Even fit squash players are susceptible to pulls, strains, and tears of muscles and tendons, particularly in the lower leg. An adequate warm-up which includes mobility and stretching will reduce the risk of injury. This is particularly important for those over 25 because as you age your muscles and tendons gradually become less elastic. To minimize stress injuries when feet are jarred and dragged on a hard squash court, it is essential to wear shoes that have adequate cushioning in the heels and instep, and adequate reinforcement around the toes. To decrease the risk of eye injury (a squash ball is just the right size to enter the eye socket), squash players should wear smash-resistant eye protectors."
"squat","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>squat</b><div class=""content"">An exercise for conditioning muscles of the legs and buttocks. It can be performed with or without additional weights.<br class=""nLine"" />❏<i> Stand erect with feet about shoulder width apart. Keeping your back straight and head up, slowly bend the knees to squat down, and then return to the standing position.</i>If the knees are bent fully, tremendous mechanical strains are imposed on the joint and can cause irreparable damage. Therefore, the knees are bent only to the half- to two-thirds position. The back is kept straight to reduce the strain on the knees and lower back, and movements should always be slow and controlled.<br class=""nLine"" />Squats with additional weights are usually performed with either the barbell resting at the back of the neck (back squat) or across the front of the shoulders and top of the chest (front squat). Both types of squat develop leg, hip, and back strength, but the front squat places more stress on the quadriceps.<br class=""nLine"" />There are at least eight other types of squat, each with their own specific advantages and disadvantages. Squats have been called the ‘king of all exercises’ by some body-builders. If performed properly, squats can greatly strengthen the muscles (especially the quadriceps), bones, tendons, and ligaments in the legs. However, if performed excessively or with poor technique, they can cause a host of stress injuries, including arthritis and torn cartilage of the knee."

"starch","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>starch</b><div class=""content"">A complex carbohydrate (polysaccharide) made of many glucose units. Uncooked starch is very difficult to digest, but heat opens out starch molecules so that they form a gel-like structure which is more accessible to digestive enzymes. During digestion, enzymes in the gut help to break down the starch into dextrins, and then glucose molecules which are absorbed into the blood. Starch takes much longer to digest than simple sugars, such as sucrose (table sugar). Consequently, starch provides a steady stream of glucose into the bloodstream and is less likely than sucrose to cause blood glucose swings which can provoke the secretion of excess insulin.<br class=""nLine"" />High quantities of starch are found in bananas which are still green at their tips (in brown bananas, most of the starch is converted to sugars), breads, corn, oats, pasta, potatoes, rice, and yams. Unrefined forms of these foods also contain other nutrients, especially vitamins, trace minerals, and fibre. They are a much better source of carbohydrates than manufactured, sweet products containing little other than sugar. For example, wholemeal pasta contains high levels of carbohydrate and significant amounts of dietary fibre, minerals, and B complex vitamins. This makes it a favourite pre-race food for many marathon runners: the carbohydrate helps to boost muscle glycogen stores, and the other components help to maintain the health and efficiency of the runner.

"starvation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>starvation</b><div class=""content"">Total abstinence from food. Starvation for more than one day depletes the body of its glycogen stores. Glycogen is the main source of glucose, an essential fuel for the brain. In order to maintain supplies, the body uses the protein in its own cells to make glucose, resulting in muscle wasting. If starvation continues for a few weeks, the brain adapts and can use the breakdown products of fat as a fuel. Once the fat stores are used, it again resorts to using protein. If this self-destructive process continues, heart muscle is broken down and death is inevitable.<br class=""nLine"" />Starvation is sometimes self-inflicted by people who want to lose weight rapidly. This is generally not recommended: it can disturb the body's metabolism and some doctors believe it may lead to eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. In addition, the muscle lost during starvation is not easily regained, leaving a person physically weaker, less active, and more susceptible to weight gain.

<b>steadiness</b><div class=""content"">The ability to maintain the body, or a part of the body, in a fixed position, or the ability to perform a smooth movement without any deviations from the desired course. Steadiness is adversely affected by muscle tremor and usually decreases as the strength of muscle contractions increase. It is an important component of skills requiring very controlled, steady movements (such as pistol marksmanship and snooker). The anxiety caused by competition sometimes results in the loss of steadiness, and a few marksmen and snooker players have resorted to taking drugs, such as beta-blockers, to reduce muscle tension."

"step aerobics","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>step aerobics</b><div class=""content"">This very popular form of aerobic exercise involves stepping on and off a step. The exact type and rate of movement varies, but simple step-up, step-down aerobics can be as beneficial to aerobic fitness as more intense movements, and less damaging to joints. Step aerobics is linked to more knee injuries than other forms of aerobics. Many of the injuries are due to poor technique and poor tuition in classes that are too large. Stepping rates are usually about 120 per minute and the step is 6&ndash;8 inches (about 15&ndash;20 cm) high. The higher the step and the higher the rate of stepping, the greater the risk of injury. Therefore, step aerobics should be tailored to individual requirements, and the routine should take into consideration the size and fitness levels of individuals. To minimize risk of injury, steps should be performed gently and carefully. Power stepping (high impact stepping that may involve the use of handweights) is gaining popularity as a more robust form of step aerobics. Although it has a greater effect on strength, it carries a higher risk of injury and does not improve aerobic fitness any more than traditional step aerobics."
"step test","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>step test</b><div class=""content"">A test of cardiovascular fitness involving a period of stepping on and off a bench or chair and comparing pulse rates before and after the exercise. The quicker the pulse returns to its normal resting rate, the fitter the individual. There are a number of variations. The Harvard step test was devised at Harvard University during the Second World War. In this test, you step on and off a 20 inch (50.8 cm) bench with alternate feet, repeating the sequence at a steady rhythm of 30 times a minute for up to 5 minutes or until exhausted. Your pulse is taken before the exercise and again 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 3 minutes after the exercise. Fitness levels are estimated from the rate at which the pulse returns to its resting level. Although cheap and easy to do, the step test is not very reliable as a medical test of cardiovascular fitness, and has been largely superseded by other exercise tests (see <a href=""entry://graded exercise test""><span class=""links"">graded exercise test</span></a>). However, its beneficial effects on the heart and vascular system have been recognized and incorporated into step aerobics, a very popular type of exercise usually performed to music."
"stepper","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stepper</b><div class=""content"">A training machine on which movements similar to running are performed. The exerciser pushes up and down against steps. Resistance is provided by air pressure, so impact forces are low, and there is little risk of stress injuries to bones and joints. Exercise on steppers is good training for active sports such as skiing because it strengthens the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles in the legs. Resistance is easily varied by changing the air pressure. It is usually set at a low level for developing aerobic fitness, but should be higher to develop muscle endurance. Many steppers are computerized so that stepping frequency, work levels, calories burnt, and duration of exercise can be controlled easily.

"strength","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>strength</b><div class=""content"">The ability to apply a force and overcome a resistance. Strength is an essential part of physical fitness. The term usually refers to maximum, absolute strength, which is the maximum force a person can exert in one effort regardless of body size or muscle size. A better comparison of people of different body size can be made using relative strength. This is the maximum force an individual can exert in relation to his or her body weight. Other types of strength include dynamic strength and elastic strength.<br class=""nLine"" />Dynamic strength is the ability to exert muscle force repeatedly. The muscle contractions involved are isotonic (the muscle shortens and the body or body parts move).<br class=""nLine"" />Elastic strength is the ability of muscles to exert forces quickly and to overcome resistance with high speed contractions. Elastic strength requires complex coordination of speed and strength of muscles. It is important in explosive activities such as jumping and sprinting. Sometimes elastic strength is used synonymously with power. It can be improved by special exercises, called plyometrics, which involve bounding movements. There are three main types of muscle contraction: eccentric, in which the muscle increases in length; isometric, in which the muscle maintains a constant length; and isotonic, in which the muscle shortens. A person who has a high level of strength for one type of muscle contraction is not necessarily strong with respect to the other types; training has to be specific."

"strength training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>strength training</b><div class=""content"">Exercises performed specifically to develop strength. Strength training can be achieved using a wide variety of exercises, including body resistance exercises, exercises with a medicine ball, circuit training, and plyometrics. However most strength training involves progressive resistant exercises using free weights or a weight-training machine. Usually the training programme is based on establishing the repetition maximum (the maximum load that can be lifted for a given number of repetitions) and ensuring that the muscles are systematically overloaded but not overstrained. The main factors which can be varied in strength training are the resistance (the weight being moved or the force resisted); the number of repetitions (the times each exercise or weight-training movement is repeated); the number of sets (each set being a given number of repetitions); and the rest period between the sets. Absolute strength is best gained by increasing the resistance and reducing the number of repetitions. The minimum resistance needed to gain strength is approximately 60 per cent of the maximum resistance that a muscle group can exert. Muscle endurance and elastic strength is best gained by decreasing the resistance, and increasing the number and speed of repetitions.<br class=""nLine"" />The following table shows that to develop absolute strength, you should perform high resistance exercises at a low number of repetitions; for endurance, you should perform low resistance exercises at high number of repetitions.<br class=""nLine"" />Strength training affects muscles, their nerve supply, and other associated structures. The beneficial effects of strength training include the following:<blockquote>•&nbsp;increase in muscle size and absolute strength<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;improved blood supply to the muscles and joints<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;toughening of connective tissue in the tendons and ligaments<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;increase in bone density and strength<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;reduction of the fat content of muscles.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>For maximum benefits, strength training should take place at least two or three times a week for 45 minutes each time. Strength training more than three times a week can be damaging and does not allow sufficient time for the muscles to respond to increased demands. It is believed that during a hard training session some of the muscle fibres are split and need time to regrow. It takes several weeks to gain all the benefits of a strength-training programme, the time depending on the person and the muscle groups being exercised.<br class=""nLine"" />A strength-training programme should take into account all the basic principles of training: it must be specific, progressive, and provide sufficient overload to stimulate muscle growth. There are a number of different schemes, but they all tend to follow a similar pattern of phases:<blockquote>•&nbsp;PREPARATION PHASE. General conditioning, including body-weight exercises and light resistance (see <a href=""entry://circuit training""><span class=""links"">circuit training</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;FOUNDATION PHASE. Continuation of whole-body conditioning, but with an increase in the resistances<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;STRENGTH TRANSFER PHASE. Introduction of specific exercises. These will depend on individual aims, but may include absolute strength-gain exercises for those who wish to be weight-lifters, and bounding exercises (see <a href=""entry://plyometrics""><span class=""links"">plyometrics</span></a>) for potential sprinters, jumpers, and throwers<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;SPECIFIC STRENGTH PHASE. Exercises that increase the strength of muscle groups used in a specific activity. A variety of exercises may be performed (e.g. bounding exercises, medicine ball drills, and conventional weight training), but muscles should be worked in the same way as in the activity for which you are training. The duration of each phase and the choice of exercises will depend on the individual and the activity for which he or she is training. Ideally, during a strength-training session each of the major muscle groups should be used, and, to avoid fatigue, successive exercises should not use the same muscle group.<br class=""nLine"" />

"stress","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stress</b><div class=""content"">A psychological condition occurring when individuals feel unable to cope with the demands being made on them. They also believe that this failure will have important consequences. This condition is sometimes called distress, to distinguish it from the positive or pleasant aspects of stressful situations (eustress). Stress is usually associated with feeling a lack of control and involvement in the decisions which affect life and work.<br class=""nLine"" />The jobs with the highest strain are those in which there is heavy pressure to perform, where hours and procedures are rigid, there is a threat of redundancy, there is little opportunity to learn new skills, and there is little involvement in decision making. Such jobs tend to be the least prestigious. Workers low in the hierarchy tend to experience the most stress. It is unclear how stress affects health, but one possibility is that it disturbs important systems in the body, such as the hormonal, nervous, or immune system.<br class=""nLine"" />Although it may not be possible to change jobs, the effects of stress can be relieved by exercise and a healthy diet. Regular aerobic exercise, consisting of a daily 40-minute brisk walk, can reduce anxiety by as much as 14 per cent. In stressful situations, those who exercise regularly tend to have less muscle tension and lower blood pressure than inactive people."
"stress fracture","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stress fracture</b><div class=""content"">A microscopic break in a bone caused by repeated loading and unloading. Stress fractures are often slow to develop and are not usually linked to any single injury. They occur when the forces applied repeatedly to a bone exceed its structural strength. According to the fatigue theory, bones are more likely to suffer fractures if they are not adequately supported by surrounding muscles because impact forces are transferred directly to the bones. Consequently, stress fractures tend to be more common in unconditioned exercisers with poor muscle development. Also, those with brittle bones, such as older people and females suffering from menstrual irregularities (see <a href=""entry://amenorrhoea""><span class=""links"">amenorrhoea</span></a>), are also susceptible to fractures. Stress fractures are characterized by local pain exacerbated by activity but relieved by rest. Most bones can become stress fractured, but more than one-half of all fractures seen in athletes affect the shin bone.<br class=""nLine"" />Stress fractures may be difficult to diagnose, except by a bone scan, because they do not always appear on X-rays until well established. See also <a href=""entry://osteoporosis""><span class=""links"">osteoporosis</span></a>."
"stress hormone","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stress hormone</b><div class=""content"">A hormone secreted in response to stressful or exciting situations. Long-term stress is associated with high levels of cortisol. This is a steroid hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex which has a marked effect on carbohydrate metabolism and acts as an immunosuppressant. In the short term, physiological and psychological arousal results in the secretion of adrenaline into the blood, and noradrenaline into tissues. These hormones evolved so that we could deal rapidly with impending danger. They prepare our bodies for action by improving the blood supply to skeletal muscles and mobilizing energy stores. If stress hormones are too low, muscles have insufficient fuel and oxygen to respond quickly; however, excessive secretion of stress hormones can disturb the balance between fat and carbohydrate metabolism, and damage physical performance."
"stress incontinence","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stress incontinence</b><div class=""content"">The leakage of urine on laughing, coughing, straining, or even walking. It is common in women whose pelvic floor muscles have been weakened during childbirth. Specific postnatal exercises, such as stride jumps, can reduce the risk of stress incontinence.<br class=""nLine"" />Female athletes who perform heavy exercises that raise their abdominal pressure (e.g. basketball players, weight-lifters, and javelin throwers) may also suffer stress incontinence. Extreme exertion can reduce the collagen that helps to bind the tissue in the pelvic floor.<br class=""nLine"" />Special pelvic floor exercises have been designed to reduce the risk of stress incontinence. One unusual form of exercise uses weights inserted like a tampon into the vagina for 20&ndash;30 minutes each day. The pelvic floor muscles are strengthened by the pubococcygeal muscles contracting to keep the weights in place. Sometimes, stress incontinence can be treated by surgery. See also <a href=""entry://pelvic floor lift""><span class=""links"">pelvic floor lift</span></a>."
"stress inoculation training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stress inoculation training</b><div class=""content"">A form of psychological training devised to overcome the nervousness and anxiety associated with competition. The competitor identifies the factors (stressors) that induce stress and describes the negative thoughts associated with each. Then he or she imagines each stressor in turn, starting with the least worrying. At the same time, the competitor practises physical relaxation techniques and replaces the negative thoughts with positive ones. The training is based on the principle that it is not possible to feel stress and be physically relaxed at the same time."
"stretch reflex","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stretch reflex</b><div class=""content"">The reflex contraction of a muscle when it is stretched. Special sensory receptors (called proprioceptors) in muscle cells constantly monitor the state of muscles. The stretch reflex, by limiting its range of movement, protects a muscle from being overstretched and damaged. However, this protective mechanism can itself be damaging if the muscle is lengthened suddenly, especially when cold. The muscle will automatically and forcibly try to shorten, sometimes rupturing itself. For this reason, sports coaches usually advise exercisers training for flexibility to perform static stretches, or slow, controlled movements."
"stretch stress","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stretch stress</b><div class=""content"">A feeling experienced when the muscles and connective tissue of a joint are stretched to a point at which some resistance or slight stress is felt but there is no pain. The stretch stress is used to obtain the stretch position when doing flexibility exercises. To gain maximum benefit, this end position is usually held (with no bouncing movements) for 10 or more seconds before the body is returned slowly to its original position. Quick movements are avoided throughout the stretch to minimize the risk of damage."
"stretch-and-curl","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stretch-and-curl</b><div class=""content"">A relatively easy exercise often used as part of a cool-down routine to reduce muscle tension.<br class=""nLine"" />❏<i> Lie flat on your back. Gently stretch out until your arms and legs are fully extended. Slowly raise and bend your arms, trunk, and legs so that you assume a crouched position with your arms wrapped around your knees, the heels of your feet tucked under your buttocks, and your head tucked forwards between your arms. Make yourself into as small a ball as possible. Hold for about 5 seconds then slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position. Repeat the exercise three or four times. The key to this exercise is to move in a relaxed manner, very smoothly and slowly.</i>"
"stretching","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stretching</b><div class=""content"">There are two main types of stretching exercises: ballistic stretching and static stretching. Ballistic stretching is performed quickly with bouncing movements. It carries a high risk of muscle tears. In static stretching, the stretched position is reached gently and slowly and is held for a given time (usually 6&ndash;60 seconds); there is no movement or bouncing and no extra weight or strain on the muscle.<br class=""nLine"" />A programme of static stretching exercises improves flexibility, allowing freer and easier movements. Stretching can also improve posture and a sense of well being. It is particularly useful for older people, because their muscles tend to tighten, particularly those in the backs of the thighs.<br class=""nLine"" />Most coaches advocate pre-workout stretching to reduce the risk of muscle injuries. However, stretching can have the opposite effect, especially if it is performed too enthusiastically before you are properly warmed up. If you stretch as part of your warm-up routine, make sure that your muscles are warm before you stretch and perform the stretches gently and slowly. It appears that the best time to stretch is after strenuous activity, during cooling down. This maintains mobility of the joints by loosening muscles which have tightened during the activity. It also reduces the incidence of muscle soreness. It is probably a good idea to include static stretches which are held for only a few seconds (5&ndash;10 seconds) towards the end of your warm-up and include longer static stretches (up to 30 seconds) when cooling down."
"stride jumps","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stride jumps</b>
<i>(star jumps)</i><div class=""content"">A simple exercise for toning pelvic floor muscles. It is particularly valuable as a postnatal exercise for women who wish to reduce the risk of stress incontinence. At first, the jumps should be performed when the bladder is empty.<br class=""nLine"" />❏<i> Start in a standing position with feet together then jump up, spreading arms and legs out in a wide ‘V’, and finish with legs together and arms by the side.

"stroke","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stroke</b><div class=""content"">An interruption of the blood supply to the brain. A blood clot, a head injury, or a burst blood vessel in the brain (an aneurysm) can cause strokes. The main risk factors associated with strokes are high blood pressure, heart diseases, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity.<br class=""nLine"" />A stroke results in a portion of the brain being deprived of oxygen often leading to some type of paralysis, but small strokes may occur without symptoms. Large strokes can result in severe paralysis or death. Regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and so can reduce the risk of a stroke."
"stroke volume","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stroke volume</b><div class=""content"">The volume of blood pumped by the left ventricle per heartbeat. A typical value for a relatively inactive man is 75 ml per beat. For a trained man at rest it goes up to 105 ml per beat. See also <a href=""entry://cardiac output""><span class=""links"">cardiac output</span></a>."
"strychnine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>strychnine</b><div class=""content"">An alkaloid drug obtained from the seeds of <i>Strychnos nux-vomica</i>. In high doses, strychnine causes severe muscular spasms which can be fatal if respiratory muscles are involved. In low doses it can act as a stimulant, boosting athletic performance. A related chemical was used by the Aztecs to enable them to complete their amazing runs which lasted up to 3 days. In the nineteenth century and the early part of this century, disreputable trainers and coaches sometimes spiked the drinks of their charges with small amounts of strychnine to give them an extra boost during very demanding competitions, such as bare-knuckle fights. In the St. Louis Olympic Games of 1904, the marathon runner, Thomas Hicks, was given strychnine mixed with brandy, in order to inject a bit more pace into his last few kilometres of running."

"sucrose","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sucrose</b><div class=""content"">A double sugar formed from fructose and glucose. It is a valuable energy source (each 100 grams of sucrose yields about 400 kcal of energy) but it has no other nutritional value and is often referred to as ‘empty calories’. Refined sucrose, made from sugar cane and sugar beet, is the table sugar added to foods as a sweetener, flavour enhancer, and preservative. Sucrose also occurs naturally in many vegetables and fruits. See also <a href=""entry://sugar""><span class=""links"">sugar</span></a>."
"sudden death","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sudden death</b><div class=""content"">Sudden death during or immediately after exercise is, thankfully, very rare. It has been estimated that one death occurs for every 15 000 to 18 000 exercisers each year. The risk of sudden death during exercise is 4 to 56 times greater than during rest (depending on the activity and age), but regular exercisers are less likely than inactive people to die at rest or during activity. Therefore, regular, vigorous exercise reduces the overall risk of sudden death. Among those under 35 years of age, the usual cause of death is a heart abnormality; of those over 35 who die, about 75 per cent have heart disease. Anyone who suffers from fainting or near-fainting, or has chest pains during activity should consult a doctor before continuing an exercise programme. Myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart) has been implicated in sudden death. However, several sports medicine practitioners question its involvement. Nevertheless, all agree that it is unwise to exercise during any illness which induces fever. See also <a href=""entry://sudden immersion injury""><span class=""links"">sudden immersion injury</span></a>."
"sudden immersion injury","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sudden immersion injury</b><div class=""content"">Swimming in very cold water is impossible, even for Olympic champions, because it incapacitates muscles. Sudden entry into freezing water can disturb the activity of the heart and disrupt breathing, resulting in loss of consciousness which may lead to death from drowning, a stroke, or heart attack. Canoeists and participants in other water sports are at obvious risk. Safety procedures for dealing with anyone who falls into the water are vital. Participants should always wear life-jackets and use wet- or dry-suits to retain body heat. Safety procedures should include quick removal, a change into dry clothing, and warm drinks. Alcohol should never be given because it encourages heat loss."
"sugar","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sugar</b><div class=""content"">Sugars are simple carbohydrates. They are sweet, crystalline, and soluble in water. They are classified chemically as monosaccharides and disaccharides. Common monosaccharides are glucose and fructose; common disaccharides are sucrose and lactose. The most common sugar is white table sugar consisting of sucrose.<br class=""nLine"" />In the UK, the average person consumes more than 1 kg (2 lb) of sugar each week. Chocolates, biscuits, sweets, and many soft drinks contain very high levels of sugar. Many of these are also high in fat. Highly refined white sugar and its products are often called ‘empty calories’ because, although they provide energy, they are very low in nutrients such as vitamins and minerals. Unrefined brown sugar, and the sugar in honey, is reputed to have more nutritional value than white sugar, but the difference is insignificant. No sugars contain significant amounts of vitamins and minerals. Sugar is a preservative and flavour enhancer. It is added to many processed foods, such as baked beans and soups.<br class=""nLine"" />Sugar has a bad reputation. Table sugar is sometimes referred to as ‘pure, white, and deadly’. Obesity, heart disease, and diabetes are just three diseases thought to be linked to high sugar consumption. However, although sugar is not very nutritious, there is little evidence that moderate consumption is harmful. There is much more evidence linking the above three diseases to overeating and lack of exercise. Of course, those people who are particularly carbohydrate-sensitive, or who are already suffering from obesity or diabetes, have to keep sugar consumption within strict limits. Frequent consumption of sucrose can encourage growth of oral bacteria (see <a href=""entry://tooth decay""><span class=""links"">tooth decay</span></a>) and yeast infections. See also <a href=""entry://glucose""><span class=""links"">glucose</span></a>."
"sugar fix","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sugar fix</b><div class=""content"">The use of sugar as a quick source of energy, particularly just before or during exercise, to enhance performance. Contrary to popular belief, consuming high quantities of sugar 30&ndash;60 minutes before exercise does not boost short-term energy sources. In fact, it may have a negative effect by stimulating the production of insulin thus causing the sugar to be converted to glycogen. This would cause hypoglycaemia, a lowering of blood sugar, which makes a person feel lightheaded and interferes with the ability to exercise. Sugar consumed during exercise may improve stamina and is unlikely to lower blood sugar levels because insulin production is inhibited by the exercise. See also <a href=""entry://energy drink""><span class=""links"">energy drink</span></a> and <a href=""entry://insulin rebound""><span class=""links"">insulin rebound</span></a>."
"sugar malabsorption","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sugar malabsorption</b><div class=""content"">A partial or complete inability to break down disaccharides (double sugars) into monosaccharides. The disaccharides accumulate in the gut and cause diarrhoea. Bacterial decomposition of these sugars in the lower part of the digestive tract results in gas formation and abdominal pain. Vitamins, minerals, and fluid are lost with the diarrhoea. Untreated sugar malabsorption results in fatigue and deterioration in physical performance. Avoiding carbohydrates from which the disaccharides are derived enables normal activity to be resumed. Sugar malabsorption, apart from that due to lactose intolerance, is very rare."
"sugar-free food","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sugar-free food</b><div class=""content"">In the UK, a label used on foods that do not contain table sugar (sucrose). However, they may contain other sugars such as glucose, fructose, or sugar alcohols (e.g. xylitol, used in ‘tooth-friendly’ sweets because it deters the growth of bacteria that cause dental caries). Foods containing xylitol are unsuitable for diabetics."
"sulphites","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sulphites</b><div class=""content"">Salts containing sulphur and usually derived from sulphur dioxide. They are used as preservatives to prevent oxidation and mould growth in many processed foods and beverages, especially wines. They were formerly used by caterers to maintain the fresh appearance of fruits and vegetables, until it was discovered that some people have an adverse reaction to sulphites. Many asthmatics, children with a history of hyperactivity, and those with liver disorders are particularly sensitive to sulphites or sulphur dioxide. Consequently, their use in raw foods has been banned in the USA. All manufacturers of processed foods must declare the sulphite content in the food label. Although sulphites are a health hazard to only a few people, it is important to be aware that they can destroy thiamin (see <a href=""entry://vitamin B1""><span class=""links"">vitamin B<sub class=""ind>1</sub></span></a>). Foods containing appreciable quantities of sulphites will not provide this important vitamin. This may be a problem when sulphite is used to blanch chipped potatoes."

"sunburn","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sunburn</b><div class=""content"">Skin damage caused by overexposure to the sun's rays, especially ultraviolet rays. There are two main types of ultraviolet light, UVA (wavelengths 320&ndash;400 nm) and UVB (wavelengths 290&ndash;320 nm). On a dose-to-dose basis, UVB is about 1000 times more harmful than UVA. Exposure to ultraviolet light increases with altitude (4 per cent per 100 metres), increasing the risk of sunburn. Chronic exposure of unprotected skin to sunlight induces premature skin ageing, abnormal pigmentation, and skin cancers. Anyone exercising regularly out of doors has a high risk of sunburn and should use a sunscreen with a high sun-protection factor, which absorbs both UVA and UVB. Acute sunburn is treated with cold compresses and painkillers."
"sunstroke","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sunstroke</b><div class=""content"">Overheating due to direct exposure of the head and back of the neck to the sun's rays. Symptoms include red skin, a swollen face, buzzing in the ears, dizziness, nausea, increased pulse rate, and rapid breathing. If overheating persists it can become very dangerous (see <a href=""entry://heat stroke""><span class=""links"">heat stroke</span></a>). Sunstroke is quite common in people exercising outdoors for long periods; tennis players, walkers, and golfers are particularly susceptible. If you suffer from sunstroke, you should stop exercising, rest in the shade, and loosen your clothing.

"supplements","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>supplements</b><div class=""content"">Vitamin, mineral, and other food concentrates packaged as tablets, capsules, or liquids. Supplements are big business; in the USA 40 per cent of the population takes some form of food supplement. Those who suffer specific nutrient deficiencies or who have special dietary requirements may be advised to take food supplements (e.g. expectant mothers, total vegetarians, and those on a low calorie diet). However, most others do not need supplements if they eat a well balanced diet. This applies even to people who are very active, because they usually consume more food and hence more nutrients than sedentary people with smaller appetites. Many people take supplements to compensate for poor dietary habits, or in the belief that the supplement will make them immune to disease or ageing. Some athletes take supplements to improve performance, but this should not be necessary as long as you train well and eat properly."

"sweating","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sweating</b><div class=""content"">It is said that ‘pigs sweat, men perspire, but only ladies glow’. Whatever name is given to the process, they all secrete a watery fluid onto their skin to prevent them from overheating during exercise or in hot environments. There are two main types of sweat glands: eccrine glands and apocrine glands.<br class=""nLine"" />Eccrine glands are the most common type. They occur all over the body and produce sweat that is a clear fluid containing mainly salt and water. It has small amounts of urea and uroconic acid which may offer the skin some protection against ultraviolet radiation. It also contains small amounts of minerals and water-soluble vitamins that must be replaced if sweating is excessive. Sweating can, for example, cause a significant loss of vitamin B<sub class=""ind>1</sub> and zinc.<br class=""nLine"" />Vigorous physical activity produces heat which must be removed. Otherwise the exerciser will overheat and is in danger of suffering from heat stroke. High body temperatures stimulate the eccrine glands to secrete watery sweat which evaporates from the skin surface, cooling it. The cooled skin subsequently cools blood which has been shunted from the body core to the body surface. One litre of sweat evaporated from the body removes approximately 580 kcal of heat.<br class=""nLine"" />A person exercising in the heat may sweat up to 2&ndash;3 litres per hour, depending on the conditions. During a World Cup soccer match against Brazil in Mexico, England soccer players lost as much as 5 kg in body weight. Conditions that allow rapid evaporation of sweat include high temperatures, cloud cover, steady breezes, and low humidity. If sweating occurs without sufficient water replacement, overheating and dehydration occur. Sweating also increases during periods of mental and emotional arousal.<br class=""nLine"" />The other type of sweat glands are called apocrine glands. They occur under the armpits and around the groin and nipples. They secrete a milky white fluid containing proteins and fatty substances. These substances may be broken down by bacteria to produce a pungent odour which may have a sexual function.

<b>swimmer's ear</b>
<i>(surfer's ear)</i><div class=""content"">An earache that starts as an annoying itch but can develop into a painful infection. It affects swimmers or surfers who neglect to dry their ear canals adequately after long periods in the water. Water trapped in the ear breaks down the lining of the outer canal which becomes infected with bacteria and fungi. Use of cotton-tipped ear swabs increases the risk of infection by removing the protective wax in the ear canal. Swimmers should keep out of the water until the infection has cleared. Ear drops of alcohol and vinegar may clear the infection in its early stages, but persistent infections may need treatment with antibiotics."
"swimmer's shoulder","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>swimmer's shoulder</b><div class=""content"">An overuse injury common among swimmers and others, such as throwers, who make repeated, vigorous movements of the arms. It is characterized by inflammation and intense pain when the arm is lifted upwards and forwards. Soft tissues, mostly the tendons associated with rotator muscles of the shoulder joint, become trapped in the space between the head of the humerus and the shoulder blade. The injury can be prevented by a good upper body conditioning programme, including both strength and flexibility exercises, combined with the development of good technique. Established injuries usually respond to rest, ice, and anti-inflammatories, but surgery may be required in severe cases."
"swimming","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>swimming</b><div class=""content"">Many experts believe that swimming is the ideal all-round exercise. People of all ages and levels of fitness can take part. Swimming, especially the front crawl which requires steady, rhythmic movements, helps to develop aerobic fitness, suppleness, and muscular strength. If, however, you are swimming for fitness you will need to do three or four hard sessions a week. The water supports the body so there is little stress or impact on tendons, ligaments, and joints. This does not strengthen bones, but it does make swimming safer than land-based activities for those whose bones are weakened by osteoporosis. It also makes swimming especially suitable for those who suffer from knee or back problems, or who are slightly overweight. Swimming can also be helpful for people with asthma or bronchitis.<br class=""nLine"" />Although swimmers are less injury-prone than those involved in high-impact sports which involve running or jumping, they can still suffer overuse injuries. Most injuries affect the shoulder (see <a href=""entry://swimmer's shoulder""><span class=""links"">swimmer's shoulder</span></a>). They are usually caused by either poor technique or lack of muscle balance. Competitive swimmers are particularly prone to overuse injuries so they supplement their swimming with land-based training (especially weight training) to rectify muscle imbalances and strengthen muscles. Injuries can also be reduced by using a variety of strokes that develop different muscles of the body: the front crawl helps develop the arms and chest; backstroke develops flexibility of the shoulders; breast-stroke develops the upper arms, chest, thighs, and hips; and the butterfly develops the whole upper body.<br class=""nLine"" />Although an excellent activity, swimming in cold water may not be a suitable part of a slimming programme because it can stimulate the deposition of fats under the skin to act as an insulating layer."

<b>Syndrome X</b><div class=""content"">A set of signs and symptoms associated with the accumulation of fat in the abdomen. This form of fat distribution is common in middle-aged men and is often visible as a pot belly or paunch. Syndrome X is characterized by a number of disorders including gout, impaired glucose metabolism (increasing susceptibility to diabetes), raised blood pressure, and elevated blood cholesterol levels. People with Syndrome X have a high risk of heart disease."
"synergist","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>synergist</b>
<br class=""nLine"" /><b>1</b> A drug, food additive, or other chemical that interacts with another substance so that their combined effect (known as synergy) is more than the sum of their separate effects. These may be beneficial or harmful. In foods, vitamin E and selenium have overlapping functions, each can replace the other to some extent. When together, they may act as synergists, each increasing the effect of the other as an antioxidant. The term synergist is also applied to health-risk factors. For example, studies in the USA have revealed a synergistic effect of smoking and drinking alcohol on the risk of oral cancer. It was found that moderate drinking increases the risk by 60 per cent; moderate smoking increases the risk by 52 per cent; but moderate drinking combined with moderate smoking increased the risk by 400 per cent.
<br class=""nLine"" /><b>2</b> A muscle which aids the action of a prime mover (a muscle which has the main responsibility for a particular movement). The synergist may produce the same movement as the prime mover, or it may stabilize the joints across which the prime mover acts, preventing undesirable movements."
"synergy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>synergy</b><div class=""content"">Coordinated activity of opposing muscle groups (antagonistic pairs, such as the biceps and triceps in the upper arm) that results in smooth, well-controlled movements. See also <a href=""entry://synergist""><span class=""links"">synergist</span></a>."
"t'ai chi","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>t'ai chi</b><div class=""content"">A gentle, non-violent form of exercise partly derived from Chinese martial arts and Taoism (a Chinese philosophical system). It consists of 108 complex, slow-motion movements that encourage mental and physical harmony. T'ai chi is unlikely to place sufficient demands on your body to improve cardiovascular fitness, nor is it likely to help you lose weight. However, it may help to improve posture, making you appear taller, slimmer, and more poised."
"table salt","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>table salt</b><div class=""content"">Common salt used to flavour food and as a preservative. Table salt consists mainly of sodium chloride, but may also contain other chemicals such as anti-caking agents (e.g. magnesium carbonate and sodium hexacyanoferrate II).<br class=""nLine"" />Many table salts are also iodized (they have iodine added). Iodization was first carried out in the USA in the 1920s to combat goitre (an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland). However, except in the northernmost States where the levels of iodine in the soil are abnormally low, most people can obtain sufficient iodine from a normal balanced diet without using iodized salt.<br class=""nLine"" />For several years doctors have expressed concern about the overconsumption of salt because of its high sodium content (approximately 40 per cent). A high dietary intake of sodium salts is associated with high blood pressure and heart disease. Some patients suffering hypertension can reduce their blood pressure by taking a low-salt diet. The WHO recommends that total salt consumption should be around 5 g per person per day. Current intakes in the UK are around 8&ndash;10 g of salt each day. In the USA warnings about the hazards of salt consumption have resulted in a remarkable response: although still exceeding 5 g per day, the intake of salty products has decreased by more than 30 per cent and the food industry is processing many more foods with low salt levels."
"tachycardia","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tachycardia</b><div class=""content"">A rapid, resting heartbeat 20&ndash;30 beats above normal. Drinking coffee or tea, and excitement can induce tachycardia, or it may indicate a disorder, such as an impending infection or heart disease. Many sports people monitor their resting pulse rate regularly and find that it keeps relatively constant from day to day. A small elevation (even of 3&ndash;5 beats per minute) is often an early indication of overtraining. If wise, they reduce their training load until the resting pulse returns to normal. Those who ignore the warning often succumb to a viral infection or some other disorder."

<b>tannins</b><div class=""content"">Soluble, astringent substances found in some plants, including tea and coffee. Tannins are added to a variety of processed foods, including ice-cream and caramel. They are also used as clearing agents to precipitate proteins in wines and beer.<br class=""nLine"" />Tannins are sometimes called ‘antinutrients’ because they may reduce the absorption of some minerals. Drinking more than two cups of tea or coffee without milk a day can rob the body of significant amounts of calcium and iron, and may contribute to the development of osteoporosis (brittle bone disease) and anaemia. These adverse effects can be reduced by drinking tea and coffee between rather than during meals, and the addition of milk or lemon juice neutralizes the effects of tannins on iron absorption. Eating foods rich in vitamin C helps to counteract the effects of tannins on iron absorption."
"tapering down","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tapering down</b><div class=""content"">A gradual reduction in training load in the period leading up to competition. Tapering is particularly important for those preparing for endurance events. It gives the body an opportunity to recover fully from months of heavy training and to adapt to increased demands. There are many examples of athletes who performed exceptionally well after they were forced to rest against their wishes. One of the most famous was Emil Zatopek who was training very intensively for the 1950 European Games when he became ill and had to stay in hospital for two weeks. He came out just 2 days before he was due to compete in the 10 000 metres. He won the race convincingly by more than one lap. He went on to complete the ‘double’ by winning the 5000 metres. Zatopek's performances demonstrated the benefits of tapering so clearly that their effects are sometimes called the ‘Zatopek phenomenon’. Despite the well-recorded benefits, many top class athletes do not have the confidence to taper and feel uncomfortable having a period of relative rest before a major competition. However, those who do not taper often underperform and are susceptible to injuries.<br class=""nLine"" />There does not seem to be any formula for establishing the optimum tapering period, but many coaches advocate 10&ndash;14 days of reduced training load (not complete rest) prior to competition. Duncan MacDougall of the University of Ontario, Canada, found that when middle-distance runners cut their training mileage by 90 per cent, their performances unexpectedly improved as long as they trained at race pace. Swimmers are usually advised not to reduce their training frequency by more than 50 per cent. Swimming is a skill sport and long periods out of the water may result in loss of neuromuscular coordination."
"taping","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>taping</b><div class=""content"">Strapping or taping is the use of tapes and bandages to support a weakened body part without limiting its function. A taped joint should retain its normal range of movement but as the tapes are usually inelastic, they prevent movements beyond the normal range which might stress the weakened area and aggravate an injury. Some coaches and trainers tape uninjured joints as a precautionary measure to improve stability and decrease the risk of injury during strenuous activity. Others never tape uninjured joints. They argue that an immobilized joint cannot take its share of the load and therefore overloads other joints, increasing the risk of injury. They often add that a person injured badly enough to require taping, should not exercise."
"tempolauf","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tempolauf</b><div class=""content"">A type of training for runners, cyclists, and swimmers which emphasizes high-intensity effort equalling or approaching that required in a race. The aim is to accustom the athlete to the tempo or pace of the race. Tempolauf may take the form of a single time trial or a small number of repetitions with sufficient rest between each to allow recovery to be almost complete."
"tendinitis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

"tendon","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tendon</b><div class=""content"">A white band of tough, rope-like connective tissue which attaches a muscle to a bone or cartilage. Tendons transmit the forces exerted by muscle contraction to move parts of the skeleton. They can tolerate being pulled vigorously by muscles but are less resistant to compression and twisting forces. Each tendon moves up and down within a sheath containing a small amount of fluid to reduce friction. Inflammation of the sheath (paratendinitis) restricts movement of the tendon and can be quite painful."
"tendon injuries","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tendon injuries</b><div class=""content"">Tendons can be ruptured by a single over-enthusiastic movement. Such acute injuries are quite dramatic and usually leave the sufferer unable to move the affected joint. In these cases, surgery may be needed to secure the tendon to its bone. However, most tendon injuries develop insidiously through chronic overuse during activities that produce high compression forces (e.g. road running) or twisting forces (e.g. golf and tennis). One theory suggests that tendons repeatedly subjected to relatively large loads suffer microscopic ruptures. Individual loads are tolerated, but if they are repeated often enough the tendon starts to break down (metal fatigues in a similar way).<br class=""nLine"" />Treatment of tendon injuries varies depending on their severity. Rest is the first and most important treatment. Ice and analgesics are often applied to reduce any swelling and pain. Ultrasound, acupuncture, and laser therapy are a few of the many treatments employed by physiotherapists. Stretching exercises are usually an important part of a rehabilitation programme because lack of flexibility of a muscle-tendon unit is a major contributory factor to injury. Unfortunately, tendons have a poor blood supply and are generally slow to heal."
"tennis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tennis</b><div class=""content"">A top-class tennis match may last over 2 hours and players require high levels of aerobic fitness. A player's average heart rate reaches 60&ndash;70 per cent of its maximum level and a burst of maximum activity occurs each time a player contests a point. A point lasts about 12&ndash;15 seconds and there may be more than 500 points contested during a match. So, tennis can be a very demanding sport but it can also be played at many levels of intensity, making it very popular. As long as you can find someone at about the same level to play with, you can play tennis at your own pace.<br class=""nLine"" />Doubles is less strenuous than singles (during a doubles match, average heart rate is only about 40 per cent maximum). This makes tennis an activity which can be enjoyed by people of all ages and levels of fitness. Playing tennis involves bending, twisting, stretching, leaping, and running. These movements keep the shoulders, arms, and legs supple and strong, and help to develop good posture and balance. It also improves aerobic fitness. The movements, however, tend to lead to injuries in the shoulder, lower back, and knee, especially if there are muscular weaknesses and imbalances (see <a href=""entry://tennis elbow""><span class=""links"">tennis elbow</span></a>). Injuries are more common in those who are in poor physical condition and those who do not warm-up ade-quately. Rehabilitation from upper-body injuries may include windmill exercises (see <a href=""entry://windmills""><span class=""links"">windmills</span></a>) and ‘anchored racquet’ exercises in which an elastic band is attached to the racquet to provide controlled resistance for normal stroke movements.<br class=""nLine"" />Flexibility and mobility exercises are essential for players of all standards so that they can be adequately prepared for dynamic activity during a game. It is also important to do exercises using both sides of the body to counteract the one-sided development of body musculature. A condition nicknamed ‘King Kong’ arm is common in players who do not take this advice. The dominant arm becomes overdeveloped because of the asymmetrical increase in size of the dominant shoulder girdle. This affects body posture and may result in stresses and strains causing injuries in other parts of the body. Tennis involves a considerable amount of side-to-side movement. To minimize injuries, tennis shoes should have a strong heel cup and heel counter. Also, the forefoot should be made of sturdy material to cope with the dragging of the trail leg during low ground shots."
"tennis elbow","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tennis elbow</b><div class=""content"">Tennis elbow is an overuse injury of the tendon that attaches one of the finger and wrist extensor muscles (the extensor carpi radialis brevis) onto the lower part of the humerus. The injury is characterized by pain on the lateral (outer) side of the elbow. The pain may extend from the shoulder to the wrist.<br class=""nLine"" />Tennis elbow is associated with any activity in which the wrist is constantly bending while the hand is gripping an object (e.g. canoeing, baseball, fencing, racquet sports, tenpin bowling, and fly fishing). Repeated throwing may also put undue stress on the tendon, especially if the arm and wrist are twisted in an effort to impose spin on a ball. Overuse, poor mechanics, and insufficient conditioning of muscles are contributory factors. In racquet sports, poor backhand technique, inappropriate grip size, and tight racquet strings may overload the tendon. As with other soft-tissue injuries, primary treatment includes rest, ice, and analgesics.

<b>tennis leg</b><div class=""content"">An injury characterized by a sharp pain in the upper calf described as feeling like ‘a shot in the leg’. It is caused by a rupture of one of the tendons of the gastrocnemius muscle at the back of the calf. The injury may result from a sudden extension of the knee when the ankle is dorsiflexed (i.e. the foot is pulled towards the shin), or by a sudden dorsiflexion when the knee is extended. Tennis leg occurs most frequently among middle-aged exercisers who already have some degeneration of the tendon. It is common in all racquet sports and basketball."

"testosterone","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>testosterone</b><div class=""content"">The main male sex hormone. Testosterone is secreted by the testes throughout life, but there is some decline with age. To offset this decline and in the hope of retaining youthful virility, some older men take testosterone preparations (in the past, extra testosterone was sometimes obtained by eating testes of monkeys). Surprisingly, testosterone is also secreted in small amounts from the adrenal glands in women. This secretion increases after exercise but decreases with overtraining. Rapid weight loss may also lead to lower testosterone levels. High testosterone levels in females may interfere with some actions of female sex hormones, disrupting the menstrual cycle but reducing premenstrual stress. Low testosterone levels in males may reduce sexual desire. Low levels may also reduce a person's energy capacity by affecting the body's ability to store energy in the form of creatine phosphate and glycogen.<br class=""nLine"" />Testosterone has both androgenic (masculinizing) and anabolic (tissue-building) effects. It acts as an androgen by promoting the development of male secondary sexual characteristics. Its anabolic effects include stimulating muscle growth and reducing muscle degradation during training. Both help to improve muscle strength. Most users of synthetic testosterone do not wish to have the masculinizing effects. Therefore, synthetic analogues of testosterone are designed to emphasize the anabolic properties while minimizing the androgenic properties. These preparations can be harmful and have been linked to liver disease, tumour growth, breast development in men, and suppression of normal female hormones. Consequently, the use of testosterone and related drugs has been banned by the International Olympic Committee on the principle that athletes should not be allowed to sacrifice their health to obtain a competitive advantage. However, testosterone supplements do have their valid medical uses. For example, they are administered to some anorexics to help them build muscle mass and aid their recovery.

"tetanus","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tetanus</b><div class=""content"">In exercise physiology, tetanus refers to a sustained contraction of a muscle block, but most people associate the term with a dreadful disease, lockjaw. A bacterium, <i>Clostridium tetani</i>, is responsible for the disease. It can be found anywhere, but is most common on ground contaminated by animal faeces, such as sports fields used by farm animals. Tetanus is regarded as the most serious type of sports-related infection. The infective organisms usually enter the body through a laceration. In recent years, two Scottish rugby players and one soccer player developed tetanus from lacerations acquired during play. Only one player survived. The others died by exhaustion and asphyxiation. Even when not fatal, the disease is very unpleasant. The bacterium releases a toxin which causes simultaneous contraction of all the muscles, making the body go as rigid as a board. Treatment is usually prolonged and painful. Tetanus is preventable by active immunization. Anyone who exercises out of doors is foolish not to take advantage of this protection. Some sports, including orienteering, insist on participants taking measures to reduce the risk of this fearsome condition."

Thinness-demand sports include gymnastics, diving, dance, and figure skating, which base their scoring on appearance and form. Long-distance running is also included because those who have thin, lean bodies often have a high power to body weight ratio which gives them a distinct advantage. Sports which have strict weight classes, such as boxing, wrestling, and horse-racing, often require the participants to lose weight. There is some evidence, albeit inconclusive, that participants in thinness-demand sports have a greater tendency to suffer from eating disorders.

<b>thirst</b><div class=""content"">An uncomfortable feeling of dryness in the mouth and throat accompanied by a desire to drink. The stimulus for thirst is an abnormally high concentration of sodium in the blood. This usually occurs after significant amounts of body fluid are lost. Unfortunately, thirst is not a very reliable mechanism. There is a delay between loss of body fluids and the sensation of thirst. A 150 pound (about 68 kg) person may lose as much as 1.5 pounds (0.7 kg) of sweat before feeling thirsty.

<b>thrombosis</b><div class=""content"">The formation of a clot (thrombus) in a blood vessel. A thrombus remains at its site of formation where it restricts or stops blood flow. Regular exercisers are unlikely to suffer from a spontaneous thrombosis (i.e. one not associated with an injury) because their blood tends to have a high concentration of anti-clotting agents. However, thromboses associated with a trauma can sometimes occur. In contact sports, for example, the sub-clavian or axillary vein can be damaged by a blow to the shoulder or clavicle and a condition known as ‘effort thrombosis’ may occur. It is characterized by pain, swelling, and sometimes numbness in the affected arm. An effort thrombosis may also result from repetitive overhand movements, for example in racquet sports."
"thrower's elbow","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>thrower's elbow</b>
<i>(pitcher's elbow)</i><div class=""content"">A term given to a number of injuries of the elbow associated with throwing. These are characterized by damage to the triceps muscle, its tendon, and the olecranon process (the end of the ulna which forms the tip of the elbow) which may suffer stress fractures. Loose bodies may form in the joint causing locking and predisposing the injured thrower to osteoarthritis.<br class=""nLine"" />Thrower's elbow is often the result of poor throwing technique when forcefully straightening the elbow, resulting in too great a load being imposed. Professional baseball pitchers produce arm speeds of 7000 degrees per second as the arm rotates inwards. The elbow is subjected to violent forces during all phases of the pitching motion, so injuries are no surprise.<br class=""nLine"" />Treatment includes correcting faulty technique and removing any loose bodies (this can now be done by keyhole surgery). Although rest, ice, compression, and elevation (see <a href=""entry://RICE""><span class=""links"">RICE</span></a>) may be sufficient to treat slightly damaged tissue, surgery is often needed for more serious injuries."
"thrower's fracture","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>thrower's fracture</b><div class=""content"">A fracture of the humerus which occurs when muscle forces generated by a throw are enough to snap the bone. Such dramatic fractures occur rarely, but smaller stress fractures are more common, especially in young throwers and participants in racquet sports. Their immature bones and muscles cannot tolerate the high acceleration forces operating on the humerus during throws. Treatment is based on rest and improvement of technique when throwing is resumed. If the thrower does not rest, a complete fracture is likely. This may require surgery and possibly end a person's ability to throw competitively."
"throwing","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>throwing</b><div class=""content"">Throwing forms a central part of many sports, including athletics, baseball, and cricket. The best throwers are usually strong, and have good mobility, balance, and coordination. Mobility is required particularly in the shoulders and hips. Throwers also need a great deal of strength in their throwing arm. They have be able to move the arm very quickly and with great power. To do this effectively, they use the large muscles of the legs and back. Training, therefore, involves strengthening not only the throwing arm, but also the muscles in the abdomen, back, and legs. Throwers subject themselves to tremendous forces and often suffer injuries in the knees, lower back, shoulders, and elbows. To minimize the risk of injury they should: <blockquote>•&nbsp;warm-up before throwing and cool down afterwards<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;do mobility training that develops the flexibility of the back, hips, and shoulders<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;strengthen the lower back and abdominal muscles<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;adopt a safe and efficient throwing technique.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>"

"thyroid hormone","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>thyroid hormone</b><div class=""content"">A hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, a large gland in the neck. There are two thyroid hormones (thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine), both contain iodine. They regulate the metabolic rate of every cell in the body except those of the brain, spleen, testes, and uterus. They are important regulators of tissue growth and development, particularly of nervous and skeletal tissue. People with an under-active thyroid gland tend to be sluggish and overweight, and to suffer from swollen joints, muscle cramps, puffy faces, and general lassitude. Fortunately, the condition is easily treated with thyroid hormone replacement tablets or iodine supplements if the problem is due to iodine deficiency. Those with an over-active thyroid gland tend to be thin, hyperactive, and have protruding eyes. Excessive secretion of thyroid hormone can also lead to muscle loss, and cause bones to demineralize and become brittle. The use of thyroid hormones to treat obese people was quite common 30 years ago, but it has grown out of favour because of dangerous and unpleasant side-effects, including muscle loss, heart malfunctions, and mental problems. There is some evidence to show that regular exercise stimulates thyroxine production. This is just one of the reasons why exercise is beneficial in a weight-loss programme.

"time of meals","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>time of meals</b><div class=""content"">Many people do not have specific meal times. This is seen by some dietitians as making a major contribution to over-eating: if people eat when they like and food is constantly available, sensible, controlled eating is less likely. They are more likely to ‘graze’ continuously on food and eat too much. Dietitians generally advise people to eat at least three meals at specific times each day. Those on a weight-loss diet are often advised to have as many as six small meals each day. Eating increases metabolic rate (see diet induced thermogenesis). Consequently, there is less energy available for other body activities (including fat storage) from a number of meals than from one meal containing the same number of calories.<br class=""nLine"" />For those who exercise vigorously, the ideal time to consume a meal is 2&ndash;3 hours before the activity. Foods high in protein need the maximum time; those high in carbohydrates will require the lower time limit. Although exhaustive exercise may lower the appetite, the best way to replenish energy is by consuming easily absorbable, carbohydrate-rich food or drink immediately after exercise. A delay may result in the body taking up to 48 hours to replenish energy stores.

<b>time-trial</b><div class=""content"">A form of training often used by runners, cyclists, and swimmers, in which they race against the clock to establish how fast they can cover a particular distance. Many coaches believe that racing, even against the clock, should be confined to competition. They argue that time-trials focus on speed at the expense of endurance, and that overexertion during a time-trial may result in injury. However, time-trials below competition distance form an important part of the training programmes of most elite athletes. They provide feedback about the effectiveness of a training programme, and help to develop judgement of pace at racing speed. A major danger with time-trials is that the performer loses confidence because too much importance is placed on the times achieved. Also, there is often an expectation that each time-trial should be faster than the previous one. This is neither possible nor desirable, since a person cannot expect to train hard and perform well simultaneously. It is best to regard time-trials as diagnostic tools and not as measures of ability. Personal-best performances should be saved for competitions."
"timing","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>timing</b><div class=""content"">The ability to perform movements and actions at the most effective moment. It is an important component of skill, and depends on the ability to perceive and respond to a wide variety of factors. For example, correct timing of the swing of a baseball bat depends on visual and auditory cues produced by the pitcher, and on internal stimuli that enable the hitter to make smooth coordinated movements. This ensures the ball is hit on the sweet spot, the area of the bat which exerts the most effective force on the ball."

"tooth decay","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tooth decay</b>
<i>(dental caries)</i><div class=""content"">A dental disease in which the hard enamel tissue of the tooth is worn away. It is caused mainly by bacterial deposits (known as plaque) on the tooth surface. Bacteria use food, especially fermentable carbohydrates trapped between the teeth, as an energy source, fermenting it to acids which lower the pH of the plaque. If the pH drops below 5.5, the acid reacts with the enamel, dissolving it. Sugars and starches are both fermented by bacteria. Sugar manufacturers say ‘Sugar itself does not rot your teeth’; nutritionists reply ‘Without it, teeth will not rot!’ Studies have shown that foods containing carbohydrates that stick to the teeth are the most likely to cause tooth decay because they remain available to the bacteria for longer. Specifically, sucrose encourages plaque-forming bacteria. Some chewing-gums, marketed as ‘tooth-friendly’, overcome this problem by replacing sugar with xylitol, a sugar alcohol that does not encourage the growth of the bacteria that cause caries."

<b>total thermal load</b><div class=""content"">The sum of all the factors which tend to increase body temperature. The thermal load is determined by exercise intensity, environmental temperature, and environmental evaporative power. Thus, a person has highest thermal loads (and is therefore at greatest risk of heat exhaustion) when exercising intensively in warm, humid environments with little or no wind."
"toxicity","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>toxicity</b><div class=""content"">The extent to which a substance is poisonous. Toxins in food are usually present in small concentrations. Most toxins in plants are natural and help to protect the plants from pests, disease, and damage. Carcinogenic mycotoxins are produced when moulds and other fungi thrive on food kept in poor storage conditions (see <a href=""entry://aflatoxins""><span class=""links"">aflatoxins</span></a>). Some toxins may also be formed as a result of not cooking food properly. Kidney beans, for example, contain lectins. The beans should be cooked thoroughly to destroy this substance.<br class=""nLine"" />Almost any substance in food, air, or water can become toxic if consumed in high enough concentrations. Even some vitamins and minerals, usually beneficial components of the diet, may be toxic in high doses. This applies especially to the fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A and D) which are stored in the liver, and some water-soluble vitamins (e.g. vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub> and niacin). If excessive amounts are taken, some of the vitamin spills over into the tissues causing toxic reactions. The amount which induces a reaction depends on an individual's sensitivity, but it is usually a megadose, many times the recommended daily intake."

"trainability principle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>trainability principle</b><div class=""content"">A basic principle of training which states that the more fully a person is trained with respect to a given fitness component, the less there remains of that component to be trained in the future. Training benefits, therefore, are more easily obtained during the early stages of training than later."
"training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training</b><div class=""content"">An exercise programme designed to help a person acquire skills and improve physical fitness. Training is usually broken down into different phases, typically starting with general whole-body conditioning, then going on to more specific training and psychological preparation (see also <a href=""entry://periodization""><span class=""links"">periodization</span></a>). For every activity, there are many different types of training and a growing body of scientific knowledge to explain their effects. However, this knowledge is far from complete and there are no simple recipes to guarantee success. Individuals rarely respond in exactly the same way to the same type of training. Nevertheless, a number of general training principles have evolved. The following training guidelines are based on basic training principles and the experience of many top-class coaches: <blockquote>•&nbsp;train regularly all year round, but break the training year down into phases (see <a href=""entry://periodization""><span class=""links"">periodization</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;start gently and gradually increase the training intensity (see <a href=""entry://progression""><span class=""links"">progression</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;ensure that you work sufficiently hard in training to improve (see <a href=""entry://overload principle""><span class=""links"">overload principle</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;train first for endurance, and only later for power or speed<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;establish good overall conditioning, and then make training specific (see <a href=""entry://specific-training principle""><span class=""links"">specific training principle</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;do not overtrain; listen to your body and rest when you become aware of warning symptoms such as persistent pain (see <a href=""entry://overuse injury""><span class=""links"">overuse injury</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;do not be enslaved by a daily schedule, it may become a recipe for overtraining<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;give yourself sufficient rest after a hard training session; alternate a hard training day with an easy day. Include a transition period of reduced training in your yearly schedule<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;rest before competition (see <a href=""entry://peaking""><span class=""links"">peaking</span></a> and <a href=""entry://tapering down""><span class=""links"">tapering down</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;train with a good coach you trust and respect. The coach will help you to establish appropriate goals (see <a href=""entry://goal""><span class=""links"">goal</span></a>), provide objective feedback, and maintain motivation<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;with your coach, select a training programme you believe in. Persevere even when you do not seem to be improving (see <a href=""entry://plateau""><span class=""links"">plateau</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;keep a detailed training log book; it will help you to monitor your fitness and provide a lasting record of your training.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> Overtraining may be more harmful than undertraining. Good coaches advise rest between hard training sessions. People who ignore this basic advice are in danger of doing themselves considerable harm (see <a href=""entry://overtraining""><span class=""links"">overtraining</span></a> and <a href=""entry://overuse injury""><span class=""links"">overuse injury</span></a>). Franz Stampfl (Roger Bannister's coach) said that ‘Training is principally an act of faith’. Without belief in a training system, a person will not train over the months or even years needed to acquire maximum training benefits."
"training diary","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training diary</b><div class=""content"">When you start exercising it is a good idea to keep a daily log of your training. The diary does not have to take any special form. A simple notebook is sufficient, with a page or half page dedicated to each day. The following are some of the items that might be included in the daily entries: <blockquote>•&nbsp;date<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;weight<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;resting pulse<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;training targets<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;training location<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;actual training achieved<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;comments (e.g. how you felt; see <a href=""entry://perceived exertion""><span class=""links"">perceived exertion</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> The diary will enable you to monitor your progress and set new training goals."
"training duration","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training duration</b><div class=""content"">The optimum duration of each exercise session depends on the intensity of the session and the fitness level of the individual. A minimum period of 15 minutes is required to improve cardiovascular fitness. Most experts recommend that healthy individuals exercising to improve general fitness should start with 20&ndash;30 minutes of aerobic exercise. The duration should increase as fitness improves. However, training should not be exhausting. You should feel relaxed and not fatigued within 1 hour of completing your session. Doing too much exercise too soon is one of the main reasons for people giving up. Be patient if you do not seem to be progressing fast enough. It takes at least 12 weeks training to improve aerobic fitness significantly and 8 weeks to improve anaerobic fitness."
"training effects","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training effects</b><div class=""content"">Regular, vigorous exercise affects most parts of the body. Sports scientists and doctors have discovered a long list of benefits gained from regular training. All the benefits listed below have been linked to aerobic exercise, unless otherwise stated. <blockquote>HEART •&nbsp;heart muscle enlarged and strengthened, improving the ability to pump blood<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;coronary blood supply improved, reducing the risk of heart attack<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;resting heart rate lowered<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;heart rate needed to perform given workload lowered, reducing stress on the heart<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>
<blockquote>LUNGS •&nbsp;ventilation of lungs (i.e. ability to breathe) improved<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;respiratory muscles strengthened<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;blood supply to lungs increased<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;ability to extract oxygen from lungs improved<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>
<blockquote>JOINTS •&nbsp;thickening of articular cartilage with weight-bearing exercises<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;increased mobility with flexibility training<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;greater stability (less dislocations) with strength training<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>
<blockquote>BONES •&nbsp;bones thickened, reducing risk of fractures<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>
<blockquote>BLOOD •&nbsp;blood volume increased<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;total volume of red blood cells increased, improving oxygen transport<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;high-density (beneficial) lipoproteins increased<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;low-density (harmful) lipoproteins lowered<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;cholesterol level lowered<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;arterial blood pressure lowered<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;less tendency for blood to clot spontaneously<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>
<blockquote>MUSCLES •&nbsp;muscles enlarged and made stronger by strength training<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;speed of muscle contraction increased with power training<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;myoglobin and muscle glycogen content increased, improving endurance<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;mitochondria density increased, improving muscles' ability to use oxygen<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>
<blockquote>BRAIN •&nbsp;mental alertness improved<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;depression and anxiety reduced<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>
<blockquote>WHOLE BODY •&nbsp;ability to relax and sleep improved<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;stress tolerance improved<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;lean body mass increased<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;metabolic rate increased<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;tendency to suffer from obesity and diabetes mellitus decreased<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> No single form of training produces all of the effects listed, but most of them are gained from regular, vigorous aerobic exercise. It must also be emphasized that individuals vary in their response to exercise. Nevertheless, if performed properly with due regard to individual abilities, regular training has a positive effect on many components of health, and makes weight control easier."
"training frequency","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training frequency</b><div class=""content"">The number of times per week training is undertaken. Some athletics coaches advocate training 7 days a week, but recommended frequencies vary considerably. As a rough guideline, it has been suggested that aerobic training should occur three to five times a week (depending on intensity), and anaerobic training (including strength training) no more than three times a week. Optimal exercise frequency to maintain health, rather than to train for competitive sport, was studied by NASA scientists to prepare their astronauts for manned space flights. They concluded that, although some daily exercise is desirable, vigorous aerobic exercises on 3 non-consecutive days per week is sufficient to maintain a good level of personal physical fitness. Exercise frequencies less than this resulted in degeneration of muscles and reduction in cardiovascular fitness."
"training heart rate","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training heart rate</b>
<i>(target heart rate; training zone)</i><div class=""content"">A heart rate reached in training that indicates the level of exercise which produces maximum training effects (figure 64). The method most commonly used to estimate training heart rate for aerobic exercises on land is to take 60&ndash;80 per cent of maximum heart rate (assumed to be 220 minus age). Heart rates in water are naturally lower than on land. This is partly due to the support that the water gives the body. Therefore, for swimming the maximum heart rate is assumed to be 205 minus age, rather than 220. The training heart rate should be determined in relation to the type of activity and fitness level of the individual. Anaerobic training requires higher heart rates (up to 95 per cent maximum heart rate) sustained for short periods. Unfit people should train at the lower end of the range. For example, a relatively unfit person of 35 years would have a training heart rate (THR) of 60 per cent maximum heart rate, i.e.: <div class=""expo"">THR = (220&ndash;35) × 0.60= 111 beats per minute.</div> Training heart rates are only estimates. Exercisers should always be aware of symptoms, such as breathlessness, dizziness, and pains in the chest, which indicate that the training level is too high. Those with health problems should seek medical advice concerning their level of activity. <center class=""centre""><img src=""000063.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 64</center>"
"training impulse","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training impulse</b><div class=""content"">A measure of the amount of training performed in one session, calculated from the changes in heart rate experienced during the training, the intensity of the exercises, and the duration of the session."
"training intensity","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training intensity</b><div class=""content"">The total amount of effort expended in training. According to the overload principle of training, to improve physical fitness exercise must require more effort than usual. Improvements in flexibility are obtained only if muscles are stretched beyond their normal length; cardiovascular or aerobic fitness is gained only by elevating the heart rate above the normal range; and strength is increased only after training against resistances greater than normal (see <a href=""entry://repetition maximum""><span class=""links"">repetition maximum</span></a>). Although it is essential to ensure that the training intensity is high enough, it is equally important that the intensity is not so high there is a great risk of overuse injuries and overtraining (see <a href=""entry://progression""><span class=""links"">progression</span></a>). A number of methods are used to establish the training intensities which give maximum benefits (see <a href=""entry://training heart rate""><span class=""links"">training heart rate</span></a>)."
"training shoes","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training shoes</b><div class=""content"">Training shoes incorporate features to protect the wearer against the mechanical stresses imposed by the foot striking and moving sideways on the ground (figure 65). Each sport and type of exercise has different requirements. For example, running shoes are designed for forward and backward movements and give little support for the sideways motions experienced in squash. Individuals also have different requirements: heavy people and those with loose tendons and ligaments require a more supportive shoe than light people or those with rigid feet. Modern shoes incorporate the latest technological advances in material science. Some even have gadgets such as rollbars and pumps to inflate bladders which support the upper foot. <center class=""centre""><img src=""000060.jpg"" class=""h_w_auto"" /><br class=""nLine"" />Figure 65 Features of a typical, good training shoe</center><br class=""nLine"" />In 1995 there were more than 200 types of shoe on the market designed specifically for running. These included high and low mileage shoes; shoes suitable for different terrains; shoes with superior fore and rear foot cushioning for those with high or medium arches; slightly heavier, stability shoes, to limit excessive foot motion; motion control shoes, with supports to correct biomechanical problems (e.g. overpronation); and flexible, lightweight shoes for racing. Unfortunately, choosing the ideal shoe is not easy because two people of similar size and running action can react to the same shoe in completely different ways. The wrong shoe may cause injury by having inadequate shock absorption or inappropriate grip on the sole. Therefore, it is best to seek the advice of a specialist shoe shop when buying training shoes, and to try them on."
"training threshold","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training threshold</b><div class=""content"">The minimum amount of exercise needed to improve physical fitness. For exercise to be effective, it must be performed with sufficient frequency, at a high enough intensity, and for a long enough duration. As fitness improves, the threshold level increases. See also <a href=""entry://overload principle""><span class=""links"">overload principle</span></a> and <a href=""entry://progression""><span class=""links"">progression</span></a>."
"training unit","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>training unit</b><div class=""content"">A single period of training designed to achieve a specific objective. A training session may consist of several units, each with different objectives. In American football, for example, one training session may include sprinting to develop speed, weight training to develop strength, and stretching to develop flexibility."
"trans fats","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>trans fats</b>:<div class=""content"">See <a href=""entry://unsaturated fat""><span class=""links"">unsaturated fat</span></a>."
"transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</b> (TENS)<div class=""content"">A technique for relieving acute and chronic pain. A weak electrical current is discharged through electrodes placed at strategic points on the skin to stop the messages from pain receptors reaching the brain. One theory suggests that this current stimulates large nerve fibres in the spinal cord to inhibit or block the transmission along small pain fibres. Another theory proposes that it stimulates the release of chemicals, such as endorphins, that decrease the perception of pain in the same way as opium and morphine. TENS has been used effectively to control the pain caused by some sports injuries, but, because the devices use pulses of short duration, the technique is not well suited to relieving muscle pain."
"transfer","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>transfer</b><div class=""content"">The effect of one form of training on another. The transfer principle emphasizes that the positive effects of different types of training occur only when they share similar components and use the same muscles in the same way. For example, if you learn how to roller-skate, you will probably find it easier to learn ice-skating because the two activities are very alike. Similarly, if you train hard and become physically fit for roller-skating, you are likely to be fit to ice-skate. However, improvements gained from cycling are not so readily passed on to running. See also <a href=""entry://cross-training""><span class=""links"">cross-training</span></a> and <a href=""entry://specific-training principle""><span class=""links"">specific training principle</span></a>."
"transition period","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>transition period</b><div class=""content"">An important post-competition phase of a training programme. During the transition period, training intensity is reduced but exercise is continued at a moderate level to maintain fitness. It is an opportunity to participate in non-competitive activities to relax and mentally refresh yourself so that you can recover from the stresses imposed by competition. See also <a href=""entry://periodization""><span class=""links"">periodization</span></a>."
"trapezius","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>trapezius</b><div class=""content"">A large, flat, triangular muscle in the upper back. It originates from the base of the skull and the upper vertebrae and inserts onto the shoulder blade and collar bone. Its main job is to rotate the shoulder blade and move it inwards. It also helps to rotate the head and extend the neck backwards. If you have difficulty holding your arms out to the side or over your head, your trapezius may be weak. Back strengtheners (see <a href=""entry://back extension""><span class=""links"">back extension</span></a>) will help to strengthen the trapezius and improve flexibility in the upper back. Overtraining for dance, especially ballet, can tighten the trapezius causing discomfort and restricting movement. Relaxation exercises and physiotherapy may be used to treat the problem, but it is best avoided by not overtraining."
"travel sickness","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>travel sickness</b><div class=""content"">A feeling of nausea and vertigo, often leading to vomiting, associated with travelling. It is thought to be caused by abnormal stimulation of the organ of balance in the ear. Needless to say, travel sickness is a considerable handicap to performers in sports such as sailing and motor-racing, but it may occur in anyone who travels. Antihistamines and anticholinergic drugs may be taken to relieve symptoms, but they may cause drowsiness and adversely affect physical performance."
"traveller's diarrhoea","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>traveller's diarrhoea</b><div class=""content"">A notoriously disabling condition with a number of names depending on the geographical location at which it strikes (e.g. Delhi belly and Montezuma's revenge). It often afflicts tourists in locations where food hygiene is poor. Traveller's diarrhoea is usually caused by certain types of the bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i>. This microbe is a common inhabitant of the gut and is usually harmless. However, in a new locality, the gut may become infected with an unaccustomed strain which upsets the intestinal lining, preventing normal reabsorption of water. Treatment includes drinking plenty of fluids to regain water lost, and sometimes, antibiotics. The condition should be treated more seriously if diarrhoea is accompanied by blood in the stool, or fever. This may indicate a more serious condition, such as dysentery, that requires immediate medical attention."
"treadmill","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>treadmill</b><div class=""content"">An exercise machine consisting of a moving belt on which you walk or run. The intensity of the exercise can be adjusted by altering the speed of the belt or altering its gradient.<br class=""nLine"" />Once the preserve of fitness clinics, physiology laboratories, and hospitals, treadmills are becoming more common as an item of home fitness equipment. There has been a phenomenal growth in sales in the USA. Treadmill running now ranks as one of the top activities among Americans. Some treadmills are supplied with computerized equipment to monitor speed, distance travelled, and pulse rate. A video of inspiring scenes and motivational exhortations is often included with the package. You should remember to follow the same precautions when treadmill running as when doing other exercise: warm-up before and cool down after the exercise, and increase your training progressively (see <a href=""entry://progression""><span class=""links"">progression</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />Treadmills are used in physiology laboratories to measure fitness. A non-motorized treadmill is commercially available to measure power output during sprint training. The sprinter uses his or her own forces to move the belt. The speed of the belt, and the forces the sprinter exerts to move the belt and to pull against waist-straps (recorded on strain gauges), are used to calculate the power output. Motorized treadmills are more often used to measure aerobic fitness because they demand the use of the arms, torso, and legs, requiring high rates of oxygen consumption. Unfortunately, the test can be so demanding that even healthy individuals have a small risk of sudden cardiac death. Leonard Shapiro in the <i>Oxford textbook of sports medicine</i>, estimates the sudden death rate to be once in every 375 000 hours of treadmill activity in healthy individuals, and as high as once in 6000 hours in people with heart disease. So, if you have a healthy bank balance that enables you to buy one of these machines, go to a doctor to ensure that you have an equally healthy heart before you use it.<br class=""nLine"" />Motorized treadmills are often used in hospitals to test for cardiovascular disease (see <a href=""entry://graded exercise test""><span class=""links"">graded exercise test</span></a>) although they are losing favour because the results are not very reliable for diagnosis. Many hospital treadmills incorporate electrocardiograms to measure heart activity, and other devices to measure blood pressure and breathing rate. The great advantage of hospital treadmill tests is that there is expert help on hand if anything goes wrong."
"tri-sets","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tri-sets</b><div class=""content"">A weight-training system in which three sets of different exercises are performed before taking a rest. The different exercises may affect different muscles, but body-builders often use tri-sets on a single muscle group to keep blood in the same region of the body and improve muscle appearance.

"triceps brachii","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>triceps brachii</b><div class=""content"">A large fleshy muscle at the back of the arm. It is commonly referred to as the triceps. It opposes the action of the biceps by straightening the arm. This three-headed muscle originates from the humerus and shoulder blade. A single tendon inserts the three heads of the muscle onto the olecranon process, the prominent projection of the ulna in the elbow. This tendon is easily damaged by forceful throwing or when falling on the hand with a fully extended arm. See also <a href=""entry://thrower's elbow""><span class=""links"">thrower's elbow</span></a>."

<b>trigger finger</b><div class=""content"">A thickening and hardening of the tendon of the muscle which flexes the trigger finger, resulting from excessive use from pistol- or rifle-shooting. It is still possible to bend the affected finger, but with little strength. Extension of the finger is also impaired but the condition is rarely painful. It can resolve itself spontaneously but it may require surgery."
"trigger point","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>trigger point</b><div class=""content"">A trigger point usually consists of a small band of muscle which feels knotty. It is sometimes painful when touched, but the pain is often referred to another area of the body. A trigger point in the shoulder, for example, might cause a headache. Trigger points are thought to be due to an accumulation within deep muscle of the waste products of physical activity. This causes localized muscle tension and spasm which may make the points feel like small nodules. Heat treatment with a heat pad or gentle kneading of the trigger point may encourage removal of the waste products and provide relief from pain."

<b>triple-jumper's heel</b><div class=""content"">An overuse injury common among triple-jumpers. The triple-jump consists of three phases: the hop, step, and jump. Enormous forces are imposed on the heel during the triple-jump, especially when it is banged into the ground on landing after the hop and step phases. Consequently, the soft tissue in the heels are easily strained. Triple jumper's heel is sometimes accompanied by the development of a bony spur, an abnormal bony outgrowth, on the heel bone."
"trunk lifts","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>trunk lifts</b><div class=""content"">Two exercises that improve trunk mobility and strengthen the back muscles. Both are performed on a table or bench (figure 67). The lower trunk lift is a specific exercise for the lower back and hips: <br class=""nLine"" />❏<i> Lie prone on a firmly fixed bench or table with your legs hanging over the edge. Stabilize your upper body (e.g. by grasping the edges of the table). Slowly raise your legs until they are parallel to the floor, but no further (do not arch your back), then lower your legs slowly.</i> The upper trunk lift develops the upper back muscles. <br class=""nLine"" />❏<i> Lie face down on a table with your upper body hanging over the edge. Place your hands on the top of your head. Get a partner to stabilize your feet and legs while you raise your trunk so that it is parallel to the floor, no further (again, do not arch your back). Return slowly to the start position.</i>

Use your abdominal and leg muscles to lift your trunk and twist it so that your right elbow is as close as possible to your left knee. Then gently lie back onto the floor and pull upwards again, this time twisting your left elbow towards your right knee. Repeat the whole routine three or four times, remembering to breathe out on the way up and in on the way down.</i> Once the technique is mastered, you can grasp a light weight behind your head to make the exercise more difficult, but do not use your hands and arms to force your body upwards because this can put unnecessary pressure on the neck."
"tryptophan","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>tryptophan</b><div class=""content"">An essential component of a balanced diet, this amino acid is found in protein-rich foods, especially legumes (e.g. beans). Once absorbed into the body, some of it is converted into niacin, one of the B complex vitamins needed for efficient respiration and fat metabolism. People whose staple food is maize often suffer from pellagra, a niacin-deficiency disease, mainly because of the low tryptophan content of their food.<br class=""nLine"" />Many people take amino acid supplements to stimulate muscle growth artificially or as an aid to health. If the supplement contains high levels of tryptophan, the user may feel drowsy and fatigued because the tryptophan may be converted into serotonin which appears to play a role in sleep inducement. Increased dietary intake of tryptophan increases brain levels of serotonin, reducing the time taken to go to sleep by as much as 50 per cent. High levels of tryptophan may also cause faeces to be smelly as the tryptophan is broken down by intestinal bacteria into two odoriferous chemicals, indole and skatole. More worrying, in the USA a few years ago several hundred people who took tryptophan supplements developed a rare blood disease (eosinophil myalgia syndrome, EMS) which caused excruciating muscular pain, skin rashes, and sometimes death. Although its cause was attributed to a contaminant introduced during its manufacture and not directly to tryptophan itself, over-the-counter supplements were banned in 1989 by the Food and Drug Administration until the contaminant could be identified.

"turf toe syndrome","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>turf toe syndrome</b><div class=""content"">An injury commonly caused by stopping suddenly on artificial turf. The foot slides, forward in the shoe, bending the big toe upward and stretching ligaments. This usually results in swelling and pain at the base of the big toe, but if the movement is particularly violent, the toe-nail may be damaged (see <a href=""entry://black nail""><span class=""links"">black nail</span></a>) and bones may be fractured."

"type A behaviour","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>type A behaviour</b><div class=""content"">A form of behaviour exhibited by people who tend to be aggressive, competitive, tense, time-conscious, and generally hostile. Although not all people who exhibit type A behaviour have an increased risk of heart attacks, those who are chronically hostile or cynical are twice as likely to suffer coronary heart disease as people who have a more relaxed and tolerant attitude. The reasons for the relationship between hostile behaviour and heart disease are not clear. It has been suggested that the hormones produced during hostility may do some physical damage, or that people who exhibit such negative behaviour do not maintain good health habits, such as exercising and eating a balanced diet.

It is present in some fermented cheeses, fermented sausages (such as pepperoni), chocolate, pickled or fermented fish (particularly herring), sauerkraut, yeast extracts, red wine, and some strong beers. These foods may provoke an allergic reaction in people who are highly sensitive to tyramine. The chemical acts as a stimulant, raising blood pressure in a manner similar to adrenaline.

"ultrasound","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>ultrasound</b><div class=""content"">Very high frequencies of sound, above 20 kHz. Ultrasound is used in both diagnosis and treatment. Ultrasonography uses echoes of the sound waves to produce images of structures within the body. Continuous ultrasound is a common treatment for deep, soft-tissue injuries. The high-frequency sound waves are believed to vibrate and loosen scar tissue, accelerating the healing process. The vibrations also heat deep tissues and relieve pain. If a swelling occurs, pulsed ultrasound is used because, unlike continuous ultrasound, it does not heat up the tissues. Ultrasound may also be used in a process called phonophoresis to drive anti-inflammatory drugs through the skin into underlying tissue."
"ultraviolet light","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>ultraviolet light</b><div class=""content"">People who exercise out of doors may be exposed to ultraviolet (<small class=""smCap"">UV</small>) light for long periods and are at particular risk from its damaging effects. <small class=""smCap"">UV</small> light can penetrate the skin and burn underlying tissues. Certain wavelengths disrupt normal cell activity and are linked with the development of skin cancers (e.g. melanoma). There are a number of sensible precautions that participants in outdoor activities should take: <blockquote>•&nbsp;wear a hat or cap to shade the head and back of the neck, particularly for long-duration activities such as 18 holes of golf or a marathon<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;keep your arms, torso, and, if possible, legs covered with pale-coloured clothing to reflect the light<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;apply a suitable barrier on exposed parts of the body (see <a href=""entry://sun-protection factor""><span class=""links"">sun-protection factor</span></a>)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;wear sunglasses which protect the eyes from damaging <small class=""smCap"">UV</small> rays; this is especially important at high altitudes where <small class=""smCap"">UV</small> light is especially intense<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;exercise outdoors when the UV light is less intense, before 10 a.m. and after 4 p.m.<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;seek medical advice if any persistent sores develop or if moles change appearance.<br class=""nLine"" />

"undereating","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>undereating</b><div class=""content"">Eating less food than the body demands to maintain weight. Mild undereating is a necessary part of a planned weight-loss regime, but it should not be severe. It is important that undereating results in a lower calorie intake but not a reduction in essential nutrients (especially vitamins and minerals). This usually means reducing the fat content of meals. Once the ideal weight is achieved, the dieter should revert to a well-balanced maintenance diet. Prolonged or severe undereating results not only in weight loss but also potentially dangerous muscle wasting. It may also lead to metabolic and psychological disturbances. See also <a href=""entry://starvation""><span class=""links"">starvation</span></a>."
"underload principle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>underload principle</b><div class=""content"">A basic principle of training which states that if exercise intensity is regularly below the threshold to stimulate improvements, muscles will gradually become weaker and other training effects will be lost. It is summed up in the phrase ‘If you don't use it, you will lose it’."
"underweight","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>underweight</b><div class=""content"">A person is significantly underweight if he or she is more than 10 per cent below their optimal body weight. It must be stressed that this optimal weight varies from individual to individual (see <a href=""entry://ideal weight""><span class=""links"">ideal weight</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" /> Some people are constitutionally thin and their optimum weight will be lower than those who are more comfortable, fit, and healthy at a higher weight. Some athletes, such as long-distance runners, are thin by nature and suffer no ill-effects from being thin. However, such is the pressure for success in sport, that many athletes are unnaturally thin by design rather than by nature. Many exercisers, particularly young female runners and gymnasts, take great pains to keep their weight low. There is no doubt that their high power to weight ratio gives them a competitive advantage, but this may be at a cost to health if taken to extremes.<br class=""nLine"" /> An obsessive desire for thinness can lead to eating disorders. A survey of more than 4000 recreational runners found that 8 per cent of the men and 24 per cent of the women had attitudes to food similar to those of people suffering anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Many of the women had irregular periods (see <a href=""entry://amenorrhoea""><span class=""links"">amenorrhoea</span></a>) and, although weight-bearing exercise offers partial protection, some may be in danger of suffering brittle bone disease in later life (see <a href=""entry://osteoporosis""><span class=""links"">osteoporosis</span></a>). In addition, low food intake may result in malnourishment and all its attendant problems, including greater risk of sports injuries. Extreme underweight is often associated with an insufficient intake of the vitamins and minerals required to maintain health.<br class=""nLine"" /> If you are underweight, your first priority should be to ensure that you are obtaining adequate nutrients. If you wish to increase your weight to its ideal level, you should do this gradually. Aim to gain about 1 pound (0.5 kg) per week by increasing your intake of lean meat, complex carbohydrates, and low-fat dairy products. These foods, combined with a well-devised exercise programme, will help you gain muscle, not fat."

"unsaturated fat","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>unsaturated fat</b><div class=""content"">A fat which is not fully saturated with hydrogen. Each molecule contains at least one double bond between two carbon atoms because these carbon atoms have not combined with all the hydrogen atoms they could carry. They are more reactive than saturated fats and combine relatively easily with oxygen to become rancid.<br class=""nLine"" /> There are two main types of unsaturated fats: cis fats and trans fats. Cis fats have molecules with irregular shapes that do not allow them to pack closely together, consequently they are liquid at room temperature. Most natural vegetable oils contain cis fats. Trans fats form straight-chained molecules that can pack tightly together. Trans fats have properties similar to those of saturated fats, making them more harmful to health than cis fats. Butter, milk fat, and some vegetable oils that have been hydrogenated contain significant amounts of trans fats.

"Valsalva's manoeuvre","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Valsalva's manoeuvre</b><div class=""content"">A manœuvre first described by an Italian, A.M. Valsalva (1666&ndash;1723). It occurs when the breath is held while muscles in the abdomen and chest are contracted. The chest contents become compressed, increasing gas pressure in the cavity of the thorax and blood pressure in the blood vessels. When breathing is restarted, a reflex reaction causes the heart to slow down, sometimes resulting in dizziness and fainting. Weight-lifters may unintentionally perform a Valsalva's manoeuvre if they hold their breath during a lift. It can cause dizziness, blackouts, and inguinal hernias. This is why weight-lifters are instructed to breathe normally when performing their exercises and never to hold their breath. It is not unknown for children to perform the Valsalva manoeuvre intentionally in order to induce a fainting attack. They, and anyone else performing the manœuvre, should be strongly discouraged because the increase in intrathoracic pressure can provoke a heart attack in people with a weak heart."

"variable resistance exercise","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>variable resistance exercise</b><div class=""content"">An exercise, usually performed on a special machine, in which the resistance varies throughout the range of movement of the muscles involved. The ability of the muscles of a particular joint system to exert a force changes as the angles of the joint change. Thus the amount of resistance that can be moved is limited by the weakest point in the range of movement. Variable resistance exercise machines adjust the resistance to the muscle's ability to exert a force. It is claimed that these machines bring about a faster and greater increase of strength through the whole range of movement than exercises using a constant resistance."

<b>varicose veins</b>
<i>(varices)</i><div class=""content"">Veins, commonly in the legs, which have become distended and twisted as a result of weakening of their walls and valves. Because they protrude, they are ruptured relatively easily. Ruptured veins bleed heavily, but the application of firm pressure usually brings the bleeding under control quickly. Obese individuals, pregnant women, those who regularly stand for prolonged periods, and the physically inactive are particularly susceptible. As long as varicose veins are not associated with other symptoms that may indicate a more sinister condition, a controlled programme of physical exercise may improve circulation and benefit sufferers."

<b>vegan</b><div class=""content"">A person who eats only food of plant origin. Strict vegans eat no dairy products, eggs, or even honey. Their diet of cereals, vegetables, fruit, and nuts must provide all the essential nutrients. With careful planning this is possible, but there is a risk of vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> deficiency because no plants contain this vitamin. Vegans are usually advised to take B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> supplements made by bacterial fermentation.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>Spirulina</i>, a blue-green alga used as a staple food by the Aztecs of Mexico and by inhabitants around Lake Chad, Africa, is sold in some health food shops as a high-protein food supplement, rich in minerals and vitamins (including B<sub class=""ind>12</sub>). It is true that <i>Spirulina</i> contains B<sub class=""ind>12</sub>-related compounds that act as growth factors for <i>Lactobacillus</i> (the legal definition of vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub>), but these compounds do not appear to have B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> activity in humans; they may even act as antivitamins. Vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> activity obtained from some <i>Spirulina</i> extracts or concentrates may be due to contamination with faecal bacteria, some of which do form active vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub>. Vegans who use <i>Spirulina</i> as their source of B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> should be cautious.<br class=""nLine"" />Some vegans may also need zinc supplements if their diet has a high content of phytates, chemicals that can reduce the availability of zinc. Vegans who exercise a lot may be especially susceptible to a zinc deficiency because of large losses in sweat and urine. However, excessive zinc consumption can produce several harmful effects (including inhibition of copper absorption that can lead to anaemia), so zinc supplementation should not exceed 15 milligrams per day.<br class=""nLine"" />Most research indicates that vegans tend to be healthier than people who eat animal products. They also have a lower risk of heart disease, certain cancers, and metabolic and digestive disorders. See also <a href=""entry://vegetarian""><span class=""links"">vegetarian</span></a>."
"vegetarian","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vegetarian</b><div class=""content"">A person who does not eat meat. There are different degrees of vegetarianism, from strict vegans who omit all animal products from their diet to semi-vegetarians who eat some animal products. Pescovegetarians eat fish; lacto-vegetarians consume milk but not eggs; lacto-ovovegetarians consume both eggs and milk; and ovo-vegetarians eat eggs. So-called new vegetarians restrict their meat intake to the occasional fish or white meat (e.g. chicken) dish, but avoid red meat and processed foods.<br class=""nLine"" />There are many reasons for adopting a vegetarian diet. Some people are vegetarian for religious and cultural reasons; others avoid eating meat for ethical, environmental, or health reasons. Some people do not eat meat for the simple reason that they dislike the taste. The recent upsurge in interest in vegetarian diets has been fuelled by reports in the press about animal cruelty and the potential dangers of eating meat. Media reports associating red meat consumption with heart disease, or about mad cow disease (see <a href=""entry://bovine spongiform encephalopathy""><span class=""links"">bovine spongiform encephalopathy</span></a>), increase the number of converts to vegetarianism.<br class=""nLine"" />There is much debate about the nutritional adequacy of vegetarian diets, but it is not possible to say that they are all ‘good’ or ‘bad’ because they vary so much in nutrient composition. Nevertheless, well-planned vegetarian diets can provide adequate amounts of all the required nutrients and may be more beneficial to health than an omnivorous diet (studies in the United States indicate that vegetarians have heart attacks on average 10 years later in life than meat eaters). However, the diets of vegans have a greater risk of deficiencies and vegans have to be particularly careful to consume a variety of foods. Vegans may also need to supplement their diets with vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> and possibly calcium to ensure adequate intakes. Poor nutritional health in vegetarians does occur, but is usually a result of poor dietary planning.<br class=""nLine"" />It has been estimated recently that there are about 5 million vegetarians in the UK with a growing number of adherents under 16 years of age. The food industry is responding to the increased demand by providing a greater variety of highly nutritious, competitively priced, convenience foods for vegetarians. This is likely to encourage a further expansion in vegetarianism in the future."

"very low calorie diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>very low calorie diet</b><div class=""content"">A very low calorie diet (VLCD) provides less than 800 Calories per day. Some contain as little as 400 Calories. VLCDs were first introduced in the 1920s to replace fasting as a means of treating overweight people. Some take the form of a drink made from powder and water. So-called ‘liquid protein diets’ were freely available in the 1970s and gained considerable notoriety after they were linked to a number of deaths. It was discovered that the protein they contained was mainly collagen derived from cowhides. The diets were nutritionally inadequate. Deficiencies of certain essential amino acids and potassium were thought to have caused a loss of lean muscle mass, weakening of heart muscle, and heart irregularities which probably contributed to the death of at least 60 people in the United States. Such liquid protein diets are no longer generally available. Most modern VLCDs are designed to be nutritionally sound and provide the recommended daily intake of proteins, vitamins, and minerals to sustain health.<br class=""nLine"" />VLCDs can be dangerous if not used properly, or if taken by certain groups of people. Pregnant women and people with an eating disorder, psychiatric illness, a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart, liver, kidney, or gall bladder disease, should not use a VLCD. Children, breast-feeding women, and the elderly should only take one if medically advised to do so. The general consensus is that VLCDs are safe if used under medical supervision and that they should be used only by those who are medically classified as obese (i.e. have a body mass index of at least 31). Many doctors believe they should be used only by the morbidly obese (BMI greater than 40). In Canada, laws ensure that VLCDs can be used only with a medical prescription; similar laws are being considered in the United States. Potential side-effects, even when VLCDs are used under medical supervision, include gastro-intestinal problems, fatigue, and muscle cramping. The risk of suffering side-effects is reduced by drinking plenty of fluids (at least eight glasses a day).<br class=""nLine"" />VLCDs have high rates of short-term success, with the majority of dieters losing 9 kg (about 20 lb). However, people usually stick to the diets only for a short time. They lose weight rapidly, but fail to maintain the loss. One British survey of VLCD users found that less than 20 per cent stayed with the diet for more than two weeks. The better VLCDs include regimes of exercise, nutrition education, and support groups to increase their long-term effectiveness.<br class=""nLine"" />VLCDs include the Cambridge Diet or Cambridge Health Plan, which has been used by more than 15 million people worldwide (see <a href=""entry://Cambridge diet""><span class=""links"">Cambridge diet</span></a>)."

<b>viropause</b><div class=""content"">A term coined by the popular media for the mid-life changes experienced by some men between the ages of 35 and 45 years. These middle-aged men report that they feel depressed and lack vitality. They complain that their body fat increases and their physical capacity decreases. A few doctors have linked these changes to a critical period when testosterone levels decrease. They argue that the changes are physiological and equivalent to the female menopause (the viropause is sometimes called the ‘male menopause’). However, most experts believe that viropause is a myth. They believe that the reported changes are more psychological than physiological. Testosterone levels decline gradually with age and there is no critical drop."

"visualization","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>visualization</b>
<i>(imaging)</i><div class=""content"">A method of training and preparation for performing a physical activity. You create a vivid, controlled image of a situation and imagine yourself coping successfully with it. Before David Hemery won the gold medal for the 400 metres hurdles in the 1968 Mexico Olympics, he visualized himself running in every lane, and imagined how he would cope with the race under different circumstances, but in every instance he pictured himself winning the race. Psychologists believe that visualization establishes neural pathways in the brain which act as a blue-print to be followed in the actual performance. There are different types of visualization: in external imaging, you imagine that you are an external observer watching yourself perform; in internal imaging, you imagine how you would feel if you performed a particular skill successfully. One computer program available in the USA is designed to help people to visualize how they would like to perform a particular activity. Users can create and modify their own images on the computer screen. The images can then be fixed in the mind prior to visualization. European bobsleigh teams already use virtual reality-type techniques for practice runs.<br class=""nLine"" />You can test your powers of visualization by imagining an experience (e.g. making a successful putt at golf) and then rate the vividness of your images using the following scale: <center class=""centre""><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1""<tr><td>VIVIDNESS OF IMAGES</td><td>RATING</td></tr><tr><td>clear and vivid as the actual experience</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>moderately clear and vivid</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>not clear but recognizable</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>dim and hardly recognizable</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>thinking of experience but no image</td><td>1</td></tr></table></center> If your rating was poor, you can improve your powers of visualization by relaxing and clearing your mind. Sit in a comfortable chair and listen to the sounds around you before visualizing so that the sounds do not distract you during visualization."
"vital capacity","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vital capacity</b><div class=""content"">The maximal volume of air forcefully expelled from the lungs after a maximal inspiration. It is a measure of the maximum amount of air the lungs can breathe in or out. At rest, values vary from about 3.5&ndash;6.0 litres, according to age, sex, and height. Measurements of vital capacity are used as part of a fitness assessment. A person whose vital capacity is less than 75 per cent of the expected value, is generally advised to consult a doctor for further testing before exercising vigorously.

"vitamin","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vitamin</b><div class=""content"">One of a group of potent, non-protein, organic compounds required in small amounts for the maintenance of normal health and metabolic integrity. Deficiency leads to specific clinical signs that respond only to restoration of the vitamin. They are essential in the diet because they cannot be made in the body (with the exception of vitamin D and niacin). So far, 13 compounds have been classed as true vitamins. Several other substances, such as laetrile and pangamic acid, have been described as vitamins but these compounds do not meet the strict definition of a vitamin. Although vitamins form a diverse and chemically unrelated group, they are classified as fat-soluble vitamins or water-soluble vitamins.<blockquote>FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS•&nbsp;vitamin A (retinol; carotene is an important precursor of vitamin A)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;vitamin D (ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;vitamin E (tocopherol)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;vitamin K (phylloquinone from plants; menaquinone from gut bacteria)<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><blockquote>WATER-SOLUBLE VITAMINS•&nbsp;vitamin B<sub class=""ind>1</sub> (thiamin)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;vitamin B<sub class=""ind>2</sub> (riboflavin)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub> (pyridoxine)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> (cobalamin)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;niacin (nicotinic acid and nicotinamide)<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;pantothenic acid<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;biotin<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;folic acid<br class=""nLine"" />•&nbsp;vitamin C (ascorbic acid)<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote> Each vitamin has a specific function; one vitamin cannot substitute for another. Lack of any one vitamin in the diet leads to ill health and eventually a deficiency disease. In addition, many body functions require the interaction of several vitamins, and the lack of one may undermine the function of others.<br class=""nLine"" />The relationship between vitamin requirements and exercise is complex, and the subject of much debate. There is some dispute about whether active people require more of every type of vitamin. However, it is generally agreed that requirements of the B-complex vitamins, which play many diverse roles in energy metabolism, are directly related to calorie expenditures of up to 5000 Calories per day. On this basis, some coaches believe that very active people may need at least twice the recommended daily amounts of these vitamins. Many sports nutritionists maintain that this increased demand for vitamins can be satisfied by eating a well-balanced diet. They argue that, as energy expenditure increases, food intake and therefore vitamin intake will also increase. On the other hand, some coaches advocate the use of vitamin supplements, arguing that increased dietary intake alone cannot guarantee a sufficient vitamin intake. See also <a href=""entry://vitamin supplementation""><span class=""links"">vitamin supplementation</span></a>."
"vitamin A","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vitamin A</b>
<i>(retinol; carotene)</i><div class=""content"">A fat-soluble vitamin which helps with normal functioning of the mucus membranes of the eye and respiratory tract, and the formation of visual pigments in the eye. It is also essential for normal tissue growth and differentiation. Vitamin A can be manufactured in the body from beta-carotene, found in a variety of foods, particularly green vegetables and carrots. Vitamin A deficiency increases the risk of all infections, especially those of the respiratory, digestive, and urinogenital tracts, and causes a number eye disorders, including night blindness. It is the most prevalent vitamin deficiency, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. It is the commonest preventable cause of blindness in the world. However, in economically developed countries, most people can acquire adequate amounts from a well-balanced diet. There is little evidence to support the use of vitamin A supplements, even for athletes whose demands would be expected to be considerably higher than normal. Excessive intakes of vitamin A can lead to nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headaches, hairlessness, bone and joint pain, and bone fragility. (This toxicity applies only to preformed retinol; carotene is not toxic in excess.) Women who are, or might become, pregnant are advised not to take vitamin A supplements, unless advised to do so by their doctor. The safe upper limit in pregnancy (3300 micrograms per day) is considerably lower than for non-pregnant women (7500 micrograms per day) because there may be a risk to the developing baby.<br class=""nLine"" />The US Recommended Daily Allowance is 5000 IU or 750 microgram retinol equivalents (the UK adult Reference Nutrient Intake is 700 micrograms for males and 600 micrograms for females). A footballer, acting on the premise that more is better, attempted to improve his performance by consuming 100 000 IU of vitamin A a day in cod liver oil, liver, milk, and vitamin supplements. The huge amounts of vitamin A taken over a period of more than two months resulted in the footballer's legs swelling and becoming stiff, and his bones changing structure. Fortunately, the changes were reversed within a month of the diet being discontinued."
"vitamin B complex","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vitamin B complex</b><div class=""content"">A group of vitamins including thiamin (vitamin B<sub class=""ind>1</sub>), riboflavin (vitamin B<sub class=""ind>2</sub>), niacin, pyrodoxine (vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub>), pantothenic acid, folic acid, cobalamin (vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub>), and biotin. These vitamins play an essential role in the release of energy from food, making them of great interest to exercisers. Prolonged aerobic exercise depends on a sustained production of energy, so deficiencies impair endurance performance. However, there is no evidence for beneficial effects of supplements over and above the amounts required to prevent deficiency."
"vitamin B1","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vitamin B<sub class=""ind>1</sub></b>
<i>(aneurine, thiamin)</i><div class=""content"">A water-soluble vitamin first extracted and isolated from rice polishings. It is also found in lean meat, liver, eggs, wholegrains, and milk. It plays a very important role in releasing energy from foods rich in carbohydrates. Gross deficiency causes the potentially fatal disease known as beriberi. Mild deficiencies cause fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle weakness, and digestive disturbances. Deficiency is also associated with chronic alcohol abuse which may lead to derangement of the central nervous system, enlargement of the heart, and death by heart failure. Vitamin B<sub class=""ind>1</sub> is rapidly destroyed by heat and is stored in the body in very small amounts. In the UK, the Reference Nutrient Intake for adults is 1.0 mg each day for males and 0.8 mg for females. Physically active people may need more thiamin than inactive people. Increased intakes may also be required by those on high carbohydrate diets, during pregnancy, and in other stressful situations."
"vitamin B12","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub></b>
<i>(cobalamin; cyanocobalamin)</i><div class=""content"">A complex water-soluble vitamin containing cobalt. Vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> can be obtained from liver, fish, and some dairy products. It is the only member of the B complex that cannot be obtained from yeast. Vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> acts as a coenzyme. It is involved in DNA synthesis and the formation of red blood cells. Vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> and folic acid interact: deficiency of B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> leads to functional deficiency of folic acid. In addition, a glycoprotein (known as intrinsic factor) produced by the stomach is needed for absorption of Vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> across the membrane of the intestine into the bloodstream. Lack of B<sub class=""ind>12</sub>, or intrinsic factor, or folic acid, may cause pernicious anaemia and weight loss. Vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> is regarded as an ergogenic aid by many coaches who believe it improves energy metabolism in muscle cells. Supplementation, often by injection into the buttocks, is common even though most research has shown no significant benefits where a B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> deficiency does not exist. Toxic effects of vitamin B<sub class=""ind>12</sub> are virtually unknown, but allergic reactions occasionally occur from injections. In the UK, the Reference Nutrient Intake for adults is 1.5 micrograms per day."

<i>(riboflavin)</i><div class=""content"">A water-soluble vitamin present in the body as coenzymes which play a central role in releasing energy from food. It is obtained from a wide variety of foods including wholegrains, yeast, liver, eggs, and milk. Riboflavin is quickly decomposed by heat and when exposed to light it is converted to lumiflavin which destroys vitamin C. Thus milk left outside for long periods in bright sunlight will lose much of its riboflavin activity. The Reference Nutrient Intake (UK) ranges from 0.4 mg in babies to 1.6 mg in breast-feeding women. Deficiency causes ariboflavinosis, characterized by cracked skin and eye problems including blurred vision. Riboflavin is used as a food colouring agent; an example of a food additive that has a considerable beneficial effect."

<b>vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub></b>
<i>(pyridoxine)</i><div class=""content"">A water-soluble vitamin obtained from meat, poultry, and eggs. It acts as a co-enzyme to over 60 enzymes and plays a vital role in protein metabolism. Those on high protein diets may require more vitamin B<sub class=""ind>6</sub>. The vitamin is essential for efficient nerve and muscle function. It is also involved in the initial breakdown of glycogen, and in the formation of antibodies and haemoglobin. Deficiency, although relatively rare, causes nervous irritability, anaemia, convulsions in infants, and sores around the eyes and mouth in adults. Excessive intake results in depressed tendon reflexes and loss of sensation in the fingers and toes. Intakes greater than 500 mg per day are associated with permanent sensory nerve damage. In the UK, the adult Reference Nutrient Intake is 1.4 mg per day for males, and 1.2 mg per day for females."
"vitamin C","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vitamin C</b>
<i>(ascorbic acid)</i><div class=""content"">A water-soluble vitamin essential for the formation of collagen (a major component of skin, muscles, and bone) and the healthy functioning of tissues containing collagen. It is required for the repair of joint tissues which are often damaged during high levels of physical activity. Vitamin C acts as a stimulant for body defence mechanisms, and protects vitamin A, vitamin E, and dietary fats from oxidation (see <a href=""entry://antioxidant""><span class=""links"">antioxidants</span></a>). Vitamin C also plays an important role in the absorption of iron from plant foods. Mild deficiencies can cause fleeting joint pains, poor tooth and bone growth, poor wound healing, and an increased susceptibility to infection. The Nobel Prize winner, Linus Pauling, and others claimed that doses 10 to 100 times greater than normal are effective in preventing the common cold. This claim is still very controversial, but there is some evidence to support it. In the test-tube, vitamin C has been shown to detoxify histamine&mdash;a product of stress (including the common cold). It is not clear whether the vitamin has the same ability in a living person. An extreme deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. In the UK, the Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) is 40 mg per day for adults, but this should be increased for those under any stress and those who are physically active. The RNI for pregnant women is 50 mg per day, and for lactating mothers is 70 mg per day. The USA recommendations are higher.<br class=""nLine"" />Vitamin C toxicity is unlikely, therefore many coaches feel free to advocate substantial supplementation for athletes. The whole topic is controversial; there is little unequivocal research to support large supplementation, and there may be some problems not yet fully reported. Most nutritionists recommend taking vitamin C naturally in the diet rather than as artificial supplements. Vegetables (especially green peppers) and citrus fruits are good sources. The richest source is acerola cherry juice (3390 mg of vitamin C per 100 g of juice)."
"vitamin D","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vitamin D</b>
<i>(anti-rachitic factor)</i><div class=""content"">A fat-soluble vitamin that enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the intestine and, with parathyroid hormone, mobilizes their deposition in bones. Vitamin D is relatively stable when exposed to heat and light. It is stored in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the fatty tissue in the skin. Vitamin D occurs in two forms: vitamin D<sub class=""ind>2</sub> and vitamin D<sub class=""ind>3</sub>. Vitamin D<sub class=""ind>2</sub> (ergocalciferol or calciferol) is obtained in the diet from foods such as oily fish, eggs, and margarine. Vitamin D<sub class=""ind>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) is the main form of the vitamin and is produced in the skin by the action of ultraviolet light on another compound, 7-dehydrocholesterol. Vitamin D deficiency causes a loss of muscle tone, restlessness, and irritability. It also causes rickets in children, and demineralization and softening of the bones (osteomalacia) in adults.<br class=""nLine"" />In the UK, no Dietary Reference Values are given for adults with normal sunlight exposure because the main source of vitamin D is from the action of sunlight on skin. However, for those confined indoors during the winter months, the Reference Nutrient Intake is 10 micrograms for adults (18&ndash;65 years) and 7 micrograms for children. In the USA, a daily intake of 10 micrograms throughout life is recommended. As with vitamin A, vitamin D can be toxic if large amounts are consumed over a long period of time. Calcium may be deposited in the organs and soft tissues of the body damaging, for example, the kidneys. Vitamin D supplements have been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and they may reduce the risk of osteoporosis, but the evidence is conflicting: most studies show no benefit, and some even show an adverse effect. Nevertheless, vitamin D supplements in the elderly will prevent osteomalacia which may occur together with, or independently of, osteoporosis."
"vitamin deficiency disease","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vitamin deficiency disease</b><div class=""content"">A disease due to a lack of a vitamin in the body. It may be caused by a dietary deficiency or as a secondary disease associated with anorexia, vomiting, or diarrhoea. Vitamin deficiency disease may also result from the increased metabolic demands for vitamins imposed by fever or stress, including the stress of vigorous, prolonged physical exertion. A substance which interferes with the activity of a vitamin may also cause a deficiency disease.<br class=""nLine"" />It is now generally recognized that certain groups within the population have a greater risk of deficiency diseases because of their increased vitamin requirements. They include pregnant women, nursing mothers, those following a weight-reducing diet, convalescents, the elderly, athletes in hard training, and those in physically demanding jobs. These groups may benefit from carefully managed vitamin supplementation."
"vitamin E","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vitamin E</b>
<i>(anti-sterility factor; fertility vitamin)</i><div class=""content"">A group of related compounds called tocopherols which maintain the integrity of cell membranes. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and mutually protects vitamins A and C. Some coaches claim that it increases muscular development and function; this claim is hotly disputed, but there is considerable support for the suggestion that vitamin E reduces the oxygen requirements of muscles and so enhances performance. It has been suggested that physical endurance at high altitudes may be increased, and oxygen debt reduced, by taking 1200 IU of vitamin E per day. Such high doses can be toxic and should be taken only under medical supervision. Vitamin E is widely available in the diet. The richest sources include wheatgerm oil, sunflower oil, and roasted peanuts. Natural sources of Vitamin E are almost twice as potent as synthetic vitamin E. Natural and synthetic forms can be identified by subtle differences in the names of their main components: natural forms are known as ‘d-alpha tocopherol’ and the synthetic ones as ‘dl-alpha tocopherol’. Vitamin E deficiencies are rare, but when they do occur they may lead to destruction of red blood cells and anaemia. Deficiencies impair the reproductive ability of rats and causes muscle wasting in pigs, but vitamin E has no effect on human fertility or libido. There is a growing body of good evidence that vitamin E supplements may offer some protection against atherosclerosis and heart disease. It has also been suggested that supplements may reduce the risk of miscarriages, but this suggestion is disputed."

<b>vitamin K</b>
<i>(anti-haemorrhagic vitamin)</i><div class=""content"">A fat-soluble vitamin which occurs in two main forms: one of plant origin (phyto-menadione or phylloquinone), and the other of animal origin (menaquinone). Dietary sources include green leafy vegetables, some vegetable oils, and liver. Some vitamin K is derived from bacterial activity in the gut, but it is not clear how active this form of vitamin K is compared with phylloquinone. Bacterial synthesis is not adequate to maintain normal blood clotting if no phylloquinone is obtained from the diet. Vitamin K is needed to manufacture prothrombin, a substance essential for the normal clotting of blood. Deficiency is rare but may result from taking antibiotics which interfere with the activity of gut bacteria. Symptoms include easy bruising and prolonged clotting time, leading to excessive bleeding and haemorrhage."
"vitamin supplementation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>vitamin supplementation</b><div class=""content"">Additional vitamins taken to make up a deficit, to avoid a vitamin deficiency disease, or to enhance athletic performance. There is much controversy concerning the value of vitamin supplements as ergogenic aids. There is little evidence to support the notion that extra vitamins improve the physical performance of athletes already eating a balanced diet and not suffering from a vitamin deficiency. However, high doses of vitamins may improve athletic performance by acting as drugs in, as yet, undefined ways.<br class=""nLine"" />There is general agreement that physical activity increases vitamin requirement, but many sports nutritionists believe that the increased requirement can be satisfied by a balanced diet. As exercise increases, food intake will increase and so should vitamin intake if the right foods are eaten. Nevertheless, because the difference between success and failure in sport may be very finely balanced, many coaches like to ensure that their athletes are taking sufficient vitamins, particularly the energy-related B vitamins, and advocate moderate multi-vitamin supplementation. Those taking supplements should be aware of the risk of toxicity from overdoses. This especially applies to the vitamins A, B<sub class=""ind>6</sub>, D, and niacin. Vitamin B complex tablets, particularly those containing nicotinic acid, should not be taken immediately before a prolonged bout of exercise because nicotinic acid can impair endurance by preventing mobilization of free fatty acids used as an energy source."
"volleyball","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>volleyball</b><div class=""content"">Volleyball is a dynamic game requiring high levels of aerobic endurance, power, flexibility, speed, and agility. The most important of these is endurance, because without this a player is unable to maintain skill and effort throughout a game. A well-balanced training programme includes aerobic fitness (e.g. running), weight training, agility drills, and jump training (see <a href=""entry://plyometrics""><span class=""links"">plyometrics</span></a>) to provide the explosive power the game requires. Much of the formal training of a volleyball team focuses on court skills, technique, and strategy, leaving each player to take responsibility for developing individual fitness. However, it is essential for players to train for general fitness so that they can perform to their maximum ability and reduce the risk of injury. The shoulder is the part of the body most commonly injured in volleyball, followed by the back and ankle. The most common chronic ailment of volleyball players is probably inflammation of the tendon that crosses the kneecap. These injuries can be reduced by an adequate warm-up and a programme of good flexibility exercises."
"waist-hip ratio","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>waist-hip ratio</b><div class=""content"">The circumference of the body at the level of the navel divided by the circumference at the widest point around the buttocks. The waist-hip ratio is used as a convenient method of assessing the distribution of body fat. Men tend to have high ratios indicating that most fat is distributed around the waist; women have low ratios indicating fat distribution around the hips. These sex differences in fat distribution are thought to be due to hormonal effects during puberty. High oestrogen levels in women encourage the deposition of fat around the buttocks and hips, while high testosterone levels in men encourages deposition around the waist. Accumulation of fat around the waist increases the risk of certain diseases. Men with waist-hip ratios greater than 1.0, and women with ratios greater than 0.8, have an increased risk of cardiovascular illness.<br class=""nLine"" /> According to a theory supported by Professor Devendra Singh of the University of Texas, USA, the waist-hip ratio holds the key to sex appeal in women. Tests showed that women become more attractive to men as the waist becomes smaller in relation to the hip, with the ideal ratio in healthy premenopausal women being between 0.67 and 0.80. This belief was supported by studies of Ms America contestants and <i>Playboy</i> playmates between 1957 and 1987, all of whom had waist-hip ratios between 0.68 and 0.71. In addition to being a sexual attractant, the high stores of fat in the buttocks are used during the last stages of pregnancy and during breast-feeding to support the baby. Women with low waist-hip ratios also have a lower risk of heart disease and diabetes.

"walking","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>walking</b><div class=""content"">Walking is one of the most popular exercises. It has many benefits. It is a low-impact exercise with very little risk of injury; it requires the minimum of special equipment (good shoes and loose-fitting clothing are usually sufficient); the whole family can take part; and it has the added advantage of being socially acceptable for women and older people.<br class=""nLine"" /> Many people believe that only strenuous exercise has health benefits. This is not true. Exercise no more exhausting than a brisk walk can lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Walking about 10 miles (16 kilometres) per week at about 60 per cent maximum aerobic capacity, is enough for the heart to benefit, and, cardiologists estimate, may reduce the risk of heart attack by half.<br class=""nLine"" />Walking can improve aerobic fitness, as long as it is done fast enough. As you walk faster, you can expect to improve your aerobic fitness at a higher rate. Strolling at 20 minutes per mile pace is likely to improve your maximum aerobic capacity (VO<sub class=""ind>2</sub> max) by no more than 5 per cent; walking at 15 minutes per mile pace may almost double that improvement; and if you walk very fast (at 12 minutes per mile pace), your VO<sub class=""ind>2</sub> max may improve as much as 15 per cent. Benefits gained from fast walking can be as good as those derived from running, cycling, or swimming. Very fast walking is sometimes called power walking. Some people use hand weights to increase the resistance and to develop upper body muscles. These weights are generally not effective unless they are used in an exaggerated way that disturbs the stride pattern and increases the risk of injury.<br class=""nLine"" /> If you wish to walk to improve health: <blockquote>•&nbsp;walk at least three times a week<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;start with a 1 mile (1.6 km) and walk at a slow pace (20 minutes per mile)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;add a quarter of a mile (400 m) a week until you can walk three miles easily.<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><br class=""nLine"" /> This will be enough to improve your health, but if you wish to improve your aerobic fitness you will need to increase your pace gradually. Aim to do one of the three miles in 15 minutes, then two, and finally all three. When you have achieved this, aim to do one mile in 12 minutes, and so on. Be patient. It will take about six months before you feel the real benefits of your training."

"warm-up","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>warm-up</b><div class=""content"">A routine used before strenuous activity to attain optimal body temperature, and to prepare physically and mentally for the activity. Body temperature can be raised by aerobic activities called pulse raisers. These are usually followed by mobility exercises or callisthenics (gentle movements to loosen joints) and static stretching of all the major muscle groups. Warm-ups improve the body's ability to transport oxygen and fuel to active muscles, increase the speed of muscle contraction, and reduce the risk of muscle and joint injuries."
"water","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>water</b><div class=""content"">Water is the most abundant chemical in the body, making up roughly 60 per cent of body weight. It is an essential nutrient although it provides no energy. It has excellent solvent properties enabling it to act as a transport medium for many chemicals. It is involved in many chemical reactions including digestion of food.<br class=""nLine"" /> Evaporation of water as sweat is essential for cooling the body. However, failure to replace water losses results in dehydration. This can adversely affect physical performance even if relatively slight. Each 1 per cent loss of water results in a 2 per cent reduction in aerobic capacity. Water loss causes the heart rate to spiral upwards. A loss of 6 per cent of total body water is serious; and loss of more than 10 per cent can be fatal. The amount of water an individual drinks depends on water losses (see <a href=""entry://water replacement""><span class=""links"">water replacement</span></a>).<br class=""nLine"" />Hardness of water varies with geographical location. There is statistical evidence that heart disease is more common in areas with soft drinking water than in those with hard water. However, the link between type of water and heart disease is not proven.<br class=""nLine"" /> The quality of drinking water varies. In most areas of the USA and the UK, tap water is safe, but in some areas it can become contaminated with bacteria, nitrates, or other pollutants. Some people drink bottled water because they are worried about pollutants, but others drink it because they prefer the taste, or believe that bottled water has health-giving properties. Ironically, bottled water is not always healthy. Some contain high levels of sodium and the same pollutants as tap water."
"water balance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>water balance</b>
<i>(fluid balance)</i><div class=""content"">The relationship between the water taken into the body by all routes (e.g. food and drink) and the water lost by all routes (e.g. sweat, vomit, urine, and faeces). An inadequate water balance has immediate and serious debilitating effects on physical activity. See also <a href=""entry://dehydration""><span class=""links"">dehydration</span></a> and <a href=""entry://water intoxication""><span class=""links"">water intoxication</span></a>."
"water intoxication","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>water intoxication</b>
<i>(dilutional hyponatremia; hypotonic hydration)</i><div class=""content"">A condition of water imbalance which may result from a kidney disorder or from drinking large amounts of water in a short time. The water dilutes the fluid surrounding cells and causes them to swell. This may result in metabolic disorders, nausea, vomiting, muscular cramps, and, in extreme cases, death. In February 1995, a twenty-year-old man from Derby in the United Kingdom drank himself to death after taking a single tablet of the drug ecstasy. It was estimated that he drank 26 pints of water which, according to a pathologist, caused brain damage and death. Such extreme cases are very rare, but mild water intoxication can occur when people try to replenish fluid losses by drinking too much water, too quickly. See also <a href=""entry://hyponatremia""><span class=""links"">hyponatremia</span></a>."
"water replacement","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>water replacement</b><div class=""content"">To reduce the risk of dehydration, water should be replaced during vigorous physical exercises lasting more than about 50 minutes. Replacement is particularly important for children and adolescents because their body temperature rises faster than that of adults. The best form of replacement is a cold drink (8&ndash;13°C); low in sugars (sugar retards gastric emptying and inhibits the absorption of water); and with a salt concentration less than that of the body fluids. The main purpose of the salts is to speed up the transfer of water through the small intestine into the body. Water lost due to sweating during exercise results in weight loss, and a loss of muscle strength and endurance. As a rough guide, a person should drink two cups of fluid for every pound of weight lost. The rate of replacement should not exceed the maximum absorption rate (about 800 ml per hour).

"weight cycling","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>weight cycling</b><div class=""content"">A cycle of weight changes associated with alternating periods of dieting (restricted food intake) and periods of normal eating with weight gain. The basal metabolic rate (BMR, a measure of the body's energy consumption at complete rest) of people on a weight-loss diet is usually reduced. The body adapts to the lower intake of food by using the limited supply of energy more efficiently. It appears that this reduction in BMR is more pronounced in those who exhibit weight cycling, making it increasingly difficult to lose weight and much easier to regain it. There is also evidence that weight cycling over several years increases the risk of coronary heart disease. See also <a href=""entry://Yo-Yo diet""><span class=""links"">Yo-Yo diet</span></a>."
"weight training","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>weight training</b><div class=""content"">A form of strength training involving the use of either free weights or a weight-training machine. There are many weight-training systems including the blitz system, burns, pyramid system, multi-set system, superset system, and multi-poundage system. In addition, there is a long list of weight-training exercises which train specific muscles or muscle groups.<br class=""nLine"" /> Pumping iron is no longer the preserve of the young. It has been shown that pensioners can benefit from regular weight-training sessions designed to improve leg strength. Weight training for 45 minutes every other day for 10 weeks, can double muscle strength, even in frail octogenarians. Weight training has helped older people walk more quickly and to climb stairs, and to discard the Zimmer frames on which they previously relied.<br class=""nLine"" />If you wish to start weight training, you should obtain proper instruction from a qualified trainer. You should also be confident that you can cope with strenuous physical exertion. If you have been inactive or ill, see your doctor to obtain approval. The following are some other guidelines to help you train safely: <blockquote>•&nbsp;plan ahead what you want to do; set achievable goals<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;warm-up for at least 5 minutes before you start a session and cool down afterwards<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;incorporate slow, static stretches in your routines<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;start your session slowly with light weights<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;position yourself properly; e.g. when standing and lifting free weights<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote>

"weight-gain diet","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>weight-gain diet</b><div class=""content"">Theoretically, to put on weight, a person should eat about 500 Calories more each day than are required to maintain a constant weight. In practice, some people put on weight easily while others seem unable to gain weight even after eating extravagantly over a long period. A healthy weight-gain diet is usually low in fats and not especially high in proteins. Most of the extra calories should be in the form of carbohydrates which will provide the energy required for muscle growth. Excess protein is not stored as muscle. Muscles grow only in response to increased demands of exercise. Specific exercises, such as weight training, should be performed to ensure that the diet promotes muscle growth rather than fat deposition.

"weight-loss maintenance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>weight-loss maintenance</b><div class=""content"">Maintenance of a relatively constant body weight after a successful weight-loss programme. It is relatively easy to lose weight, but much more difficult to maintain the weight at a lower level. Most dieters return to their original weight within one year. Weight-loss maintenance is easier if dieters adopt exercise as part of their lifestyle. It is also more likely if dieters have lost weight slowly and steadily. Dieters should aim to lose about 1&ndash;2 lb (0.5&ndash;1.0 kg) per week. Successful weight-loss maintenance usually requires considerable effort in planning balanced, nutritious, and interesting meals. The following tips may help you maintain your ideal weight: <blockquote>•&nbsp;weigh yourself regularly (once a week), but do not worry about fluctuations of a few pounds, this may be due to variations in water retention<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;plan your meals and try to eat only at meal times<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;have at least three meals each day<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;choose foods with a high nutrient density<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;keep an eating diary recording when and what foods are eaten<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;have a good breakfast and avoid eating heavy meals in the evening<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;if you need to have a snack, eat fruit or other nutrient-rich foods rather than sweets which contain empty calories<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;avoid foods with a high fat content<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;eat plenty of complex carbohydrates, such as wholewheat pasta, wholemeal bread, and jacket potatoes<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;cut down sugar intake<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;include small portions of favourite foods on a regular basis<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;drink plenty of watery fluids (about eight glasses of water each day)<br class=""nLine"" /> •&nbsp;exercise regularly (for example, by walking briskly for 20 minutes each day).<br class=""nLine"" /></blockquote><br class=""nLine"" /> Once an ideal weight is achieved, it is just as important not to allow it to go down as it is to prevent it from going up."
"weight-training machine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>weight-training machine</b><div class=""content"">A specialized device that provides support for a person trying to overcome a resistance. Weight-training machines can be designed to produce resistances at a particular angle of pull for a specific muscle, or to provide variable resistances for isokinetic exercises which are performed at a constant speed. There have been claims that these machines bring about faster and greater increases in strength than other types of weight training. Although this may be true in some cases, most exercise physiologists agree that each type of training method has advantages and disadvantages, and as long as basic training principles (particularly the overload principle) are adhered to, it is possible to make strength gains using machines or free weights."
"whiplash injury","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>whiplash injury</b><div class=""content"">Damage to the nerves and ligaments in the neck caused by a sudden, uncontrolled, and usually unexpected movement of the head. Players of rugby and American football may sustain a whiplash injury when tackled by two players simultaneously, one at the back and the other at the front. Rear-end vehicle collisions are notorious for causing neck strains as the vulnerable neck vertebrae are first extended and then fully flexed. Treatment usually includes wearing a restricting neck collar. Neck injuries should always be treated with great respect and, with the exception of obviously minor injuries, medical advice should be sought to ensure there is no serious injury. The risk of serious injury from a whiplash can be reduced by adherence to the rules (for example, no high tackles in rugby), wearing appropriate protective equipment, and special strength training for the neck."

Although there is only a little evidence that taking extra zinc can improve athletic performance, some weight-lifters take zinc supplements in the belief that it increases stamina by prolonging muscle contractions.<br class=""nLine"" />Zinc deficiency may cause loss of taste and smell, and a reduction of appetite. A deficiency can slow down the healing of wounds (zinc oxide ointment is applied to abrasions to accelerate healing), retard growth in children, and reduce the sperm count of adult males (the concentration of zinc in semen is 100 times greater than in the blood plasma).<br class=""nLine"" />The US recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adults is 15 mg for males and 12 mg for females. The UK Reference Nutrient Intake for adults is 9.5 mg for males and 7.0 mg for females (lactating mothers require higher amounts). Zinc can be obtained from seafood (especially oysters and other shellfish), cereal crops, legumes, wheat germ, and yeast products. Zinc may bind to some constituents of dietary fibre, interfering with its absorption from the gut. Consequently, vegetarians may require a higher than normal intake of this element. As zinc is lost in urine and sweat, exercisers (especially those who train intensively) may also need zinc supplementation. However, zinc supplementation should not exceed the RDA because excessive amounts can have harmful effects including inhibition of copper absorption, which may lead to anaemia."
