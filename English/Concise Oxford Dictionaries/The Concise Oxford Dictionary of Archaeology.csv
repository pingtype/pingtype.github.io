<span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A method for detecting atoms of specific elements according to their atomic weights.

Here, the addition of a series of magnetic lenses and a high-voltage ‘accelerator’ to a mass spectrometer allows <sup class=""expo"">14</sup>C atoms to be detected in an ancient sample and the amount present determined in a matter of minutes. The technique provides an alternative to the conventional approach which relies on measuring the decay of <sup class=""expo"">14</sup>C in a sample over a defined period (usually weeks or months). In addition to being relatively quick, AMS determinations can be made on far smaller samples of carbon (1 mg), allowing, for example, the dating of individual cereal grains.

Notable later rulers of the Achaemenids include Cyrus II (559&ndash;530 bc), Darius (522&ndash;486 bc), and Xerxes I (485&ndash;465 bc). The Achaemenid period was an important one for Iranian civilization and was one of the richest in terms of contacts between the classical world and the Near East. It saw the appearance and spread of Zoroastrianism, and some spectacular architecture at, for example, Darius' capital at Persepolis. However, tensions between the Achaemenids and the Greeks were always in the background, and erupted into several key battles: Darius was defeated by the Greeks at Marathon in 490 bc and the same fate befell Xerxes ten years later. In 330 bc Alexander the Great conquered and destroyed the Achaemenid empire."

<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A group of related native American cultures of the early Woodland period centred on the Ohio area of the USA and dating to the period 1000 bc to 100 bc. Named after the type-site of Adena, these communities lived in small villages, perhaps seasonally, supported by an essentially hunter-gatherer economy with limited small-scale horticultural use of sunflowers, marsh elder, squashes, and gourds. Distinctive material culture includes cord-decorated pottery, engraved stone tablets (‘birdstones’ and ‘boatstones’), and ornamented smoking tubes. Copper bracelets, beads, crescents, axes and other items were imported from areas around Lake Superior. Drawing on earlier prototypes, the most impressive and distinctive Adena constructions after about 500 bc were the burial mounds, of which several types have been found. Important individuals were typically interred in log-lined tombs which were burnt and then covered by a conical earth mound up to 20m high. In other cases corpses were cremated in a clay oven and the remains then buried under a mound. Elaborate grave goods were often placed with the dead. Adena earthworks also included large geometrically shaped ceremonial constructions and circles. One of the best known is the Great Serpent Mound, Ohio. Adena Complex groups were locally ancestral to the <a href=""entry://Hopewellian Culture""><span class=""links"">HOPEWELLIAN CULTURE</span></a>."

In the early part of the phase there is little evidence for the use of plant resources; the exploitation of the valley seems to have involved small mobile hunting groups. About 8000 bc, horse, antelope, and several other animal species became extinct, perhaps because of over-hunting, forcing the population to greater reliance on plant food."

The cultural sequence begins at about 8000 bc and runs through for about two millennia, spanning the period when farming developed in the region. In the earliest, Bus Mordeh, phase (<i>c.</i>8000&ndash;7000 bc) the settlement comprised simple rectangular houses built of mud brick. The occupants lived through a combination of simple farming, hunting, and gathering. Domesticates included herded sheep and goats together with hulled barley, and emmer and einkorn wheat. The inhabitants collected a wide range of plants and also fished. In the succeeding Ali Kosh Phase (<i>c.</i>7000&ndash;6200 bc) the same range of domesticates were found and some hunting and fishing still occurred, but the contribution made by wild plants decreased dramatically as the use of cultivated plants increased. The settlement was larger, with more substantial buildings. In the third, Muhammad Jaffar, phase (<i>c.</i>6200&ndash;5800 bc) there were further innovations, including the introduction of pottery, and farming had become firmly established.

<b>amino-acid racemization</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A biological dating method used on human and animal bone and carbonate shells. Within living organisms amino acids are molecularly structured in what is known as the L-isomer configuration, but at death they restructure to what is known as the D-isomer configuration through a process known as racemization. This restructuring takes place relatively slowly, so that from a zero point at the time of death the D/L ratio gradually increases so that equilibrium is reached after anything from 150000 years to more than 2 million years. The main problem with the technique is that the rate of racemization varies according to temperature and groundwater conditions so that regional differences according to latitude can be seen as well as, over long periods, uneven rates of change through time. This means that turning the D/L ratios into absolute ages is difficult, although as data about a particular area is built up fairly reasonable sequences can be developed."

<div class=""content"">A large two-handled ceramic jar with narrow neck and pointed or rounded base. Used for the storage and transportation of liquid commodities such as wine, olive oil, and fish sauce around the ancient world. One of the most abundant forms of finds in Roman and later sites. The earliest amphorae, known as Canaanite jars, originated on the Lebanese&ndash;Syrian coast in the 15th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. The latest amphorae date to the 7th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, by which time wooden and skin containers seem to have taken over the traditional roles. The study of amphorae is facilitated by the distinctive typological form of vessels from different areas and of different dates. Petrological work also helps with the definition of sources for vessels found at the end of their journey as containers. Stamps and painted inscriptions (<i>tituli picti</i>) assist in the recognition of the original contents.<br class=""nLine"" />Several classificatory schemes have been proposed for amphorae, most notably by Dressel in 1899 who illustrated 45 main forms (D1&ndash;D45). Pélichet (1946) and Almagro (1955) added further forms to the list, while Schumacher (1936), Callender (1965), and Lamboglia (1955) have attempted to group the basic types into broad groups. Most recently, David Peacock and David Williams have provided a new classification based on form and origin (based on petrological work) with 66 classes. The more common classes can be summarized as follows (with Dressel numbers in brackets): 1. brindisc amphorae from Apani, Italy&mdash;olive oil; 2. Greco-Italic amphorae from a range of sources in Sicily, Corsica, Spain, and the Aegean&mdash;probably wine; 3. (D1A) from Campania, Latium, and Etruria in Italy&mdash;wine and occasionally shells, resin, and hazel nuts; 5. (D1C) from Campania and Etruria&mdash;wines and olives; 6. (D1) from Catalan coast of Spain and ?Aspiran, France&mdash;wine; 7. (D21&ndash;22) possibly from Campania and Lazio, Italy&mdash;fruit; 8. (D6) from Apulia and Istrian peninsula of Yugoslavia&mdash;mainly olive oil; 9. Rhodian amphorae from Rhodes&mdash;wine and sometimes figs; 10. Greco-Roman amphorae (D2&ndash;4) from a range of sources in Campania, Latium, and Etruria, Italy, Catalonia and Baetica in Spain, southern and central France, and perhaps Brockley Hill in England&mdash;mainly wine, sometimes figs and fish sauce; 14. (D12) southern Spain and used for fish-based products; 16. (D7&ndash;11) from southern Spain&mdash;fish sauce; 24. (D25) southern Spain, possibly olive oil; 25.

<b>Anasazi</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A regional cultural grouping of peoples living along the Arizona&ndash;Utah borderlands of the USA, emerging within the Basketmaker Phase defined in the prehistory of the southwestern part of North America. Dating to <i>c.</i>ad 400&ndash;1300, the Anasazi tradition is the largest cultural grouping of the period and covers the northwestern quarter of New Mexico, much of southwestern and western Colorado, the northern half of Arizona, and most of Utah: an area known as the ‘Four Corners’. Much of this area has inadequate rainfall for the size of populations involved and some basic irrigation measures were used, although not extensively. Alongside agriculture, hunting and the collecting of wild foodstuffs was also practised. Ceremonial centres near the settlements remained important. Exchange links with Mississippian Cultures are evident from, among other things, similarities in the form of some ceramic containers. The distinctive characteristics of the Anasazi tradition developed during the Basketmaker III Phase (ad 450&ndash;750). Beans were added to the diet and communities became more committed to agriculture. Domesticated turkeys were introduced to supplement deer and rabbit meat obtained through hunting and trapping. A sophisticated ceramic technology developed with the resultant bowls and jars often internally decorated with black painted geometric patterns. There was also a transition from scattered village life to nucleated settlements. At first these comprised pit-houses with domed roofs and a central hearth.<br class=""nLine"" />After ad 750, in the Pueblo I and II Phases, the size of the settlements increased considerably. These large settlements or ‘pueblos’ comprised multi-storey and multi-roomed houses, some with over 100 rooms and constructed from masonry. By about ad 1300 many of the classic sites of this culture had been abandoned, perhaps because of climatic factors, erosion, intergroup conflicts, or demographic changes. One theory holds that Anasazi communities migrated away from their former homeland."

The main frontier comprises a stone foundation about 4.3m wide on which stood a turf bank up to 3m high, fronted by a berm and a ditch normally about 12m wide and 3m deep. The boundary was built by troops from all three legions in Britannia at the time: the II Augusta, the VI Vitrix, and the XX Valeria Vitrix. Forts were constructed at intervals of about 3km, nineteen of them in all, attached to the back of the wall, many with annexes to the south for storage. A road, the Military Way, linked the forts. Signal stations were also built between some forts. The Antonine Wall succeeded Hadrian's Wall as the northern frontier of Britannia in ad 143, but was abandoned in ad 158 following a retreat southwards to Hadrian's Wall. After some limited re-use the Antonine Wall was finally abandoned by ad 214.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: J. F. Keppe and J. F.

Perhaps the most important finds from the city relate to the cemeteries, which included over a dozen royal tombs. Each consists of a large square pit 14m across and 4m deep entered by either two or four ramps. At the centre an inner pit contained the body of the king set in a large wooden coffin. A small pit below the coffin held the bones of a dog. Around the central burial pit and on the ramps there were placed many grave goods and the bodies of the king's retinue (men and horses). Around the tomb, excavations have revealed numerous smaller pit graves and these seem to represent the accumulation of burials over a long period after the central prestige grave had been completed.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: Li Chi, 1977, <i>Anyang: a chronicle of the discovery, excavation, and reconstruction of the ancient capital of the Chang Dynasty</i>.

<b>archaeology</b><i>(archeology)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[De].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Literally, ‘the study of ancient things’; the term archaeology has developed and grown to embrace a much wider set of meanings through common usage as the discipline itself has expanded and matured. Walter Taylor writing in 1948 was confidently able to assert that: ‘Archaeology is neither history nor anthropology. As an autonomous discipline, it consists of a method and a set of specialized techniques for the gathering or “production” of cultural information.’<br class=""nLine"" />Operationally, archaeology has come to mean the study of past human societies and their environments through the systematic recovery and analysis of material culture or physical remains. The primary aims of the discipline are thus: to recover, record, analyse, and classify archaeological material; to describe and interpret the patterns of human behaviours that led to its creation; and to explain or develop an understanding of the reasons for this behaviour. In Europe and the Old World archaeology has tended to focus on the material remains themselves (sites and monuments), the techniques of recovering material, and theoretical and philosophical underpinnings inherent to achieving its goals. In the New World attention is directed more towards the subject matter and past human societies, and as such is considered one of the four fields of <a href=""entry://anthropology""><span class=""links"">ANTHROPOLOGY</span></a>. In both traditions, the attainment of a broadly based archaeology involves multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary endeavour, and it can fairly be said that the discipline of archaeology is a broad church embracing an increasingly large number of different subdiscipline areas or branches.<br class=""nLine"" />Originally, archaeology was a descriptive science, documenting, defining, and classifying everything it came across and mainly concerned with the material itself. This developed into an explanatory discipline where interest focused on understanding the causes behind the patterns and the reasons for what could be observed with a consequent obsession with the processes and the methodology whether at the practical level or the theoretical level. Increasingly, attention is being directed to what archaeologists actually produce, the end result of their labours, with an inevitable swing towards concerns over the nature of discourse and the production of knowledge."
"archaeomagnetic dating","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>archaeomagnetic dating</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ge].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A method of determining absolute dates for certain kinds of archaeological materials, particularly in-situ hearths, kilns, and furnaces. The method works because the materials used to construct these facilities contain fine particles of iron-rich elements such as haematite. When these materials are heated above about 650°C (the Curie point) all previous alignments in the magnetic particles are destroyed, and as the material cools the particles realign themselves on the Earth's natural magnetic field. Since the prevailing magnetic field moves over the course of time, local and regional sequences in the pattern of magnetic declination, dip, and intensity can be established and in-situ remains related to it to show when the last major episode of heating took place. The technique is very sensitive and can sometimes be used to show the time lapse between the inner and outer walls of a long-lived kiln or furnace.

<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">The second of five general cultural stages proposed by G. Willey and P. Phillips in 1958 as a framework for the study of ancient communities in the Americas. The Archaic Stage (which in the original scheme succeeded the <a href=""entry://Lithic""><span class=""links"">LITHIC</span></a>) embraced all the post-Pleistocene hunter-gatherer communities from the period after about 8000 bc. The Archaic Stage ends when sedentary agriculture becomes the main means of subsistence; its duration is therefore subject to considerable local variation.<br class=""nLine"" />The Archaic Stage is characterized by subsistence economies based on sedentary resources such as nuts, seeds, and shellfish, and a closer adjustment to the forest or desert environment. As a general term still in regular use, the Archaic Stage covers a series of local and regional traditions and the cultures they embrace.<br class=""nLine"" />On the west coast of North America the early, middle, and late phases within the Archaic are defined, each with numerous local variations, but extending down to modern times. In the Great Basin and western interior, the Archaic is usually divided into the early Desert Archaic, middle Archaic, and late Archaic, again extending in a continuous series down to modern times.

Stone tools include delicately made blades, microburins, burins, scrapers, and adzes. The most important innovation they brought to North America was the bow and arrow. Bifacially worked projectile points were made to tip the wooden arrowshafts. The main quarry was caribou and waterfowl.<br class=""nLine"" />Settlements were often small, represented archaeologically by stone scatters and traces of a tented encampment. More permanent structures in the form of square semi-subterranean houses are known where settlements take advantage of especially abundant food resources.

Born in Lichfield he became a solicitor in 1638 before embracing the Royalist cause in the Civil War. In 1644 he was appointed by the king as commissioner of excise in Lichfield, which led to him to Oxford where the Royalist parliament sat. He entered Brasenose College to study physics and mathematics, but further changes of employment took him to Worcester and London. Following the Restoration he was appointed Windsor herald and from that time he developed his antiquarian interests alongside increasing influence at court. In a life full of twists and turns he inherited from John Tradescant (Keeper of the Botanic Garden at Chelsea) a collection of antiquities and in 1677 he determined to give the collection, plus his own additions, to the University of Oxford on condition that they find a suitable building for it. This was agreed and the building opened in 1682, Dr Plot being appointed its curator. At least twelve wagon-loads of material were taken to the museum. In 1690 the university conferred on Ashmole the degree of MD and in turn he bequeathed his library to them. The Ashmolean Museum, though really formed by Tradescant, has secured its donor a celebrity that remains today.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: <i>Dictionary of British biography: earliest times to 1900</i>, 644&ndash;6]</div>"

Numerous excavations and surveys have been carried out in the city, the biggest programme of work in the late 20th century being that connected with the construction of a metro.<br class=""nLine"" />Traces of occupation in late Neolithic and Mycenaean times have been found, but it is from the 7th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> onwards that the town develops into a major city-state and enters a period of alternating phases of success and failure that lasts down to Roman times. Amongst the first buildings to be set out in the new Hellenistic city were the agora and the monumental temples on the <a href=""entry://acropolis""><span class=""links"">ACROPOLIS</span></a>. At the same time Athenian black-figure ware of high artistic quality was developed and came to be widely traded in the Mediterranean world. Red-figure ware succeeded it from about 500 bc. The sack of Athens by the Persians in 480 bc provided a major setback with most of the major buildings and structures flattened. Outstanding buildings constructed in the 5th-century rebirth of Athens include the <a href=""entry://Parthenon, Athens, Greece""><span class=""links"">PARTHENON</span></a> and Erechtheum on the acropolis. After the defeat of Athens by Sparta in the Peloponnesian Wars (432&ndash;404 bc) building nearly ceased again, but from the early 4th century new private finances were found and the city again entered a period of prosperity. This tradition continued down the centuries: the east side of the agora was filled with a stoa financed by Attalos, king of Pergamum, in the 2nd century, while, for example, Ptolemy VI, the Roman emperor Hadrian, and others built libraries.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: J.

Born in Dorset and educated at Sherborne School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read PPE. As a Quaker he was a non-combatant during WW2, employed instead on ditch-digging and hospital duties. In 1944 he returned to Oxford as Assistant Keeper of Archaeology in the Ashmolean Museum. Almost immediately he began excavating at Dorchester-on-Thames, later with help from Stuart Piggott . In 1949 he was appointed to a lectureship in archaeology at Edinburgh University, and in 1958 became the first Professor of Archaeology at Cardiff where he remained until his retirement in 1983. Throughout these years he was active in the field, excavating at Stonehenge in 1953&ndash;6, the West Kennet long barrow with Piggott in 1955&ndash;6, and at Wayland's Smithy in 1962&ndash;3. In 1968&ndash;9 he undertook an examination of Silbury Hill under the watchful eye of the BBC television cameras. University administration was a call on his time later in life: between 1966 and 1970 he was Dean of Arts at Cardiff and between 1970 and 1974 he was Vice-Principal of the University.

The thread is twisted into the ground, thus drilling a hole (typically 2&ndash;4 cm in diameter) while trapping the deposit being drilled through in the thread. By repeatedly drilling in and pulling out the auger a sample of deposit can be examined. For shallow holes a <i>posthole auger</i>, either hand-powered or attached to the power takeoff on a Land Rover or similar vehicle, provides a good and quick glimpse of what is below the ground. A <i>gouge auger</i> is similar, but instead of a screw thread there is a sharp-ended tube with a slot cut in the side. This can be pushed into the ground, twisted, and then carefully extracted with a thin sample of the material through which the auger has passed trapped in the tube. For deep deposits of soft material where samples are needed, a <i>Hiller auger</i> can be used. This has a chamber at the end of the main shaft, and usually extension bars can be added to achieve depths of up to 20m."

<div class=""content"">The dominant polity of the late Post-Classic period in the densely populated Basin of Mexico, which came to control large areas of Mesoamerica north of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.<br class=""nLine"" />The origins of the Aztecs are bound up in the population movements of Toltec refugees and Chichimec immigrants settling in the Basin of Mexico around 1000 ad, each establishing itself as a tiny state whose ruling dynasties claimed descent from the Toltecs and adopted Toltec ideologies and divinely authorized kingship.<br class=""nLine"" />The Aztecs, also known as the Tenochca or Mexica, were the last Chichimec tribe to arrive, possibly forced to leave their home at Aztlan by drought or over-population. There was little available land for occupation and the Aztecs lived a peripatetic existence, periodically being moved on by one state after another appalled by their savage ways and liking for human sacrifice. Eventually, they settled on some uninhabited swampy islands near the western shore of Lake Texcoco where, according to legend, they saw a sign previously prophesied as indicating the site for their capital: an eagle with a snake in its beak sitting on a cactus. The twin Aztec towns of Tenochtitlán and Tlatelolco were founded in ad 1325 or ad 1345.<br class=""nLine"" />In ad 1367 the Aztecs started serving as mercenaries for the ruler of the Tepanec city-state of Azcapotzalco, then in competition with the rulers of Texcoco for recognition as paramount lords of new Chichimec states. Through a series of alliances and rebellions the Aztec cities grew larger and more wealthy, with the Aztecs themselves gradually accruing more and more power. In 1434 the rulers of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlán formed the so-called Triple Alliance with the rulers of Texcoco and Tlacopan. All the other small states in the Basin became tribute-paying vassals of the Alliance. By 1500 the Triple Alliance controlled an area of 200000 square kilometres and a population of perhaps 10 million. Aztec domination of the Alliance came in 1502.<br class=""nLine"" />The Aztecs invested much time and effort into the construction of their cities and the agricultural systems round about. The centre of Tenochtitlán was a sacred precinct dominated by a 60m high pyramid on which stood the temples of Tlaloc the rain god and Huitzilopochtli the war god. The precinct also included the priest's residence, a large ball court, and a <i>tzompantli</i> on which the skulls of many thousands of sacrificed victims were displayed. Surrounding the precinct were the palaces of Tenochtitlán's rulers, two major market-places, and, beyond these, the houses of the town's inhabitants.<br class=""nLine"" />Agriculture was intensive and heavily dependent on water control systems established in the Basin of Mexico by the Teotihuacan state. These water control systems were crucial both for irrigation and the draining of lakes. The Aztecs also made use of floating gardens by dredging lakes and piling the silt up to form raised surfaces.<br class=""nLine"" />Aztec society was stratified into three main classes: nobles (<i>pilli</i>), who were relatives of the king; commoners (<i>macehuales</i>), who belonged by birth to one of twenty clans; and displaced and conquered people (<i>mayeques</i>), who worked as tenants. Craftsmanship was important and Aztec artists excelled in stone sculpture. Other nations, particularly the Mixtec of Oaxaca were engaged to make featherwork, polychrome ceramics, superb gold jewellery, and intricate mosaics.<br class=""nLine"" />The Aztec state was a militaristic regime, constantly at war in order to conquer other states and force them to pay tribute, and as a way of obtaining captives to sacrifice.<br class=""nLine"" />The Aztecs inherited from the Toltec and the Maya the practice of human sacrifice. It was believed that the main Aztec deities, Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatlipoca, needed regular nourishment from the blood and heart of sacrificed victims in order to perpetuate the continued existence of the universe. Up to 15000 people a year were sacrificed, mainly by ripping out the beating heart of the victim who was stretched out on a stone in front of the temple of the god. High-status warriors, nobles, and priests ate the flesh of those sacrificed.<br class=""nLine"" />The Aztec empire came to an abrupt end on 13 August 1521 when Hernan Cortés and his Spanish <i>conquistadors</i> took the Aztec capital and its emperor Montechzuma (Montezuma) II."

<div class=""content"">Staple cereal of the Old World of the genus Hordeum. Two main groups are recognized.

Six-row barley (Hordeum hexastichum) derives from the wild Hordeum distichum whose distribution extended from China westwards to Egypt. Modern barley (Hordeum tetrastichum) is a development of the original domesticated six-row types. Wild barley is of hulled form with the seed firmly held in the glume with a fragile stalk attached to the ear. Domesticated barley has a stronger spike which does not break during harvesting and includes hulled forms as well as the rather easier to thresh, so-called free threshing, naked forms."

<div class=""content"">Late Archaic and Post-Archaic sedentary communities living in southwestern parts of North America between <i>c.</i>1000 bc and ad 750. Identified in the late 19th century and codified into three main phases by Alfred Kidder in 1927, it is now recognized that much of what was formerly classified as Basketmaker Tradition is more comfortably seen as belonging to more clearly identified traditions and cultures. Basketmaker Phase I, dated to <i>c.</i>1000&ndash;1 bc, is essentially the same as the Archaic; Phase II, <i>c.</i>ad 1&ndash;450 is the same as the Desert Archaic and represents the beginning a long-lived cultural tradition on the Colorado Plateau which is referred to as the <a href=""entry://Anasazi""><span class=""links"">ANASAZI</span></a> from the Navajo word for ‘ancient alien ones’.

<b>Bateman, Thomas</b> (1821&ndash;61) <span class=""red""><b><i>[Bi].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">British antiquarian well known for his exploits in excavating barrows in the Peak District of central England. Born in Rowsley, Derbyshire, Bateman began his antiquarian work at the age of three when he accompanied his father, William Bateman (1787&ndash;1835), on the excavation of a barrow. Both Thomas's parents died when he was young and he was brought up by his stern but wealthy grandfather. He began excavating barrows on his own account in, working assiduously over a period of about a decade. It seems that Bateman 1843 was a colourful character and throughout his early life carried on an affair with a young married woman, Mary Mason, setting up house with her in 1844. Things came to a head with the death of his grandfather in 1847 and the prospect of being disinherited. Thomas saved himself by marrying his housekeeper, Sarah Parker, after which he reverted to a life of unblemished respectability. In 1848 he published the results of his excavations as <i>Vestiges of the antiquities of Derbyshire</i> (London: J. R. Smith ). At this time he employed various excavators to work for him in order to speed the flow of antiquities to his blossoming museum. Two weeks before his death at the young age of 39 he published <i>Ten years' diggings</i> (1861, London: J. R. Smith ). He was buried at Middleton-by-Youlgrave in an impressive tomb, still visible today, with a stone replica of a Bronze Age urn on top.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: B. M.

Although common in literature of the 1960s through to the 1980s, such a date is fundamentally wrong because radiocarbon years are not the same as calendar years and thus such calculations have been made without subtracting like from like.

<br class=""nLine"" /><b>2</b> Specifically, a kind of late Neolithic and early Bronze Age ceramic vessel characteristic of the <a href=""entry://Beaker Culture""><span class=""links"">BEAKER CULTURE</span></a>. First defined by Lord <a href=""entry://Abercromby Lord John""><span class=""links"">ABERCROMBY</span></a> in the early 20th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, beaker pottery, also known as drinking cups by earlier scholars, is distinctive in its range of shapes and style of decoration. Three main forms are recognized&mdash;the bell beaker, the short-necked beaker, and the long-necked beaker&mdash;each with numerous variations.<br class=""nLine"" />Bell beakers are often decorated with twisted cord impressions across the whole outer surface and these are known as all-over-corded beakers (AOC beakers). Where the outer surface of a beaker is covered in decoration, whether corded or using comb-impressed motifs, they are referred to as all-over-ornamented (AOO) beakers. Some beakers have a single looped handle making a mug. In some cases the impressed decoration was inlaid with a white paste which, against the traditional red fabric of beaker ware, makes the decoration look all the more impressive. Beaker pottery is found from northern Scotland to North Africa and from western Spain across to western Russia. It is particularly common in the Low Countries and northern France, and a good case has been made for its development out of local protruding foot beaker wares in the lower Rhine valley during the later 3rd millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>.<br class=""nLine"" />There has been much debate about the topological development of beaker styles and the role of regional traditions in the evolution of the forms. In general, bell beakers appear to be the earliest and the most widely distributed common form, especially AOC types. They are sometimes known as maritime beakers, reflecting something of the distribution itself and the means of transportation by which the ideas behind their manufacture spread. In the traditional chrono-topological sequence, short-necked forms follow the bell beakers, with the long-necked forms following still later. However, through studies of the British material, Humphrey Case suggested in 1993 that these rather crude stereotypes masked a series of three rather more broadly definable ‘styles’ which were in fact used contemporaneously in different regions. In this model each area has its own trajectory of topological development but within the overall limits of its chosen style."

<b>Beaker Culture</b></b>
<i>(Beaker Folk)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A general term for widely scattered groups of late Neolithic and early Bronze Age communities of the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, whose material culture includes substantial amounts of <a href=""entry://beaker""><span class=""links"">BEAKER</span></a> pottery. The distribution of these communities is wide: from the North African coast in the south to Scotland in the north; and from Spain and Portugal in the west to the Dnieper in the Ukraine in the east. The greatest concentrations of beaker-using communities is in fertile agricultural regions, especially in the lower Rhine Valley and around the North Sea coastlands where they seem to have developed from the local protruding foot beaker corded ware ceramics.<br class=""nLine"" />Because of the ubiquity of beaker ceramics, their distinctive forms and fabrics, and the fact that in most parts of Europe they appear to contrast markedly with existing later Neolithic styles, diffusionist explanations seemed highly appropriate. During early decades of the 20th century this expanded to embrace not only the pottery, but also the spread of metalworking in northern Europe, links to preferred burial rites (well-furnished crouched single inhumations), the extensive use of round barrows over their burial places, and biometrical data suggestive of intrusive racial groups in some areas. Together these were seen as the Beaker Folk, described in 1940 by Gordon Childe as ‘warlike invaders imbued with domineering habits and an appreciation of metal weapons and ornaments which inspired them to impose sufficient political unity on their new domain for some economic unification to follow’.<br class=""nLine"" />Most of these connections can now be seen as erroneous, with beaker ceramics and certain aspects of the early metalworking traditions being added to rather than replacing local late Neolithic traditions. Following suggestions made in 1976 by Colin Burgess and Steven Shennan, what was once seen as a Beaker Culture is increasingly viewed as a ‘package’ in which exotic elements such as pottery (and maybe whatever was drunk from it) and new styles of metalwork were acquired and adapted by indigenous communities."

Certainly there are tribal names in central southern England that would support that. However, archaeologists have long searched without success for patterns in the distribution of material culture that would allow the movements of these people to be mapped. Some scholars from the time of Arthur Evans onwards have favoured identifying the Belgae with communities in Kent and the extreme southeast of England who used distinctive styles of pottery and are known as the Aylesford&ndash;Swarling Culture. The problem, however, is that nothing amongst the material culture of these areas pre-dates Caesar's visits to Britain in the mid 1st century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. Others see the term Belgae or Belgic as having little or no meaning in the British context.

<div class=""content"">An Italian popular entertainer and unprincipled collector of Egyptian antiquities who enriched many major European collections, including those of the British Museum. Born in Padua, Italy, he spent much of his early life travelling around Europe looking for work, appearing as a ‘strong man’ in theatrical performances. In Egypt he was given work developing irrigation schemes, but they were not popular with the Pasha and Belzoni found himself without money and employment. The British Consul suggested that he should collect antiquities for him, and between 1817 and 1819 Belzoni systematically looted tombs and monuments, causing many disputes with local landowners and rival Italian and French collectors. It is said that, in just two years, Belzoni did as much damage to Egypt's archaeological heritage as time alone had done over the previous 2000 years. Perhaps his best discovery was the tomb of Seti I in the <a href=""entry://Valley of the Kings, Egypt""><span class=""links"">VALLEY OF THE KINGS</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: S.

Born in Jauer, Silesia, his experience in the field began in 1907, when he assisted in excavations near Potsdam. In the following years he visited several European countries in an archaeological capacity. During WW1 he served in the Office for the Protection of Monuments and Collections on the western front and was later attached to the German Armistice and Peace delegations. In 1924 he began a long association with the Römisch-Germanischen Kommission (German Archaeological Institute) in Frankfurt-am-Main, becoming the second director in 1928 and the Director in 1931. Under his guidance the Institute took over new premises and became a centre for scholars from all over Europe to meet and discuss archaeological questions. In 1933 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1935 the Nazi government removed him from office and he began working overseas. He and his wife Maria moved to Britain and, at the invitation of the Prehistoric Society, he undertook a research excavation at Little Woodbury, Wiltshire, in (1938&ndash;9), introducing continental methods of excavation to the study of British prehistoric sites. During WW2 he was interned on the Isle of Man, but was allowed to continue his researches with the help of other internees, and between (1939 and 1945) he excavated a number of later prehistoric and Viking-age sites. After the war, in 1947, he was appointed to a Chair in the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin.

<div class=""content"">Extensive layers of peat and wetland vegetation that spread out across mainly upland landscapes, covering them like a blanket. Most blanket bog is <a href=""entry://ombrogenous bog""><span class=""links"">OMBROGENOUS BOG</span></a>, formed because of high rainfall on soils with poor drainage. It is likely that the drainage problem was, in many cases, caused by human over-exploitation of the area through woodland clearance and land-use practices that caused an iron-pan to develop at the base of the soil profile. In upland areas of the British Isles, especially in Ireland, blanket bog begins to form in later Neolithic times, earlier in localized areas, with very extensive tracts developing in the later Bronze Age. Archaeologically, blanket bog is important as a record of local environment and also because it preserves areas of landscape that were abandoned by their inhabitants."

<b>Byzantine empire</b></b>
<i>(Byzantium)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">The Byzantine empire started with the first Christian emperor of the eastern Roman empire, Constantine, in ad 330. At that time Byzantium was inaugurated as the new capital of the eastern empire and renamed Constantinople. In ad 392 the emperor Theodosius proclaimed Christianity to be the official religion of the Roman empire and on his death in ad 395 the empire was split between his two sons, never to be reunited. The eastern empire was ruled from Constantinople and developed as the Byzantine empire. The greatest Byzantine emperor was probably Justinian the Great who ruled from ad 527 to 565. He introduced a new legal system and expanded the boundaries of the empire as far west as Spain, Italy, and Africa. He encouraged the arts, a unique blend of late Roman and Greek influences, and commissioned the building of the great basilica of Haghia Sophia in Constantinople.<br class=""nLine"" />Following the death of the Prophet Mohammed in ad 632, Arab armies took Egypt, Syria, and Palestine from the Byzantines, and Constantinople was itself besieged from ad 674 to 678. It survived, but the empire was further reduced at this time by the loss of North Africa and Italy. It was brought to the brink of civil war by the Iconoclastic Crisis before enjoying another brief golden age under Basil II (ad 976&ndash;1025). But the empire's troubles increased as invaders made further incursions into Byzantine territory. In the 11th century the Seljuk Turks took large parts of Asia Minor and overran Anatolia, menacing Christian pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. Reluctantly the emperor, Alexius I, sought help from the Christian west and the First Crusade was organized to help the Byzantines recapture the Holy Land from Muslim forces. The result was victory for the Crusaders, but they were not so lucky in the Second and Third Crusades. The Fourth Crusade, launched in 1202, was partly inspired by the Vatican's jealousy of Byzantium's trading power. It soon became an excuse to plunder Constantinople itself, the Crusaders ruling the city from 1204 through to 1261. The rise of the Ottoman empire during the 14th century finally put an end to the Byzantines, the fall of Constantinople itself being in April 1453."

Herod the Great enlarged the city and rebuilt its harbour in a campaign of works starting in 22 bc, naming it Caesarea in honour of his patron Caesar Augustus when he inaugurated the town in 10 bc. An inscription that refers to Pontius Pilate is one of the best-known finds of this period. After Herod's death it became the Roman provincial capital of Judaea and was used as the headquarters for Vespasian's campaigns against Jewish revolts between ad 66 and ad 70. Over the next two centuries the town flourished and was a centre for both Christianity and Jewish thought and scholarship.

"calendar","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>calendar</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[De].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A formal system for measuring and documenting the passage of time. The basic unit of nearly all known calendars is the cyclical movement of the sun, giving the units known in the modern western world as days, and&mdash;rather less easy to gauge&mdash;the annual cycle or solar year. In ancient Egypt, for civil purposes, a solar calendar of 365 days to the year was used in which there were 12 months of 30 days and 5 intercalary days. For agricultural purposes, and for determining the timing of religious festivals, a second calendar was used, based on observations of the dog star Sirius (Sothis to the Egyptians). The annual heliacal rising (i.e. at the same time as the sun) usually preceded the Nile flood. The two calendars would coincide every 1460 years, a period known as the Sothic Cycle. The cycle of the moon provides a lunar month and this was used as the basis for the calendar in ancient Mesopotamia, where 12 months of 29.5 days were adjusted over 19 cycles to keep the calendar in step with solar years. How these basic units were divided, combined, and reconciled is culturally specific, and many different systems have been developed. All, however, fall into one of two main types.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>Linear calendars</i> start from a nominated moment and extend outwards from that time in an endless sequence of more or less equal sized repetitive units. The western Christian calendar takes as its origin a notional point considered to be the Incarnation of Christ and extends linearly forwards (years <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> from ad 1) and backwards (years <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> from 1 bc). The reckoning system was established by Julius Caesar who adapted the Egyptian solar calendar to Roman usage, inserting extra days in the shorter months to make 365 days over 12 months with the insertion of an additional day into February every four years. The naming of the years was first established in Italy in the 6th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> and based on the Julian calendar; it was later revised by Pope Gregory XIII in ad 1582 to provide the calendar used today, which is known as the Gregorian calendar (adopted by Act of Parliament in Britain in ad 1752). Other linear calendars were established in classical times and more recently, and include: a Roman calendar with a notional start date fixed as the founding of Rome in years AUC (<i>ab urbe condita</i>) which can be mapped onto the Gregorian calendar as starting in 753 bc; a Greek calendar with a notional start date fixed as the first Olympiad which maps onto the Gregorian calendar as 776 bc; and an Islamic calendar based on the flight of Mohammad from Mecca to Medina (the Hegira). Hegira year 1 (AH 1) maps onto the Gregorian calendar as ad 622 but Hegira years are lunar years with a mean length of 354.3 days.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>Cyclical calendars</i> use a floating starting position which is periodically returned to. One of the most common is with reference to the reign of a king, queen, or other official so that dates are given as the regnal year of that person. When the person is replaced the calendar starts again for the next person. Ancient Chinese societies used a cyclical calendar of 60 years, designated by two ideographs in a series which covers the whole 60-year period before starting again. The Mayan calendar was based on a 52-year cycle (known as the calendar round) which combined a 260-day almanac and a 365-day year. The use of this system carried with it a belief that events, including disasters, repeated themselves with each turn of the cycle.

This is especially important if radiocarbon determinations are to be compared with historically derived calendar dates, or dates determined by other means.<br class=""nLine"" />Laboratory determinations are given in radiocarbon years before present (RCYBP or BP), but radiocarbon years are not of equal length because of variations in the level of <sup class=""expo"">14</sup>C in the atmosphere in the past. Special corrections for the effects of certain factors that alter the background level of <sup class=""expo"">14</sup>C may also be necessary. Calibration is based on measurements of the <sup class=""expo"">14</sup>C levels in material of known age, principally samples of ancient wood taken from <a href=""entry://dendrochronology""><span class=""links"">DENDROCHRONOLOGICALLY</span></a> dated sequences. The earliest calibration curves, published in the mid 1970s, used samples from the bristlecone pine (Pinus aristat), an especially long-lived tree species that grows in the Sierra Nevada of California. During the 1980s and 1990s regional calibration curves were developed for different parts of the world based on local dendrochronological sequences. A number of excellent computer-based calibration programmes are available, including OxCal from the Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit in Oxford University, UK, and CALIB from the University of Washington in Seattle, USA. Both can be downloaded from the world wide web.<br class=""nLine"" />Calibrated radiocarbon ages are conventionally indicated by the abbreviations <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>/<small class=""smCap"">ad</small> or cal.<small class=""smCap"">bc</small>/cal.<small class=""smCap"">ad</small>. However, because the calibration process involves using the standard deviations provided by the laboratory for the original determination, the calibration of a specific determination will result in an age range, the width of which will depend on the size of the standard deviation, the level of certainty used (typically 66 per cent or 95 per cent based on one and two standard deviations respectively), and the nature of the calibration curve in the region covered by the initial determination. Thus, calibrated radiocarbon dates are usually given as a range, for example 2030&ndash;2125 bc, which if calibrated using a single place of standard deviation would mean that there was a 66 per cent probability that the actual date lies within that range. When citing dates it is standard practice to give the calibrated age, the original determination, and the laboratory code (e.g. 2472&ndash;2404 bc (3925 ± 35 RCYBP) OxA-5328). Within a book or academic paper all dates should be calibrated using the same procedures and the same calibration curve, and the parameters used should be summarized in the preface or some other convenient place.

<div class=""content"">A series of stone alignments and a <a href=""entry://stone circle""><span class=""links"">STONE CIRCLE</span></a> on the southern part of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of western Scotland. This complicated site was partly covered in up to 1.5m of peat until the late 19th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>. Investigations by Gerald and Margaret Ponting and excavations by Patrick Ashmore in 1980 and 1981 have revealed a great deal about the history of the site. Perhaps most surprising is that prior to the construction of the stone monuments the area had been farmed. In the early 3rd millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> a stone circle comprising thirteen pillars of local gneiss was built with a single large pillar in the centre. The circle is approached from the north by a stone <a href=""entry://avenue""><span class=""links"">AVENUE</span></a>, while single <a href=""entry://stone row""><span class=""links"">STONE ROWS</span></a> lead away to the west, south, and east. Some time after the circle and the alignments were built a small <a href=""entry://passage grave""><span class=""links"">PASSAGE GRAVE</span></a> was constructed between the pillars of the circle and the central standing stone on the east side. It has been suggested that Callanish incorporated a series of lunar alignments looking down the stone avenue through the circle onto the southern horizon when, every 18.6 years, the moon dances low over the hills to the south, sets, and then gleams brightly throwing the stones of the stone circle into silhouette as it passes a notch in the horizon.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: P.

<div class=""content"">British antiquary, historian, and traveller. Born in London the son of a painter, he attended St Paul's School and then proceeded to Oxford where he was a student at Broadgate Hall (later Pembroke College). About 1575 he became a master at Westminster School and remained there for the rest of his life. He was appointed headmaster in 1593. During his time at Oxford he made frequent excursions into the countryside to inspect antiquities of various sorts, encouraged by patrons such as Sir Philip Sydney and Fulke Greville . As a result he began making notes of his observations and discoveries, eventually becoming more familiar with the antiquities of the country than anyone else alive. This material was gathered together in his principal work, the <i>Britannia</i>, the first edition of which was published in 1586. It includes important early accounts of such major monuments as Stonehenge and Hadrian's Wall. His intension, expressed in the volume, was ‘to restore antiquity to Britain’.<br class=""nLine"" />The <i>Britannia</i> was revised and enlarged several times during Camden's lifetime, and after his death it continued to be modernized by a series of editors and translators, the most famous of which are Gibson (1695) and Gough (1789). County maps by Christopher Saton and John Norden accompanied the editions from 1607 onwards. Camden published a range of other works too and developed a notable reputation as a historian. He was encouraged in his work by King James I who gave access to state papers. In 1622 he founded a Chair in Civil History at Oxford University. Camden was a respected herald, being Clarenceux King-of-Arms from 1597 until his death. He is buried in Westminster Abbey.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: S.

Objects regarded as part of the Carp's Tongue Complex include the eponymous <a href=""entry://carp's tongue sword""><span class=""links"">CARP'S TONGUE SWORD</span></a>, bag-shaped chapes, triangular perforated knives, hog's back knives, socketed axes, end-winged axes, gouges, spearheads, and bugle-shaped objects of unknown purpose."

<b>Carter, Howard</b></b> (1873&ndash;1939) <span class=""red""><b><i>[Bi].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">British archaeologist famous for his discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen in Egypt. Born in Brompton, London, the last of eleven children, he spent his early years in Swaffam, Norfolk, although details of his schooling are uncertain. In 1891 he was offered employment at Didlington Hall, the country seat of William Amhurst Tyssen-Amherst, a well-known collector of Egyptian antiquities. It was this introduction to archaeology that set the course of the rest of Carter's life. From the early 1890s he was working as a draughtsman and copyist for Percy Newberry who was carrying out an archaeological survey of Egypt. In September 1891 he joined Newberry in Egypt and later went on to work with Sir Flinders Petrie at Amarna.<br class=""nLine"" />Through the mid 1890s Carter developed great proficiency as an excavator and site manager, as well as an illustrator and photographer. On 1 January 1900 he took up an appointment as chief inspector of antiquities in Upper Egypt and Nubia with an office in Luxor. His role was to safeguard the antiquities of the region and supervise all archaeological work carried out there. This he did efficiently, changing roles in 1904 to look after the monuments in Lower Egypt. Things here did not go so smoothly and after badly handling a tussle between some French tourists and Egyptian guards, and various brushes with officialdom, he resigned in 1905.<br class=""nLine"" />Over the next few years he supported himself as an artist and illustrator. In 1909, however, Carter joined Lord Carnarvon's expedition at Thebes, the pair working in the Theban necropolis and elsewhere down to WW1. During the war Carter worked as a civilian in the intelligence department of the War Office in Cairo. After the war he continued working for Lord Carnarvon, but the political situation so far as archaeological investigations in Egypt were concerned was getting worse, permits were increasingly difficult to get, and Carnarvon grew increasingly disenchanted. In 1922 it was understood that the partners would make one last try to reveal something really worthwhile. Working in the Valley of the Kings, Carter began clearing the area in front of the tomb of Ramesses VI, and in early November 1922 he discovered the sealed entrance to the tomb of Tutankhamen . Clearing and recording the tomb took until February 1932, during which time there was a great deal of squabbling and intrigue, and the death of Lord Carnarvon from blood poisoning in April 1923. Carter never full published the excavations, nor was he ever fully accepted by the establishment of the time. His health deteriorated in the late 1930s and he died of Hodgkin's disease.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: T. G. H. James, 1992, <i>Howard Carter. The path to Tutankhamen</i>.

"Carthage, Tunisia","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Carthage, Tunisia</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Ancient city and seaport on the coast of Tunisia northwest of modern Tunis. The site has been the subject of many extensive campaigns of investigation, most notably the UNESCO ‘Save Carthage’ campaign under the aegis of the Tunisian Institut National d'Archéologie et d'Art and the Conservateur du site de Carthage between 1972 and about 1980, which involved collaboration by archaeological teams from twelve countries. It is believed that the city was founded in 814 bc as a colony of the <a href=""entry://Phoenicians""><span class=""links"">PHOENICIAN</span></a> city of Tyre, but no archaeological remains have yet been found earlier than the later 8th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. There is no doubt, however, that the colony became very prosperous relatively quickly, overlooked the straits separating the eastern from the western Mediterranean and providing an ideal anchorage. When Tyre fell under the domination of Assyria, a Punic (western Phoenicians) trading empire was established based on the former Phoenician colonies in the western Mediterranean. From the 6th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> wealth was generated by merchants acting as middlemen, trade monopolies over certain products, and access to the mineral wealth of southwestern Spain. The town itself expanded through the intensive exploitation of the rich agricultural land along the North African coast. The new empire was constantly at war with the Greeks and later the Romans. Three great Punic Wars raged in the 3rd and 2nd century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. In 241 bc, at the end of the first Punic War, Carthage lost Scilly and Sardinia to Rome. From an enlarged domain that included southern Spain, however, the Carthaginian general Hannibal led his army across the Alps to attack Italy from the north in 218 bc. He was later recalled to Africa where he was defeated by Scipio Africanus at Zama in 202 bc. Carthage was finally destroyed by Roman forces under Scipio Aemilianus in 146 bc.<br class=""nLine"" />From 29 bc the city was rebuilt as a Roman colony (<i>colonia Iulia Concordia Karthago</i>) by Julius Caesar and his heir Octavius . The city again prospered and became a major trading port for grain and olive oil produced in North Africa. It eventually replaced Utica as the provincial capital of Roman North Africa, and by the 4th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> was the second largest city in the western empire after Rome itself. In the 4th and early 5th centuries it was a major centre for the early Christian church as it was home to St Augustine. The <a href=""entry://Vandals""><span class=""links"">VANDALS</span></a> took Carthage in ad 439, retaining control until the <a href=""entry://Byzantine empire""><span class=""links"">BYZANTINE</span></a> invasion of ad 533.

Excavating with Petrie at Abydos, Egypt, she later went on to conduct her own excavations at the predynastic village of North Sapur, Hemmamiya. Turning her attention to Africa she discovered a series of previously unrecorded Neolithic cultures living in the southern Saharan margins around Fayum Lake, work published as <i>The desert Fayum</i> (1934, London: Royal Anthropological Institute). In 1929 she began the first scientific investigation of the ruins at the Great Zimbabwe, firmly establishing that they had been built by an indigenous African culture in the period ad 1270 to ad 1450. Together with Miss E. W. Gardner she excavated at the Saharan Kharga Oasis and went on with Freya Stark to excavate later prehistoric sites in southern Arabia just before WW2. This was the last of her fieldwork, although later publications include <i>The tombs and moon temple of Hureidha (Hadhramaut)</i> (1944, London: Society of Antiquaries) and <i>Kharga Oasis in prehistory</i> (1952, London: Athlone Press). She received an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University, and was an Honorary Fellow of Newham College, Cambridge. She was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939.<br class=""nLine"" />[Abio.: 1983, <i>Mixed memoirs</i>, London: Paradigm Publishing]</div>"

<i>(causewayed camp)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">One of the main kinds of Neolithic enclosure found in southern and eastern Britain, closely related to a range of other forms of ditched enclosures in northwest Europe. The synonymous terms causewayed camp/causewayed enclosure were first used in the 1930s, since when they have found widespread acceptance in the archaeological literature. The characteristic feature of a causewayed enclosure is the presence of frequent breaks or causeways in the boundary ditch. Some of these are entrance gaps, but most are simply narrow blocks of unexcavated natural bedrock formed because the boundaries were dug as a series of pits rather than a continuous ditch. Dating mainly to the 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, causewayed enclosures range in size from about 1ha through to over 10ha. A number of different designs have been recognized on the basis of the boundary arrangements including: single, double, and multiple concentric circuits of ditches; and spiral ditches. They occur in many different situations in the landscape including river valleys and hilltops. About 70 examples had been discovered up until the end of the 20th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, the majority through aerial photography.<br class=""nLine"" />The ditch fills show evidence of recutting and many had a long life spanning more than 1000 years. The fills also contain what appear to be deliberately placed deposits of pottery, animal remains, and human bone. There is much debate about the function of causewayed enclosures, although it is now widely recognized that despite a common technique of construction they were not all built for the same purpose. Some appear to have been defended settlements while others appear to be ceremonial sites, perhaps associated with periodic fairs or gatherings."

<b>Celt</b></b>
<i>(Celtic/Celts)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<b>1</b> The name given by classical authors such as Hecataeus and Herodotus&gt; to the proto-historic peoples occupying Spain, Gaul, and central Europe. These writers distinguished the Celts from neighbouring peoples by their appearance, customs, language, and political organization. They spoke of them as tall, fair, excitable, ostentatious, and fierce people. They are portrayed by themselves as having wavy swept-back hair, heavy moustaches on the men, and wearing a metal torc or neck-ring. Many authorities extend this fairly narrow, if slightly ambiguous, definition to include the pre-Roman inhabitants of Britain and parts of northern Europe, and even more fancifully to include those same communities living outside the roman Empire who survived down into the later 1st millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> and beyond&mdash;the so-called ‘Celtic fringe’. In fact there is no archaeological evidence for such a widespread and enduring common culture. As a cultural label the term should be seen as a blanket description for a whole series of more or less autonomous groups superficially linked through common ancestries, kinship ties, and shared artistic tastes.<br class=""nLine"" />

"Celtic art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Celtic art</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[De].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A style of decorative art, widely regarded as one of the most impressive known from antiquity that developed around 500 bc in central and western Europe and found expression in the following centuries over a wide area from Spain and Ireland across to eastern Germany. Also known in its early stages as La Tène art. The development of the style in the 5th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> owes much to the artistic genius of local craftsmen building on the tradition of <a href=""entry://Hallstatt, Gmunden, Austria""><span class=""links"">HALLSTATT</span></a> geometric and abstract art, coupled with influences resulting from material introduced through trade, especially the animal designs seen on <a href=""entry://Scythians""><span class=""links"">SCYTHIAN</span></a> artefacts from the steppes of eastern Europe and the plant motifs found in the classical world. The result of this combination was a bold curvilinear style with a fascinating blurring of the distinction between naturalistic and abstract with a strong sense of balance but not of symmetry. Such art is applied extensively on bronzework, horse-gear, weapons, and eating and drinking equipment. There are also notable examples carved in stone. A series of stages to the development of Celtic art was suggested by Paul Jacobsthal in 1944: successively, the Early; Waldalgesheim; Plastic; and Sword styles.<br class=""nLine"" />The Celtic art styles of the later 1st millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> continued to flourish in the northern and western extremes of its early distribution, outside the direct influence of the Roman empire: for example, southern Scandinavia, Ireland, and the west of Britain. Indeed, the styles and ideas survived to return after the Roman withdrawal, fertilizing the artistic revivals of Anglo-Saxon, Norse, and British art from the 5th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> onwards."

<div class=""content"">French linguist and antiquarian who deciphered the texts on the Rosetta Stone. Born at Figeac in France, he was educated at the Académie de Grenoble and when only sixteen years old read a paper there in which he argued that the Coptic language was the ancient language of Egypt. In 1807 he went to Paris where he studied at the School of Oriental Languages and the Collège de France. From this time on he devoted himself to the study of ancient languages, returning to Grenoble in 1819 to become Professor of History at the Lyceum. In the early 1820s he used the Rosetta Stone texts to present a solution to Egyptian hieroglyphics, publishing his results in 1824 as<i>Précis du système hiéroglyphique des anciens Egyptiens, figuratif, idéographique et alphabétique</i>. Later in 1824 he went to study the Egyptian antiquities in the museums of Italy and on his return was appointed director of the Egyptian Museum at the Louvre. From 1828 to 1830 he carried out expeditions to Egypt, and in 1831 he was appointed to the Chair of Egyptology specially created for him at the Collège de France. However, his health was already failing and he died in Paris a year later.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: L. Adkins and R. Adkins, 2001, <i>The keys to Egypt: the race to read the hieroglyphs</i>.

<b>Childe, Gordon Vere</b></b> (1892&ndash;1957) <span class=""red""><b><i>[Bi].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Celebrated prehistorian who worked widely in Europe and who is particularly associated with the definition and application of the concept of ‘culture’ in archaeological analysis. Born in North Sydney, Australia, he graduated in Latin, Greek, and philosophy from Sydney University in 1913, developing at the same time good linguistic skills. Growing up alongside the rise of the Australian Labour Party he became a militant socialist. Between 1914 and 1916 Childe studied for a B. Litt. at Queen's College, Oxford, becoming a close friend of Rajani Palme Dutt who was later a leading figure in the British Communist Party. In 1916 Childe returned to Australia and became involved in the anti-conscription movement and Labour politics while supporting himself teaching in a Queensland secondary school and for a time at Sydney University.<br class=""nLine"" />After briefly working as a publicity officer in London he abandoned political work in 1922 and resumed his interest in European prehistory, although in 1926 he published his only political book <i>How Labour governs</i> (Melbourne: Melbourne University Press). From 1925 he was appointed librarian at the Royal Anthropological Institute, a post which allowed him to continue his researches and especially his travels in eastern Europe. Several books were published in this period including <i>The dawn of European civilization</i> (1925, London: Routledge) and <i>The Ayrians</i> (1926, New York: A. A. Knopf ). In 1927 he joined with archaeologists from the Hungarian National Museum and Cambridge University in excavating the Hungarian Bronze Age site of Toszeg. In the same year he was appointed Abercromby Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology at Edinburgh University. By the end of the 1920s he had attained the greatest achievement of his early works, the linking of the idea of an archaeological culture as a device for tracing the history of a particular people with the idea of diffusionism as a means for the spread of ideas and people. Throughout the 1930s and early 1940s he applied these ideas locally within the British Isles and to the wider European scene, publishing such key works as <i>The Danube in prehistory</i> (1929, Oxford: Clarendon Press), <i>Prehistory of Scotland</i> (1935, London: Kegan Paul), and <i>Prehistoric communities of the British Isles</i> (1940, London: Chambers). His pursuit of Marxism took him to the Soviet Union for the first time in 1935.<br class=""nLine"" />He left Edinburgh in 1946 to became the Director of the Institute of Archaeology at London University, a position he retained until his retirement in 1956. He returned to Australia, seemingly disillusioned in his own ability to devise new ways of carrying forward the Marxist analysis of prehistory. After presenting some lectures and visiting friends, he committed suicide, falling 300m from Govett's Leap in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales on the morning of 19 October 1957.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: B.

Canals were dug around three or four sides to facilitate drainage and provide mud and silt which was then spread on top of the mats. Waste from nearby settlements was added to the raised beds to give additional fertility. Each chinampa was about 10m by 110m and they were usually constructed on a regular grid pattern. Chinampas were used to grow staple root, vegetable, grain, and fruit crops and were kept in production all year round. It has been reported that, in ad 1519, 10000ha of chinampa supported about 100000 people."

<div class=""content"">Distinguished British prehistorian who specialized in the Mesolithic period and is well known for his work on world prehistory and developments in the field of palaeoeconomy. Born in Bromley, Kent, he was educated at Marlborough and Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he remained for the rest of his career. He became a Bye-Fellow in 1933 and a Fellow in 1950, breaking off his academic work only during WW2 to serve in the RAF Volunteer Reserve where he worked on photographic interpretation. In 1952 he was appointed Disney Professor of Archaeology and in 1956 he became head of the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology. He was Master of Peterhouse from 1973 to 1980. Throughout his academic career and beyond into retirement there were a number of key strands to his work. First and foremost was an interest in the Mesolithic of northern Europe, starting with his first book, published at the age of 25, <i>The Mesolithic Age in Britain</i> (1932, Cambridge: CUP). His excavations at <a href=""entry://Star Carr, North Yorkshire, UK""><span class=""links"">STAR CARR</span></a> between 1949 and 1951 remain one of the most important pieces of work relating to the early Mesolithic. Beyond this his interests included world prehistory, a topic which displayed another of his talents, the ability to write for wide audiences and the general public. <i>Prehistoric England</i> (1940, London: Batsford) went through five editions, <i>World prehistory</i> (1961, Cambridge: CUP) through three. And beyond this still was his interest in economic prehistory and the need to take a social perspective, well exemplified in his <i>Prehistoric Europe: the economic basis</i> (1952, London: Methuen). Of course these were not his only interests. For 35 years he was the editor of the <i>Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society</i> and from 1958 to 1962 he was President of the Prehistoric Society. He served on numerous other committees and boards. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1951, appointed CBE in 1971, and knighted in 1992.

Part of his time was devoted to preparing his work on beakers for publication as the <i>Beaker pottery in Great Britain and Ireland</i> (1970, Cambridge: CUP). Alongside this, however, he was also working on a study of what archaeology was and what it should be. Drawing on many diverse disciplines he began to formulate a new way of thinking about and exploring the past. The results of this were published as <i>Analytical archaeology</i> (1968, London: Methuen), in which he argued that archaeology should become a science by developing its own explicit methodologies and theory based on <a href=""entry://systems theory""><span class=""links"">SYSTEMS THEORY</span></a>. This book was probably the single most important archaeological text published in Britain in the 1960s, and one that caused great controversy in ushering in the new archaeology on the European side of the Atlantic. A number of colleagues and students quickly picked up on the ideas and their implications, as shown by the papers in Clarke's edited book <i>Models in archaeology</i> (1972, London: Methuen). This was followed up in 1973 with an article in <i>Antiquity</i> entitled ‘Archaeology&mdash;the loss of innocence’ which took the ideas to a far wider audience and drew heavy criticism from more traditionally minded archaeologists.<br class=""nLine"" />Although hopeful of being given the Disney Chair of Archaeology in 1975, the electors chose Glyn Daniel instead. In 1976, Clarke was given an untenured assistant lectureship. That same year he spent some time in hospital; he died at home the day after being discharged when a blood clot, formed by weeks of inactivity, detached itself and lodged in his lung.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: N.

The Clyde cairns are characterized by rectangular and trapezoidal mounds, stone-built chambers comprising linear groups of cells at the higher and wider end of the mound, concave or recessed forecourts, and a façade of large stones set around the back of the forecourt, usually diminishing in height outwards from the entrance to the chambers.

Investigations in Scotland by Jack Scott and in Ireland by Ruaidhri de Valéra and others during the 1950s and 1960s showed that the similarities noted by Childe and Piggott were rather superficial and that the structures in southwest Scotland should be considered <a href=""entry://Clyde cairn""><span class=""links"">CLYDE CAIRNS</span></a> while those in Ireland were part of a more widespread tradition of long barrow construction in Ireland where examples are known as <a href=""entry://court cairn""><span class=""links"">COURT CAIRNS</span></a>.

<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ar].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A metal token, usually a disc, with specific weight and value, usually stamped with designs and inscriptions. The earliest known coins in the world were minted by the kingdom of <a href=""entry://Lydians""><span class=""links"">LYDIA</span></a> in the Near East in the 7th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. The coins, made of electrum, were simply pieces of metal of standardized weight stamped with designs and later inscriptions to identify the issuing authority. It is not exactly certain how they were initially used, but it was probably for high-level ceremonial exchange rather than everyday trade. After Cyrus the Great gained control of Lydia in the 6th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> the <a href=""entry://Achaemenids""><span class=""links"">ACHAEMENID</span></a> Persians adopted a gold coinage that typically had a portrait of their king on one side and a punch mark on the other. The Greek cities of Asia Minor also copied the Lydian idea for coins in the 7th century, after which the idea spread widely throughout Greece. The first Roman coins were struck in the early 3rd century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, initially in precious metals but by the later 3rd century in bronze as the <i>as</i> and the <i>denarius</i> in silver. The 4th-century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> staters of Phillip II and Alexander III of Macedon provided the prototypes for coins in Europe which developed their own sequence based on the use of <a href=""entry://Celtic art""><span class=""links"">CELTIC ART</span></a> and local designs.<br class=""nLine"" />In the Far East, coinage developed in India in the 5th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> through contacts with Persian/Achaemenid coinage by Mauryans and Kushans.

<span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">The Roman city was established as the first <i>colonia</i> in Britain in ad 49. Situated beside the River Colne in southern Essex, the site has been investigated through many excavations by Mortimer Wheeler, Christopher Hakes, Philip Crummy, and others since the 1920s.

In ad 49 the emperor Claudius visited the newly conquered province and established the town of Colonia Claudia Victricensis, with a colossal temple dedicated to him. The city was modelled on classical lines and was the embodiment of Roman colonial power in the newly annexed province. The town was extensively damaged during the Boudiccan revolts of ad 60, but was rebuilt.

<div class=""content"">In medieval and early post-medieval times a college was an establishment built to house a community of secular clergy sharing a degree of common life that was less strictly controlled than that within a monastery. Colleges were often founded under patronage but financed through the income of the priests and canons within them that derived from tithes or other kinds of income from the manors and villages they served. Many colleges included an educational element to their work, and it is this which has survived down into modern times. The monastic roots of ancient colleges can be seen in their arrangement around a cloister or quadrangle, the presence of a church or chapel, and the existence of extensive accommodation and domestic offices."

<div class=""content"">British philosopher and archaeologist best known for his work on Roman Britain. Born in the Lake District, he was educated at Rugby before going up to Oxford to read Moderations and Greats at Pembroke College. From that time on, his life had two parallel tracks. Pembroke College elected him as a Fellow and Tutor to teach philosophy. His work in this area was considerable, including studies into the nature of history. This formed the subject of his inaugural lecture to the University of Oxford on 28 October 1935 and was later published as <i>The historical imagination</i> (1935, Oxford: Clarendon Press); later works on the subject include <i>The idea of history</i> (1946, Oxford: Clarendon Press) and <i>Essays in the philosophy of history</i> (1965, Austin: University of Texas Press). Meanwhile, Professor F. J. <a href=""entry://Haverfield, Francis John""><span class=""links"">HAVERFIELD </span></a> picked out Collingwood's artistic and archaeological interests and scholarly gifts and persuaded him to help illustrate articles on the Roman forts of northern Britain. Numerous further studies of archaeological remains followed and Collingwood developed deep expert knowledge not only of the inscriptions and topography that underpinned his early work, but the whole archaeology of the province in Roman times such as can be seen in his publications <i>Archaeology of Roman Britain</i> (1930, London: Methuen) and <i>Roman Britain and the English settlement</i> (1945, Oxford: OUP).<br class=""nLine"" />[Abio.: 1939, <i>Autobiography</i>, Oxford: OUP (reprinted by Penguin, 1944)]</div>"

All resources should therefore be used for the greatest good of the greatest number of people, and that where resources are scarce some should be held back for future generations.

This involves two lines of enquiry. The first is to consider the environmental and behaviour context of action; understanding an object, for example, by placing it in relation to the larger functioning whole from which it is drawn. Second, it involves looking at the networks of associations that objects were placed within in the past and attempting to read meaning from such groupings as if the objects were words in text. The analogy here is that words on their own mean relatively little; it is only when they are put together in structured ways that the overall meaning becomes clear."

<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A regional type of middle Neolithic long barrow found on the north Wessex Downs, Cotswold Hills, South Wales coast, and Brecon Beacons in the west of England and eastern Wales. Dating to the 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, these long barrows have rectangular or trapezoidal mounds, shallow forecourts at the higher and wider ends of the mounds, and in some cases an elaborated façade of large upright slabs. Two patterns of chamber location are represented: terminal chambers in a simple linear pattern with cells opening off a central passage; and lateral chambers where short passages lead into the body of the mound from the side to give access to a simple polygonal or rectangular chamber. The material used in constructing the mounds was derived from flanking quarries. In the areas where these barrows occur the stone is suitable for dry-stone walling and the outer cairn walls of the barrows themselves are typically well constructed. Burial is by inhumation; grave goods are rare and mainly confined to personal objects. Excavations by Alan Saville at Hazleton, Gloucestershire, in the early 1980s showed that here at least bodies were first placed in the outer part of the entrance passage and that as the corpse decayed and room was needed for new burials parts were gradually moved further and further into the tomb. Also known as Severn&ndash;Cotswold long barrows."

<div class=""content"">British archaeologist who is best known as the founder of the journal <i>Antiquity</i> and for his work with aerial photographs. Born in Bombay, India, his mother died soon after he was born and he was brought up in London and later Newbury, Berkshire, by his father's sisters. He was educated at Marlborough College and then went up to Keble College, Oxford, where he started reading Greats but after discovering an interest in archaeology gave this up in favour of a geography diploma. It is clear that he enjoyed neither school nor university. His first tentative steps into archaeological fieldwork with the Wellcome Expedition to the Sudan was cut short by WW1. After a period in the infantry he was attached to the Third Army as a photographer and he then realized a long-standing ambition to work in the Royal Flying Corps. Here he became an observer but was shot down early in 1918. After the war he undertook various short-term jobs in field archaeology.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1920 he was appointed as the first Archaeology Officer in the Ordnance Survey. This suited him well, not least because it meant carving out a job for himself in an organization where nothing similar had previously existed. Continuing his work with aerial photography he also worked on the revision of archaeological features depicted on published maps. The aerial photographs that he took or acquired from others in the 1920s and 1930s have since proved to be some of the most valuable records of archaeological sites currently available. One innovation was the production of period maps showing archaeological distributions, one of the first being the <i>Map of Roman Britain</i>. Much of this work had to be done single-handedly as he had no assistants, and in the face of unsympathetic official outlooks. In 1927 he founded the international journal <i>Antiquity</i>, which he edited through to his death in 1957. One of his best-known works, a series of aerial photographs of Wessex taken as part of a joint project with <a href=""entry://Keiller, Alexander""><span class=""links"">Alexander KEILLER </span></a>, was published in 1928 (<i>Wessex from the air</i>. Oxford: Clarendon Press); other publications include <i>Man and his past</i> (1921, London: Milford), <i>Long barrows of the Cotswolds</i> (1925, Gloucester: John Bellows), and <i>Archaeology in the field</i> (1953, London: Phoenix).

After being rebuilt several times this was completely remodelled as a defended enclosure in its latest phase. The site was abandoned in the middle Neolithic, after being attacked and razed. A <a href=""entry://long mound""><span class=""links"">LONG MOUND</span></a> was built over the top of the infilled enclosure boundaries. There is some slight evidence for Beaker occupation on the hilltop, but the site was not re-occupied until the construction of an Iron Age hillfort in the 7th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. Several phases of rebuilding have been recorded at this structure, each associated with the destruction of the existing fortifications.

<b>culture</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ge].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Probably one of the most used terms in contemporary archaeology, and broadly derived from anthropology and sociology. The anthropologist E. B. Tylor set the scene in the late 19th century by defining culture as ‘that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society’. Thus in a general sense culture is a commonly preferred learned form of behaviour which has been adopted by a given society and which includes distinctive and complicated systems of technology, social organization, thought, cosmology, and ideology. Culture is something that articulates a human society with its environment and, for Leslie White, writing in the late 1950s, could be seen in adaptive functional terms as ‘an extrasomatic, temporal continuum of things and events dependent upon symbolling....A mechanism whose function is to make life secure and continuous for groups and individuals of the human species’.<br class=""nLine"" />In the purely archaeological sense, the idea of a culture was firmly established in the late 1920s by Gordon Childe whose Marxist perspectives shine through in his proposition that ‘we find certain types of remains&mdash;pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites and house forms&mdash;constantly recurring together. Such a complex of associated traits we shall term a “cultural group” or just a “culture”. We assume that such a complex is the material expression of what today we would call a “people”.’ Thus, for archaeologists, a culture is usually taken to be a constantly recurring assemblage of artefacts which are assumed to be representative of a particular set of activities carried out at a particular time and place. As such, archaeological cultures are defined by archaeologists rather than the original participants."

During this time he seems to have developed an interest in the wealth of archaeological monuments of the area, and made friends with other antiquarians in the region. His first barrow opening appears to have been a small bowl barrow south of the Knook Long Barrow in or around 1800.

Between 1992 and 1995 several thousand panels were discovered as well as four rock-shelters and possible settlement sites dating to the Upper Palaeolithic.

Occupied from at least the 3rd millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, much of the prehistoric and Roman town lies beneath the modern city and thus is not easily accessible for excavation. However, historical accounts show something of its long history. Egyptian texts and biblical references show that it was an important international trading centre from the 16th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. The Aramaens conquered the town in the 2nd millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, the Israelites in the 19th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, and the Assyrians in the 8th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. By 85 bc it had become the capital of the Nabatean kingdom, and by 64 bc it was a Roman city of both commercial and strategic importance. In the mid 1st millennium <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> it became a major Byzantine garrison. In 635 it was captured by Arab forces and chosen as their capital by the Ummayads who were the first Islamic dynasty spanning the period ad 611 to ad 750. The Great Mosque of the caliph Al-Walid was built between ad 706 to ad 714, in the ruins of a Roman temple, and still stands today.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: W. T.

<b>Danebury, Hampshire, UK</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A developed hillfort of the middle Iron Age on the chalk downlands of central southern England. Extensively excavated by Barry Cunliffe between 1969 and 1989, the site was first occupied in the 6th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, when the defences consisted of a single bank and ditch with two opposed entrances. Inside a road ran between the entrances and divided the occupation area into sectors: dwellings were set around the edges while the central area was used for storage. A series of square shrines occupied the highest spot in the middle of the fort. In the early 4th century a further line of ramparts was added outside the first, the southwest gateway was closed, and the east gate was strengthened. The site seems to have been abandoned during the 1st century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, thereafter being used only as a temporary refuge. Investigations in the surrounding landscape have revealed that the hillfort was surrounded by other kinds of settlement and enclosure.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: B. Cunliffe, 1983, <i>Danebury</i>.

<div class=""content"">A deeply stratified cave site in the Great Basin of midwest North America. The deposits contained evidence of intermittent occupation from about 9000 bc through to the second millennium <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>. The excavator of the site, Jesse Jennings, argued that the sequence represented in the cave illustrated the development of a single culture living in a desert environment: the Desert Culture. In this he was greatly influenced by the anthropological work of Julian Steward, and indeed used aspects of the lifestyle of the Shoshoni Indians living in the Great Basin at the time of European contact to flesh out his reconstructions of earlier communities.The continuity inherent in Jennings' model is not now very widely accepted, although the site remains an important sequence for understanding the early occupation of the Great Basin.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: J.

<div class=""content"">British prehistorian and academic, well known for popularizing archaeology on television and radio in the 1950s and 1960s. Born in Barry, South Wales, he was educated first at University College, Cardiff, where he started reading geology before transferring to St John's College, Cambridge, where he read archaeology and anthropology. He put his archaeological training to good use during WW2, serving in the central photographic interpretation unit of the RAF. He returned to St John's in 1945 and stayed there until he retired in 1981. In 1974 he was elected Disney Professor. His academic specialisms focused on the Neolithic tombs of northwest Europe, his doctoral dissertation being published in 1950 as <i>The prehistoric chamber tombs of England and Wales</i> (Cambridge: CUP). He was also interested in the history of archaeology and archaeological thought and published several books on the subject, including <i>The idea of prehistory</i> (1962, London: C. A. Watts ). He appeared on television with Sir Mortimer Wheeler in <i>Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?</i>, and helped popularize the subject further by editing more than 100 volumes in the Ancient Peoples and Places series, and between 1958 and 1985 he was the editor of the journal <i>Antiquity</i>. He was also interested in food and drink, a joy which he shared in his book <i>The hungry archaeologist in France</i> (1963, London: Faber and Faber), and in detective novels: he wrote two, both published by Penguin, one under the pseudonym Dilwyn Rees .<br class=""nLine"" />[Abio.: 1986, <i>Some small harvest</i>.

Born in Brisbane, he trained as a doctor at Sydney University Medical School before serving in WW1 with the Australian army medical corps. After the war he went to London to pursue his research in brain anatomy at University College. At the age of 30 he was appointed Professor of Anatomy at the fledgling Medical School in the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, a post he remained in until his retirement. In 1924 he was shown a fossil skull from Taungs near Kimberley and realized that it was an extremely early hominid of a type previously unrecognized. He named it <i>Australopithecus</i>, much to the dismay of those in the academic world who realized that the word was a cocktail of Greek and Latin. Although the place of <i>Australopithecus</i> in hominid evolution at the time of its discovery was hotly contested, Dart lived to see his views confirmed by finds at Olduvai and elsewhere.

<b>Darwin, Charles Robert</b></b> (1809&ndash;82) <span class=""red""><b><i>[Bi].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">British biologist and naturalist who developed and expounded the theory of evolution by natural selection and the survival of the fittest. After two years as a medical student in Edinburgh he earned a BA degree at Cambridge University in 1831. Here he met Adam Sedgwick and John Henslow, the latter of whom recommended him for the post of naturalist on the expedition ship <i>The Beagle</i>. Darwin used the trip, between <i>c.</i>1831 and 1836 bc, to make observations on biology and geology that would last him his entire career. Between <i>c.</i>1846 and 1854 bc he spent much time researching the classification, variation, and origins of animal species. After the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace sent Darwin a manuscript outlining similar evolutionary thinking, he published his abstract <i>On the origin of species</i> (1859, London), documenting his evidence for the operation of biological evolution. He later became interested in the early history of humans and developed his thinking on human evolution as <i>The descent of man and selection in relation to sex</i> (1871, London). His interest in soils and their formation led him to consider the work and role of the earthworm, published as <i>The formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms</i> (1888, London), which provided one of the first scientific considerations of how archaeological remains are buried.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: J.

<b>dendrochronology</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A highly accurate dating method that in favourable circumstances provides both absolute and relative dates. The idea of dendrochronology was developed in the early 20th century by Andrew Ettlicott Douglass, an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, as a result of his work on the effects of sunspots on terrestrial climate. Also known as tree-ring dating, the method is based on the fact that living trees add an annual growth ring to their trunk and branches. The size and character of the ring varies from year to year according to weather patterns and general climatic conditions: in dry years the ring is thin while in wet years it is relatively thick. Trees of the same species of similar age and living in the same region will show similar patterns of tree-ring growth. By analysing trees whose growth periods overlap it is possible to construct a master tree-ring profile for a region. When a piece of timber of unknown date is found in the same area its rings can be matched with the master sequence and its date established. Even where sequences cannot be tied down to absolute ages it is possible to construct ‘floating’ sequences so that timbers can be dated in relative terms; when the master sequence is eventually tied down these dates will become absolute dates.A number of master curves have been or are being constructed for different parts of the world. One of the longest and most spectacular is the Belfast curve for the British Isles which spans the period back to about 5500 bc. The method has much to commend it, and for recent centuries, where large timbers survive in standing buildings, it is already widely used. For earlier times the key issue is the preservation of suitable timber: ideally a timber with more than 50 years' growth represented is needed to achieve firm dating.Dendrochronology is also the basis for the construction of calibration curves for the conversion of radiocarbon ages to calendar years.

<i>(DNA)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ge].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Genes, the organizers of inheritance, are composed of DNA, thread-like molecules which carry the hereditary instructions needed to build an organism and make it work. Genes are copied or replicated with every new generation of living cells and thus preserve the blueprint for that form of life. For archaeology this opens up tremendous potential to address problems that could hardly be contemplated in the 1970s. What have been called studies of ‘the archaeology of the human body’ allow populations to be explored in terms the sex, hair colour, skin type, blood group, and family connections of individuals from whom DNA can be recovered. Major issues about patterns of colonization and relationships between human populations can also potentially be explored, although issues relating to early hominid development are way beyond the range of preserved DNA which so far has been recovered from preserved remains back to about 40000 years ago. Already DNA studies of North American populations suggest three waves of migration between 15000 and 9000 years ago."

<div class=""content"">The abandoned remains of a nucleated rural settlement abandoned sometime between the 12th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> and the 19th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>. Such sites often survive as earthworks or, in marginal areas, as ruinous structures.

In most cases fields, tracks, and droves are also preserved as earthworks around the village itself. There are many reasons why such settlements became deserted, amongst them the oft-cited explanation of plague and especially the <a href=""entry://Black Death""><span class=""links"">BLACK DEATH</span></a>. The majority, however, appear to have been deserted for economic reasons: because of rural depopulation, through changes in landholding brought about by <a href=""entry://enclosure""><span class=""links"">ENCLOSURE</span></a>, and because of the creation of landscaped parks from the 17th century onwards, when wealthy landowners sometimes physically moved whole settlements."

<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A type of later Neolithic burial monument found in clusters along the Atlantic coastlands of Northwest Europe, notably in central Ireland, north Wales, and Orkney. Dating mainly to the 3rd millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, these structures represent enlarged or developed versions of the earlier <a href=""entry://simple passage grave""><span class=""links"">SIMPLE PASSAGE GRAVES</span></a>. They typically comprise a large round mound of earth and stone more than 35m in diameter, within which there is one or more stone-built chambers accessible from the outside of the mound via a long narrow passage. The chambers are usually square, rectangular, or polygonal in plan and often show structural compartmentalization with side cells opening from the main chamber. Burials either by inhumation or cremation were made in the side cells. The walls of the passage and chamber often carry <a href=""entry://passage grave art""><span class=""links"">PASSAGE GRAVE ART</span></a>, as do the stones forming the kerb around the outside of the mound in some examples. Decorated stones brought from elsewhere are sometimes broken up and used in the construction of developed passage graves.

<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ge].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Most forms of property development and material changes to land use need approval from a local or national government body responsible for spatial planning. This process is known as development control. The determination of applications and the granting of permission increasingly includes consideration of the archaeological implications of proposals. Where permission for development is granted, a condition can be imposed through the planning system which requires the developer to undertake, at their own expense, an agreed mitigation strategy that may variously involve the preservation or excavation of archaeological remains, or a combination of the two. As such, this approach provides a variant on the widely applied principle of environmental protection in which ‘the polluter pays’ for any damage done to the environment."

<div class=""content"">The spread of ideas, items of material culture, or cultural traits from one culture or society to another. Diffusion does not necessarily imply a movement of people, for ideas can move through trade and other forms of contact. What it does imply is that ideas and inventions tend to radiate out from one source area into surrounding regions. Prior to radiocarbon dating there was a general assumption that, within the Old World, most of the main developments and key innovations took place in the Near East, the Middle East, Egypt, and the Mycenaean world of Greece and the Aegean, and ideas spread out from there. Taken at its extreme, in what is sometimes known as <i>hyper-diffusionism</i>, major inventions happened only once, and a few key areas provided the inspiration for most major technical and social developments later imparted to the rest of the world: such things as agriculture, writing, urban settlement, metallurgy, and so on. It is now recognized, however, that many things were independently developed under different social conditions at different times. Moreover, radiocarbon dating has shown that the movement of ideas is far more complicated than originally thought and that it is inappropriate to think in terms of simple one-way movements outwards from supposedly ‘higher civilizations’."

<div class=""content"">Arctic cultures found in western Greenland, around the northern Hudson Bay area, and the islands of northern parts of North America, dating to the period 550 bc to ad 1100. Seemingly developing from the Pre-Dorset Tradition of the Arctic Small Tool Tradition, Dorset Tradition communities lived mainly on the coast. They were hunters and their subsistence economy was based mainly on sea mammals, especially seals, and other resources derived from the shoreline. However, terrestrial mammals such as caribou and even polar bears were also exploited, along with many smaller species.Their material culture included bone hunting equipment, including toggling harpoons, lances and spears. Chipped and polished stone was also used for edged tools and weapons. Small stone lamps were used. Houses were rectangular semi-subterranean structures.Dorset art styles were well established and elaborate. The repertoire includes lifelike portraits of actual people, and Dorset carvers were adept at working antler, bone, ivory, soapstones, and wood. Over half of their carvings were of human beings or polar bears. Few decorated objects were utilitarian pieces: most were masks, figurines, and plaques that were used in funerary rituals and in shamanistic and magical ceremonies.Skeletal remains show that Dorset Tradition communities were the ancestors of modern Inuit, and it may be that when some of the Inuit legends refer to ‘Tunnit’ folk, giants with enormous strength, and people without dog sleds or bows and arrows, they are talking about Dorset Tradition societies."

At least seven styles of fluted point are known in the northeastern part of the area, some with constricted blades, some with pentagonal shapes, some long and narrow, others almost triangular in outline. Some show similarities with the western <a href=""entry://Clovis point""><span class=""links"">CLOVIS</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Folsom, New Mexico, USA""><span class=""links"">FOLSOM</span></a> points and they are assumed to be of approximately the same age."

At the elm decline the relative abundance of this species decreased considerably, sometimes in isolation and sometimes as part of a general reduction in tree cover. Before the application of radiocarbon dating to pollen sequences this was thought to be a widespread and broadly synchronous event which, in the 1940s, J. Iversen linked to the impact of early farmers on the post-glacial forest maxima. It is now clear that this event post-dated the first impact of farming, that it was not quite as synchronous as first thought, and moreover that in some areas at least it was probably brought about by the ancient equivalent of Dutch Elm Disease."

<div class=""content"">A large Celto-Ligurian <i>oppidum</i> near Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. It was the capital of the Saluvii tribe until destroyed by the Romans in 124 bc. Originally constructed in the 3rd century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, Entremont was roughly triangular in plan and enclosed by a stone wall with rectangular projecting towers. Within the enclosure were houses, a regular street plan, a drainage network, and, near the centre, an important sanctuary. Finds include human heads and torsos carved in the round and four-sided limestone pillars with severed heads carved in relief. The occupants of the site were well connected to the classical world, as shown by a wide range of imports to the site. Especially important was eating and drinking equipment, the use of which is demonstrated by the discarded amphorae containers in which luxury food and drink would have arrived.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: F.

The aim is to better inform the decision-making process, allow alternative proposals to be compared, and, where appropriate, promote the development of acceptable mitigation measures. EIA was first applied widely in the USA; it was made a legal requirement for certain types of scheme in Europe following a European Community Directive issued in 1985.

<div class=""content"">Once a major seaport on the west coast of Turkey in the delta area of the River Cayster, this site is now 8km inland. It is one of the richest and most splendid sites in the world. Excavations by John Turle Wood for the British Museum in the 1860s located the temple of Artemis, and later work by Austrian archaeologists uncovered a good deal of its early history. First occupied in Mycenaean times, tradition describes how the settlement was founded from Athens by King Androklos. Supreme prosperity arrived under Hellenistic and Roman rulers. The centre-piece is the temple of Artemis (Diana to the Romans and perhaps equivalent to the Anatolian god Cybele), one of the <a href=""entry://Seven Wonders of the World""><span class=""links"">SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD</span></a>, but later destroyed by Alexander the Great in 356 bc. From the Greco-Roman town there are many public buildings, including seven gymnasia, administrative buildings, baths, and the agora. The theatre, from the <a href=""entry://Hellenistic period""><span class=""links"">HELLENISTIC</span></a> period, could seat 24000 people and was the setting for St Paul's address set down in the Acts of the Apostles (Chapter 19).

They developed long-distance trade contacts to Greece, Carthage, and across the Alps into central Europe. Their cities were substantial and wealthy: for example, Populonia, Vetulonia, and Tarquinia. Their influence extended over wide areas, including Aleria, the Po Valley, and parts of Campania. The area is rich in natural resources, including gold, copper and iron, and this led to a strong and influential craft base. The Etruscan language still causes problems because although it is written in an eastern Greek alphabet many aspects of its syntax and vocabulary are uncertain. But the Etruscans were under constant pressure from communities to the north, and increasingly from Rome in the south. Between the 4th and 2nd centuries Rome conquered all of Etruria, but despite their political extinction, the Etruscans contributed much to Roman civilization in such matters as infrastructure, political and social organization, art, architecture, theatre, and engineering skills."

His first interests were in coins and seals, and it was the early Greek seals that led him to Knossos, on Crete, which he purchased in 1896. In 1899 he began excavations there at his own expense and for 35 years thoroughly researched not only the site but the whole <a href=""entry://Minoan""><span class=""links"">MINOAN</span></a> civilization that it related to.

<b>excavation</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">One of the principal means by which archaeological data is captured and recorded, excavation involves the systematic exposure of deposits that are then taken apart. There are a number of different techniques of excavation, such as <a href=""entry://open area excavation""><span class=""links"">OPEN AREA EXCAVATION</span></a>, <a href=""entry://planum method""><span class=""links"">PLANUM METHOD</span></a>, <a href=""entry://quadrant excavation""><span class=""links"">QUADRANT METHOD</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Wheeler system""><span class=""links"">WHEELER METHOD</span></a>, each having its own strengths and weaknesses. Selecting a method that suits the kind of site under investigation and the questions being asked is an important preliminary to any excavation project. A widely held principle, however, is that excavation should proceed by removing the layers and deposits within the site in the reverse order to which they were laid down in the first place. The different methods also carry with them implications for the way things are recorded, although plans, sections, photographs, notebooks, finds indexes, context records, and sample logs will be found in almost all of them. Not all studies can be done on site (desirable though that is), and samples of material and finds have to be cross-referenced to the deposits from which they came so that they can be examined later in the laboratory. Excavation is destructive, and it is costly in time and resources. New technology such as digital recording systems is playing an increasing role on fieldwork projects, and frees the archaeologists to spend more time interpreting what they are finding as they go along."

The lower deposit belonged to the early Magellan Complex and included an assemblage which comprised fishtail points, associated with late Pleistocene fauna such as native horse, sloth, and guanaco. Further excavations in the late 1950s by José Emperaire and Annette Laming-Emperaine confirmed Bird's record of the stratigraphy and provided dates which assign the lower deposits to the period before 9000 bc.

<div class=""content"">Multi-period prehistoric settlements on the edge of the Fenlands in eastern England. Excavations by Francis Pryor and colleagues since 1971 have revealed a long sequence of occupation starting in the middle Neolithic and extending through into early Roman times. In the 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> there was a small square Neolithic house, and a pit-grave all well spaced out across the landscape and representing the first major colonization of the area. During the 3rd millennium, however, the area started to fill up, with the establishment of a small field system and more extensive settlement. This process continued through the 2nd and 1st millennia <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, with the appearance soon after 1000 bc of a series of structures on a timber platform in a marshy area at what is now Flag Fen. A series of post alignments run across the wetland near the platform and during the later Bronze Age and early Iron Age acted to trap material moving about in the shallow water round the island, making a rich assemblage in archaeological terms. One of the activities happening within and around Flag Fen was the deposition into the water of metal objects, perhaps as some kind of offerings. Settlement in the area continued through the Iron Age and early Roman period, but from the 3rd century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> the water level rose, flooding the landscape and causing the people to move to drier ground.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: F.

"field system","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>field system</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">At their most simple, field systems are groupings of plots established in order to graze animals and cultivate crops in a controlled way. Each plot or field is usually surrounded by a fence, hedge, or wall, the latter as often as not derived from stones collected up from clearing stones from the plot in order to facilitate cultivation. The creation of a field system implies an investment in the land, and in addition to the fields themselves there may well be infrastructure facilities such as wells, threshing floors, animal houses, folds and pens, shelters and tool stores, barns, and maybe even dwellings for those working the land. Connecting the plots will be tracks and droves of various kinds.<br class=""nLine"" />The arrangement of a field system, its organization, and the nature of the components within it say a lot about its origins and how it worked. In general there are two kinds of arrangement, although either can occur as an ‘open field system’ where there are few if any walls, banks, or hedges dividing the plots or as a ‘closed field system’ where the boundary works between and around plots are substantial. Closed field systems are especially common where livestock form part of the regime.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>Regular field systems</i> have a common plan and fairly tight structure to them. Most were set out as a single operation, or at least planned in a way that could be expanded on a modular basis later if need be. The field plots are usually fairly uniform in size and shape, square and rectangular fields being common. One particular variant of the regular field system is the so-called co-axial field system where a framework comprising the long parallel boundaries forming the axis of the system are set out and then these strips, which may be several kilometres long, are infilled with cross-walls to create the field plots. Such systems began to be made during the Bronze Age in Europe, some of the best preserved being those identified by Andrew Fleming and John Collis on Dartmoor, England.<br class=""nLine"" />By contrast, <i>irregular field systems</i> are rarely planned: rather they develop piecemeal (irregular aggregate field systems) either by the periodic addition of new plots or the modification of what was originally a regular system. Irregular field systems tend to have curved or crooked boundaries between the plots, fields of uneven shape and size, and a high proportion of fields that can only be accessed from other fields rather than from a trackway or drove."
"fieldwalking","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>fieldwalking</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A powerful archaeological technique to systematically sample the upper surface of cultivated or disturbed ground in an effort to locate or map the distribution and extent of archaeological sites. The basic assumption is made that the topsoil contains distinctive traces of archaeological activity&mdash;fingerprints of what has gone on in the past. In this sense the topsoil is treated as a single extensive open archaeological context. It includes material that has been deposited onto or into the topsoil from above, for example debitage from an episode of flint knapping by someone sitting on the ground. It also includes material from features underneath the topsoil that are exposed to the effects of cultivation or ground works and therefore mechanically brought into the ploughsoil. Cultivation will have mixed all these different sources of material together, and a proportion of what is in the soil will be visible on the surface.<br class=""nLine"" />There are two main ways of carrying out fieldwalking. The first is <i>line walking</i>, where linear transects are defined at fixed intervals and the fieldwalkers traverse each line collecting material that they see within their corridor of vision. Lines are usually divided into stints (often the stints are the same length as the gap between transects to make data processing easier) and the material recovered is bagged by line and stint. The second technique is <i>grid walking</i>, where the survey area is divided into squares and the walkers spend a fixed amount of time working in each square gathering everything they can see during the allotted search period. At the end of the allotted time the finds are bagged together and the team moves on to the next square. In both systems it is important that each sample unit (a line stint or a grid square) is treated equally, otherwise the results will be worthless. After the finds have been collected, cleaned, sorted, and identified, different categories can be mapped and patterns identified."

<div class=""content"">A place where natural outcrops or seams of underground flint were worked to obtain blocks of raw material for knapping and making into tools. The mining techniques vary a little between mining areas but mines basically consist of pits or shafts. Pits are generally used where the flint is shallow and relatively large and rather irregular holes can be opened to get it. Shafts involve considerably more effort, and examples more than 15m deep are known. The shafts themselves are steep-sided and cylindrical in form, although most originally have had fixtures and fittings to allow the miners to get in and out, and to allow soil and water to be removed. When the desired band of flint is reached it is followed outwards from the shaft as a series of galleries that optimize the extractable flint by leaving only small pillars to support the roof. Most flint mines are of Neolithic date, and examples are known in many parts of Europe including Poland, Holland, Belgium, and southern and eastern England."

<b>flint scatter</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A general term applied to collections of worked flint, stone, debitage, and associated raw material gathered up from the surface of ploughed fields or disturbed ground. Such collections range in size from a few dozen through to many thousands of pieces, and may have been collected from areas of any size from a few metres across to several hectares. As such they do not represent distinct kinds of archaeological site but rather the archaeological manifestation of many different kinds of activity; their unity is a product of the way material has been recovered rather than the processes by which it was created in the first place. Much work has been devoted to characterizing flint scatters in terms of what they represent. It is now clear that some are caused by the erosion of underlying features and deposits which relate to a vast range of activities including settlements, stoneworking sites, and middens. In other cases the scatters reflect episodes of activity in the past that involved little more than the deposition of material on the contemporary ground surface which has subsequently become incorporated into the topsoil through natural and anthropogenic formation processes.

<b>floatation</b></b>
<i>(flotation)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A method of extracting carbonized plant remains, shells, small bones, and insect remains from ancient soils and sediments. The process involves stirring the sediment into a large barrel of water so that the lighter material floats and can be scooped off or floated over a weir and into a fine-meshed sieve. More sophisticated floatation machines have a water supply inside the barrel, thus forcing water upwards through the descending sediment, so helping to push light material to the surface. Various chemicals can be added to prepare the samples by breaking the sediments down or by creating froth in the floatation machine so that organic residues get trapped in air bubbles and are taken to the surface more easily."

<div class=""content"">A method for roughly determining the age of human or animal bones, and for comparing the relative ages of two bones recovered from the same context.

N-transforms are caused by non-cultural processes such as wind, water, rodent activity, and chemical action. By contrast C-transforms are cultural transforms which are the links between what people do and what is left in the archaeological record. Both impact on structures, objects, their associated matrix, and their associations in predictable ways as they move from the past (systemic context) into the present (archaeological context)."

The Formative embraced communities with village agriculture and sedentary lifestyles and is therefore mainly confined in its application to southwestern parts of North America, Mesoamerica, and the central and northern west coast of South America. The term is now largely obsolete because regionally specific traditions with better chronological and cultural resolution have been defined in most areas. During the Formative Stage, the foundations are laid for the emergence of a range of complicated social traditions or civilizations and nearly all the main traits that characterize these later civilizations were established: astronomical observations, calendrical systems, monumental architecture, hieroglyphic writing, craft specialization, planned settlements, and elaborate defined ceremonial and religious centres.<br class=""nLine"" />The main value of the concept of the Formative Stage is the recognition that no matter when it happened, the same basic pattern of development can be seen: sparsely scattered hamlet-type agricultural settlements increasing in their density in the landscape, coupled with the emergence of larger more important centres.

<b>fort</b></b>

<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A military construction that combines accommodation for troops, their transport, and their equipment with a defensible stronghold. In general, the design of a fort will reflect the style of warfare anticipated, and the kind of defence that might be mounted. Amongst the most widespread set of forts known through archaeological investigation are those built by the Roman army. Indeed, these provided models for later armies to copy and adapt. Roman forts were either temporary (also called marching camps), built of earth and wood with tents rather than buildings, or permanent/long-term, in which case they were built in stone and wood with considerable investment in the fortifications, infrastructure, and accommodation. Those used by cavalry units would have an annexe for stabling the horses if there was insufficient room within the main fort. The basic layout of Roman forts followed set patterns and all were built to the so-called ‘playing-card’ shape. Three main sizes can be recognized: <i>fortlets</i> of less than 1ha; <i>forts</i> of between 1ha and 4ha to accommodate between 500 and 1000 troops; and <i>fortresses</i> which generally cover between 17ha and 20ha and were designed to accommodate a whole legion.

<div class=""content"">British archaeologist and scholar specializing in the prehistory of the British Isles and the application of geographical models to archaeological data. Born in Chippenham, Wiltshire, and educated at Christ's Hospital he was destined for a career in market gardening. By a happy coincidence he was appointed superintendent of the University Field Laboratories in Cambridge. Here he became interested in archaeology and was admitted to Magdalene College to read for the tripos, but Professor H. M. Chadwick was so impressed by Fox that he arranged for him to proceed straight to a Ph.D. His thesis was on the archaeology of the Cambridge region. It was highly successful and innovatory, and was eventually published. In 1923 Fox became assistant curator of the University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography, but a year later he moved to the dual post of Keeper of Archaeology in the National Museum of Wales and Lecturer in Archaeology at University College, Cardiff. In 1926 he succeeded to the directorship of the Museum where he remained until his retirement in 1948. During his time in Wales he carried out a great deal of fieldwork, including the excavation of several Bronze Age barrows and the surveying of Offa's Dyke. In building geographical models he noted the ways in which Britain was connected to mainland Europe via a series of seaways that were used over many millennia and he also proposed a division of Britain into a Highland Zone and a Lowland Zone as a way of characterizing key differences in the nature of the archaeological evidence, but also in the kinds of society that might have existed in the regions in the past. His numerous publications include <i>The personality of Britain</i> (1932, Cardiff: National Museum of Wales) and <i>Life and death in the Bronze Age</i> (1959, London: Routledge).

The upper levels date to the Mesolithic and Neolithic, and it was during the Mesolithic, around 7000 bc, that obsidian from Melos first appears in the sequence, demonstrating long-distance boat journeys across the Aegean. An abrupt change in subsistence patterns around 6000 bc saw the introduction of domesticated sheep and goat, with, a little later, cultivated barley, and finally pottery.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: T.

Born and brought up in Vilnius, she took an MA degree at Vilnius University, before travelling to Tübingen, Germany, under difficult conditions in the later years of WW2. She took her Ph.D. in Tübingen in 1946, but emigrated to the USA in 1955. Initially undertaking rather routine translation work at Harvard University she found time to research and write and soon produced important books on the archaeology of eastern Europe such as the monumental <i>The prehistory of Eastern Europe, vol. I: Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Copper Age cultures in Russia and the Baltic areas</i> (1956, Cambridge Mass.: American School of Prehistoric Research). These established her as the foremost figure in the field and in 1964 earned her a full professorship at the University of California at Los Angeles where she worked until her retirement in 1990. There followed an enormously productive period during the 1960s and 1970s with surveys and excavations in Yugoslavia, Greece, and Italy. She brought together linguistic and folklore evidence alongside the archaeological material, focusing increasingly on the origins of Indo-European languages and their associations with Copper Age cultures of southeastern Europe. In exploring these questions she developed a series of ideas about the existence of a European mother goddess cult which she outlined in her book <i>Gods and goddesses of old Europe</i> (1974, London: Thames and Hudson) and which has found much favour with some sections of the feminist movement although not universally accepted.<br class=""nLine"" />[Obit.: The<i>Independent</i>, 23 February 1994]</div>"

<div class=""content"">A late Iron Age town of 720ha with impressive stone walls near Masvingo in southeastern Zimbabwe. Shona speakers occupied Zimbabwe Hill from about ad 1000 and later began building the stone walls. Between about ad 1100 and 1500, Great Zimbabwe was the capital of the vast Shona empire that stretched from the Zambezi River to the northern Transvaal of South Africa and eastern Botswana. Between 12000 and 20000 people lived within and around it. Social organization in the Shona was based on distinctions between commoners and a ruling class. The great size of the structures at the Great Zimbabwe was a symbol of the power and wealth of those who lived there. The Shona kings accumulated much wealth and prestige by controlling trade between the southern Africa interior and the East African coast. They also had connections further afield and Chinese stone and glassware have been recovered from the site.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: P. S. Garlake, 1973, <i>Great Zimbabwe</i>.

<div class=""content"">British prehistorian who specialized in the archaeology of barrows and pursued a relentless programme of field survey and recording throughout southern England. Born and brought up in London, he joined Barclay's Bank as a clerk after leaving school. In 1925 his parents moved to Brighton and within a few months he discovered the Sussex Downs and started a lifelong interest in barrows, especially finding and recording them. By the outbreak of WW2 he had surveyed and published reports on the barrows of ten counties in meticulous detail, using his skills as a bank clerk to tabulate the descriptions. During WW2 he was a pilot officer in the photographic branch of the RAF which took him to Egypt and gave him the opportunity to visit the tombs there. After WW2 he returned to the bank briefly, taking up a position to work on the Victoria County History of Wiltshire in 1947. After completing the gazetteer for Wiltshire he joined the Bristol City Museum as Keeper of Archaeology in 1952, remaining there until he retired in 1972. Throughout his time at Bristol, and after his retirement when he continued to live in the city, he carried on with his surveys of barrows and by 1993 was proud to have completed studies on all the counties in southern England. He was treasurer of the Prehistoric Society between 1947 and 1970, and had many other interests&mdash; folklore, music, place-name studies, Egyptology, and coins. He was appointed OBE in 1972.

<div class=""content"">A method of remote sensing by geophysical survey that can be used to provide a three-dimensional view of a buried site. The method works by systematically traversing a survey area with a portable radar that is directed downwards into the ground. A short pulse or wave of electromagnetic radiation is transmitted from the system into the ground. A receiver then records the reflected energy returned from interfaces between materials with differing conductivity or dielectric constants. The travel times of the reflections are also recorded and converted into depth measurements to provide a geo-electric depth section. By piecing together readings from across the survey area its is possible to produce, in visual form, vertically or horizontally sliced cutaways through the subsurface deposits. The reflections detected by the radar relate to changes of material at the interface of deposits and can thus be used to differentiate refilled pits and ditches, graves, buried paths and roads, air-filled chambers, and wood, metal, and stone artefacts."

<span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">The most famous and most thoroughly explored frontier system created by the Roman army. The main wall runs coast to coast across northern England for 117km from the Wallsend in Newcastle on the east to Carlisle on the Solway Firth in the west, with a continuation of the line as a series of forts and signal stations along the Cumbria coast. Construction of the wall began in ad 122 on the instructions of the Emperor Hadrian while on a visit to the province; it was completed in about ad 133. Various kinds of construction are represented along its length, but the basic idea was a stone wall punctuated at intervals of a Roman mile by small forts (milecastles) with turrets in between. Larger forts lay at intervals. There was a ditch on the north side, and a military zone on the south defined by an earthwork called the <i>vallum</i>, which is actually a ditch. The purpose of the wall was to control the movement of people in and out of the empire, and to counter localized threats and uprisings. Hadrian's Wall was abandoned between about ad 140 and ad 165 when the frontier moved north to the Antonine Wall, but otherwise it remained in place throughout the Roman occupation of Britain.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: D.

Between about 300 bc and ad 100 Hengistbury was the focus of cross-channel trade between Britain and France. The headland had been occupied much earlier too, with an Upper Palaeolithic (Creswellian) open-air settlement on the hill in the centre of the Head which, when it was occupied in about 10500 bc, would have overlooked a big river valley where the English Channel now lies.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: B.

From the 19th century more conventional excavations have taken place, although not on the scale of those in Pompeii. Little is known about the origins of Herculaneum, but the Roman town has the appearance of a quieter and less commercial place, probably based on fishing, and the streets are not so rutted and dirty.

<b>hermeneutics</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Th].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">The art, skill, theory, and philosophy of interpretation and understanding, especially in relation to reading texts. Originally developed in the 19th century by the German historian W. Dilthey and others, it revolved around perceived distinctions between natural and social phenomena, and hence the natural and social sciences with their approaches to the creation of knowledge: explanation (<i>erklaren</i>) and understanding (<i>verstehen</i>), respectively. Further development by Martin Heidegger introduced the concept of pre-understanding to the way people situate themselves in the world. This was taken up by H. Gadamer to constitute the basis of a <i>hermeneutic circle</i> . This tried to encapsulate the act of understanding or interpretation by recognizing that the relationship between a person and the perceived world in which they exist is always historically located and set within a tradition that is credited with authority. More recently still, Anthony Giddens has suggested a double hermeneutic circle in the sense that the responses that an individual gets from their engagement with the world within the framework of underlying pre-knowledge itself loops back to modify that pre-knowledge for future engagements. In archaeology this has three main areas of application. The first is in terms of exploring ancient material culture, explicitly recognizing the pre-knowledge that has gone into its development and deployment. The second is in relation to the archaeological process and the way that research unfolds in a kind of spiral action in which the knowledge created by one phase of enquiry becomes the pre-knowledge for the next. The third is in relation to the way that here in the present archaeologists give means to material culture that was produced in the past."

<span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Hallstatt-period hillfort of about 3ha overlooking the River Danube in southern Germany. Extensive excavations directed by Kurt Bittel between 1950 and 1958 and by Egon Gersbach between 1963 and 1979 have revealed that the hilltop had first been occupied in the Bronze Age, but abandoned during the early Iron Age (Hallstatt C). During the 7th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> it was re-occupied and from this period (Hallstatt D1) there are five main building phases. In the early 7th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> the defences comprised a traditional timber-framed box rampart with a wall of timber back and front. This was replaced around 550 bc by a remarkable defensive system in a distinctively Greek style of construction. A wall was built of mud brick on a limestone foundation, punctuated by projecting bastions to allow cross-firing against anyone attacking the wall. Inside were rectangular houses of timber construction. This evidence of Greek influence is also reflected in the finds from the second phase, which include <a href=""entry://Attic black-figure ware""><span class=""links"">ATTIC BLACK-FIGURE WARE</span></a>, wine amphorae imported from the Greek colony at Massalia, and coral. There was also extensive evidence for local manufacturing and trade.

<div class=""content"">Distinguished British prehistorian, well known for his work on early farming and as the founder of the palaeoeconomic school of archaeology. Born in Shropshire, he did not take up archaeology until he was 47. Before that he took a degree in agricultural economics at London University before living for a while as a professional card player, construction worker, and hill farmer. In 1954 he entered the two-year postgraduate programme in archaeology at Cambridge and the combined influences of Charles McBurney and Grahame Clark got him hooked on archaeology.

They are generally free-standing, with a shaft that is square or nearly square in cross-section, standing on a base or plinth (socle), and frequently carved with decorative panels. Two types of cross-head have been recognized: free-armed, which characterizes the earlier (pre-Viking) crosses; and the ringed or infilled cross-head which characterizes the Viking and later examples. The role of these monuments varied from place to place. Some were cenotaphs, while others were meeting places with a role in the ritual geography of religious communities."

Their history has three main phases, representing cycles of integration, expansion, and collapse. The Old Kingdom (<i>c.</i>1750&ndash;1450 bc) had its capital at Kussara (Hattusas) and later at Boghaz Köy. Mursilis I expanded control by overrunning north Syria in about 1600 bc and pushing as far as Babylon. Under the Empire (<i>c.</i>1450&ndash;1200 bc) a stable state was built up covering most of Anatolia and north Syria, displacing the kingdom of the Mitanni, and successfully challenging both Assyria and Egypt. The end of the Empire came suddenly in about 1200 bc when it was overwhelmed by invaders, the identity of whom is uncertain but who were probably part of the general movements of people in the period of unrest in the Mediterranean at the time. During the third phase (<i>c.</i>1200&ndash;720 bc) areas such as north Syria continued as neo-Hittite city-states, but in the early 1st millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> the Hittite empire came under <a href=""entry://Assyrian civilization""><span class=""links"">ASSYRIAN</span></a> rule after the defeat of the Hittite army by Sargon II <i>c.</i>720 bc.

After service in the Royal Naval Dockyard in Rosyth during WW2 he returned to Cambridge in 1945 and in 1947 took up a lectureship there. Throughout his career since leaving Cambridge he pursued an interest in archaeology, at first studying barrows and burial sites and later hillforts. His interest grew, and in 1949 he applied for and got the post of secretary to the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire.

<div class=""content"">An early and long-lived human species (the name means ‘upright man’) that appeared about 1.8 million years ago and survived until at least 250000 years ago. It is the first human species found outside Africa and appears to have colonized Asia, Indonesia, and Europe around 1 million years ago. The ancestry of <i>Homo erectus</i> is uncertain. The species may have derived directly from the Australopithecines, but differed from them in a number of ways: <i>homo erectus</i> was heavier and taller, had a more linear body form, better bipedal movement, less sexual dimorphism, and a larger brain. <i>Homo erectus</i> was also the first hominid to have a projecting nose.

<b>Homo sapiens</b></b>

Although it is generally believed that this species emerged about 40000 years ago, claims of exceptionally early finds dating back to between 130000 and 70000 years ago have been made for fossils found in Africa and the Levant. The toolmaking traditions of the Upper Palaeolithic outside Africa are associated with modern humans, and these date back to about 40000 years ago too. The main controversy surrounding the origin of <i>Homo sapiens</i> is whether they are all descendants of early examples in Africa or whether there was local multi-regional development from <i>Homo erectus</i>. In the <i>multiregional hypothesis</i>, advocated by Milford Wolpoff, Alan Thorne, and others, it is believed that major population groups established in Africa, Europe, Asia, and Indonesia all developed in parallel, with some gene flows between regions, and with no one region developing modern humans any earlier than any of the others. The <i>out of Africa model</i>, also known as the African replacement hypothesis, is championed by Chris Stringer, Rebecca Cann, Alan Wilson, and others and suggests that regional groups of <i>Homo erectus</i> developed independent evolutionary trajectories, leading, for example, to the appearance of <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>, but that these were overtaken and eventually replaced modern humans, who had evolved from <i>Homo erectus</i> in Africa and spread rapidly to other areas."

<div class=""content"">Hopewellian communities living in and around the Ohio and Mississippi valleys acquired a very wide range of exotic goods and raw materials from all over North America. Native copper from around the Great Lakes to the north, silver from near Cobalt, Ontario, obsidian from the Yellowstone area of Wyoming, meteoric iron from a number of different meteor falls, marine shells, shark and alligator teeth from Florida, grizzly bear teeth from the Rocky Mountains, and mica, quartz crystal, and chlorite from the Appalachians. How these items and materials were acquired is not exactly known. Expeditions to remote sources may have been responsible in some cases, but the majority probably arrived through ‘down-the-line’ exchange between villages, the trade being controlled by some kind of elite or local ‘big men’."

<b>Hopewellian Culture</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Middle Woodland Stage communities occupying the Ohio Valley and much of the eastern woodlands and midwest of North America in the period <i>c.</i>200 bc to ad 400. Named after the owner of a farm in Ross County, Ohio, Hopewellian Culture developed out of the Adena Complex of the eastern woodlands to become one of the most remarkable cultural traditions in North America.<br class=""nLine"" />Characteristic Hopewellian material culture includes pottery with deeply incised or rocker-stamped decoration, broad-bladed chipped stone points, and small stone platform-pipes for smoking tobacco. These pipes were often carved in zoomorphic forms.<br class=""nLine"" />Settlements were semi-permanent or permanent hamlets and villages, often in river valleys and at intervals of about 20km. Houses were rectangular or oval in plan, built with wood forming a frame, over which mats and animal skins would be stretched. The subsistence base mainly depended on hunting and gathering. Small mammals, turkeys, fish, and shellfish were important foods, as too were hickory nuts. Some maize may have been cultivated, but was probably not a major component of diet.<br class=""nLine"" />The Hopewellian is best known for its ceremonial centres, of which the largest were those built in the Ohio Valley. Each centre typically comprises one or more earthwork enclosures containing burial mounds. Both cremation and inhumation burials are known, although inhumation appears to have been reserved for the elite. The burial rites involved placing the dead person in a charnel house made of wooden posts, burning it, and then constructing a mound over the top. The elite were often buried in log-lined tombs within the charnel houses, accompanied by a selection of rich grave goods.<br class=""nLine"" />Extensive trading links known as the <a href=""entry://Hopewell Interaction Sphere""><span class=""links"">HOPEWELL INTERACTION SPHERE</span></a> are reflected in the range of imported goods and raw materials. The Hopewellian Culture had many local styles and regional variations (e.g. Havana Hopewellian, Illinois Hopewellian, Marksville Hopewellian), the differences sometimes being greater than the similarities. Throughout, however, artistic expression and craftsmanship were of a high level and many fine artefacts were created or acquired by Hopewellian communities."

<div class=""content"">Renowned British local historian who did much to integrate archaeology with local studies and the understanding of the landscape. Born and brought up in Exeter, he was educated at Hele's School and the University College of the South West (now Exeter University). Youthful explorations of Devon and especially the Exe Valley started his interest in landscapes which he took with him to Bradford Technical College where he taught for a short time and where he saw the contrasting landscape of Yorkshire. In 1931 he was appointed assistant lecturer in commerce at University College, Leicester (now Leicester University). During WW2 he worked at the Board of Trade, and immediately after the war Leicester established a full department of local history with Hoskins as its head. In 1951 he moved to Oxford as a reader in economic history. He greatly disliked being at Oxford, although it was while there that he published his best-known book <i>The making of the English landscape</i> (1955, London: Hodder and Stoughton) at the head of a series he edited dealing with the landscape history of English counties. In 1965 he returned to Leicester University as Hatton Professor of English History, retiring in 1968. In his later years he developed a keep interest in popularizing his particular brand of landscape history, and between 1976 and 1978 made a number of programmes for television which made him a household name.<br class=""nLine"" />[Obit.: <i>The Times</i>, 15 January 1992]</div>"

<b>Inca</b></b>
<i>(Inka)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A late Horizon cultural grouping centred on its capital at Cuzco, Peru, which in the early 15th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> began expanding outwards through conquest and alliance to form the Inca empire. At its peak in the early 16th century, this empire stretched from northern Ecuador to south-central Chile, a distance of more than 4000km.<br class=""nLine"" />The period of Inca expansion began around ad 1410 under the semi-mythical emperor, or Sapa Inca, Viracocha, and was continued by his son Yupanqui (who assumed the name Pachakuti or ‘Cataclysm’ ), who defeated a series of neighbouring rival states and kingdoms including the Chanca, the Colla, and the Lupaqa. Pachakuti's son Topa defeated the Chimu in ad 1463, thereby removing the last serious obstacle to Inca dominance of the Andes. Topa became emperor in ad 1471 and proceeded to enlarge the Inca domain still further. Topa's successor Huayna Capac took more territory in the upper Amazon region and built a second capital at Quito.<br class=""nLine"" />The Inca empire was called ‘Tawantinsuyu’ by the Inca people, meaning the land of the four quarters. Each quarter was a large province which radiated out from Cuzco. The four provinces (Antisuyu, Collasuyu, Chinchasuyu, and Cuntisuyu) were each sub-divided into smaller regions, the boundaries of which broadly followed those of the conquered kingdoms.<br class=""nLine"" />At the head of the empire was the Sapa Inca who was believed to be descended from the sun god Inti. When a Sapa Inca died his body was mummified and thereafter became the focus of a cult. High-ranking officials in the Inca empire were recruited from royal lineages. Although the Incas generally left the social and political hierarchy of conquered kingdoms in place they required the rulers' sons to go to Cuzco to learn the Inca language, Quechua. Surprisingly, this was only a spoken language as the Inca did not use writing.<br class=""nLine"" />Sacred objects from conquered provinces were also taken to Cuzco to reside in the temple of the sun god or in some specially constructed shrine.<br class=""nLine"" />Over 30000km of paved roads linked Cuzco with the provincial centres, facilitating the movement of troops and the transportation of luxury goods. It has been estimated that there were between six and twelve million subjects within the Inca empire, so administration was a major task.<br class=""nLine"" />Agricultural land was divided into three divisions: that belonging to the temples, to the state (i.e. Sapa Inca), and to the landowning commoners known as <i>aylluses</i>. Every <i>ayllus</i> had to spend time working on the state-owned land and temple land as labour tribute or <i>mita</i>. Food produced for the state was kept in great storehouses and used to feed the army, officials, and those engaged on state projects. The main crops were potatoes, maize, and other grain crops. Specialist craftsmen produced ceramics and metalwork. All luxury goods were produced and distributed by the state.<br class=""nLine"" />The Inca did not build cities. The population was essentially rural with numerous small villages and towns housing less than 1000 people. The capital, Cuzco, was occupied only by members of the Sapa Inca's court and priests. The architecture of Inca centres is impressive, as is the quality of the building work done.<br class=""nLine"" />The Inca empire came to an end in the mid 16th century. Internecine strife and a civil war between Atahuallpa and Huascar, the sons of Huayna Capac, between ad 1525 and 1532 weakened the empire considerably. Atahuallpa won the civil war but within weeks was captured at Cajamarca by a party of just 168 Spanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro, and within a year Cuzco and the whole empire had been taken over by the Spanish."

"Indo-European","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Indo-European</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[De].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Term applied to a large group of cognate languages, including the majority of European language groups&mdash;Italic, Germanic, Celtic, Baltic, Slavonic, and Greek&mdash;as well as Indo-Iranian (Persian and Hindi) and Sanskrit. Many attempts have been made to model and explain the dispersal of Indo-European languages, a problem fraught with difficulties because of having to correlate linguistic groups with material culture, ethnic communities, and cultural groups. Following earlier work by Gordon Childe and others, Marija Gimbutas has articulated and elaborated the long-held traditional view which situates the homeland of a proto-Indo-European language in the Euro-Asiatic steppe of south Russia and western Asia. From here it spread into Europe with the single-grave, corded ware, and globular amphorae groups during the 2nd millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. A similar argument was elaborated still further by Jim Mallory in 1989, confirming the area north of the Black Sea as the Indo-European homeland and seeking its spread around 4000 bc, late in the Neolithic or early Copper Age of the region. However, the precise origins, timing, and social context of the language spread has been disputed by Colin Renfrew who forcefully argues for an origin in Anatolia and northern Greece and a much earlier spread, starting in the 7th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, linked to the dispersal of farming technologies and the classic Neolithic lifestyle."

"Indus Valley civilization","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Indus Valley civilization</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">An extensive civilization that developed on the plains of the Indus Valley of Pakistan and northwestern India in the middle of the 3rd millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> and lasted for about five centuries. Also known as the Harappan civilization. The discovery of the Indus civilization was a piece of pure archaeological research that began in the late 19th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> with work by Sir John Marshall and with the discovery of some seal-stamps at <a href=""entry://Harappa, India""><span class=""links"">HARAPPA</span></a>. Unlike many other great civilizations, no hint of its former existence came through in the later historical texts from the Indian subcontinent.The origins of the Indus civilization are poorly known. Certainly there are some connections with the <a href=""entry://Akkadian""><span class=""links"">AKKADIAN</span></a> period in Mesopotamia, but the extent of any influence is impossible to gauge. There does, however, appear to be a period of rapid cultural change in the Indus Valley about 2600 bc with the emergence of major cities such as Mohenjodaro, Harappa, Ganweriwala, and perhaps also Chanhu-daro, Lothal, Dholavira, and Kalibangan. A form of writing developed, still not deciphered, and there was agricultural intensification with concentration on barley and wheat. The peoples of the Indus were also cattle-keepers on a grand scale, with cattle bones representing more than 50 per cent of the material in any assemblage; there is also abundant cattle imagery in art. Long-distance trade both east and west is well attested, as well as internal commerce in artefacts and foodstuffs. Metal was worked and there was an early use of the fast wheel for potting. The central theme of Indus religion is the combined male/female deity symbolized by animal horns and broad curving plant motifs. There is some speculation that some of the beliefs and imagery represent a proto-Shiva or early form of Buddhism, but this is highly speculative. There is an interest in water and cleanliness. How and why the civilization came to an end is unknown. The major settlements were simply abandoned around 2000 bc, with no archaeological evidence for natural disasters or invasions by other peoples."
"industrial archaeology","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>industrial archaeology</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Ge].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A term coined by Donald Dudley in the 1950s to describe an emergent branch of archaeology that at the time was explicitly concerned with the archaeology of industry, with a particular focus on the surviving monuments and structures of the Industrial Revolution and later. Since then its scope has broadened to cover an interest in the industry and communications of any period in the past. Because of its interests there is a substantial input from related subjects such as engineering, architecture, building craftsmen, and experts in particular fields of craft or production (e.g., mining, metalworking, shipbuilding, and weaving). Although it shares many methods of fieldwork with other areas of archaeology its overall aims remain grounded in description and investigation and there is relatively little use of general archaeological theory to develop insights into the meaning and wider social implications of the material remains."

<b>infrared absorption spectrometry</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A technique of physical analysis used to determine the mineralogy or chemical composition of artefacts and organic materials such as amber. A sample is bombarded by infrared radiation, causing the atoms in the sample to vibrate at frequencies characteristic of the material present. That part of the radiation spectrum vibrating at the same frequency as an interatomic bond in the sample is absorbed, the rest is transmitted. Thus measurement of the extent of absorption at each wavelength in the range 2.5&ndash;16mm provides information on the interatomic bonds associated with the specimen and this can be used to identify the mineral phases and chemical compounds, both organic and inorganic, that are present."

<div class=""content"">The main UK-based association for archaeologists working in all sectors of the discipline which firmly establishes archaeology as a self-regulating profession. The IFA came into being on 21 December 1982 as the culmination of some ten years of discussion in Britain on the need for a professional institute. The objects of the Institute are to advance the practice of archaeology and allied disciplines; to define and maintain proper standards and ethics in training and education in field archaeology, in the execution and supervision of work, and in the conservation of the archaeological heritage; and to disseminate information about field archaeologists and their areas of interest. Central to its operation is an agreed code of conduct, which, together with other by-laws, all members agree to abide by. Membership is available at a number of levels depending on the level of education, training, and experience. Entry level is generally that of Practitioner, above which is an Associate Member, and then a Member, as a person's experience and career builds up. Membership carries the right to use the appropriate distinction&mdash;PIFA, AIFA, and MIFA respectively. Associate membership for students and those starting out in the profession is also available. Joining the Institute, or changing levels of membership, is attained by submitting for review and validation a portfolio or work and evidence of training and experience."

<div class=""content"">The first permanent English settlement in America, founded in ad 1607 by 105 settlers, on the James River about 24km inland from Chesapeake Bay. Originally, the town was the capital of Virginia. The early settlers lived off fishing, small-scale farming of maize, squash, and pumpkin, and trading with local aboriginal Indian communities. Some staples were imported from England. At first houses were timber-framed with wattle-and-daub walls and thatched roofs. Later, baked clay bricks were used for walling. Pottery and glassmaking also became local industries. The town had its troubles, however, with attacks by Indians, famine, fire, and civil strife. It was built in an unhealthy location and, once established, many of the planters preferred to live on their estates. Jamestown went into decline in the 18th century after Williamsburg became the capital of the colony. The US National Park Service took over the site in 1934, and in 1954&ndash;6 a major programme of excavations was carried out by J. L.

Excavated at various intervals since the late 19th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, notably by J. Garstang in 1930&ndash;6 and Kathleen Kenyon in 1952&ndash;8, the site shows a long and uninterrupted sequence from the Natufian through to the late Bronze Age. The Natufian levels date to about 8000 bc and seem to represent a hunter-gatherer campsite, although Kenyon discovered a rectangular stone platform that may have been some kind of shrine. These are followed by the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A levels (PPNA) at about 7500 bc: a settlement of 4ha was enclosed by a fortification wall that includes a large tower against its inner face. It is one of the earliest permanent settlements known. The houses are round and of mud brick. Subsistence here included cereal cultivation and hunting animals. The succeeding PPNB, dated to <i>c.</i>6500 bc, had rectangular houses with plastered floors. An increased range of crops was cultivated, and it is possible than domesticated sheep were exploited. Evidence of an ancestor cult was found in the form of plastered skulls with cowrie shell eyes. There was a break in occupation after the PPNB, but the site was reoccupied in late Neolithic and Chalcolithic times. This was the Proto-Urban phase dating to about 3200 bc, and it is from here the site begins takes on a distinctively city-like character, the earliest in Palestine. The middle Bronze Age town was defended by a <a href=""entry://glacis rampart""><span class=""links"">GLACIS</span></a> and occupied by the Hyksos; it was destroyed by the Egyptians in 1580 bc.

Excavations in the city have gone on almost continuously since the work of Charles Warren in 1867&ndash;70, rather little of the city's early history remaining visible because of the succession of destructive episodes in its more recent past.<br class=""nLine"" />The first major constructions on the site were the stone walls of the Late Bronze Age citadel, a Jebusite town that stood on the ridge of Ophel. Jerusalem was captured by the Israelites under King David in <i>c.</i>996 bc and they covered Ophel with their town. Solomon added the temple immediately to the north and a palace nearby. The city fell to the Babylonians in <i>c.</i>587 bc and was extensively destroyed. It was rebuilt about 540 bc under Persian patronage. The present plan of the city dates back to the time of Herod the Great, around 37&ndash;35 bc, who constructed his palace and a massive new temple mount over earlier structures. The city was again razed by Titus in ad 70. In ad 130, during the reign of Hadrian, it became a Roman <i>colonia</i> and was rebuilt. At this time the Jews were forbidden entry to the city.<br class=""nLine"" />In ad 330 Jerusalem was transformed into a Christian city, with a major phase of church-building patronized by the Byzantine emperors. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built by Constantine the Great; other churches include the Eleona Church and the Church of the Ascension on the Mount of Olives. In ad 638 the city fell into Muslim hands and, except for a brief period of domination by the Crusaders in 1099&ndash;1187, has remained so ever since. Muslims believe that Muhammad began his night journey to heaven from the city. The place where this happened is now under the Dome of the Rock, built in ad 685&ndash;92, and by far the most striking Islamic building in the city.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: K. M.

<div class=""content"">A deep cave extending nearly 2km into the hills of Guerrero east of Chilpancingo near the village of Colotipa. Important because of the polychrome paintings in some of the inner passages approximately 1.2km from the entrance which were discovered by art historian Gillett Griffin and retired Italian businessman Carlo Gay . The paintings are believed to date to about 1000 bc, the oldest documented in the Americas, and were done in the Olmec style, although the site lies well outside the heartland of Olmec influence. Among the images is a tall bearded figure in a red and yellow striped tunic, limbs clad in jaguar pelts, brandishing a trident-like object over a second, black-faced figure interpreted as a captive. Other motifs include the feathered serpent, jaguars, and crosses resembling St Andrew's cross. Throughout Mesoamerica, caves and caverns were held to be entrances into the underworld; this site may have been connected with secret rites celebrated by Olmec living on the edge of their domain.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: A.

An arc of stones may be the remains of a windbreak, while two grass-filled hollows may be sleeping places. Bone was not preserved at the site, but pieces of wood appear to show deliberate shaping and burning. Pollen shows that plants favouring a rather cooler and damper climate than prevails in the area today were present in the late Acheulean.

<div class=""content"">A large Maya ceremonial centre and settlement in the southern highlands on the western outskirts of Guatemala City. Originating in the Formative stage (early Pre-Classic), the most important occupation dates to the Miraflores Phase (<i>c.</i>100 bc to ad 100). From this period there are over 200 mounds of mud brick, some of several phases. Tombs were sometimes dug into the mounds, many with luxury grave goods and evidence for the sacrifice and ritual burial of the retainers of the deceased. Mound E-III-3 is typical and consists of several superimposed temple pyramids which in its final form rose to a height of 18m. Each successive building operation took place to house the remains of an exalted person, whose burial place was constructed in the top of the pyramid as a pit formed from a series of stepped rectangles of decreasing size. The corpse was deposited in the lowest, smallest part of the pit, grave goods being set on the steps rising up all around.<br class=""nLine"" />After about ad 200 there is a hiatus in the use of parts of the site, before a phase of regeneration and reconstruction in the Classic Stage accompanied by an influx of Teotihucán material. At this time the site seems to have controlled obsidian production on the Pacific slopes and contact between central Mexico and Teotihuacán. A group of temple pyramids and a ball-court were constructed near the centre of the site, and rich tombs continued to be built. Its wealth and importance may be related to the local production of cacao and cotton.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: A. V. Kidder, J. L. Jennings, and E. M.

<div class=""content"">British archaeologist best known for his excavations at Windmill and Avebury and his pioneer flights recording the archaeology of Wessex from the air. Born in Dundee, Scotland, he was a member of the wealthy Keiller family, well known amongst other things for their marmalade and preserves. Educated at Eton, at the age of nine he became sole heir to the company and his family's fortune, and devoted the rest of his life to spending it. He became interested in aircraft and went flying intermittently from 1909 onwards, becoming a pilot in the Royal Naval Air Service in WW1. After meeting and becoming firm friends with O. G. S. Crawford, the two undertook what have become historic flights across the Wessex landscape recording archaeological sites using a captured German Service Type F.KI camera purchased from the Disposals Board and a De Havilland Company DH9 aeroplane. The work was published in 1924 as <i>Wessex from the air</i> (Oxford: OUP).<br class=""nLine"" />One of the sites they photographed was Windmill Hill in Wiltshire, and in 1925, after it was threatened by the construction of radio masts, Keiller bought it and began excavating it. He subsequently bought further land in the area, including much of Avebury and the adjoining West Kennet Avenue. Though much of the work was done in conjunction with the Office of Works, the whole cost of undertaking it was met by Keiller . To provide a base for operations he established the Morvan Institute of Archaeological Research (named after the Keiller estate in Aberdeenshire) in a small building near Avebury Manor which is now the site museum. The excavations took place between 1925 and 1939, with restoration works thereafter to open the site for public viewing. In 1943 he transferred the whole Avebury Estate to the National Trust.<br class=""nLine"" />Keiller was not only interested in archaeology, however. Before WW1 he owned a car manufacturing company which in 1919 went bankrupt, but he was passionately interested in motorcars and owned a string of rather fast ones. He was an expert skier and was president of the British Ski Jumping Club in 1932. During his life he had four wives, a string of mistresses, but no heirs. Keiller was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1927 and of the Geological Society in 1928.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: L. J. Murray, 1999, <i>A zest for life.

<div class=""content"">The burial of a single adult male on land controlled by the US Army Corps of Engineers that has caused considerable legal and ethical turmoil over questions of ownership, cultural affinity, and the needs and desirability of scientific analysis. Known as the Kennewick Man, the skeleton was found in 1996 by spectators at a boat race after the remains eroded from an embankment. Upon examination it was found that, rather unusually, a stone projectile point was embedded in the pelvis. A radiocarbon determination dates the remains to about 7300&ndash;7600 bc (8410 ± 60 BP, UCR-3476). Initially, the Army Corps of Engineers proposed that the remains were culturally affiliated to the local Umatilla tribe and agreed repatriation. However, competing claims were brought forward, amongst them a claim by a group of scientists who want to study the remains. In September 2000 that USA's Department of the Interior determined its view that the remains were those of a Native American and were covered by <a href=""entry://NAGPRA""><span class=""links"">NAGPRA</span></a>. Five claimants were identified in the ruling and at the end of 2000 the remains were still in storage in a museum in Seattle.

<div class=""content"">British archaeologist who pioneered the application of stratigraphic excavation in the Near East. Born in London, daughter of Sir Fredrick Kenyon who was Director of the British Museum. Educated at St Paul's Girls' School and Somerville College, Oxford, where she read modern history and obtained a third-class degree in 1928. She took an active interest in the university's Archaeology Society and was the first woman to be elected President. After travelling to Zimbabwe with an expedition organized by the British Association she joined the team of archaeologists working for Mortimer Wheeler at Verulamium. In 1931 she joined J. W. Crowfoot's expedition to Samaria, almost single-handedly introducing British excavation methods to the region. Returning to work in Britain at Leicester and elsewhere in the late 1930s she was drawn into Wheeler's plans for the Institute of Archaeology in London, of which she was Secretary between 1935 and 1948, and Acting Director 1942&ndash;6. After WW2 she was appointed to a lectureship in Palestinian Archaeology at the Institute, but the political situation in the Near East prevented her from immediate involvement in fieldwork. Instead she excavated at Sabratha, Libya, from 1948 until 1951. In 1951 she became Honorary Director of the British School in Jerusalem and in 1952 she began a programme of excavations at Jericho in the Jordan Valley, followed in 1961 by excavations in Jerusalem. In 1962 she left the Institute of Archaeology to become Principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she remained until retirement in 1973. Although not always popular amongst her peers, her excavations and surveys fundamentally changed understandings of the prehistory of Palestine and the Near East. Her translation of the Wheeler box method of excavation to the Near East made such an impact that it is often referred to as the Wheeler&ndash;Kenyon method. In 1973 she was appointed DBE.<br class=""nLine"" />[Obit.: <i>The Times</i>, 25 August 1978]</div>"

<span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Minoan palace famed in antiquity as the home of the legendary King Minos, and location of the labyrinth with its monstrous bull-headed Minotaur. Situated in north central Crete, 5km from the coast, the site was known in the 19th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> and a variety of archaeologists including Heinrich Schliemann excavated there. It was the work of Sir Arthur Evans between 1900 and 1929 which really opened the site up. The earliest occupation extends back to about 6000 bc with an aceramic Neolithic exploiting the agricultural potential of the fertile and well-watered valley. By 1900 bc the Neolithic settlement had expanded considerably and even as early as 2400 bc had within it some substantial structures and the first signs of a densely occupied town. The main elements of the palace had been built by about 1900 bc, although it continued to expand and change. At the centre lay a great court, flanked on the west by a second court. Near the west wing were storehouses. Artefacts recovered from here and elsewhere in the palace showed extensive trading with Egypt and the Near East.<br class=""nLine"" />Around 1700 bc Crete was devastated by a massive earthquake and the palace was destroyed. The builders of the second palace levelled the earlier structure, removing many deposits in the process. This new structure flourished between 1700 and 1450 bc, a time when Crete reached its zenith of cultural sophistication and power. The complexity of the internal arrangement of the second palace is clearly the origin of the labyrinth myth, although in fact there is some order to the structure. The prime functions of the palace were economic and religious, and this is reflected in the remains found which include eighteen storerooms, seals and Linear A and Linear B writing tablets, and cult equipment. The Knossos throne room has a magnificent throne flanked by wall paintings showing griffins and projects an image of divine power. Around 1450 bc the town that had grown up around the palace was destroyed, the palace itself surviving until around 1375 bc. Its final destruction is linked to a Minoan rebellion again Mycenaean overlordship.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: J. D. S.

The area was discovered by Richard Leakey in 1968, and investigated in subsequent years. There are two cultural traditions represented. The earliest dates to around 1.8 or 2 million years ago, with material of a similar kind to the Oldowan from Olduvai Bed I. Higher in the sequence is Karari industry material dated to 1.5 million years ago and matching well the Bed II finds from Olduvai.

<div class=""content"">Archaic Stage site spanning the period 7500 bc through to ad 1200 in fourteen distinct cultural horizons represented by over 10.5m of stratigraphy. Excavated under the direction of Stuart Struever and James Brown in the 1970s, the site is important for its contributions to understanding the changing relationships between the occupants and their environment. The earliest levels show periodic visits by Palaeo-Indian groups. In Horizon 11, there was an Archaic settlement dating to about 6500 bc, a seasonal camp with temporary dwellings covering an area of 0.3ha. By Horizon 8, <i>c.</i>5600&ndash;5000 bc, the settlement had become more substantial and more permanent with timber houses. By Horizon 6, <i>c.</i>3900&ndash;2800 bc the village had expanded to cover 2ha with perhaps 150 inhabitants.

Dating from the late Pre-Ceramic period through to the early Horizon, roughly 3000&ndash;1000 bc, the site has four main phases. The earliest (Mito phase) is Pre-Ceramic, but includes the Temple of the Crossed Hands. Square in plan, this temple has a single entrance with a niche on each side facing inwards. Below each niche, modelled in mud plaster, is a pair of crossed human forearms, some of which are larger than the others suggesting perhaps a male/female duality. Around the interior of the temple is a low stone bench; there is a fire-pit in the centre of the floor. The second phase (Waira-Jirca) is associated with ceramics of the Zone Hachure Horizon Style and dates to <i>c.</i>1800&ndash;1150 bc. The third phase (Kotash) dates to <i>c.</i>1000&ndash;900 bc. During this time the temple was rebuilt following the demolition of its predecessor. New pottery forms are present, including stirrup-spout vessels. Maize was probably being cultivated at this time.

The earliest of these focuses on the lower Volga region and is characterized by its contracted inhumation burials which are commonly sprinkled with red ochre.

<div class=""content"">Iron Age site on the shores of Lake Neuchatel in western Switzerland, discovered in 1857 when the water level in the lake was unusually low.

Subsequent excavations by Emile Vouga between 1880 and 1885 and William Wabre and Paul Vouga between 1907 and 1917 have resulted in the recovery of a vast collection of objects, human skeletal material, and further evidence for timber structures, but no certain evidence for the purpose or nature of the site. While some scholars see La Tène as a settlement, others interpret it a timber platform on the edge of the lake, approached via timber causeways, from which votive deposits and perhaps burials were made. In support of this is the relative poverty of domestic debris from the site and the abundance of high-quality iron and bronze weapons and personal ornaments including: 166+ swords and scabbards, 269+ spearheads, 29 shields, 382+ brooches, and 158 belt clasps.

The term was introduced to the archaeological literature by J. Iversen in 1941 when describing the results of his investigations of pollen profiles in Denmark. He found charcoal layers associated with falls in the proportion of forest tree pollen, a rise in non-tree pollen, and in some cases cereal and cultivation-weed pollen at the same horizon. Iversen proposed that these changes were the kind of indicators that would be expected as a reflection of forest clearance for cultivation. The fact that these clearance episodes were not all of the same date, and that some pollen profiles had more than one phase of clearance, led to the suggestion that some kind of shifting cultivation was happening in the early and middle Neolithic of northern Europe. This is now generally rejected, although the term remains a useful one, recognizing that much early Neolithic clearance was highly localized."

<b>landscape</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[De].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Initially introduced into English with reference to paintings and particular ways of seeing the world from the Dutch <i>landskap</i>, the idea of the landscape has gradually expanded to embrace what is perhaps better described as the countryside. The historical depth to the landscape has in a sense been recognized since the time of the first antiquarian investigations; the contribution that the past makes to the present shape, feel, and form of the landscape, and our appreciation of it, is something that came into sharp focus through the work of W. G. <a href=""entry://Hoskins, William George""><span class=""links"">HOSKINS </span></a> during the 1950s and 1960s. More specifically, landscape is seen as the social construction of space, containing a bundle of practices, meanings, attitudes, and values. As such, it is a term appropriate to a humanistic understanding of the environment."

<div class=""content"">A major branch of study within archaeology that draws on archaeological, historical geography, human geography, ecology, anthropology, and place-name studies. A number of different approaches have been, and continue to be, used which fall into two main areas. First is the largely <i>descriptive</i> work of mapping and plotting archaeological features over wide areas and then trying to work out their sequence and patterns of contemporaneity. Such work usually produces a series of extremely useful phase plans or snapshot images of the physical arrangement of the landscape at a point in time. Second is the <i>interpretative</i> work that focuses on the social use of space by past communities, together with their comprehension and engagement with the world. The application of <a href=""entry://phenomenology""><span class=""links"">PHENOMENOLOGY</span></a> here has proved illuminating. The greatest significance of all landscape archaeology is the way it has replaced the focus on single tightly defined sites with an interest in much bigger areas that are more closely matched with the physical scale at which human societies operate."

Initially he was a magistrate working in the south of France but he gave up law to study palaeontology and from there to examine cave deposits containing the remains of early human communities. From 1863 onwards he worked in collaboration with his British friend Henry Christy, the two of them carrying out the first systematic studies of French caves in the Dordogne, including Laugerie-Haute, Le Moustier, and La Madelaine. Realizing that several different phases were represented in these sites they divided the excavated material into a series of stages: an early group with two subdivisions based on associations with cave bear and later with woolly mammoth and rhinoceros bones; and a late phase with two subdivisions characterized by associations with reindeer bones and later aurochs. These two main phases have become the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic respectively. They also discovered mobiliary art in a proper archaeological context, so helping the arguments in favour of the cave art of France being truly ancient.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: E. T.

<div class=""content"">A Palaeolithic cave site on a hillside above Montignac in the Dordogne region of southern France, containing what are probably the most famous cave paintings in the world. The cave was discovered in September 1940; it was cleared out and opened to the public in 1948, sadly without proper excavation. The level of tourist interest was such, however, that in 1963 it was closed to the public because of fears about the long-term survival of the paintings. A facsimile of the cave has been created nearby (Lascaux II), and this opened in 1983.<br class=""nLine"" />Little is known about the Lascaux cave and its original use; even the original entrance remains unknown. It seems unlikely, however, that it was an occupation site; rather it is seen as a place that was periodically visited for the purposes related to the paintings themselves.

There are about 600 paintings in the cave, including images of bulls, horses, and deer, and a range of other motifs. What appears to be a bird-headed man with a wounded bison and a rhinoceros is usually interpreted as a shaman. In addition there are nearly 1500 engravings, again of both animals and motifs. Some of the tools and equipment used by the artists, for example lamps, mixing pallets, mortars and pestles, and engraving tools have been found in the caves.

Between 1845 and 1847 he excavated at <a href=""entry://Nimrud, Iraq""><span class=""links"">NIMRUD</span></a> (thinking it was Nineveh), and while his methods were brutal compared with modern standards they were typical of the day and resulted in the discovery of a lot of structural evidence as well as artefacts. His book, <i>Nineveh and its remains</i>, published in 1849 sold well and allowed him to make good contacts. He resumed excavations the same year, and upon his return to England in 1851 prepared a second volume, <i>Discoveries and ruins of Nineveh and Babylon</i>, which appeared in 1853. It included a provisional chronology for the Assyrian kings and a description of their state. Layard subsequently became a politician and then British ambassador in Madrid and later Constantinople.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: G. Waterfield, 1963, <i>Layard of Nineveh</i>.

In 1919 he went to Weymouth College and then to St John's College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages for the first two years followed by the archaeology and anthropology tripos. Between graduating in 1926 and 1935 he led four expeditions to East Africa and established the sequence of early cultures in Kenya and northern Tanzania.

In the Levant the technique is also used in the Upper Palaeolithic. The technique is named after finds made during the 19th century at Levallois-Perret in the suburbs of Paris, and involves the careful preparation of substantial core prior to the removal of the intended flake. Preparation involved establishing a striking platform, trimming the edge of the core to the desired shape and working the surface to create a slightly domed form by flaking inwards from the outer edges towards the centre. The finished core before the flake is removed is often known as a ‘tortoise core’ because of its faceted domed back and flat underside. When the desired flake is detached from the core the flake itself (known as a Levallois flake) shows the scars of the preparatory work on the dorsal surface while the ventral face is smooth. Because of the wide range of cultural contexts in which this technique was used the idea of a Levallois Culture is now obsolete."

<div class=""content"">Early Neolithic forest zone communities forming part of the Volga-Oka Cultures of the 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> in the upper Volga and Oka rivers and their tributaries around Moscow in western Russia. In origin, the Lialovo Culture results from local later Mesolithic groups adopting the use of pottery and characteristically Neolithic stone artefacts from groups further to the south. The basic economy of hunting, fishing, and food gathering, and the settlement pattern that focused on lake margins and river valley locations, remained unchanged. Lialovo pottery vessels are bag-shaped with pointed bases. They are heavily decorated using the pit and comb technique, usually with horizontal rows of pits or patterns made using pits and comb impressions. Three main phases have been recognized on the basis of decorative patterns: early styles which almost exclusively use round pits as motifs; the middle style using comb impressions and pits together; and the late style which is predominantly decorated using comb impressions. It is possible, however, that these different styles of decoration represent spatial variations between contemporary groups rather than successive phases."

<b>Lindisfarne, Northumberland, UK</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">An early monastic site on a small rocky island accessible by a causeway only at low tide off the exposed north coast of Northumberland. In ad 634 King Oswald gave the island to the monastery of Iona. A year later St Aiden and monks from Iona established the monastery on Lindisfarne which soon became the centre of Celtic Christianity in the kingdom of Northumbria with associated houses at Jarrow, York, and Hexham. Its most famous bishop was St Cuthbert who lived there from about ad 685 until ad 687. From around ad 700, after the Celtic church had acknowledged the supremacy of the Roman church, Lindisfarne became the focus of a cultural renaissance in the region. This is especially well seen in the art of the period and in the beautifully made illuminated manuscripts, of which the best surviving example is the Lindisfarne Gospel dating to about ad 700. The monastery flourished until ad 793 when it became the target of the first Viking raids on Northumbria's east coast. The church and monastic buildings on Lindisfarne today date from the Norman period when a Benedictine monastery was established on the island.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: D. O'Sullivan and R.

<i>(LBK)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">The earliest Neolithic cultures in central and northern Europe, communities that rapidly established themselves on the loess lands of the major river valleys from the Czech Republic to the North Sea coast during the 5th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. A second rapid expansion northwards around the rim of the Carpathian Basin and into Poland and the Dnieper region of the Ukraine took place in the early 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. Some limited outwards expansion from these areas can be seen in, for example, central France and the Paris Basin, but it was the post-LBK communities who were responsible for moving off light loess-based agricultural lands. It is thought that the LBK developed initially from the <a href=""entry://Körös Culture""><span class=""links"">KÖRÖS CULTURE</span></a> of the northern Balkans.<br class=""nLine"" />The LBK is named after its distinctive decoration applied to round-bottomed bowls and jars: incised and sometimes painted wares with linear designs that include curvilinear, zig-zag, and meander patterns. Later styles include stroke-ornamented and punched ornament in the form of small pits. Other elements of material culture include stone shoelast adzes and a microlithic stone industry.<br class=""nLine"" />Settlements of the LBK are highly distinctive and very similar throughout the spread of the culture. They are mainly situated on the edge of river floodplains and are dominated by clusters of rectangular houses&mdash;small villages. The houses are typically 8m wide and up to 40m long. Some are simply dwellings, others are dwellings with a barn attached, still others have three components in the form of a central dwelling with a barn at one end and a byre at the other. All were timber-framed, represented archaeologically as sets of postholes and slots. Round about are borrow pits for taking clay to make wattle and daub walls. The villages were long-lasting, and while it used to be thought that LBK farmers practised slash and burn farming so that they returned to the same village at intervals of perhaps a century or so, this is no longer accepted and it seems that most villages represent the simple process of periodic house replacement so that there were always perhaps 5&ndash;10 structures standing at any one time. Richard Bradley has argued that the houses were left to collapse naturally when no longer required and that the decayed remains of these longhouses provided the inspiration for the construction of <a href=""entry://long barrow""><span class=""links"">LONG BARROWS</span></a> by later communities in more northerly parts of Europe. Some LBK villages were open sites, but others such as <a href=""entry://Köln-Lindenthal, Germany""><span class=""links"">KÖLN-LINDENTHAL</span></a> in Germany were set within ditched enclosures.<br class=""nLine"" />The LBK economy was based on cattle husbandry and the cultivation of cereals, mainly wheat and barley. Cemeteries are relatively few, but where excavated comprise inhumations and cremations in flat graves, some with grave goods. Also known as Bandkeramik, Linear Pottery Culture, or Danubian I Culture."

<span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">The capital city of England since medieval times, and of the UK in recent centuries, straddling the River Thames in the southeastern part of the British Isles. Although prehistoric settlements are known in the area later occupied by London, the major settlement on the site was the creation of a Roman town (Londinium) in the mid 1st century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>. In ad 66 the town was sacked by the Boudiccan rebellion. After its rebuilding it grew steadily, with a timber bridge across the Thames to Southwark by ad 70. The main town lay on the north side of the river, but was not walled until the later 2nd century when a fort seems to have been added to the north side. In its southwest quarter were a series of high-status and monumental structures including a temple erected in ad 294&ndash;5, a Mithraic temple, a large bath-house, and the governor's palace. Outside the walls were large cemeteries.<br class=""nLine"" />Although there is little evidence for occupation in the 5th and 6th centuries, London was chosen as the seat for the bishopric of the East Saxons in ad 604, and it was probably at this time that the cathedral of St Paul was founded. By the mid 7th century there was a port at London, and by the 9th century a substantial town was re-established to the west of modern-day Wallbrook, walled by <i>c.</i>1050.<br class=""nLine"" />The main consequence for London of the Norman invasion was the construction by <a href=""entry://William I""><span class=""links"">WILLIAM I</span></a> of the White Tower in what is now the Tower of London. West of the city there was also much activity around Westminster where an abbey existed from at least the 8th century and which later became the focus for a royal palace and the seat of power. Throughout the medieval period the city was prosperous with churches, monastic houses, merchants, traders, and industrial quarters all developing. The Civil War did not affect London greatly, but in 1666 the Great Fire of London caused much loss of property, as about one-third of the walled area was razed to the ground. The post-Fire reconstruction took many years but included great achievements such as Christopher Wren's masterpiece of architecture at St Paul's Cathedral.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: E.

"long barrow","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>long barrow</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A class of middle Neolithic burial monument found extensively across the British Isles and related to other contemporary tomb-building traditions in other parts of northwestern Europe, especially northern France. The essential features of a long barrow are: the long rectangular or trapezoidal mound of soil and stone sometimes edged with a peristalith, a dry-stone wall, or timber posts; flanking ditches or quarry pits from which the material to construct the mound was obtained; chambers within the mound built either of orthostats or timber; and some kind of elaboration to the higher and broader end of the mound in the form of a concave forecourt or façade. Much literature on the period distinguishes between so-called <i>earthen long barrows</i> in the southern and eastern part of the country and the stone <i>chambered tombs</i> of the north and west. Both are part of the same tradition of long-barrow building, although not all chambered tombs are long barrows (some are <a href=""entry://passage grave""><span class=""links"">PASSAGE GRAVES</span></a>, <a href=""entry://portal dolmen""><span class=""links"">PORTAL DOLMENS</span></a>, etc.).<br class=""nLine"" />The chambers within long barrows are located in one of two areas: terminal chambers that open into the mound form the wider higher end of the barrow, from the back of the forecourt or centre of the façade; or lateral chambers that open into the side of the mound. In all cases the chambers represent a small proportion of the overall structure, prompting speculation that the barrows may also have served as territorial markers. The burials are usually disarticulated inhumations, the corpses having been placed in the entrance areas to the chambers and then, bit by bit, moved further into the mound as they decayed and space was needed for the introduction of new burials.<br class=""nLine"" />All dated long barrows were built and used during the mid 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>; many show signs of abandonment and in some cases deliberate blocking after about 3000 bc. A number of regional groupings can be recognized on the basis of concentrations in the distribution and the use of particular architectural details, including: Cotswold&ndash;Severn tombs, Clyde tombs, Carlingford tombs, Wessex long barrows, Yorkshire long barrows, Medway tombs, East Anglian and Midland group; and East Scottish group."
"long count","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>long count</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ge].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A calendrical system for measuring absolute time devised in Mesoamerica during the Formative (Pre-Classic) period. The day forms the basic unit (<i>kin</i>), thereafter multiplying up into larger units progressing by 20s: <i>uinal</i> (20 days), <i>tun</i> (360 days), <i>katun</i> (7200 days), and <i>baktun</i> (144000 days). Dates are expressed as units in a five-place notation starting with the largest units. Thus 8.2.4.5.1 means 8 <i>baktunob</i>, 2 <i>katunob</i>, 4 <i>tunob</i>, 5 <i>uinalob</i>, and 1 <i>kin</i>. The Maya began their counting at a time equivalent to 3114 bc, perhaps marking some mythical event in Maya history. They inscribed their dates in the notation given above as hieroglyphs in which bars represented units of five and dots units of one. The long count system was replaced after ad 900 by a short count system in which the <i>katun</i> replaced the <i>baktun</i> as the largest unit."

The major settlements of the culture were enclosed villages, at Los Millares itself bounded by a stone wall with semicircular projecting bastions and an area of 5ha. Inside, the citadel occupies the tip of the promontory and is defended by three walls. Three smaller forts lie outside the main structure. Cemeteries comprise collective burials in passage graves. Grave goods found in the tombs includes pottery, stone tools, copper tools and weapons, and a variety of so-called idols made in stone, bone, or ceramic. Objects of ivory and ostrich-eggshell imported from Africa are also known. Beaker pottery is present in the later phases of the culture. At one time it was though that the Los Millares Culture developed as a result of colonization from the Aegean, but a local origin is now favoured, with the development of local elites controlling the water supplies to the arid lands in this part of Spain, and also sources of metal."

<div class=""content"">British banker, politician, and antiquary, later Lord Avebury, best known to archaeologists as the author of <i>Prehistoric Times</i> (1865, London). Lubbock became interested in archaeology at an early age and as a close friend of Charles Darwin was an early advocate of evolutionary thinking in his approaches to archaeological material. He published <i>Prehistoric Times</i> at the age of 35, introducing two new archaeological terms&mdash;Palaeolithic and Neolithic&mdash;as subdivisions of the Stone Age. The book went through seven editions, the last in 1913, and was enormously popular. It drew on ethnography to help interpret the archaeological material, and it also touched on one of Lubbock's other interests, the preservation of archaeological remains. Lubbock was the architect of the first ancient monuments legislation in Britain, finally succeeding in getting the Ancient Monuments Protection Act onto the statute book in 1882 after nearly a decade of negotiations. Outside of his archaeological life, Lubbock was a successful banker and a hard-working Liberal MP. Amongst his other successes in parliament was the introduction of a bill to establish bank holidays.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: A.

Born in New York he was a schoolboy boxer of note, taking his degrees at the University of Chicago and completing his BA in 1940 and his Ph.D. in 1949. He joined the National Museum of Canada as an archaeologist in 1949, remaining there until 1964 when the Tehuacán Project in Mexico was already well under way. This project examined the long-term cultural and environmental history of the Tehuacán Valley and was the first post-Pleistocene sequence for any region important in New World archaeology. It documented changes in subsistence patterns and the development of agriculture and village life which underpinned the rise of Olmec, Zapotec, and Maya civilizations. In 1964 he founded the Department of Archaeology in the University of Calgary, Canada, the first such freestanding department in the Americas. He continued this tradition and commitment to archaeology as a distinct discipline by spending the period 1982 to 1986 at the newly established Department of Archaeology in Boston University, the first such department in the USA. Between 1968 and 1983 he was director of the Robert S. Peabody Foundation for Archaeology in Andover, Massachusetts, but resigned after a disagreement with the governing body there about the allocation of funds. In the mid 1980s he established the Andover Foundation for Archaeological Research which served as a vehicle for receiving grants and running his projects for the rest of his life.

<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Late Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherer communities occupying much of northern and western Europe during the period 16000&ndash;10000 bc. The classic Magdalenian is concentrated in southern France and northern Spain, but it can also be recognized extending northwards into Britain and eastwards into the North European Plain in Germany, Poland, and as far as the Sudost River in Russia. The name is taken from the type-site rock-shelter of La Madeleine in the Dordogne Valley of southwest France. The Magdalenian stone industry is characterized by small geometrically shaped implements, especially triangles and semilunar blades, that were probably set into bone or antler handles for use, burins, scrapers, borers, backed bladelets, and shouldered and leaf-shaped projectile points. Bone was used extensively to make wedges, adzes, hammers, spear heads with link shafts, barbed points and harpoons, eyed needles, and jewellery. Their economy was based on reindeer hunting and fishing, and there is evidence of occupied caves as well as open sites. Some of the finest cave art in France and northern Spain can be attributed to these communities, as can a great many decorated bone and ivory pieces. The Magdalenian followed the <a href=""entry://Solutrean""><span class=""links"">SOLUTREAN</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Aurignacian""><span class=""links"">AURIGNACIAN</span></a> and was succeeded by the simplified <a href=""entry://Azilian""><span class=""links"">AZILIAN</span></a>.

The name Magle Mose means ‘big bog’ in Danish. The material culture of these communities is well known because a number of excavated sites lay in waterlogged areas and were well preserved. Their tools and equipment included microliths, woodworking tools such as chipped axes and adzes, picks, barbed points, bone and antler spearheads, and fishing equipment such as spears and fish-hooks. Wooden bows, paddles, and dugout canoes have been found. Some Maglemosian material culture was artistically designed, with decoration on tools and wooden canoes. Ornaments such as pendants, bead necklaces, and amulets are also known.

<b>magnetic susceptibility</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A technique that measures the degree to which a body of soil or sediment becomes magnetized when exposed to a magnetic field of known strength. All soils have some potentially magnetizable components, the nature of the ferrous mineralization and particle size being a major influencing factor. This allows apparently similar sediments to be distinguished from one another according to the degree of susceptibility. Especially useful for archaeology is the fact that the introduction of humic, organic, and burnt material, such as might be associated with settlements or areas of human occupation, tend to increase the susceptibility of soils. In archaeological prospection, systematically sampling an area of landscape may allow areas of high and low magnetic susceptibility to be recognized and thus settlement areas and activity sites to be identified. Within an individual site the technique can be used to characterize deposits and variations within them, thus allowing the position of houses, industrial areas, and middens to be recognized, and patterns formed by the recurrent use of certain spaces to be mapped."
"magnetometer","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>magnetometer</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Eq].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A portable device for measuring localized anomalies in the intensity and direction of the earth's magnetic field as a result of variations caused by changes in subsurface geology or as a result of human activity that changed the magnetic properties of the ground. Burning and the heating of sediments is the most significant factor, especially in detecting the presence of magnetically enhanced sediments in ditch fills, pit fills, and around structures. Ferruginous artefacts and deposits can also be located. A number of different kinds of magnetometer have been adopted for archaeological use. A <i>proton magnetometer</i> utilizes a sealed container full of water or alcohol in which is suspended a metal coil. When a current is passed through the coil the protons of hydrogen atoms in the liquid align themselves to its magnetic field. When the current is cut off, the protons realign themselves according to the local natural magnetic field, its strength being indicated by the frequency of their gyration on realignment. This frequency is transmitted back from the coil to the instrument where it is measured and logged. An <i>alkali vapour magnetometer</i> is a highly sensitive magnetometer that works at the atomic rather than the nuclear level. Developed by the University Museum of Pennsylvania University and Varian Associates in the 1960s it has the advantage of producing a continuous signal. Depending on the elements used, these instruments are also known as optically pumped magnetometers, optical absorption magnetometers, rubidium magnetometers, or caesium magnetometers. The last mentioned has become the most popular and in these the sensor is a glass cell containing caesium vapour at low pressure. Both the proton magnetometer and the alkali vapour magnetometer measure the total magnetic field so that systematic surveys across an area using close-set transects or a grid pattern will allow a map of magnetic anomalies to be built up. The resolution of the resultant plot, and the scale of the anomalies found will depend on the size of the sampling interval, the sensitivity of the equipment, and the magnetic characteristics of the area being surveyed. An instrument in which a pair of sensors is used, either one above the other or side by side, is known as a <a href=""entry://gradiometer""><span class=""links"">GRADIOMETER</span></a>."

This was followed around 3400 bc by the building of a long mound partly over the infilled ditches of the earlier camp. The site was not heavily used during Bronze Age times, but occupation resumed around 500 bc with the construction of a hillfort. This fort was remodelled several times by the 3rd century, extending to 20ha with three or four concentric ramparts and ditches and massive heavily defended entrances to the east and west. Maiden Castle was at that time a permanent settlement with stone and wooden houses linked by surfaced trackways. During the Roman conquest, the fort was sacked by Vespasian's legions. The Romans established a new centre for the Durotriges at Durnovaria (Dorchester), and the hillfort was abandoned until the 4th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> when a Romano&ndash;Celtic temple was built there.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: N.

He left soon afterwards, however, first to take a post as drawing master at a private school in Stratford-upon-Avon in England, and then to be a teacher at the College of Art in Boulogne. He was an active journalist and essayist and was very interested in art. He was first introduced to Egyptology by his cousin Nestor Lhote, and became hooked. He learnt hieroglyphics and Coptic and spent his vacations in the Louvre Museum studying its collections. In 1849 he was offered a post at the Louvre which he gladly accepted. The following year he began a series of expeditions to Egypt, initially to collect manuscripts but this soon turned into excavations at Saqqara where he found the burials of the Apis bulls and the jewels belonging to Ramesses II. His ambition was to establish a museum of antiquities in Cairo, and in 1858 Said Pasha the viceroy of the Ottoman emperor agreed to the plans. He founded the Egyptian Antiquities Service and what was to become the Cairo Museum (National Museum of Egyptian Antiquities). Later excavations included work at Giza, Abydos, Thebes, Edfu, and Elephantine. He was buried in a sarcophagus in front of the Cairo Museum.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: G.

<div class=""content"">Greek archaeologist well known for his excavations at Akrotiri on the island of Thera. Born at Lixouri on the island of Cephalonia, he studied archaeology and philology at Athens, Berlin, and Halle universities. His archaeological career began when he was made caretaker of antiquities on Crete, eventually spending twenty years there and becoming Director of the Archaeological Museum of Herakleion. In 1937 he became Director of the Archaeology Division of the Education Ministry, and in 1939 he was given the Chair of Archaeology at the University of Athens. In the same year he proposed the idea that the collapse of Minoan civilization in the Aegean was caused by the eruption of Thera in <i>c.</i>1500 bc. Later, in 1966, he discovered the buried Bronze Age port city at Akrotiri on Thera and spent most of the later part of his life excavating it. Marinatos also discovered the site of the battle of Thermopylae (480 bc) and the burial ground associated with the battle of Marathon (490 bc). Amongst his many publications is <i>Crete and Mycenae</i> (1959, London: Thames and Hudson). In 1955 he was elected a member of the Athens Academy. When the military junta seized power in Greece in 1967 he was appointed Inspector-General of the Archaeological Services, duties he was relieved of after the second military coup.

<b>Marxist archaeology</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Th].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">An approach to archaeological interpretation and explanation that draws on the work of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels to explore materialist models of social change and the central questions of social relations. Understanding who has power, and how that power is exercised, are seen as vital elements in explaining social change. Marxists regard each human society as defined and shaped by its ‘mode of production’, which comprises both the ‘forces of production’ (i.e. science, technology, and all other human and natural resources), and the ‘relations of production’ (i.e. the ways in which people relate to one another in order to facilitate the production and distribution of goods). Social organization and change are seen in terms of conflicts between segments of society: for example, those based on class, sex, or age. Among western archaeologists one of the first to draw heavily on Marxist theory was Gordon Childe who emphasized the forces of production as being fundamental influences on prehistoric economies, societies, and ideologies. In many of his early works he effectively challenged the fascist German-based views of prehistory current at the time."

Excavated in 1972&ndash;4, the three tombs each take the form of a massive compartmented timber box at the bottom of a deep stepped shaft.

The writings deal with such subjects as contemporary philosophical themes, early historical events, military information, astronomical and calendrical matters, geography, and medicine.<br class=""nLine"" />Tomb 1 is that of the marquis's wife who died shortly after 168 bc. The earthen mound was 16m in height. The contents of this tomb were very well preserved. The body and internal organs of its occupant showed it to have been a 50-year-old female of short stature. Details from the autopsy of the cadaver showed a variety of ills leading up to her death, including coronary arteriosclerosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and gallstones. The body had been wrapped in silk and laid inside four richly decorated nested coffins. More than 180 dishes, toilet boxes, and other lacquered articles, silk clothing, offerings of food, musical instruments, small wooden figures of servants and musicians, and a complete inventory of the grave goods written on bamboo slips serve to depict extreme wealth.<br class=""nLine"" />In construction and contents these three tombs are rather different from other Han princely burials in northern China and reflect the lingering traditions and material culture of the Chu kingdom, which had fallen to the Qin less than a century earlier.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: Q.

<b>Maya</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A regionally distinct cultural grouping, united by material culture and language, occupying eastern Mesoamerica from the Formative Stage down to the present day. During the Classic Stage from about ad 300 to ad 900 the Maya emerged as the most sophisticated civilization in pre-Columbian America.<br class=""nLine"" />The origin of the Maya is a matter that has attracted much research but little clarification. The ancestral lands were probably the Guatemalan&ndash;Chiapas highlands where, during the Early Formative, maize farming became widespread before communities began moving westwards into the adjacent lowland areas of Yucatán. Among the earliest villages known in the lowlands is Cuello, Belize, established about 1200 bc. Within three or four centuries, a network of small chiefdoms established itself across what is now Guatemala, Belize, southeastern Mexico, and the western parts of Honduras and El Salvador. Various models of what happened next, and how these chiefdoms became states, have been advanced. A common theme to many of these models is the problem of population pressure. Some areas, for example the Usumacinta and Belize River basins, were rich agricultural areas and here the population rose, with the result that agricultural land became scarce and warfare between local chiefdoms increased. The need for military leaders and for authoritative individuals to allocate land led to the emergence of an elite. Trade was also important, and there is some evidence for contact with the Olmec to the north.<br class=""nLine"" />After ad 800, Maya villages seem to have become more closely connected with one another through internal trade and exchange systems, most clearly seen in the distribution of Mamóm style pottery. At the same time, ceremonial centres begin to develop, leading to a two-tier settlement hierarchy. At Nakbe, Guatemala, a ceremonial centre seems to have developed on the site of a former village, perhaps indicating the centralization of local power. By 400 bc there were several ceremonial centres in both the lowlands and the highlands, each site including pyramids, temples, platforms, and stelae.<br class=""nLine"" />Population continued to grow during the late Formative (late Pre-Classic), and the transition from chiefdom to state seems to have happened around ad 250 in lowland areas. The two-level settlement hierarchy developed into a four-level system comprising villages, small ceremonial centres, large ceremonial centres, and regional centres. Large and small ceremonial centres were regularly spaced at intervals of 13&ndash;26km.<br class=""nLine"" />An elaborate calendrical system was evolved, not least to identify appropriate days for holding ritual and ceremonial events. The <a href=""entry://long count""><span class=""links"">LONG COUNT</span></a> calendar provides a valuable tool for dating Maya sites and objects.<br class=""nLine"" />Although irrigation was known it was not extensively used, and the economic basis of the Maya state was intensive but broadly based agriculture. In particular it focused on utilizing raised fields to grow maize, beans, squash, chilli peppers, and root crops. Settlement was mainly dispersed, with small hamlets of up to five houses arranged around a courtyard. Some of the large and regional ceremonial centres also acted as settlements and recent investigations around Tikal, for example, show that the ceremonial centre was the religious and administrative core of a city of perhaps 70000 inhabitants.<br class=""nLine"" />The Maya elite was engaged in exchange practices, building on the networks established during late Formative times. The commodities acquired included salt and grinding stones as well as raw materials such as obsidian, shell, and chert for the production of fine objects. Jade was the most precious material known to the Maya and was widely traded from its restricted sources in the Motagua Valley.<br class=""nLine"" />The ceremonial centres included temples, pyramids, ball-courts, palaces, and plazas, usually linked by causeways or wide paved roads. The massive monumental structures were intricately carved and decorated with scenes showing how the hereditary dynasties of the kings united with the gods.<br class=""nLine"" />After about ad 800, many of the Classic Maya centres fall into decline and population decreases: the so-called Classic Maya Collapse. Many causes for this have been put forward, including epidemic disease, earthquakes, drought, agricultural collapse, the severing of trade routes, a peasant revolution, and invasion. No one single cause adequately accounts for the process, and social and political factors may in fact have been the most important, especially the fall of Teotihuacán in Mexico before ad 750, and the power struggles and political unrest that must have ensued. Maya culture remained, albeit in slightly different form, flourishing in northern parts of Yucatán down to ad 1000 when Toltec invasions caused further changes. The Maya remained the indigenous people of Mesoamerica at the time of Spanish conquest, and there are about 6 million Maya living today."

<div class=""content"">A rock-shelter near the town of Avella in southwestern Pennsylvania investigated by James Adovasio between 1973 and 1977. The very extensive sequence of deposits in the shelter divides into eleven main strata. Dated by over 70 radiocarbon determinations, these strata span the period from the late glacial (before 30000 bc) down to historic times. The earliest artefacts come from Stratum IIa and belong to what is believed to be a pre-Clovis Palaeo-Indian tradition with small blades, a bifacially worked flake knife which the excavator called ‘Mungai’ and a lancolate projectile point. This material is not typical of eastern Palaeo-Indian assemblages and eight radiocarbon determinations date it to the period between 17000 and 11000 years ago. These dates have been disputed by the geologist C. Vance Haynes on the basis of possible contamination, while others have questioned such an early dating because the environmental evidence for the same strata does not match with the kind of tundra conditions which would be expected at this time. At present, however, the Meadowcroft is the best candidate for early occupation of North America.<br class=""nLine"" />Later deposits include Archaic and Woodland Stage occupation, all with acceptable radiocarbon dates and associated cultural material.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: J.

<div class=""content"">A large tell (Tell el-Mutesellim) formed over a natural hill within the southern Jezree Valley of Israel, about 35km southeast of Haifa. Excavations by J. Schumacker in 1903&ndash;5 identified the site with the Biblical town of Megiddo, and this and subsequent investigations by Clarence Fisher and Yigael Yadin in 1925&ndash;39 revealed at least 25 major phases of occupation, beginning with sporadic occupation during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic. The site became a substantial town during the early Bronze Age, the early 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. It quickly became a fortified centre through its strategic position on the land route from Egypt to Mesopotamia. Megiddo was captured by the Egyptian king Thutmose III in about 1503 bc, and was subsequently transformed into an Egyptian garrison during the 15th and 14th centuries <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>.<br class=""nLine"" />During the late 2nd millennium and early 1st millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> the site was sacked many times. In the 13th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> it was in Canaanite hands and at this time a rock-cut shaft and a 65m long passage were built to give access to a spring inside the walls. In the 9th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> it was in the hands of the Israelites and from this period there is a palace, shrine, and stable buildings. The site became important for Phoenician trade too, and among a number of notable finds there is a hoard of 400 Phoenician ivories.<br class=""nLine"" />The town was destroyed at the end of the 8th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, and, although rebuilt under Persian domination, it declined into insignificance during the Hellenistic period.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: G.

<div class=""content"">A cultural-historical classification for eastern parts of North America developed by W. C. McKern and colleagues during the 1930s. Based on artefact classifications, the system was at first simply a taxonomy with no direct relationship to time or space. A hierarchy of traits reflected in specific items and assemblages was created, the smallest unit being a <i>component</i> (a site or a layer within a site), gradually building up through <i>focus</i>, <i>aspect</i>, <i>phase</i>, and <i>pattern</i>, to <i>base</i> which represented the most generalized grouping of cultural traits. In time, however, the system became sufficiently elaborate that its taxonomic categories acquired chronological and spatial definition."

Trees are cut down in December, brush and scrub being continually cleared in ensuing months, and the dried vegetation is burnt the following April.

If the rains come on time in May the seeds will be well watered and produce a good crop. Fertility depends on the quality and thickness of the ash layer. Few milpa plots allow more than two years cultivation, often with up to twenty years left fallow in between for trees to regenerate and provide the fuel to supply the next layer of ash."

<b>mine</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Any kind of excavation into the ground for the purpose of extracting some kind of raw material such as stone, metal ore, coal, or flint. The simplest mines are basically pits sunk into the ground to find or follow outcrops of the desired material; these can be described as <i>open&ndash;cast mines</i> . Lines of shallow extraction pits following surface outcrops of metal ore are known as <i>rakes</i> . Deeper, rather cylindrical holes may be described as <i>simple shaft mines</i> . Examples where the shaft is expanded at the bottom to maximize the area available for extracting a particular layer of material are known as <i>bell pits</i> . Shafts that provide access to a series of galleries that follow seams of material underground are known as <i>galleried shaft mines</i> . Pits that run horizontally into a hill slope or cliff following material into the slope are known as <i>adits</i> or <i>drift mines</i> . The techniques of mining developed steadily from Neolithic times onwards in most parts of the world, the use of fire-setting and stone mauls being the commonest way of extracting hard rocks until hardened iron or steel tools became available in later medieval times. The use of drills and explosives appears from the 18th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>. In prehistoric times, soft rock such as gravel or chalk was excavated using bone and antler tools and stone and flint axes. The archaeology of mines and mining is often rather complicated because as well as the underground elements (which are often well preserved) there will be surface structures including spoil heaps, processing areas, working floors, a range of shelters and facilities, drainage works, and perhaps aqueducts, leats, reservoirs, and other water management works where water power was used or where material removed from the mine itself needed to be washed."

<b>Minoan</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A term developed by Sir Arthur evans for the Bronze Age civilization of Crete and surrounding areas, being an adaptation of the name of the legendary King Minos of Crete. The Minoan civilization emerged in the early 3rd millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> and is traditionally divided into three main phases, each with subdivisions: early Minoan (EM) 3000&ndash;2000 bc; middle Minoan (MM) 2000&ndash;1550 bc; and late Minoan (LM) 1550&ndash;1050 bc. Evans also subdivided each phase into three subdivisions denoted by Roman numbers (e.g. EM-III), onto which still finer subdivisions denoted by letters and arabic numbers have been added. An alternative scheme proposed by Nicholas Platon takes account of the architectural development of the civilization: Pre-Palatial (= EMI-III), Proto-Palatial (= MMI-II), Neo-Palatial (= MMIII&ndash;LMIIIA1), and Post-Palatial (LMIIIA2&ndash;IIIC).<br class=""nLine"" />During the middle Minoan period, urbanism became apparent, towns appeared, and the great palaces were built. At this time the Minoan civilization can be characterized as a palace-based redistributive economy in which food products, raw materials, and manufactured goods were collected together and redistributed from the palaces.<br class=""nLine"" />By the beginning of the late Minoan period Crete controlled the southern Aegean and the islands therein.

"Mississippian Tradition","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Mississippian Tradition</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Late Woodland Stage chiefdom-based farming cultures living in the southeastern parts of North America in the period <i>c.</i> ad 700&ndash;1500. The origins of the tradition are a matter of some debate, there being evidence of continuity from the Hopewellian Culture as well as some evidence for the diffusion or adoption of cultural traits from Mexico and Mesoamerica.<br class=""nLine"" />The standard plan of Mississippian settlements comprises platform mounds supporting temples and residences for the elite arranged around an open plaza and surrounded by numerous dwellings. Most settlements were situated on the floodplains of major rivers, but there were also some shifting farmsteads in adjacent uplands. Mississippian communities used shell-tempered pottery, including painted and effigy bowls, and a bow with arrows tipped by triangular chipped stone points. Maize and squash were cultivated in river valleys, and after ad 1200 beans were grown too. Hunting and fishing were also sources of food, as was the harvesting of wild food such as nuts.<br class=""nLine"" />Their religious system appears to have been devoted to maintaining the fertility of the land, centring on a god with solar attributes and associated with fire. Ceremonies at the mound-top temples were connected with the supernatural, expressions of ancestral obligation, success in food production, and burial rites for social leaders. Society was stratified and local chiefs appear to have been rulers of autonomous groups. Thus the Mississippian embraces a wide range of essentially localized groups: the Middle Mississippian, Fort Ancient, South Appalachian Mississippian, Plaquemine Mississippian, Caddoan Mississippian, and the Oneota. In the later phases, increasing competition for land seems to have provoked an increasing warfare, the fortification of settlements, and the practice of beheading and scalping."

Mithras is portrayed as a young man wearing a Phrygian cap, usually crouched on the back of a bull which he is killing by a thrust to the neck with a short sword. David Ulansey has convincingly identified Mithras with Perseus and shown how the tauroctony embodies cosmic symbolism relating to a secret knowledge of the precession of the heavens and Mithras himself as the ruler of the cosmos (<br class=""nLine"" />kosmokrator). Mithraism was a mystery cult that flourished alongside early Christianity and showed many similarities to it. As in all mystery cults the rites were kept secret such that the truth and benefits came only to initiated believers who had to pass through a series of seven grades of initiation. The disciple also underwent baptism, took part in the re-enactment of a sacred meal, and bore the seal of his discipleship on his body."

The site of Moche in the Moche Valley was the capital of the Mochica state and comprised two huge adobe platforms, an immense plaza, and an extensive residential area. Mochic society was stratified and militaristic. The Mochica state expanded through conquest, new territories being linked to the core area by a network of roads and paths. Fortified garrisons were established in some valleys. The construction of Moche was probably achieved through draft labour rendered to the state. Burial monuments are known, the higher levels of society being interred in platform mounds. Mochica pottery includes stirrup-spouted funerary vessels on which there are painted depictions of gods, ceremonies, and scenes from everyday life.

<div class=""content"">Early city on the west bank of the River Indus in the Sind region of Pakistan. During the later 3rd and early 2nd millennia <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> it was one of the twin capitals of the Indus Valley civilization. Excavated by John Marshall in the 1920s, Ernest Mackay in the 1930s, and more recently by Mortimer Wheeler in 1950, George Dales in 1964, and since 1979 a team of architects and archaeologists led by Michael Jansen, the city was set out on a formal grid pattern. Broad streets separated the blocks, each of which was provided with drains and densely built over with structures made of mud brick. Most of the buildings excavated appear to be dwelling houses mainly in the form of ranges of rooms opening from a central courtyard. A block in the middle of the west side stood higher than the rest and seems to have formed a citadel. The citadel is fortified with mud-brick walls and contains within it a ceremonial structure known as the Great Bath, the Granary, the Assembly Hall, and the College. The exact purpose of these structures is not, however, known.

<b>molluscan analysis</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Shells from marine, estuarine, freshwater, and land molluscs are well preserved in calcareous archaeological deposits and naturally accumulating sediments. By sampling such deposits and sediments the shells can be recovered and identified to species to reveal a great deal of information about economy and environment. In the case of shell middens, the molluscs mainly accumulate as a result of human discard patterns and thus mainly relate to the economy and eating habits of the community responsible. Other situations, for example buried soils, ditch and pit fills, slopewash deposits, blown sand and loess, old water courses, and alluvium, are important for their environmental evidence because most species prefer to live in particular habitats and rarely move far from home. A typical sample for analysis comprises 1kg of sediment wet-sieved using a 0.5mm mesh. Land Mollusca species can be broadly subdivided into: shade-loving woodland species; open-country grassland, arable, and scree-loving species; catholic species capable of living in a wide range of habitats; and marshland species who live in damp marshy conditions. Freshwater Mollusca can be divided into: slum species that live in small bodies of water, poorly aerated and subject to periodic drying; catholic species found in almost all freshwater contexts; ditch species that prefer plant-rich slow streams; and moving-water species that prefer large bodies of well-oxygenated water. Where accumulating sediments are available it is possible to take samples from different horizons and thus chart changes in local environment through time."

<b>monastery</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A monastery (from the Greek ‘to live alone’) is a more or less self-contained settlement constructed to house a community of monks or canons. The idea of a monastic lifestyle based around a religious community may have originated in prehistoric times, but finds its first expression in the Christian context in the eastern roman empire during the 4th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>. Two types emerged, the <i>cenobitic monastery</i> where a groups of monks lived a communal life, presided over by an abbot, with a shared routine of worship, work, and meals, and the <i>eremitic monastery</i> where monks lived in isolation in separate cells but assembled each Saturday and Sunday for common worship and to obtain supplies for the following week. The eastern monastic tradition, centred on <a href=""entry://Byzantine empire""><span class=""links"">BYZANTIUM</span></a>, was diverse, with no formal orders. As the influence of the church and the practice of monasticism moved westwards and northwards, however, specific orders began to develop alongside the early autonomous communities.<br class=""nLine"" />One of the earliest orders was that of the Benedictines, established by St Benedict towards the end of the 5th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, followed later by the Cluniacs in the 10th century, and the Carthusians and the Cistercians in the 11th century. In the early days monastic monks were generally lay people, with only sufficient priests amongst them to maintain the services to a proper level. Most priests were seculars, living in the world and working amongst ordinary people. Later, the proportion of priests in monasteries increased and a number of orders of canons appeared, including the Augustinians in the mid 11th century, the Premonstratensians in the early 12th century, and the Gilbertines in the mid 12th century. Another group of monasteries grew up around friars who although taking the triple vow of poverty, chastity, and obedience were mendicants who moved about the country using any house of their own order as a base. These included the Franciscans founded in ad 1210, the Dominicans founded in ad 1216, the Carmelites in the 1220s, and the Austin friars in the 1230s.<br class=""nLine"" />The physical arrangement of monasteries varied greatly through time and according to the needs of the communities who built and occupied them. Early examples tend to be small, with a church, domestic buildings usually arranged around a cloister, and a cemetery. Some later examples are extremely large and complicated structures involving not only the main monastic centre but various outlying farms and agricultural facilities (e.g. granges, coureries) that provided the wealth to maintain the community. By the high Middle Ages in Europe monasteries were some of the wealthiest and most landed institutions in existence.<br class=""nLine"" />Monasteries are known by a range of terms depending on the character of what they did and the religious order or rule under which they lived. Thus early monasteries may be associated with cathedrals, colleges, and minsters. Double houses include both men and women, often in different cloisters. Friaries were occupied by friars, abbeys were headed by abbots, priories by priors. Charterhouses were monasteries of the <a href=""entry://Carthusian order""><span class=""links"">CARTHUSIAN</span></a> order; preceptories were monasteries maintained by the military orders, the Knights Templars and the Knights Hospitallers; and hermitages and cells were small-scale monastic sites in the eremitic tradition."

At the heart of the grange were farm buildings, paddocks, gardens, granaries, industrial areas and workshops, and a chapel. Granges were especially characteristic of the holdings of Cistercian abbeys, but the system was imitated by other orders including the Premonstratensians, Gilbertines, and some of the older-established orders such as the Benedictines and the Cluniacs. Some monastic granges had particular functions, for example as agrarian farms, sheep farms (bercaries), cattle ranches (vaccaries), horse studs, or industrial workings."

The site was originally the tribal capital of the Aedui and is known from Caesar's account of the conquest of Gaul where he recounts fierce resistance in the area. From 125 bc, however, the Aedui were allies of Rome and in the winter of 52 bc Caesar stayed at Bibracte following the battle of Alesia.<br class=""nLine"" />Archaeologically the site is dominated by its defences which comprise a rampart nearly 5km long built in the <a href=""entry://murus gallicus""><i><span class=""links"">MURUS GALLICUS</i></span></a> style. Extensive excavations were carried out by J. G. Bulliot and J. Déchelette in the early 19th century, and since 1984 an international team of scholars has been working at the site under the aegis of the Ministry of Culture and Communications. Together these investigations have revealed an intensive occupation and evidence for extensive trade between the Aedui and the classical world. Site position is important as it controlled the passage of goods through the Saône and Loire valleys. Within the site its vast area was divided into quarters, each with its own distinct function. Near the entrances were industrial sectors with ironworking, bronze working, and many other crafts. At the heart of the site was a general market area with a space set aside for meetings and ceremonial events. The residential areas were well set out with wide paved streets between the houses. Some of the houses in the wealthiest sector of the site were modelled on Roman styles.

<div class=""content"">Zapotec capital set on a steep bluff in the middle of the Valley of Oaxaca which rose to prominence after about 400 bc. Four main phases in the development and occupation of the site have been recognized. In Period I (500&ndash;200 bc) the slopes of the hill were levelled off to form over 2000 terraces. An acropolis protected by stone walls lay at the centre. Inside was a stone platform surrounded by 140 carved stone slabs depicting contorted human figures. These were executed in Olmec style. In Period II (200 bc&ndash;ad 300) the first palaces were built, along with ball-courts, temples, and an arrow-shaped building in the main plaza. During this period there appears to have been extensive contact with Maya Lowland centres and the increasingly powerful Teotihuacán.<br class=""nLine"" />At its peak in Period III (ad 300&ndash;750), Monte Albán had an estimated population of 25&ndash;30000.

In 1869 he was awarded a Ph.D. in history with a thesis in archaeology. By 1863 he was employed on a part-time basis at the Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, moving to a permanent position in 1868. Between 1907 and 1913 he was state antiquarian and head of the Central Board of Antiquities and the Museum of National Antiquities.<br class=""nLine"" />Montelius's greatest achievement was in his work on the prehistoric chronology of northern Europe. In this he divided European prehistory into a series of numbered periods, three relating to the Neolithic, and six to the Bronze Age. Initially his analysis was done on the basis of artefact typology. However, he extended the principle of cross-dating, pioneered by Petrie for Egypt and the Aegean, to northern and western Europe, thus providing a chronological framework for his Bronze Age sequence. He was an exponent of the <i>ex oriente lux</i> theory that innovation in barbarian Europe was generated by impulses diffused from the more advanced civilizations of the Near East, as set out clearly in his book <i>Der Orient und Europe</i> (1899, Stockholm).<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: B.

<div class=""content"">French prehistorian best known for his work on the classification of Palaeolithic material. A pupil of Edouard Lartet (1801&ndash;73), he took the criteria of classification used in palaeontology and applied them to archaeological materials, especially tool types. He extended the geological system of periods and epochs into the recent past, characterizing each by a series of archaeological ‘type-fossils’ and naming them after a ‘type-site’. In 1864 he founded one of the earliest archaeological journals, entitled <i>Matériaux pour l'histoire positive et philosophique de l'homme</i>. By 1869 his scheme for European prehistory was fairly well elaborated and included: the Thenasian (for the now obsolete Eolithic), Chellean, Mousterian, Solutrean, Aurignacian, Magdalenian, and Robenhausian. Many of these remain in use as cultural-historical labels for bodies of material, but whereas de Mortillet saw each as a block of time they are now seen as geographically as well as chronologically defined entities.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: G.

<div class=""content"">Following the creation of the first public museum, the Ashmolean in Oxford, which opened its doors on 6 June 1683, many thousands of similar institutions have been opened worldwide. Over the centuries their functions and role have changed, although at their heart is the preservation and display of collections. So far as archaeology goes there are three main roles or responsibilities that are fulfilled by museums today: the long-term management and curation of archaeological materials and associated archives; the presentation of a selection of this material to a range of audiences through displays and other interpretative means; and the researching and investigation of both the archaeological dimensions of the material and also its cultural nature as one of the agents that help to create a contemporary picture of the past.<br class=""nLine"" />The means by which museums have acquired some of their collections have come under intense scrutiny and debate in recent years, especially in relation to archaeological objects and heritage materials. Most of the world's great museums built their collections through campaigns that literally mined the cultural resources of countries around the world. In 1970 UNESCO agreed an international ‘Convention of the means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property’ that has been endorsed by many countries. More recently a new body of legislation known as the UNIDROIT Convention has been drafted by the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law, and in November 1986 the International Council of Museums (ICOM) adopted a code of professional ethics that includes the need to consider the connection between illicitly acquired material and the destructive means by which such material is usually acquired. In the USA, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act adopted in 1986 mandates the return of all human remains and associated funerary objects to lineal descendants of the tribe from which the material was collected."

<b>Mycenae, Greece</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Bronze Age acropolis, ancient capital of Greece, and type-site of the Mycenaean civilization, situated in the Argolid overlooking the Plain of Argos in the eastern Peloponnese of southern Greece. First excavated by Heinrich Schliemann in 1874, and more recently by, amongst others, Christos Tsountas, Alan Wace, George Mylonas, William Taylour, and Spiridon Iavokides, the site is extensive and long-lived. The hilltop was first occupied in the early Neolithic period at about 6500 bc, with small-scale settlement continuing through into the Middle Bronze Age. It was at the very end of the Middle Helladic period and during the early part of the Late Helladic, around 1650 bc, that the site really rose to prominence. From the 14th century the city was surrounded by massive walls of <a href=""entry://cyclopean""><span class=""links"">CYCLOPEAN</span></a> construction, and was entered by the monumental Lion Gate built in the mid 13th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> on the northwest side. On the top of the hill in the centre was a palace and a megaron, with houses all around on the lower slopes. Outside the defences there were further areas of housing.<br class=""nLine"" />Just inside the Lion Gate in the western quarter of the citadel were the royal <a href=""entry://shaft tomb""><span class=""links"">SHAFT GRAVES</span></a> in what has become known as Circle A. Excavated by Schliemann in 1874, this consisted of six tombs dating to the Middle Helladic period, all richly furnished with weapons, drinking vessels, jewellery, face-masks, and pottery. <a href=""entry://stela""><span class=""links"">STELAE</span></a> carved with images of chariots, hunting scenes, and spirals marked the position of each tomb. Grave IV was the richest in the circle and contained the burials of two women and three men. These and other rich burials were considered by Schliemann to be members of the legendary House of Atreus recorded by Homer ; indeed he believed one of the gold masks he found was that of Agamemnon, ‘king of men’ who led the Achaean expedition to war against Troy. It is now known that Circle A pre-dates the Late Helladic prominence of Mycenae and the burials in it are thus too early for Schliemann's interpretation.<br class=""nLine"" />A second royal grave circle, Circle B, was discovered and excavated by J. Papadimitriou and George Mylonas in 1952, outside the citadel walls to the west. It was found to be slightly earlier than Circle A, dating to the 16th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, and with sixteen graves, slightly less richly appointed than those of Circle A. Later members of the royal family of Mycenae, those associated with the use of the citadel, were buried in the <a href=""entry://tholos""><span class=""links"">THOLOS</span></a> tombs to the west of the settlement.<br class=""nLine"" />The city seems to have suffered a severe earthquake around 1250 bc with further evidence of disruption around 1200 bc. At this point the palace-organized economy seems to have ceased, though parts of the citadel continued to be occupied until about 1050 bc.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: S.

Trade with the eastern Mediterranean was especially strong, but links also extended northwards into continental Europe, bringing, for example, Baltic amber into southern Greece.<br class=""nLine"" />The Mycenaeans used <a href=""entry://Linear B""><span class=""links"">LINEAR B</span></a> writing and occupied walled citadels containing palaces centred on a <a href=""entry://megaron""><span class=""links"">MEGARON</span></a>. Like Linear B, much of their material culture derived in adapted form from Minoan sources. In other ways they differed from the Minoans in being more warlike, having defended settlements, and a strong emphasis on weapons as grave goods.<br class=""nLine"" />Mycenaean power was relatively short-lived. Local unrest increased in the late 13th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, exemplified by the Trojan Wars. The civilization went into abrupt decline soon after 1200 bc. Many sites were abandoned, others decreased in size, and the palace bureaucracy collapsed. Many theories have been advanced to explain this decline, including natural catastrophes, invasions, and environmental disasters."

<div class=""content"">A hilltop enclosure west of Armagh city, the ancient Emain Macha, and the first capital of Ulster. Excavations carried out by Dudley Waterman between 1961 and 1971 show that the site has a long history stretching back to the Neolithic. The main use of the hill begins in the 3rd century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> with the construction of a massive enclosure 230m across and with a ditch 4.5m deep. Inside were a series of circular structures and monuments of which the most substantial was an earthen mound 50m in diameter and 6m high (site B). In its early life this comprised a ditched enclosure in which a series of periodically renewed figure-of-eight timber post-built structures were built. Finds from the site included the skull of a Barbary ape which is taken to illustrate the wide trading links that the site had by the middle Iron Age. The figure-of-eight structures were replaced by a single massive timber structure with concentric rings of postholes about 95 bc, the whole thing being rapidly filled with stones and then burnt before being encased in its mound of earth and stone.<br class=""nLine"" />The Navan fort passes into history as the ancient seat of the kings of Ulster and perhaps the setting for the epic tales of Cu Chulainn. When Emain Macha was finally abandoned is uncertain, but it seems likely to coincide with the establishment of a very early church nearby at Armagh, where St Patrick established the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: D.

The houses were constructed in the style of those further east: square-plan single-roomed structures made from timber and mud. A large structure in the centre of the mound contained terracotta female figurines and is thought to have been a shrine.

They had distinctive cranial features that included prominent brow ridges, low, sloping foreheads, a chinless and heavy forward-jutting jaw, and extremely large front teeth. Their brain size was comparable to that of <i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i>, averaging about 1600cc. Neanderthal skeletal remains have been found over a wide area of Asia, Europe, and Africa, and are regularly associated with Middle Palaeolithic flint industries that are characterized as the Mousterian. Dates for the skeletal remains and associated industries suggest that the species thrived between about 230000 and 30000 years ago. There has been much debate about both the origin and the fate of the Neanderthals. Their origins amongst the European <i>Homo erectus</i> now, however, seem fairly certain, both in terms of the traits revealed by the fossil human remains and the development of the lithic industries. Some scholars believe that the Neanderthal line leads to modern humans, but Chris Stringer and Clive Gamble have persuasively argued that the Neanderthal species was a dead end and that it was replaced by modern humans who evolved in Africa and were better organized and better equipped.

<div class=""content"">A technique for examining the spatial distribution of two-dimensionally recorded points, for example settlement sites within a river catchment. Assuming that all the points to be examined are contemporary and that all relevant examples are known, a series of statistics can be calculated by measuring the linear distance between sites. This can very easily be done using a GIS system. A nearest-neighbour index (usually denoted by the symbol <i>R</i>), is calculated from the ratio of the average observed distance from each point in the pattern to its nearest neighbour, to the average distance expected if the pattern were randomly distributed, which depends solely on the density of the pattern being studied. The index <i>R</i> varies from 0.00 for a totally clustered pattern through 1.00 for a random distribution to a maximum of 2.15 for a completely regularly spaced pattern."

It was also the start of intensified conflict between Babylonia and Egypt that eventually led to the defeat of Nebuchadnezzar's army three years later. This defeat may have stimulated further trouble for Nebuchadnezzar in the form of a revolt in Judaea which was finally crushed in 597 bc when Zedekiah was installed as a puppet king. Further revolts over the following decade led Nebuchadnezzar to lay siege to Jerusalem, finally destroying it in 586 bc.

From the 1940s onwards, neo-evolutionary ethnologists such as Leslie White and Julian Steward argued that, in different environments, very different cultures might arise from identical social processes.

<b>neutron activation analysis</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A method used to determine the chemical composition of various substances such as flint, obsidian, pottery, and metal found in archaeological contexts. It is generally non-destructive as it involves exciting the atomic nuclei rather than their electrons. The specimen is irradiated inside a nuclear reactor so that the neutrons will interact with nuclei in the sample to form radioactive isotopes that emit gamma rays as they decay. The energy spectrum of the emitted rays is detected by a scintillation or semiconductor counter. Constituent elements are identified by the characteristic energy spectrum of emitted rays while their intensity provides a measure of concentration. The time between the neutron activation of the sample and the measurement of the resultant gamma rays depends on the half-lives of the radioactive isotopes which range from seconds through to thousands of years. Generally a few weeks is allowed before measurement takes place.<br class=""nLine"" />Neutron activation analysis has an advantage over X-ray fluorescence spectrometry because it analyses the whole specimen as opposed to the surface only. However, care must be taken that the neutron dose is not so great as to make the specimen radioactive and therefore unsafe for handling. The technique is used less frequently than it might be because of the increasingly limited availability of suitable nuclear reactors."

<b>New Archaeology</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ge].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A movement that began in America in the 1960s, aimed at making archaeology more scientific, with explicit theory and rigorous methodologies. At the heart of the thinking was a positivist belief in the principles of the scientific method (especially hypothesis testing or hypothetico-deductive reasoning). In the USA many of these ideas were set out by Lewis Binford in his book <i>New Perspectives in Archaeology</i> published in 1968. In it he stressed: the need to use new technologies such as the computer for statistical and matrix analyses of data; the concept of the ecosystem for the understanding of the economic and subsistence bases of prehistoric societies; an evolutionary view of culture; the use of models of cultures that could be viewed as systems; incorporating an evolutionary approach to culture change; and a close relationship between archaeology and anthropology. In Britain David <a href=""entry://Clarke, David Leonard""><span class=""links"">CLARKE'S </span></a> book <i>Analytical Archaeology</i>, also published in 1968, took up similar themes, emphasizing particularly the application of systems theory to archaeological modelling.<br class=""nLine"" />Although the proponents of the New Archaeology were heavily criticized by more traditionally minded scholars, especially for their use of jargon and for dehumanizing the discipline, the basic principles became widely accepted. The product of studies that implemented and developed the ideas set down under the rubric of the New Archaeology is what is now often referred to as <a href=""entry://processual archaeology""><span class=""links"">PROCESSUAL ARCHAEOLOGY</span></a>."

<div class=""content"">The best known of the three large developed passage graves in the Bend of the Boyne between Slane and Drogheda in eastern Ireland, about 50km north of Dublin. The site was excavated by Michael O'Kelly between 1962 and 1975, and restored under his direction thereafter. The focus of the site is a vast circular cairn <i>c.</i>80m across and 12m high, retained at the base by a kerb of 97 boulders, some decorated in the style of British <a href=""entry://rock art""><span class=""links"">ROCK ART</span></a> known as megalithic art. It was built about 3200 bc. A passage, 19m in length, leads into the mound from the southeast side and gives access to a cruciform chamber roofed by a lofty corbelled vault. The orthostats of the passage support roof slabs, but at the very front of the passage is a unique ‘roof-box’ which allows light to shine into the tomb through a slot above the roof of the outer passage. This happens at sunrise around the time of the winter solstice, the first rays of the sun illuminating the rear wall of the chamber for about 17 minutes.<br class=""nLine"" />The passage grave was originally within a <a href=""entry://stone circle""><span class=""links"">STONE CIRCLE</span></a>, twelve pillars of which still survive.

<div class=""content"">Within the Gunung Subis limestone massif of north Borneo is a series of caves that have been used for burial and settlement over many millennia. The most important, known as the Great Cave, was extensively excavated by Barbara and Tom Harrison intermittently between 1954 and 1967. They showed that the site contained a long series of deposits starting in the Middle Palaeolithic with a pebble and flake industry. What is claimed to be an early <i>Homo sapiens</i> skull dating to perhaps 40000 years ago was also found, although the association between the bones and the charcoal that yielded the radiocarbon date is not secure. Higher deposits in the cave include flexed inhumations from the period 12000&ndash;15000 bc, and extended burials in wooden coffins or on mats from the 1st and 2nd millennia <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. The most recent burials in the cave are jar burials and cremations from the period 1500 bc through to about ad 1000.

In 883 bc, under Ashurnasirpal II, it became the Assyrian capital (Kalhu/Calah), a role it retained until 710 bc when the capital moved first to Khosrsabad and subsequently to Nineveh. In its heyday, the city was enclosed by a wall some 8km in circumference, enclosing at one corner a citadel that contained a ziggurat, temples, and palaces. The palaces have yielded the richest finds: enormous stone winged bulls, reliefs, and exquisite carved ivories that once adorned the royal furniture.

The exact rate of decay depends on the burial environment, but the relative ages of samples from the same environment can be compared by measuring the remaining nitrogen content."

Over time, however, they become larger and more complicated in their design so that later examples tend to have multiple towers with elaborate internal rooms and a warren of passages. These later examples form one component of fairly extensive defended settlements. The nuraghi of Sardinia are very similar in form and date to the torri of Corsica and the talayots of the Balearic Islands.<br class=""nLine"" />The Sardinian fortifications also give the name to the <i>Nuraghe Culture</i> which is associated with a flourishing bronze-working industry using locally available ores.

<div class=""content"">British anthropologist and specialist in the Palaeolithic period. Born in Amersham he was educated at Halloner's Grammar School and University College, London, where he studied geology both at undergraduate and postgraduate level. In 1934 he took a post with the Geological Survey but this was short-lived because a year later he was appointed to an assistant keepership at the British Museum (Natural History). Here he spent the rest of his working life except for a brief period back in the Geological Survey on war service. From the late 1930s he began working on Palaeolithic and Pleistocene sites in the Thames Valley. Early hominid fossils fascinated him and soon after the war he spent much time developing ways of dating early remains. This later led to considerable involvement with radiocarbon dating. Amongst his best-known publications are <i>Man the tool-maker</i> (1949, London: British Museum (Natural History)), and <i>Frameworks for dating fossil man</i> (1964, London).

Simply stated, the argument runs that as the climate got warmer and drier in the early post-glacial period people, plants, and animals became concentrated in relatively few and increasingly restricted fertile areas. The symbiosis that developed included the ‘domestication’ of plants and animals through the manipulation of their production and reproduction.

During the 12th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, the castle was elaborated and the cathedral expanded. An outer curtain wall was built to enclose the settlement, which by this time was a prosperous trading centre too. The final phase dates to the 1220s when under the guidance of Bishop Poore the cathedral and the settlement were moved to the present site of Salisbury and the existing buildings and structures demolished.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: RCHME, 1980, <i>City of Salisbury</i>, vol. 1.

<div class=""content"">Chiefdom-based civilization, the earliest in Mesoamerica, comprised of numerous small polities that flourished around the Gulf of Mexico in central Mexico from about 1200 to 600 bc. The origins of Olmec culture are not clear, some scholars preferring a local development involving the transformation of tribal farmers, while others advocate a migration from Guerrero or Oaxaca. High agricultural production was a key to their success, and Olmec communities mainly settled beside slow-flowing rivers which during times of flood produce fertile alluvial soils.<br class=""nLine"" />San Lorenzo, occupied 1200&ndash;900 bc, seems to have been the main Olmec settlement, supported by two other centres, Tenochtitlán (not the same as the Aztec capital of the same name) and Potrero Nuevo. All the Olmec ceremonial centres comprised complexes of platforms supporting ceremonial courts, house mounds, stone monuments (including carved stone heads, altars, and large free-standing sculptures), and large conical pyramids. The large stone heads are particularly distinctive, up to 3m tall, and thought to be representations of chiefs and the elite of Olmec society. The labour to build these sites was found from among the agricultural population living in widely scattered hamlets in the lowland areas of the country.<br class=""nLine"" />Trade was important and again focused on the ceremonial sites: obsidian, magnetite, serpentine, and mica were among the materials acquired through exchange. More local exchange networks must also have existed, and together with the long-distance network served to spread the Olmec way of life and the sophisticated cosmology that went with it over wide areas. Olmec priests had developed a 260-day calendar and a set of beliefs which involved a were-jaguar (a mythical being that changes from a jaguar to a human being) and a flaming serpent. The Olmec style of art is visible mostly in sculpture and is realistic in its representation of natural and supernatural forms. Craftsmanship of a very high order is represented in objects of shell and jadeite.<br class=""nLine"" />By soon after 600 bc Olmec culture was waning and the exchange systems had decreased in their intensity. The settlement pattern expanded and previously sparsely settled areas were infilled, especially in the Valley of Mexico. The development of the Olmec did, however, set the stage for the appearance of other advanced civilizations in the area in succeeding centuries."

<b>oxygen isotope analysis</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A method of determining patterns of climatic change over long periods using the ratio of the stable oxygen isotopes <sup class=""expo"">18</sup>O to <sup class=""expo"">16</sup>O as an indicator of the amount of water locked up in ice-sheets and thus of global temperature. Sea water contains many isotopes of oxygen, the most common being <sup class=""expo"">18</sup>O to <sup class=""expo"">16</sup>O. During cold periods the glaciers grow, water is drawn up into them, and the proportion of <sup class=""expo"">18</sup>O increases. When the ice-caps melt during periods of warm climate the proportion of <sup class=""expo"">18</sup>O decreases. There are two ways of obtaining data about the <sup class=""expo"">16</sup>O to <sup class=""expo"">18</sup>O ratio, both using measurements made using a mass spectrometer. The first is to use cores from the polar ice-caps which preserve layers of snow ultimately made from sea water. The second is to use the skeletons of foraminifera preserved in ocean-bottom ooze because these marine fossils had the same <sup class=""expo"">16</sup>O to <sup class=""expo"">18</sup>O ratio as the sea water during the time they were alive.

<b>palaeomagnetic dating</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A dating technique developed in the field of geology that dates rocks on the basis of polar reversals. Such reversals occur when the magnetic pole moves to the opposite side of the globe; this has happened many times during the history of the planet. By taking a sample of in situ rock and comparing its modern orientation with that preserved in the rock itself as a reflection of polar orientation at the time of its formation, something of its age can be established by reference to a master chronology of global reversals. For archaeology the main use of this technique is for deposits containing early hominids. Reversals in the period 1.65 to 1.0 million years ago, for example, have helped to date beds II and III at <a href=""entry://Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania""><span class=""links"">OLDUVAI</span></a> in Tanzania."

Aisles provided space for additional altars and chapels. The font used for baptism was traditionally adjacent to the main entrance on the south side of the nave. During medieval times the size of the parish church and the nature and extent of its decoration were largely dependent on the wealth of the local community. The church itself is usually surrounded by its graveyard, in which might be found a lychgate, cross, anchorage, bell tower, school, and a priest's house."

Pentelic marble is the main material used in its construction, the design and form of the buildings being widely regarded as the highest achievement in the <a href=""entry://Doric Order""><span class=""links"">DORIC ORDER</span></a> of architecture. In 438 bc a great statue of Athena in gold and ivory was dedicated in the shrine, where it remained until its transportation to Constantinople in ad 426.<br class=""nLine"" />After the classical period the temple was converted first to a church and then a mosque. It survived well until Turkish occupying forces used it as powder magazine; it exploded in 1687 after being hit by Venetian fire.

At the head of the Sik in the transverse gorge of Wadi al Jarra is the façade of a massive temple, Khazneh al Faraún, sculptured into the rose-red rock. Throughout Petra every available rock surface has been worked into a vertical face and in many cases sculptured into the façade of a temple, shrine, palace, or dwelling. Behind each façade is a large chamber hewn into the rock and entered through a tall rectangular doorway. In Roman times a large rock-cut amphitheatre with 33 rows of seats was added, as well as a temple known as Kasr al Bint Faraún. Later on the Crusaders fortified Petra and held it until the Moslem conquest drove the Franks out of the Middle East.

<div class=""content"">English archaeologist who specialized in Egyptology. Born in Charlton, Kent, Flinders was educated at home by his parents and through what he could pick up himself. At an early age he developed an interest in antiquities through visits to the British Museum, and in surveying structures and earthworks under the tutelage of his father who was a civil engineer. In 1877 he published <i>Inductive metrology</i> and in 1880 he produced an excellent survey of <a href=""entry://Stonehenge, Wiltshire, UK""><span class=""links"">STONEHENGE</span></a>, Wiltshire. These early publications stand at the head of a prodigious and wide-ranging bibliography. In 1880 he went to Egypt to survey the Great Pyramid at Giza, in 1883 becoming unpaid joint secretary and field director of the recently formed Egypt Exploration Fund, working first at Tanis. Petrie was responsible for advances in excavation technique and artefact analysis, devising a system of sequence dating of artefacts independent of period labels. Equally important was his recognition of Mycenaean and ‘proto-Greek’ pottery in Egypt and Egyptian imports in the Aegean, which formed the basis for cross-dating between the regions. In 1897 he married Hilda Isabel, by whom he had two children. He was elected an FRS in 1902 and a Fellow of the British Academy in 1904; he was knighted in 1923. From 1892 to 1933 he was Professor of Egyptology in the University of London. After 1926, dissatisfied with conditions in Egypt, he worked in Palestine until his death in Jerusalem in July 1942.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: M. Drower, 1985, <i>Flinders Petrie</i>.

Originally defined by Alfred Kidder in 1946, the term was modified to more or less its modern application by G. Willey and P. Phillips in 1958: ‘an archaeological unit possessing traits sufficiently characteristic to distinguish it from all other units similarly conceived, whether of the same or other cultures or civilizations, spatially limited to the order of magnitude of a locality or region and chronologically limited to a relatively brief interval of time’. Distinctive traits recognized through items of material culture or the content of assemblages are therefore used to define phases. Subphases may be identified as more sites belonging to a phase illustrate details of geographical or temporal variation.

<b>phosphate</b><i>(phosphorus)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ma].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Phosphates are naturally present in all soils at varying levels. Anthropogenically derived phosphates have their sources in a wide range of organic materials with the result that in occupation areas, burials, food-processing areas, latrine areas and animal compounds and droveways the phosphate levels in the soil can be considerably enhanced. Once in the soil, phosphate is generally fixed in an insoluble form to inorganic aluminium, calcium, and iron components, or associates with organic molecules to form insoluble complexes. Fixed in this way it can survive for long periods. In archaeology, identifying concentrations of phosphates through <a href=""entry://phosphate analysis""><span class=""links"">PHOSPHATE ANALYSIS</span></a> is extremely useful for the recognition and definition of settlement sites, and mapping the different levels of activity within a site.

The site has been excavated on several occasions since the late 19th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, most recently by Colin Renfrew in 1974&ndash;7. Three successive phases were represented: Phylakopi I&ndash;III, of early, middle, and late Cycladic date respectively. The first phase relates to the Grotta-Pelos culture, the first town being Phylokopi II built around 2000 bc, with a substantial perimeter wall. The town was destroyed in the 18th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, but was rebuilt and flourished again in its third phase down to the mid 14th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. The later phase had close ties with Minoan Crete and later with <a href=""entry://Mycenaean""><span class=""links"">MYCENAEAN</span></a> Greece. The administrative centre and cult centre have been identified. The shrines excavated in 1974&ndash;7 had a complicated history starting towards the end of the third city (about 1360 bc), and thus extending the life of the site as a cult centre. It is also notable that the shrines contained both male and female figurines.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: C. Renfrew, 1985, <i>The archaeology of cult. The sanctuary at Phylakopi</i>.

<b>Piggott, Stuart</b></b> (1910&ndash;96) <span class=""red""><b><i>[Bi].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">British prehistorian well known for his studies of the European Neolithic. Born in Petersfield he was educated at Churcher's College and later at St John's College, Oxford. After five years with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales starting in 1929, he went on to become assistant director of excavations at Avebury, Wiltshire. During WW2 he served in the army and from 1942 to 1945 was in India where, in the company of Mortimer Wheeler, he greatly advanced archaeological research, later publishing a book on <i>Prehistoric India</i> (1950). Upon returning to England he went to St John's College, Oxford, to take a B. Litt.; his thesis was on the noted 18th-century antiquary <a href=""entry://Stukeley, William""><span class=""links"">WILLIAM STUKELEY</span></a>. In 1946 he was appointed to the Abercromby Chair of Archaeology in the University of Edinburgh, where he stayed until his retirement in 1977. In 1953 he excavated at Stonehenge, Wiltshire, and in 1955 at the West Kennet long barrow, Wiltshire. His publications include <i>The Neolithic cultures of the British Isles</i> (1954) and <i>Ancient Europe</i> (1965). The latter remains a key textbook on the prehistory of Europe and illustrates very well Piggott's ability to synthesize large bodies of material into an informative narrative. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1953 and made a CBE in 1972. Piggott continued his academic studies after his retirement, from his home in West Challow, Oxfordshire. In this period he published important texts such as <i>The first wheeled vehicles</i> (1983) and <i>Ancient Britons and the antiquarian imagination</i> (1989). He was also productive outside archaeology with a volume of poems published as <i>Fire amongst the ruins 1942&gt;&ndash;1945</i> (1947) and contributions to other works.<br class=""nLine"" />[Obit.: <i>Proceedings of the British Academy</i>, 97 (1988), 413&ndash;42]</div>"

<b>Pitt Rivers, General Augustus Henry Lane Fox</b></b> (1827&ndash;1900) <span class=""red""><b><i>[Bi].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">British soldier, anthropologist, and archaeologist often regarded as the ‘father of scientific archaeology’. Born on 14 April 1827 at Hope Hall near Bramham Park, North Yorkshire, little is known of his childhood. He was known by his father's surname of Lane Fox until 1880 when he assumed the name of Pitt Rivers. In 1841 he entered the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, followed by a commission in the Grenadier Guards where he developed a special interest in musketry. He married Alice Stanley in February 1853, by whom he had six sons and three daughters. In February 1854 he went to the Crimea where his efforts resulted in decorations and mention in dispatches. In May 1857 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel by purchase; in October 1877 he was promoted to major-general, retiring in 1882 with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general. During his army career he developed an interest in archaeology and ethnography. After reading <i>The origin of species</i> on its publication in 1859, he developed a parallel theory of the evolution of culture. He was elected an FRS in 1876. The inheritance from his great-uncle (George Pitt, second Baron Rivers) of large estates in Dorset and Wiltshire in 1880 enabled him to expand the scope of his archaeological work and he spent the last twenty years of his life devoted to large-scale excavations of prehistoric and Romano-British sites. This work was done with a measure of technical competence unknown among his contemporaries. The results were published privately in a series of major volumes, <i>Excavations in Cranborne Chase</i> (1887&ndash;98). In 1882 he was appointed the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments for England to administer the recently passed Ancient Monuments Protection Act, 1882. He died at the family home of Rushmore on 4 May 1900.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: M. Bowden, 1991, <i>Pitt Rivers</i>. Cambridge: CUP]</div>"

The Plains Village Tradition is characterized by a wide diversity of essentially semi-sedentary village-based groups broadly divisible into those of the Southern Plains, Central Plains, Oneota, and middle Missouri. The subsistence base of all these groups was mainly maize and other tropical cultigens, although bison was a significant part of the diet in eastern areas. Many of the settlements were defended, with enclosed clusters of rectangular or square houses. Many of the Plains Village communities were in regular contact with each other and in the southwest area there was widespread contact with Pueblo communities to the southwest. Horses were introduced from the southwest in historic times and led to greater mobility, but this was short-lived as the village tribes were gradually destroyed by European and American diseases, spirits, trade, war, and treaties."

<span class=""red""><b><i>[Le].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Documents that set out the government's views and instructions on the way that each local planning authority in England should implement its responsibilities and duties in respect to town and country planning (spatial planning). Two such documents deal with archaeological matters: PPG15 issued in September 1994 entitled <i>Planning and the historic environment</i>, and PPG16 issued in November 1990 entitled <i>Archaeology and planning</i>. Both documents emphasize the interest and importance of various components of the historic environment and use the dual strands of the planning system to provide for the protection, conservation, and management of important sites, structures, and deposits and their setting. The role of <i>strategic planning</i> in balancing the needs of local communities and the preservation of archaeological remains is recognized, and the guidance recommends strong policies for protecting important sites. These policies will underpin what can be achieved through <i>development control</i> where the possible impact of individual proposals on archaeological materials is considered. Here the guidance provides an approach to the proper consideration of archaeological issues in which the prospective developer submits to the local authority the results of specialist studies (desk-based assessment and/or field evaluation or environmental impact assessment). The guidance places a responsibility on the local authority to have due regard to the preservation of archaeological deposits which are considered to be of national importance by making it a ‘material consideration’. If planning permission for a development is granted, the authority may, if it wishes, impose an archaeological condition (a specimen is given in PPG16) whereby the developer must undertake an agreed programme of archaeological works (known as a mitigation strategy) at their own cost. Similar intentions are set out in planning guidance notes issued for Wales and Scotland."

"plough","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>plough</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ar].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">An implement used in breaking up ground for cultivation which comprises one or more blades that are drawn through the soil, together with attachments for guiding it and providing the motive power. Ploughs are usually drawn along by animal traction (mainly oxen or horses), although people are occasionally used. There are two basic kinds of plough. The <i>ard</i> or scratch plough is essentially a single blade like a hoe set at an angle of about 60 degrees to the ground with a guiding handle behind and a beam in front for connection to a yoke and a pair of animals. An ard simply stirs the soil rather than turning it over. For effective cultivation an ard ideally needs to be used in two opposite directions, creating what is known as cross-ploughing. The earliest ards date to the 5th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> in the Near East, and were available in Europe by the middle of the 4th millennium. By contrast, the <i>mould-board plough</i> or heavy plough is wheeled and can be adjusted to control penetration into the ground. The shares comprise a cutting blade and a curved mould-board that physically inverts the soil profile. Such ploughs were not developed until the mid 1st millennium <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>."

<div class=""content"">Substantial Roman town of 65ha on the Bay of Naples in Campania, southwestern Italy, 7km from Naples. Discovered in 1748 and extensively excavated in the following years and down to the present day. The importance of the site lies in the fact that it was buried beneath volcanic ash and pumice in ad 79, perfectly fossilizing a functioning city. Excavations suggest that Pompeii's origins perhaps lie in a small fishing village established in the 10th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. It came successively under <a href=""entry://Etruscans""><span class=""links"">ETRUSCAN</span></a> and Greek influences, and in <i>c.</i>424 bc was occupied by the Samians. From 80 bc the town became a Roman colony in which many wealthy Roman citizens built summer residences. An earthquake in ad 62 caused serious damage, while the eruption of Vesuvius on 24 August ad 79 overwhelmed the whole town. Pompeii was a walled town with an amphitheatre, forum, basilica, several public baths, two theatres, and at least nine temples. Hotels, taverns, gambling houses, brothels, and a wide variety of shops and workshops have been uncovered, as well as private houses. Amongst the most emotive finds are the negative impressions of people and animals buried alive during the eruption.

<b>post-processual archaeology</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Th].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A term first used by Ian Hodder in 1985 to refer to a series of theoretical approaches deployed in archaeological thinking that share little except being critical of <a href=""entry://processual archaeology""><span class=""links"">PROCESSUAL ARCHAEOLOGY</span></a> while emphasizing social factors in the way human societies operate. Post-processual archaeology is not so much a coherent body of thought as a reaction against positivist approaches and their explicit use of models taken from the natural sciences. Post-processual archaeology incorporates many different approaches derived from <a href=""entry://Marxism""><span class=""links"">MARXISM</span></a>, <a href=""entry://hermeneutics""><span class=""links"">HERMENEUTICS</span></a>, <a href=""entry://post-structuralism""><span class=""links"">POST-STRUCTURALISM</span></a>, and constructivism, but is perhaps united in an interest in social ontology&mdash;the character of social reality. Here attempts have been made to provide archaeology with more sophisticated conceptions of past society and the tools to explore ancient societies through archaeological materials. Understandings of human behaviour must be sought in the societies themselves in order to identify specific and often rather idiosyncratic responses to particular conditions. Appropriate lines of enquiry thus include the investigation of social power, structure, contradiction, social change, and gender. A key concept here is that of agency&mdash;people are knowledgeable agents and thus attention should be paid to questions of intention, meaning, and the signification of action in order to understand past social phenomena. Also known as interpretive archaeology."
"post-structuralism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>post-structuralism</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Th].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A relativist philosophy based on the ideas and works of a number of French scholars working in the 1960s, notably Derrida, Lacan, Foucault, Barthes, and Kristeva, to develop earlier thinking by Hegel, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Freud, and Marx . The approach challenges the <a href=""entry://structuralism""><span class=""links"">STRUCTURALIST</span></a> notion that there are fixed relationships between signs and meanings, between the signifier and the signified, arguing instead that meaning is contextualized within the individual and highly nuanced. A general trend of post-structuralist method, often termed deconstruction, is to unsettle any allegedly firm, detached, or neutral conclusions on the basis that claims of truth are internal to any particular discourse. In doing so it opens up alternative readings and meanings."

Stones are often used to make a strong setting. Because timber posts rarely survive archaeologically the centre of a posthole is usually a negative impression of the post that once stood there, and this is known as the <i>post pipe</i> ."

"potassium&ndash;argon dating","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>potassium&ndash;argon dating</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">An absolute dating technique similar to radiocarbon dating but applicable to much older deposits. It is used to determine the age of volcanic rock strata containing or sealing archaeological objects rather than to date the artefacts themselves. The technique works by measuring the ratio of radioactive potassium-40 to the stable gas argon-40 in volcanic rocks. Over time <sup class=""expo"">40</sup>K decays to become <sup class=""expo"">40</sup>Ar at a known rate, its half-life being 13000 million years. In volcanic rocks any argon present will have escaped when the rock was last molten but will start to accumulate again when it solidifies. Thus by carefully measuring the amount of <sup class=""expo"">40</sup>K and <sup class=""expo"">40</sup>Ar present in a sample it is possible to work out how long ago it was that the rock solidified. Because of the long half-life of <sup class=""expo"">40</sup>K the amount of argon present in samples less than 1 million years old is insufficient to measure, but the technique is very useful for work on early hominid deposits associated with volcanic layers."

<b>potter's wheel</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ar].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A flat-topped horizontal turntable that can be rotated to assist a potter in shaping a ceramic vessel. Slow-turning wheels or tournettes were used from the 5th or 6th millennia <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> in the Near East to help true up hand-made vessels. From the early 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, however, fast wheels began to be introduced. Using a fast wheel a potter could centre a piece of clay while the wheel was spinning and then fashion the desired form of the vessel. The technique is still used today. Fast wheels may be powered by simply kicking a stone or wooden fly-wheel attached to the bottom of a spindle connected to the wheel-head (so-called ‘kick-wheel’) by using a treadle, or in more recent times by attaching an independent power source. Fast wheels began to be used in <a href=""entry://Minoan""><span class=""links"">MINOAN</span></a> Crete about 2500 bc, and were used in Britain by about 100 bc.

Upon returning to England in 1760 he became MP for Tregony in Cornwall. During the 1770s and 1780s he published a series of articles in <i>Archaeologia</i> and two books: <i>A treatise on the study of antiquities</i> (1782) and <i>An antiquarian romance</i> (1795). In these he explored the idea that the past can be reconstructed through the universal laws of human nature. Other themes that emerge from his writings include a concern for accuracy in recording antiquities, domestication, and the importance of separating fact from opinion.

<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Archaic Stage hunter-gatherer communities living in northern areas of North America in the period 1700&ndash;900 bc. There is much debate about the relationship of Pre-Dorset Cultures to the Arctic Small Tool Tradition and other related groups. Although the question has not been solved, the matter of seasonality may underlie some of the apparent differences. Pre-Dorset groups relied heavily on seals for their subsistence, hunting them at their winter breathing holes. Musk ox, caribou, polar bears, and other smaller animals were hunted with harpoons and bows and arrows. Fish, especially Arctic char were caught in weirs and traps and taken using fish spears. Pre-Dorset communities used bone and ivory needles to make tailored clothing. They kept dogs, perhaps for hunting. Camps are generally coastal. Summer dwellings seem to have been tents weighted down by stones around the periphery. Winter dwellings may have been built from stone blocks like the familiar igloos of more recent times. Heat and light were provided by soapstone lamps burning seal fat. The Pre-Dorset culture evolved into the Dorset culture around 800&ndash;500 bc, continuity being evident in the tool kits, although Dorset assemblages generally include more ground stone items."

Pueblo I (ad 700&ndash;900) was represented by increased diversity of house types, improved ceramics, and the appearance of kivas. In Pueblo II (ad 900&ndash;1150) surface dwellings became the norm, pottery decoration changed, and multi-roomed complexes began to appear. Pueblo III (ad 1100&ndash;1300) is marked by greater nucleation of the population in fewer but larger settlements, including cliff dwellings such as at Monte Verde. Pueblo IV (ad 1300&ndash;1600) saw the virtual abandonment of small villages and the concentration of population along the Rio Grande. Pueblo V (ad 1600&ndash;present) is the period of European contact."
"pulsed induction meter","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pulsed induction meter</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Eq].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A kind of metal detector used in geophysical surveying to detect primary metals and, under favourable conditions, shallowly buried features. A magnetic field is generated by a transmitted pulse in order to induce a magnetic moment in the soil and its contents. The magnetic moment continues to increase in magnitude while the field is maintained. When the magnetic field is removed at the end of the transmitted pulse, a small magnetic moment remains and the subsequent decay of this so-called magnetic viscosity induces a voltage in a receiver coil. The voltage induced is broadly proportional to the magnetic susceptibility of the soil and any materials in it at the point sampled. The technique is not very widely used."

During the <a href=""entry://Old Kingdom""><span class=""links"">OLD KINGDOM</span></a> such tombs became more elaborate and bigger, and were increasingly built from stone. The earliest pyramid is the Step Pyramid of Sakkara. The largest and best-known pyramids are at Giza and were built by Cheops, Chephren, and Mykerinus in the 4th Dynasty. The Great Pyramid of Cheops has a base-side length of 230.4m and was originally 146.6m high. It is estimated that more than 2.5 million separate blocks of stone were used in its construction. Elaborate rituals accompanied the burial of a pharaoh in his pyramid, witnessed by the presence of elaborate temples connected to the pyramid itself."

<b>rampart</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Co].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Technically an elongated bank or wall forming the defensive boundary of an enclosure. Most ramparts are associated with external ditches that provide an extra component of the defensive structure. The construction of ramparts varies considerably from simple mounds of earth and stone (dump ramparts) to elaborate structures involving timber frameworks (box ramparts and timber-laced ramparts), and stone revetted walls. Sometimes a stone rampart may be deliberately burnt to increase its strength and stability (vitrified ramparts). The size of many prehistoric and later ramparts means that they frequently preserve substantial areas of old ground surface that reflect local conditions in the period up to the time the rampart was built."

<div class=""content"">A multi-period enclosure site on the Berkshire Downs of south Oxfordshire overlooking the Vale of the White Horse and the middle Thames Valley. Extensively excavated between 1972 and 1975 by Richard Bradley and Ann Ellison, the site has four main structural phases and is critical for understanding the early development of hillforts in southern Britain. The earliest phase dates to the early 12th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> and comprised a stone-faced dump rampart inside a chalk-cut ditch that defined a roughly oval-shaped enclosure of about 1ha. There were probably two or three entrances. In phase 2, the late 12th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, a timber-laced rampart was constructed to replace the earlier defences. In the third phase, around the beginning of the 10th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, a double palisade was built on top of the former, by this time mainly silted-up, ditch. In the final phase, dated to the 7th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, a much larger enclosure of 3.5ha was built around the hilltop in the style of early hillforts.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: R.

First producing a translation of the Persian text, by 1857 he also had a version of the Babylonian text. In 1843 was appointed British consul in Baghdad and this allowed extra time for his studies, especially work on cuneiform tablets found at Assyrian cities such as Nimrud and Nineveh.

It would not be appropriate, however, to reconstruct the roof of that same building because it is not known exactly what it was like. When carrying out reconstruction it is normal to discretely mark the boundary between the original construction and the reconstruction for future reference.

<div class=""content"">As a result of the 19th- and early 20th-century propensity to collect ancient objects from all over the world and take them into established collections in Europe and America there is a great deal of material which has become detached from its cultural context, and there is now increasing pressure to return it to its country or culture of origin. Human remains taken for scientific study are amongst the most sensitive, and significant collections such as those held by the University of Nebraska in America and Edinburgh University in Scotland have already been returned to the indigenous communities from whom they were taken. The British Museum has returned to the Egyptian authorities a fragment of the beard of the great Sphinx of Giza. In 1980 France returned to Iraq fragments of Babylonian codes, and in 1978 Holland returned Hindu and Buddhist sculptures to Indonesia. Great controversy, however, surrounds claims for the repatriation of some objects, most notably the Elgin Marbles, originally from the Parthenon on the Acropolis in Athens, but since 1816 displayed in the British Museum in London."

The most common example of the effect occurs with marine shells because the surface ocean waters where they grow have a significant contribution from older deep-ocean waters. The magnitude of the correction necessary for marine shell ages will depend on the geographical location: for mid-latitude samples the gap is probably about 400 years while for higher latitudes the correction may rise to more than 1000 years. In all cases the correction is subtracted from the conventional radiocarbon age. Also known as the marine effect or the environmental effect."
"resistivity survey","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>resistivity survey</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A kind of geophysical survey used to locate buried features by mapping differences in the way that soils conduct an electric current. Using a <i>resistivity meter</i> a controlled electric current is passed through the soil between four electrodes. One pair of electrodes carries the current while the second pair measures the voltage passed through the ground; the resistance (in ohms) is determined and recorded. In general, fine densely packed damp silty material offers little resistance to current passed through it but stony deposits and those with abundant spaces in the matrix are highly resistant. Different arrays of electrodes allow different depths to be targeted, and by moving the electrodes in a systematic pattern a detailed map of subsurface soil conditions can be built up. Rubble-filled ditches and pits, walls, courtyard surfaces, and roads are the easiest features to identify with resistivity. Limitations in the technique include the problem of filtering out natural from anthropogenic anomalies, and ensuring that the survey is conducted under fairly uniform soil conditions (neither too wet nor too dry)."

<div class=""content"">British archaeologist who specialized in the Roman period. Born in Rochdale, Lancashire, he was educated at Ruthin School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, before spending two years (1924&ndash;6) at the British School in Rome. Here he developed an interest in Roman military architecture and the methods of the Roman army. This was to form the theme of his research throughout his life. He also gained practical archaeological experience working for Mortimer Wheeler at Segontium in Wales. From 1926 to 1930 he was a lecturer in classical archaeology at the Queen's University, Belfast. In 1930, however, he returned to Italy as Director of the British School in Rome. Two years later he had to retire because of ill health and for nearly three years he was without a post. In 1935 he was appointed to a lectureship in Romano-British history in the University of Durham where he remained with only a brief break for National Service until 1956. He was given a personal Chair in 1950, and during his 21 years at Durham carried out numerous excavations along Hadrian's Wall and other sites in the vicinity. In 1956 he was translated to Oxford as the first holder of the Chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Empire. He was knighted in 1964. During his life he published many books and articles, notably <i>Roman Britain</i> (Penguin, 1955) and, together with R. G. Collingwood, <i>The archaeology of Roman Britain</i> (Methuen, 1930 with several revisions).

"ridge and furrow","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>ridge and furrow</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">The archaeological manifestation of a system of strip cultivation that was widely used in England during medieval times. Fields (typically two or three in each settlement) were divided into groups of strips (furlongs) that were each ploughed separately (lands) by turning the soil towards the centre. This had the effect of creating raised areas separated by troughs or furrows, the whole having a marked S-shaped form in plan with headlands for turning the plough at either end. When cultivation ceased, the corrugated effect was fossilized in the landscape, especially if the land was put down to grass. Some of the best-preserved ridge and furrow is to be found in the south midland counties of England, especially Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire, Warwickshire, and Northamptonshire. The width of the ridges preferred seems to vary between regions, while dates for ridge and furrow range from the immediate post-Roman period through to the 17th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>."

<div class=""content"">A stretch of flowing water set aside for catching fish by the use of wickerwork or basketry traps attached to artificial structures placed on the bed of the river or stream. In many cases a weir or platform provides the foundation for the traps, and may extend across the full width of the water course. Alternatively, traps may be secured to stakes driven into the bed of the water course or be weighted down to rest on the river bed. There may be associated structures such as fish houses and processing areas on the adjacent banks. Occasionally water courses may be artificially created to provide fisheries. Widely found in many parts of the world at different times, river fisheries occur in both tidal and freshwater catchments. Early examples of wicker fish traps go back to Mesolithic times in northern Europe."
"river terrace","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>river terrace</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ge].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A platform of land formed beside a river flowing across a plain where, for some reason, the river channel has deepened and cut down to create a new flood-plain at a lower level. River terraces are often made of fluvially eroded material laid down during the creation of the flood-plain. This material sometimes includes archaeological material and faunal remains which date from any time earlier than the creation of the deposit in which they are incorporated. In this way some river terraces can be roughly dated by reference to the latest material present in the assemblages. Large river valleys usually have more than one set of terraces forming a complicated series of platforms."

<b>Riverine Archaic</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Late Archaic Stage hunter-gatherer communities living in the eastern states of North America, particularly in the Mississippi and Missouri basins. One of a series of regional adaptations to different environments, Riverine Archaic people took advantage of the wide range of resources available in the deciduous forests and river valleys of this region. They hunted and trapped small mammals such as deer, turkey, and wildfowl and took turtles, fish, and mussels from the rivers. They gathered nuts (e.g. hickory nuts, black walnuts, acorns, pecans, and hazelnuts) and seeds (e.g. from marsh elder and pigweed). Settlements sometimes comprised small villages of up to six post-built houses providing home to a nuclear family. Burials were typically flexed inhumations in pits, heads turned to the right. The corpses had been sprinkled with red ochre."

<b>Rivet, Albert Lionel Frederick</b> (1915&ndash;93) <span class=""red""><b><i>[Bi].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">British archaeologist specializing in the Roman empire. Educated at Oriel College, Oxford, his archaeological interests were aroused intellectually by R. G. Collingwood at Oxford and practically by working for Mortimer Wheeler at Maiden Castle in Dorset in the mid 1930s. Briefly working as a schoolmaster, in 1938 Rivet enlisted as a private soldier before service with the Royal Signals where he eventually rose to the rank of major and undertook service in East Africa. After the war he was a bookseller in Cambridge for five years before taking up a post as an archaeological officer with the Ordnance Survey. Working there for thirteen years, he was responsible for producing the third edition of the <i>Map of Roman Britain</i> (1956, Ordnance Survey); it was also during this period that he wrote <i>Town and country in Roman Britain</i> (1958, London: Hutchinson). In 1964 he was appointed to a lectureship in classics at Keele University, and it was from this time that he started publishing on the place-names which led to a magisterial volume written in association with Colin Smith entitled <i>The placenames of Roman Britain</i> (1979, London: Batsford). He was awarded a personal Chair at Keele University in 1974 and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1981. He served on numerous committees and editorial boards for academic societies, and published widely.<br class=""nLine"" />[Obit.: <i>The Times</i>, 22 September 1993]</div>"

"rock art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>rock art</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[De].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">At a general level, any artificially created mark that is cut, engraved, incised, etched, gouged, ground or pecked into, or applied with paint, wax, or other substance (organic or mineral) onto, a rock surface. Within this broad field, the term <i>petroglyph</i> is applied to marks made by carving, incising, engraving, pecking, or grinding the rock surface, while the term <i>pictograph</i> refers to marks made by painting organic and mineral pigments onto the surface.<br class=""nLine"" />The individual marks in rock art are often referred to as <i>motifs</i> ; groups of motifs in close juxtaposition as <i>panels</i> ; and places where one or more panels have been identified as <i>sites</i> . It is recognized, however, that in making these identifications and using such terminology a structure is being imposed that may not have been known or relevant to the people who made the rock art in the first place. Indeed, use of the very term ‘art’ carries with it a series of assumptions from modern western culture about the nature of the various marks that can be observed.<br class=""nLine"" />Rock art is extremely widely spread around the world and appears to have been made since Lower Palaeolithic times for a variety of purposes such as during religious rites, depicting historical or mythological events and narratives, as decoration, or to mark territories and routeways. Dating rock art is often extremely difficult because of its general open and exposed positions and lack of associations. Interpreting the motifs used is also difficult. The most widespread motif is the simple cup or hollow either singly or in groups. Some rock art contains motifs that are symbols, shapes and lines, in other cases people, animals, objects, events, and structures are depicted.<br class=""nLine"" />Many different kinds of rock surface have been used in the creation of rock art, but a number of key situations are widely recognized: <i>parietal</i> panels are those on the walls of a natural structure such as a cave or rock-shelter; <i>open-air</i> panels are those on natural earthfast boulders and rock outcrops that lie unprotected in essentially open countryside; <i>monument-based</i> panels are those found on the faces of stones incorporated into the fabric or structure of deliberately constructed monuments&mdash;some of these pieces may have been open-air rock art before being lifted and used in monument building; and <i>mobiliary rock art</i> where panels occur on the surface of stones that have been relocated from their source and may have been moved several times in the past&mdash;essentially portable pieces of rock art."

<i>(Roman empire)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">One of the largest ancient empire states known, the Roman empire began in central Italy in the middle of the 1st millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. In the wake of collapsing <a href=""entry://Etruscans""><span class=""links"">ETRUSCAN</span></a> cultures Rome expanded through a mixture of force and diplomacy so that by 250 bc it controlled the whole of peninsular Italy. This expansion inevitably led to conflicts with existing powers around the Mediterranean, especially Carthage, and Rome's struggle to control the western Mediterranean, the Punic Wars, lasted more than a century, Carthage finally being captured in 146 bc.<br class=""nLine"" />Until the mid 1st century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> the Roman world was a republic, governed from its centre by a senate and two annually elected consuls. Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 bc was followed by the development of imperial rule, headed by the first emperor, Augustus . Further expansion followed, and by the 2nd century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> the empire was at its largest, extending for more than 4000km east to west and 3700km north to south. Its population was more than 50 million, most living in self-governing provinces. The army amounted to more than 300000 soldiers, mainly concentrated around the fringes of the empire to defend its borders.<br class=""nLine"" />The main source of wealth was agriculture, although a vast and extensive trading economy based on luxury goods as well as staples developed around the Mediterranean, along the Atlantic seaways to the west, and eastwards into the Black Sea and beyond to India and China.<br class=""nLine"" />Culturally, the empire always had an eastern part in which Greek was the dominant language and a western part where Latin was dominant. The dividing line ran along the Adriatic coast of Dalmatia. Politically these two regions began to pull apart from the 3rd century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> onwards, and in the 4th century they were more formally divided. In the 5th century Rome's control over the western empire collapsed as barbarian groups broke down its borders; the eastern empire continued to flourish from its capital in Constantinople, eventually becoming the Christian Greek world of Byzantium."

<b>Rome, Italy</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Below the modern streets of the capital of Italy lie the remains of one of the greatest and most influential centres in the ancient world. Legend holds that Rome was founded in 754 bc by the twins Romulus and Remus who were abandoned by their parents but suckled by a she-wolf, but archaeology shows that the story begins rather before this and can be divided into five main phases.<br class=""nLine"" />The early settlement began in the 10th or 9th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> when a series of farmsteads and villages developed on the famous seven hills (Capitoline, Palatine, Aventine, Caelian, Esquiline, Viminal, and Quirinal) overlooking the River Tiber. The areas between the hills were poorly drained and were used as burial grounds.<br class=""nLine"" />In the 7th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> the existing settlements were brought together as an Etruscan city by rulers from the north. New and substantial buildings were erected and the low-lying marshland was drained and used for the construction of public buildings and the city centre. The city became an important religious and trading centre.<br class=""nLine"" />In the 6th century the Romans rose in revolt against their Etruscan rulers and expelled them from the city. In place of the monarchy they set up a republic with power vested in a senate and two annually elected consuls. The city quickly grew and by the 4th century needed its own water supplies to be brought via the Aqua Appia, the first of many aqueducts feeding the city.<br class=""nLine"" />Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 bc was followed by the development of imperial rule, headed by the first emperor, Augustus . By this time Rome was the largest city in the ancient world with a population of around 1 million people. Augustus and his successors embarked on ambitious building programmes and the expansion of the empire to support it. By the later 3rd century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> the empire had reached its peak and from that time began to decline. Defence became important and one of the most conspicuous monuments even today are the massive walls started by the emperor Aurelian around ad 271. Rome declined in importance during the 4th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, and was sacked by the Goths in ad 410.<br class=""nLine"" />Rome retained its pre-eminence as a religious centre and Papal State into the Middle Ages and beyond, while classical Roman traditions lived on in art and architecture.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: A.

<b>round barrow</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Probably the most widespread and numerous class of archaeological monument in Europe, and found in other parts of the world too. At the most basic a round barrow is simply a roughly hemispherical mound of soil, stone, and redeposited bedrock heaped over a central burial. Depending on the nature of the bedrock, such mounds may be predominantly stone (cairns) or earth. The basic pattern is elaborated by the range of constructional features and devices. Some examples have a surrounding ditch which acted both to delimit the monument and as a quarry for material with which to make the mound. Kerbs are found round some mounds, while others have a gap or berm between the mound and the surrounding ditch. Compositionally some mounds are carefully made with alternating layers of turf, soil, and stone forming successive envelopes, and in a few cases there are concentric rings of posts set in the original ground surface and giving structure to the mound. Stones are used instead of posts in some western areas of the British Isles. The central burial may be an inhumation, usually in a pit or cist, or a cremation either in a pit or contained within an urn or jar. As well as a central primary burial, many round barrows contain satellite burials added during the construction of the barrow mound. Secondary burials are often added to the mound, in some cases many centuries later.<br class=""nLine"" />The simplest round barrows are generally referred to as bowl barrows because of their shape, variations and more complicated forms being termed <a href=""entry://fancy barrow""><span class=""links"">FANCY BARROWS</span></a>. In the British Isles the majority of round barrows are of Bronze Age date, but the tradition as a whole begins in the early Neolithic around 4000 bc and continues intermittently until late in the 1st millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>."

Such cemeteries are said to be either <i>linear</i>, when there is a marked axis to the spread of barrows; <i>nuclear</i>, when the barrows form a tight cluster; or <i>dispersed</i>, when the individual barrows are spread out and lacking any obvious pattern to their arrangement. In many cases a round barrow cemetery develops around what Leslie Grinsell called a ‘founder’s barrow', usually a particularly large barrow or a Neolithic barrow that provides a focus for later activity. Few barrow cemeteries have been excavated, but where investigations have taken place there is usually abundant evidence for flat graves between and around the barrows. Such groups of burials accumulate over long periods of time, typically many centuries."

<b>round house</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">General term applied to roughly circular houses typical of the later 2nd and 1st millennia <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> in north-west Europe, especially the British Isles. Such houses may be of timber construction or have stone foundations with a timber superstructure. In general the doorways open in a southeasterly direction and they have central hearths. Those which functioned as dwellings would have been home to an extended family. Although the timber superstructures and thatched roofs are often regarded as a fire hazard, experiments show that these buildings can have a long life and that with a fire burning inside a layer of carbon dioxide gas builds up under the roof and serves to extinguish any stray sparks rising up towards the thatch.

The earliest deposits so far uncovered date to the 11th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, and the city was certainly thriving from the 6th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> onwards when it was the most powerful city in Cyprus. A vast burial ground to the west of the town dates from this period and includes many richly furnished burial chambers.

<b>Salin styles</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[De].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">General term used to describe a series of art styles of the 5th to 7th centuries on northern Europe after they were first described by Bernhard Salin in his work <i>Die altgermanische Thierornamentik</i> published in 1914. Originally derived from Roman naturalistic animal ornament, the Salin styles are characterized by anthropomorphic designs transformed by German craftsmen into an evolving range of surreal and abstract expressions. Although mainly found on metal work, they also find their way into the stone carvings and manuscript illuminations of Christian craftsmen. Salin style I is of the 5th and 6th centuries <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> and features crouching quadrupeds, usually totally disjointed and with the various parts intermixed in a close-knit pattern. This style is the counterpart of Müller's migration style. Salin style II is 6th and early 7th century in date and has the same beasts elongated into ribbon and tendril designs which are intertwined and interlaced together. In England the animals are etched in double outline and the bodies infilled with dots. This style is well represented on the gold objects from <a href=""entry://Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, UK""><span class=""links"">SUTTON HOO</span></a>. Salin style III emerged in the late 7th and 8th centuries and has a more naturalistic emphasis, but introduces a ferocious gripping beast to many designs. This is what eventually gives way to Viking art styles."

<b>salt-glazed stoneware</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[De].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">In the 14th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> it was found that the addition of salt to the kiln gases during the firing of stoneware meant that the salt volatilized and the resultant sodium chloride vapour fluxed with the silicas in the body of the vessels to form a soda-glass glaze. As a further refinement, a brown-coloured surface could be achieved by coating the vessels in a thin iron wash before firing. A patent was granted for the manufacture of such salt-glazed wares in England in 1671."
"saltern","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>saltern</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A place where salt was produced by evaporating the water from brine to leave crystalline salt blocks. In northern Europe most salterns are situated on the coast and comprise a series of large open tanks that could be flooded with a controlled amount of seawater at high tide before being closed off to allow natural evaporation to concentrate the solution. When the brine in the open tanks was sufficiently salt-rich it would be taken to smaller tanks that could be heated by fires underneath in order to be further concentrated. In later prehistoric and Romano-British times, highly concentrated salt water would be placed in ceramic containers (briquetage) for final reduction and drying in purpose-built hearths. Inland, salterns are also found around saline springs such as in Cheshire, England.<br class=""nLine"" />Archaeologically salterns can be identified by the earthwork remains of the preliminary evaporation tanks and the extensive areas of burning associated with the reducing hearths. In Essex, England, these areas of burning have become known as ‘red hills’."

<div class=""content"">British historian and editor of the <a href=""entry://Victoria County History""><span class=""links"">VICTORIA COUNTY HISTORY</span></a> of England. Born in Brighton, Salzman was educated at Haileybury and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied medicine. Endowed with a small income at an early age he settled in Hailsham and abandoned medicine for historical research. During WWI he taught in a school and after the war moved to Cambridge and undertook coaching and supervision for the history tripos. In 1935 he succeeded Dr William Page as the editor of the Victoria County History of England. He retained this post until his retirement in 1949, steering what had already become a great endeavour through some difficult times and with slender funds. Under his management the 100th volume was issued in 1938. He published numerous other books, including <i>English industries in the Middle Ages</i> (1913, London: Constable) and the pioneering <i>Building in England down to 1540</i> (1952, Oxford: OUP). He retained an interest in Sussex throughout his life, being elected president of the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1954 and 1955, and helping with excavations at Pevensey Castle, Alfriston Saxon Cemetery, and Robertsbridge Abbey. In 1965 he was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by the University of Sussex.<br class=""nLine"" />[Obit.: <i>The Times</i>, 6 April 1971]</div>"

<div class=""content"">A regional chiefdom of farming communities living in the highlands of south Columbia in South America in the period 500 bc&ndash;ad 500. Over 30 sites are known, mostly dispersed hamlets, although some ceremonial centres have been recognized. Agriculture was intensive and involved terracing and small-scale irrigation systems in the highlands. The ceremonial sites include earth mounds up to 30m across, used for burials. Each mound contained galleries and tomb-chambers built of stone slabs. The dead were placed in carved stone sarcophagi. Sculpture was also characteristic of the San Agustín Culture, mainly anthropogenic forms carved on boulders, in cliff faces, or as free-standing pillars. The heads of these sculptures often have grimacing faces whose mouths reveal crossed fangs."

<div class=""content"">Early farming village and ceremonial centre of the Formative (Pre-Classic) Stage situated in the Valley of Oaxaca. Investigated by Kent Flannery in the 1970s, the site appears to have developed after 1300 bc. Evidence of Olmec influence becomes apparent after <i>c.</i>900 bc when the settlement had grown to cover 20ha or more and probably served as the ceremonial centre for up to twenty surrounding villages. A carved stone monument of this period depicts a sacrificed captive whose heart seems to have been torn out. Finds suggest that the occupants were involved in the manufacture and exchange of magnetite mirrors and shell ornaments. By about 400 bc, San José Mogoté seems to have been overshadowed by the new ceremonial centre of Monte Albán.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: J. Marcus and K. Flannery, 1996, <i>Zapotec civilization.

<div class=""content"">Large early Formative Stage Olmec village and ceremonial centre situated on a raised natural plateau in the open country of the Rio Chiquito in the Gulf Coast lowlands of Veracruz. It was occupied from about 1200 bc down to 900 bc and was probably the main centre of Olmec civilization in its early stages. The main axis of the site is north&ndash;south, and the main structures were built on an artificially modified salt dome. At the centre is a large platform mound surrounded by up to 60 smaller mounds and what may be the earliest ball-court in Mesoamerica. A unique feature of the site is its system of stone drains. It is estimated that over 1000 people lived at San Lorenzo. There is some evidence for an abrupt end to the Olmec occupation <i>c.</i>900 bc, perhaps because the population was torn between having to farm large tracts of surrounding countryside and building monumental public buildings. When the site was abandoned many of the carved stone heads were defaced and the structures dismantled. It seems likely that La Venta took over as the regional centre.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: M.

In 1961 Humphrey Case noted that the recurrent features of the style were the presence of round-bottomed in-turned bowls, the upper part of the vessel decorated from a very large repertoire, partiality having been shown towards impressions of twisted cord. Lugs are common and the fabrics generally rather sandy. Included within his category of Sandhills ware were four substyles: Sandhills Western, Goodland Bowls, Dundrum Bowls, and Murlough Bowls.

<div class=""content"">In the British Isles the legal protection of archaeological sites involves the selection of nationally important examples which are then added to an official list or Schedule. The process is known as Scheduling; monuments protected in this way are known as Scheduled Monuments or, incorrectly, Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs). To be protected in this way a monument must be judged to be of national importance according to the following criteria: period; rarity; documentation; group value; survival/condition; fragility/vulnerability; diversity; and potential. There is no appeal against the Scheduling process which defines an area of land containing the archaeological site known as the Scheduled Area. Protection takes the form of controlling works within the Scheduled Area; before any works are carried out within a Scheduled Area, Scheduled Monument Consent (SMC) from the Secretary of State is required. Damaging a Scheduled Monument or undertaking works without consent is a criminal offence."

<b>Schliemann, Heinrich</b></b> (1822&ndash;90) <span class=""red""><b><i>[Bi].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Businessman turned archaeologist who set out to unravel the reality behind Homer's epic poetry. Born the son of a Protestant clergyman in Neubucklow, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Germany, Schliemann attended the <i>Realschule</i> in Neustrelitz. After a five-year apprenticeship in a small grocer's shop he set sail for Columbia in November 1841, but was shipwrecked off the coast of Holland. He worked as a clerk in the office of the consul-general of Prussia in Amsterdam where he learnt numerous languages. In 1846 he was sent to St Petersburg where he became a remarkably successful dealer in commodities. He applied his business skills and ability with languages, eventually amassing a considerable personal fortune that allowed him to retire at the age of 46 in order to devote himself to the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean. In 1868 a trip to Italy, Greece, and the Troas changed his life. He published an account of his observations and it earned him a doctorate in 1869. He became convinced by the authenticity of the places described by Homer, and set out to find them. He excavated at Troy over a series of four campaigns between 1871 and 1890; in 1874&ndash;6 he excavated at Mycenae where he discovered the shaft graves and revealed the wealth of the Aegean Bronze Age; in 1880 he dug at Orchomenos in Boetia, and in 1884&ndash;5 he worked at Tiryns. His discovery of ‘King Priam’s treasure' at Troy in May 1873 caused a sensation, helped perhaps by pictures of his second wife, Sophia, wearing some of the ornaments and jewellery. Subsequent studies have shown that some of Schliemann's claims are contaminated by untruths and that the ‘treasure’ was in fact a composite of finds from several spots. Nonetheless, his achievement is considerable, not least in attracting media attention and making archaeology a subject of public interest.<br class=""nLine"" />[Bio.: D.

In 1945 he went to Kabul as Director of the Délégation Archéologique Française in Afghanistan, where again he carried out a great deal of fieldwork, including the discovery of a Greek city dating back to the time of Alexander the Great at Ay Khanum on the River Oxus close to the Russian border. In 1963 he returned to France to take up a Chair in Strasbourg University, but in 1969 he went back to the Near East to take charge of the Institut Français d'Archéologie in Beirut.

<span class=""red""><b><i>[Th].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Grossly simplified, this means making an observation, developing an idea to explain the observation, turning the idea into a theoretical proposition or hypothesis, and then testing the theory against further observations made in a way that is replicable. Many archaeologists wish to adhere to such a method to ensure objectivity in their work. Essentially positivist in outlook, the quest for explanation is sometimes labelled critical rationalism. In archaeology, as in other social sciences, there are several inherent problems in applying the scientific method. One is the interdependency of the test observations with the theoretical assumptions of the hypothesis. Another is that because every piece of data collection involves unique circumstances it is almost impossible to replicate observations. For many archaeologists any use of the scientific method as an objective route to knowledge about the past is extremely implausible."

Nine main phases to the settlement were recognized, beginning with a Pre-Pottery Neolithic that included domesticated animals and cereal remains. The early Neolithic phases (EN I&ndash;III) yielded very few traces of structures, and it is only because EN III was destroyed by fire that any remains of mud-brick houses were preserved. The main phase of settlement dates to the middle Neolithic (MN I&ndash;III), the 6th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, and comprises closely grouped houses of mud brick set on stone foundations. Each house has a domed oven in the centre. The site gives its name to a distinctive style of pottery comprising a fine white slipped fabric decorated with painted red geometric designs. The Classic Sesklo levels are succeeded by a late Neolithic horizon (Dimini) and a Chalcolithic horizon (Rachmani).<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: M.

Historical records of the dynasty comprise oracle bones discovered around 1900 ad at the site of its last capital near modern-day Anyang. During the Shang period several settlements rose to prominence as cities, amongst them the capitals at Cheng Chou and Anyang in Honan Province near the middle Yellow River. Buildings were mainly of timber on rammed earth foundations. City defences were also of rammed earth. Burial was typically by inhumation in pit graves with the corpse extended and face down. The royal tombs at Anyang were richly furnished. The Shang period also saw the invention of the Chinese ideographic script and the discovery and development to a very high order of artistic and technical skill in bronze casting."

Wild sheep are now almost extinct, surviving only as wild populations in remote mountain regions of the Near East and Asia, and distinguished by horn-shape, build, and pelage. Amongst domestic sheep, six main groups are recognized: <i>Mouflon</i> (Ovis musimon) originally from Sardinia and Corsica where they are regarded as feral domestic sheep, recently introduced into the mountains of mainland Europe; <i>Urials</i> (Ovis orientalis) found in the mountains of Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, southern Russia, Pakistan, and northern India; <i>Argalis</i> (Ovis ammon) very large sheep found in the Himalayas, Mongolia, and western Siberia; <i>Snow sheep</i> large-sized sheep found in Siberia; <i>Dall sheep</i> found in Alaska and the northern Rocky Mountains; and <i>Bighorns</i> found in the mountains of western parts of North America.<br class=""nLine"" />The domestication of sheep appears to have taken place in the Near East before 7000 bc. At <a href=""entry://Ali Kosh, Iraq""><span class=""links"">ALI KOSH</span></a> in the southern Zagros Mountains of Iran, an assemblage dating to about 7000 bc that includes hornless sheep is taken as clear evidence of flock manipulation. Sheep seem to appear in Europe already domesticated around 6000 bc in the Aegean and not long afterwards in the western Mediterranean. When alive, sheep can be separated from goats (Capra) by differences in scent glands, the lack of a ‘beard’ on sheep, distinctive horn types in the two species, and genetically in terms of the number of chromosomes present. Archaeologically, however, sheep and goats are difficult to tell apart from skeletal remains alone, the key differences being in the horn cores, metapodials, and phalanges. For this reason, many archaeological reports refer to identifications as being sheep/goat or ovicaprid."

<div class=""content"">Reputedly the largest prehistoric man-made mound in Europe. Its present shape is a truncated cone with a base area of 2.1ha and a height of 40m. The flat top is 30m in diameter. The chalk to build this mound was quarried from a ditch which runs round the monument, but which is now partly silted up. It has been excavated on numerous occasions, but most recently under the direction of Richard Atkinson between 1968 and 1970, work sponsored by the BBC. These excavations revealed that the construction of the hill took place in three stages.<br class=""nLine"" />Silbury I (<i>c.</i>2800 bc) consisted of a flat circular area about 20m across which was enclosed by a low wattle fence. In the centre was a clay mound covered in soil and turves until it reached the fence. Over this was more earth and stone to form a mound 36m in diameter and 5.5m high. Silbury II involved the enlargement of the first mound with chalk from the surrounding quarry to form a structure 73m in diameter. In the final phase, Silbury III (?<i>c.</i>2200 bc), the mound was again extended to give a diameter of 160m. The new mound seems to have been built in a series of stages producing the effect of a stepped cone. Each stage was constructed with a series of buttress-like dumps of chalk contained within retaining walls. The total volume of chalk in the mound is estimated at 350000 cubic metres. What the purpose of the monument was is not known, as no burial has ever been discovered within it. It is partly intervisible with <a href=""entry://Avebury, Wiltshire, UK""><span class=""links"">AVEBURY</span></a> and a number of other contemporary sites in the area.<br class=""nLine"" />The top of the hill was occupied in medieval times, presumably because of its defensive potential.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: A.

Perhaps because of a shortage of wood, the occupants of Skara Brae used stone slabs to construct furniture (beds, dressers, etc.) as well as fittings and fixtures within their houses, thus providing an almost unique representation of things that are lost elsewhere.

<b>Smith, Charles Roach</b> (1807&ndash;90) <span class=""red""><b><i>[Bi].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">British antiquary and recognized expert on the early history of London. Born and brought up on the Isle of Wight, Smith attended a number of local schools before being placed in the office of a solicitor at Newport. Soon tiring of this work, he became an apprentice to a chemist in Chichester, but after six years moving to the firm of Wilson Ashmore and Co. at Snow Hill in London. Later he set up on his own account at the corner of Founder's Court, Lothbury. From an early age he was interested in collecting Roman and prehistoric antiquities, and while living in London he spent 20 years watching and collecting from building sites and the dredging of the Thames. By the mid 1850s his collection was very sizable and recognized as being of great importance. After some negotiation he sold it to the British Museum for £ 2000; here it formed the basis of the British Museum's national collection of Romano-British antiquities. Smith belonged to many learned societies and was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 22 December 1836. He contributed many articles and papers to journals and magazines, and in conjunction with Thomas Wright founded the British Archaeological Association in 1843. In 1856 he published the records of Anglo-Saxon burials excavated in Kent by Bryan Faussett between 1757 and 1773 under the title <i>Inventorium sepulchrale</i>.<br class=""nLine"" />[Obit.: <i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London</i>, 13 (1889&ndash;91), 310&ndash;12]</div>"

<div class=""content"">A concept borrowed from sociology and which originated in the work of Max Weber and the four-fold categorization of social action: Wertrationalität, Zweckrationalität, Traditional, and Affektuell. Social action can be conceived in terms of an actor/person behaving in such a way that his/her action is intended to influence the actions or behaviour of one or more other people. Thus in archaeology the creation of monuments or material culture can be seen, in these terms, in pre-capitalist societies orientated to the ‘traditional’ rationale in Weber's analysis."

<div class=""content"">A subdiscipline of archaeology developed in the 1970s by Colin Renfrew and others which follows the contention, widely held in Anglo-American archaeology, that understanding the archaeological past must involve reconstructing past societies and social practices in their totality; that artefacts and other archaeological finds must be placed in a social context. Taking a lead from anthropological and sociological enquiries this means taking a ‘top-down’ view by focusing on the systems, institutions, and organization of society before attempting to look at the role of the individual and their actions."

<span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Large Iron Age hillfort overlooking the Somerset lowlands excavated between 1966 and 1970 by Leslie Alcock . Although there was occupation on the hilltop in the Neolithic it was not until around 600 bc that the site was defended by substantial ramparts. Over a period of about five centuries the site was intensively occupied and remodelled several times over. The use of the fort carried on past the Roman invasion at least to about ad 70 when for some reason there appears to have been an attack and some of the inhabitants massacred. From around ad 470, however, the site saw renewed activity. The ramparts were refurbished and those living inside the fort had access to imported pottery from the Mediterranean. The excavator associates this phase with the legendary site of Camelot, a proposal first put forward by John Leyland in the 16th century. Whether or not it was Arthur's fortress, the defences were strong and inside the enclosure was a massive timber hall 19m by 10m divided by a single partition and accessed through a pair of doors in the long sides. This occupation lasted until about ad 557 and was the last major use of the hilltop, although King Aethelred took his forces there in ad 1010 and ad 1017 when under Danish attack, and in medieval times a small church and a mint were built there.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: J.

Social space is defined and manipulated using material culture, and people's experiences of it and engagement with it are structured using the same means.

<div class=""content"">A block or slab of stone perhaps selected for its shape or mass that was set upright as a marker of some kind. In the British Isles and neighbouring areas of northwest Europe the majority of standing stones date to the Neolithic and Bronze Age period, part of a long-lived tradition of using stones in this way. As free-standing structures they seem to mark sacred places, alignments, and sometimes burial grounds. Many are connected with broadly contemporary monuments such as <a href=""entry://stone circle""><span class=""links"">STONE CIRCLES</span></a>, and a high proportion have evocative names. A few examples, such as Long Meg in Cumbria, have been adorned with <a href=""entry://rock art""><span class=""links"">ROCK ART</span></a>, while in Brittany, where they are also known as <i>menhirs</i>, large examples were broken up in Neolithic times and used in the construction of <a href=""entry://simple passage grave""><span class=""links"">SIMPLE PASSAGE GRAVES</span></a>."

<div class=""content"">Extensive Iron Age <i>oppidum</i> of 300ha, extensively surveyed and excavated by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1951&ndash;2 and more recently by Colin Haselgrove between 1981 and 1986. The site is believed to have been the principal settlement of the <a href=""entry://Brigantes""><span class=""links"">BRIGANTES</span></a> in the last few centuries <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, and up to and after the Roman conquest.<br class=""nLine"" />The massive defences were mainly built in the mid 1st century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, perhaps incorporating elements of earlier small enclosures. The focus appears to have been around the present-day church, in The Tofts, and in the northern part of the site. Equally important is the fact that the northwest entrance into the main occupation area was elaborate and massive in a way that was perhaps more to impress than frighten. This, coupled with the presence of imported Roman goods (including wine amphorae and tableware) suggests that the rulers of the Brigantes at this time were both powerful and well connected in international trade.<br class=""nLine"" />The great defences of Stanwick were only used for a short time. By the late 1st century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> they had fallen into disuse and the internal settlements abandoned. Historically, this coincides with the Roman conquest of the region, although it is always difficult accurately to match historical events with archaeological evidence. It is believed, however, that in the mid 1st century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> the leader of the Brigantes was a man named Venutius. He was anti-Roman, although his wife Cartimandua was pro-Roman. In ad 69 the Emperor Vespasian tried to establish Roman rule in northern England and the Brigantes rose in open revolt. Cartimandua sought safety outside her kingdom. An energetic governor Petillius Cerialis campaigned vigorously against Venutius between ad 71 and 74, and completed the conquest of the area soon after.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: C. Haselgrove, P.

Pottery comprised principally coarse wares, commonly globular vessels with rusticated ornament, and other material remains include characteristic bone spatulae and clay figurines. Starčevo Culture settlements are generally situated on the upper terraces of river valleys or on the edges of plateaux. The settlements rarely form mounds and almost never form tells, perhaps indicating a degree of adaptation to the more temperate environment. Cattle bones also exceed those of sheep/goat in the northern regions, again suggesting local adaptations to environmental conditions.

F. S. Stone intermittently between 1951 and 1964, the site as visible today has three main phases to its construction. <i>Phase 1</i> comprises the circular earthwork enclosure constructed around 2950 bc. There were at least three entrances, the main one being to the northeast. Inside the bank was a circle of 56 postholes (Aubrey Holes) that originally held wooden posts. <i>Phase 2</i> dates to the period 2900&ndash;2400 bc, the late Neolithic, and sees the ditch filling in through a combination of human actions and natural processes. The posts in the Aubrey Holes decayed or were removed and a series of timber settings were constructed in the northeastern entrance and in the central area. Towards the end of Phase 2 the site was used as a cremation cemetery. <i>Phase 3</i> dates to the period 2550&ndash;1600 bc, the end of the late Neolithic and the early Bronze Age. It is subdivided into a number of subphases and these represent the evolution of the stone structures in the centre of the site. The first such structure comprised two concentric circles of bluestones imported from southwest Wales set up around 2500 bc. Round about were the four station stones and the heelstone and its twin outside the rings to the northeast to provide a sighting on the rising midsummer sun for those inside the circles. Beyond these stones was an embanked avenue leading across the landscape to the northeast. The bluestone circles were later removed and a new much larger set of circles constructed. Ultimately this comprised a series of four concentric rings of stones (from the centre out): a horseshoe of bluestones with the altar stone at its focus; a horseshoe setting of five trilithons; the circle of bluestones; and the outer sarsen circle with lintelled uprights. Observers standing at the site at sunrise on midsummer morning would have seen the light from the rising sun appear to shine up the avenue (which may also have had stones added to the bank at this time) and into the circles.<br class=""nLine"" />Altogether, the construction and use of Stonehenge spanned at least 1500 years, probably more. Stonehenge was not built primarily as an observatory or giant calculator but rather a place where people came to engage in ceremonies and events. The way they used the site, their movements within it, and the apparatus that controlled those movements changed from time to time while at the same time maintaining connections with the signals and celestial events that gave their actions meaning.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: R.

<div class=""content"">The study of the formation, composition, sequence, and deposits or formations. Stratigraphy provides the basic rules by which the context and relationships of archaeological materials are constructed and events put in sequence. The basic rules include the following. <i>Principle of superimposition</i> : layers or strata are overlain or buried by progressively younger deposits so that the oldest deposits are the deepest while the youngest are nearest the surface. This layering of soils one above another allows archaeologists to trace the development of a site and to place a range of archaeological remains (e.g. artefacts) within the layers into a time sequence. Natural erosion or man-made intrusion may interrupt this process, of course, and it should not be assumed that successive layers of approximately equal depth need correspond to equal periods of time, since varying intensities of building activity, flooding, etc., may result in quite different depths of debris.<i>Principle of intercutting</i> : a feature or deposit that cuts across or into an existing layer of strata must be more recent. <i>Principle of incorporation</i> : all material or debris contained within a layer or deposit must be the same age or older than the formation of the deposit. While it is possible that material from an older deposit can be incorporated in a younger deposit the opposite cannot be true. <i>Principle of correlation</i> : parallels may be drawn between deposits of the same character, containing the same range of materials, and occupying comparable stratigraphic positions within related sequences."

<b>structuralism</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Th].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A theoretical approach, derived originally from the study of language, concerned with the identification of structures in social or cultural systems. A philosophy holding that there are non-apparent, innate psycho-biological structures common to all human beings. Structuralism is a very influential approach and a body of cultural theory derived ultimately from work in linguistics. A major distinction is between language as it is spoken (<i>parole</i>) and language as the underlying system of signs (<i>langue</i>). Structuralism focuses on the latter, and makes a further distinction within the sign, between the signifier (for example, a word) and the signified (that which the sign refers to). The emphasis is on the system of signs, and their differences, rather than on the individual signs themselves. In anthropology, the approach was adopted by Lévi-Strauss, who analysed, among other things, native myths. He made heavy use of binary oppositions such as culture:nature, hot:cold, and raw:cooked to explain the way people saw the world. It is through this kind of analysis that structuralism is perhaps most widely known in archaeology, while a more pervasive influence has been through the linguistic or textual analogy, that cultural phenomena are structured as in a language. The major problem with structuralism is its privileging of structure over agency. There is the crucial, but often unanswered, question of the genesis and maintenance of structure, a question which <a href=""entry://structuration""><span class=""links"">STRUCTURATION</span></a> and humanistic approaches attempt to address."
"structuration","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>structuration</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Th].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Structuration theory was developed by Anthony Giddens in the 1970s and has since had a significant influence on post-processual social archaeology. It is concerned to overcome the dualism of individual agency, meaning, and understanding, as against social structure. Its major thesis is the replacement of the dualism with a duality wherein social structure is both the medium and the outcome of the social practice by knowledgeable social agents. In his later work, Giddens emphasized how time and space are basic constituents embedded within social life: the limitations of individual presence are transcended by the stretching of social relations across time and space."

<b>structure</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Th].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">At its most general this refers to the basic framework or form of society. Elements of a physical structure such as an artefact are often associated with function, hence functionalist and structural-functionalist theory treats society as analogous to an organism with each institutional part (religion, economy, etc.) functioning to maintain the whole. Such an approach is related to <a href=""entry://systems theory""><span class=""links"">SYSTEMS THEORY</span></a>, and both have generally received much application in processual archaeology. More particularly, structure refers to the <i>longue durée</i> in Braudel's temporal scheme, the fundamental baseline of a historical period, seen by the earlier <i>Annales</i> historians as essentially geographical or environmental in character. In spite of such refinement of the concept, it is perhaps overworked in the social sciences, ‘structured’ now being used to mean little more than organized, patterned, or non-random."

The name is taken from inscriptions, and has been applied to the language represented on clay tablets. Sumer (Biblical Shinar) began in the early 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. The main stimulus to development was probably the need to organize farming groups previously living in the highlands of Iran to take advantage of the floods and droughts of the Tigris&ndash;Euphrates Valley. As a result, craft specialization, administrative organization, and great advances in architecture and sculpture followed. The political unit was the city-state, in which the patron deity was the major power in all matters, promoted through the priesthood and temple organization. Secular leaders were required in times of war but had little power otherwise. The various city-states were united under a common culture and religion. Political unification did not come until about 2370 bc with the conquest by the Semites of Akkad."

The earliest upstanding monument on the hilltop is the Neolithic passage grave known as the Duma na nGiall (the Mound of the Hostages). Built about 3000 bc, but reused in the earlier Bronze Age, it lies within an oval ditched enclosure, the Ráith na Ríg, some 300m by 250m, which also contains two conjoined ringforts, one a bivallate structure known as Forradh (the Royal Seat), the other a univallate example known as Cormac's House. A decorated stone known as the Lia Fail (the Stone of Destiny) now stands within the Forradh, although originally it stood on the Duma na nGiall.

<div class=""content"">Term proposed in 1993 by Tim Ingold, which has since created wide interest and found considerable application, to refer to the entire ensemble of tasks or actions that a society, community, or individual performs. The idea of the taskscape recognizes that all tasks are interlocking, and that any one task is embedded in the way that other tasks are themselves seen and understood.

"Taunton Phase","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Taunton Phase</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">An industrial tradition within the <a href=""entry://Knighton Heath Period""><span class=""links"">KNIGHTON HEATH PERIOD</span></a> of the British middle Bronze Age that flourished in the period 1400&ndash;1200 bc and is named after a large hoard of metalwork found in the grounds of the Taunton workhouse, Somerset, in 1877. Comparable hoards have been found at Bishopsland, Co. Kildare in Ireland, and this stage is sometimes referred to as the <i>Taunton&ndash;Bishopsland Phase</i> in western parts of the British Isles. The Taunton Phase is characterized by local copying of imported continental objects, especially ornaments such as twisted torcs, armlets, lozenge-section penannulars, ribbed bracelets, cones, coiled finger-rings, and many different kinds of pin. Tools and weapons also benefited from these wider influences, especially the introduction of the basal-looped spearhead with leaf-shaped blades. The presence of so many ornaments and the continental connections led M. A. Smith to suggest in 1959 that the Taunton material in Britain was part of a widespread north European phenomenon known as the <a href=""entry://ornament horizon""><span class=""links"">ORNAMENT HORIZON</span></a> that could be linked with phase III and IV of Montelius' scheme for Scandinavia, Reinecke D, and Hallstatt A1/A2 in central Europe. More recently, in 1980, Colin Burgess argued that Smith's dating should be revised backwards in time to connect at least in part with Montellius IIb&ndash;c, so that a longer period of European contact can be envisaged.

The city itself was formally planned, with six main canals set on a north&ndash;south axis and two main canals running east&ndash;west. There were four main districts in the city, each containing between fifteen and twenty wards. Each ward had its own public buildings and was based on kinship groups.<br class=""nLine"" />At the centre of the city was a sacred precinct with numerous public buildings. At the focus was the Great Temple (<i>Templo Mayor</i>), a truncated pyramid 60m high on which stood two temples: one dedicated to Huitzilopochtli the Aztecs' patron god, the other to Tlaloc the rain god. Legend records that at the dedication of the former some 20000 human victims were sacrificed. There were more than twenty other pyramid-temples in the central area, including those dedicated to Tezcatlipoca and Xipe Totec, together with priests' quarters, seven <i>tzompantli</i> (racks for displaying the skulls of sacrificed victims), two ball-courts, arsenals, plazas, and other public buildings.<br class=""nLine"" />Surrounding the sacred precinct were the palaces of the rulers.

At the focus was a complex of ceremonial structures arranged along the Street of the Dead, including two massive pyramids, one dedicated to the sun, the other to the moon. A cave discovered under the Pyramid of the Sun in 1971 may have been important as a sacred place where communication with the underworld was possible and therefore the place around which the city grew up.<br class=""nLine"" />The city was probably controlled by ritual leaders who also had secular powers. These leaders occupied a series of palaces while the rest of the population lived in large apartment-like compounds set around courtyards.<br class=""nLine"" />By the mid first millennium <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, Teotihuacán covered an area of 20 square kilometres and had an estimated population of 125000&ndash;200000, making it the largest city in the pre-industrial world. It is estimated to have contained about 80 per cent of the inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico. Moreover, its size and importance made it powerful and influential among the emergent states of Mesoamerica during Formative and Classic times. The city's power and position were both created and supported by the fact that it lay on a major trade route, it had control over a major obsidian source, it was favourably located for the development of intensive agriculture, and it may have had important ritual or symbolic connections too. The influence exerted by Teotihuacán extended to the domination of other centres in the vicinity, at times culturally and stylistically through art and architectural styles, trade, and religious guidance, at other times through military domination. After ad 650 the population of Teotihuacán began to decline and by ad 750 the city had been destroyed. No satisfactory explanation for this collapse has been offered, although sacking by rival Chichimecs is one possibility.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: R. F.

<div class=""content"">Stratigraphic dating method based on the fact that during volcanic eruptions ejected material (tephra) is spread in the atmosphere over a wide area before falling to ground as ash, cinders, or dust. This material is incorporated into archaeological deposits and natural accumulations such as peat bogs as a more or less discrete layer that can be identified and sampled. As a relative dating technique layers of tephra provide isochronous horizons that allow separate sequences of deposits to be linked. Since tephra from certain major eruptions of known age is also chemically distinctive absolute dates can be assigned to layers containing that particular kind of tephra. The best known volcanic eruption that provides a dating horizon for archaeological sites is probably Mount Vesuvius in ad 79 which covered Pompeii, Herculaneum, and many other settlements in central Italy."

<b>thermoluminescence dating</b></b>
<i>(TL)</i>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Te].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A dating technique applicable to pottery and other ceramic materials. It works on the principle that all matter is constantly bombarded by cosmic rays and radiation given off from the decay of radioactive elements in the ground and in objects themselves. Minerals that are bombarded in this way by radiation build up a store of energy within their crystalline structure which is released when heated. The longer or more intense the bombardment, the more energy is stored and thus the more there is to be released. When a piece of pottery is fired, all the previously stored energy is released and the build-up starts afresh. After excavation a sherd can be heated again and its stored energy released and measured. If the level and extent of bombardment to which the pottery has been exposed while buried is known (the dose rate), or can be estimated, then the age of a sample can be calculated in terms of the time that has elapsed since it was last heated. The range of the technique is potentially unlimited, but it has an accuracy of ±5&ndash;10 per cent."

<b>Thom, Alexander</b> (1894&ndash;1985) <span class=""red""><b><i>[Bi].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Scottish engineer and amateur archaeologist who researched widely on the construction of prehistoric stone monuments in northwest Europe. Born in Argyllshire, he graduated in engineering from Glasgow University and after a spell in civil and aeronautical engineering he returned to the university as a lecturer in these subjects in 1921. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1938 and spent the war years developing and operating wind tunnels for testing early Spitfires. In 1945 he was elected Professor of Engineering and Science and Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford, a post he held until his retirement in 1961. His interest in archaeology came after a visit to Callanish in August 1933, and he subsequently made very high-quality plans of more than 400 stone circles and rows, including the extremely large and complicated structures at Carnac in France. In publishing his work he developed the idea that prehistoric people used a standardized measuring stick, the ‘Megalithic yard’, which was 0.83m in length. He also suggested that although stone circles varied greatly in plan, there were regular patterns to their outline and that proto-Pythagorean geometry had been applied. Such views remain controversial, although the quality of his surveys and the detail of his mathematical arguments command wide respect.<br class=""nLine"" />[Obit.: <i>Antiquity</i>, 60 (1986), 136&ndash;7]</div>"

<div class=""content"">British archaeologist who worked extensively on the Maya of Mesoamerica. Educated at Winchester College, he left to join the army during WW1, fighting in France with the Coldstream Guards. His family had Argentine connections and for some time after the war he worked as a gaucho on a cattle ranch in South America. A growing interest in archaeology took him to Cambridge in 1924 where he studied at Fitzwilliam House (now College). From 1926 through to 1935 he was on the staff of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, during which time he carried out much of his fieldwork. He applied ethnology to his work of interpretation, and excavated a number of sites in British Honduras, including San Jose, Bushilha, and San Antonio near Lubaantun. He was the first to establish a detailed chronology for the Belize Valley and to make a distinction between ceremonial centres and urban areas. Perhaps his greatest work was in advancing the decipherment of Mayan hieroglyphic scripts and in linking the Mayan calendar to the Christian calendar. In 1935 Thompson joined the Carnegie Institution in Washington where he remained until his retirement in 1958.<br class=""nLine"" />[Obit.: <i>American Anthropologist</i>, 78 (1976), 317&ndash;20]</div>"

In 1816 Thomsen succeeded Rasmus Nyerup as Secretary of the Danish Royal Committee and became the first curator of the National Museum in Copenhagen at its opening in 1819. Bringing a businessman's mind to the development of the museum and its collections, his major contribution was the formulation and introduction of the <a href=""entry://Three Age System""><span class=""links"">THREE AGE SYSTEM</span></a>. This he explained in his <i>Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed</i>, published in 1836, as an effective but at that time conjectural method of dividing up prehistory into the successive ages of Stone, Bronze, and Iron. Coincident with a broadly evolutionary perspective, this model has formed the basic chronological scheme used in prehistoric studies down to the present day.

The mines themselves extend over an area of about 2 square kilometres, while the systems of shafts and galleries reach depths of 50m below ground level. The shafts and galleries were generally square in cross-section, lined with timber, and never more than 1.2m across. A smelting area with at least seven furnaces has been examined. These furnaces produced ingots of about 10kg. Slag deposits estimated at more than 400000 metric tons have been mapped and serve to illustrate the scale of the workings. It is thought that more than 10000 metric tons of copper could have been produced from the mines.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: Y.

<div class=""content"">A method for studying the surface and internal structure of a range of materials, including metals, ceramics, and stone, in far more detail than can be achieved with an optical microscope. The transmission electron microscope utilizes a high-energy electron beam generated by a heated filament which is focused onto a specimen by means of a condenser lens. The electron beam illuminates an area just a few microns in diameter. After transmission of the electron beam through the sample an appropriate magnified image of the specimen is formed by the objective lens that throws the image (magnified more than 100000 times) onto a fluorescent screen or photographic plate. The whole process is undertaken under high-vacuum conditions. The sample has to be extremely thin in order to allow the electron beam to pass through it; this is usually achieved by grinding with a fine powder and mounting it on a carbon film. Wear marks on the surface of materials can be examined by making a replica of the surface in plastic or carbon film and examining that under the microscope."

<div class=""content"">An ancient common-law doctrine in the British Isles whereby items of gold and silver (treasure) which are shown to have been hidden with intent to recover, but for which ownership is now unknown, pass to the crown. The finder of such items is, by custom, rewarded with the commercial value of the find. In 1996 the common law was replaced by <i>The Treasure Act 1996</i> which came into force in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland on 24 September 1997. This defined treasure as being: any object other than a coin provided that it contains at least 10 per cent of gold or silver and is more than 300 years old; all coins from the same find provided that they are more than 300 years old and contain more than 10 per cent gold or silver, but if less than 10 per cent gold or silver then there must be at least ten of them; associated objects. Such finds must be declared to the local coroner within fourteen days of discovery. Thereafter a lengthy process ensues whereby objects confirmed as treasure are offered to national or local museums, which, if they choose to take the material, must compensate the finder with the value of treasure as determined by an independent valuation panel. Since 1996 the number of items declared treasure has risen significantly."

<span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Neolithic culture of the later fourth and third millennia <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> in northern Europe, the first Neolithic culture in the region, named after its characteristic pottery style, the funnel-necked beaker, which has a globular body and out-turned rim. Amphorae and flasks are also known in the ceramic repertoire. The origins of the TRB are thought to lie in the acculturation of local Mesolithic communities through contact with the Linear Pottery Cultures (LBK) to the south. TRB settlements are poorly known, but enclosures such as <a href=""entry://Sarup, Fyn, Denmark""><span class=""links"">SARUP</span></a> in Denmark are now being recognized more widely. Burials are well known and include single graves in <a href=""entry://dysser""><span class=""links"">DYSSER</span></a> in Scandinavia, <a href=""entry://Kujavian""><span class=""links"">KUJAVIAN</span></a> graves in Poland, and in later periods <a href=""entry://passage grave""><span class=""links"">PASSAGE GRAVES</span></a>. Five main regional groups of the TRB have been identified: the western group in the Netherlands; the southern group in Germany; the southeastern group in the Czech Republic; the eastern group in Poland; and the northern group in Denmark. Ground stone axes and battle-axes are known. Copper tools were made during later periods of the TRB in the southeastern group and distributed from there to surrounding regions. The TRB is succeeded by the <a href=""entry://Single Grave Culture""><span class=""links"">SINGLE GRAVE</span></a> cultures."

Schliemann excavated at the site between 1871 and 1890. The results from this and subsequent work, notably by Carl Blegen in the 1930s, allow the identification of seven successive cities, each with numerous subphases, spanning the period 3000 bc to 1000 bc.<br class=""nLine"" />Troy I dates to the period 3000 bc to 2500 bc and was a small settlement of 0.5ha defended by a mud-brick wall set on stone foundations. Houses of the period had built-in cupboards and sleeping platforms. Tin-bronze was introduced during Troy I. Late in the 4th millennium the site was destroyed.<br class=""nLine"" />Troy II, dated to 2500 bc to 2300 bc, was larger and wealthier than its predecessor, but the buildings were still modest in scale. Most were of <a href=""entry://megaron""><span class=""links"">MEGARON</span></a> form. It was from this phase of the site that Schliemann recovered a massive hoard of nearly 9000 objects that have become known as the Treasure of Priam.<br class=""nLine"" />Troy III&ndash;V dates to the period 2300 bc down to 1900 bc. During this time the citadel grew in size, but was not especially wealthy.<br class=""nLine"" />Troy VI, broadly 1900 bc to 1350 bc saw a new fortification built around a town of 2ha. This was a wealthy town with evidence of trade with the <a href=""entry://Mycenaean""><span class=""links"">MYCENAEAN</span></a> centres of Greece. The defensive wall was of fine ashlar masonry with a pronounced batter. The destruction of the site around 1300 bc was probably the result of an earthquake.<br class=""nLine"" />Finally, Troy VII was probably the town that should be identified with Homer's Troy. It was destroyed in the mid 13th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, perhaps by Greeks fighting the Trojan War.<br class=""nLine"" />Around 700 bc the site was re-occupied by Greeks from Lemnos and, as Illium, became the capital of a league of cities in the coastal region of Anatolia formed in 306 bc. There were further prosperous times in the later Roman period before a period of decline and decay that led to the town's disappearance for many centuries.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: C.

<b>Tyre, Lebanon</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Early port and settlement situated on a coastal promontory south of Beirut. More or less continuous occupation down to the present day has limited the amount of excavation that has taken place, but the broad sequence is clear enough; its location was so desirable for long-distance trade that it was frequently captured and occupied by successive dominant powers in the eastern Mediterranean. In ancient times the main settlement was on a small offshore island. There was a double harbour linked by a canal so that ships could enter port in almost any conditions and this was flourishing under Egyptian protection from the 18th Dynasty. Later, as a Phoenician city it appears to have been the capital of the western Phoenician (Punic) world, at least until 572 bc when Tyre was taken by the <a href=""entry://Babylonia""><span class=""links"">BABYLONIANS</span></a> under <a href=""entry://Nebuchadnezzar""><span class=""links"">NEBUCHADNEZZAR</span></a> after a thirteen-year-long siege. The site remained a powerful and important trading centre although it fell again to a siege by Alexander the Great in 332 bc. After this a causeway was built out to the mainland and it is this promontory that was occupied through Greek, Roman, and Byzantine times. It was an archbishopric during Christian times but fell to the Arabs in ad 636.

A pit cut from Level II contained a ritual assemblage including a cremation, fired clay and alabaster figurines, spondylus shell bracelets, and three fired clay tables bearing incised signs. The group as a whole has sometimes been interpreted as the equipment of a shaman, but it has caused considerable controversy because of suggested resemblances between the Tărtăria tables and symbols on tablets from Jemdetnasr and Uruk in Mesopotamia. The Mesopotamian examples are some 1000 years later (late 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>) than those from Tărtăria and so the similarities are best regarded as coincidental.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: E.

<div class=""content"">Absolute dating method that uses the decay patterns of a series of radioactive isotopes of uranium, usually <sup class=""expo"">238</sup>U or <sup class=""expo"">235</sup>U. Dates are usually based on the measurement of one of the uranium isotopes and a relatively short-lived daughter isotope expressed as isotopic ratios. When uranium is precipitated as a trace constituent in surface outcropping minerals it begins producing daughter isotopes. In applying the technique for dating, samples are ideally chosen from chemically closed systems in which the isotopic ratio used to calculate the sample age was initially zero. The great value of uranium dating is that it can be applied to materials far more ancient than could be covered by radiocarbon dating, in exceptional cases back to 1 million years ago. The kinds of material that can be dated are also slightly different, and include coral, mollusc shells, marl, bone, teeth, caliche and calcretes, peat, wood, and detrital sediment."

<div class=""content"">A series of related cultures distinctive of the European late Bronze Age, broadly 1200 bc through to 800 bc, distinguished by their cemeteries of cremated burials deposited as <a href=""entry://urnfield""><span class=""links"">URNFIELDS</span></a>. The appearance of urnfields marks a major transition in burial rites from the previous predominance of inhumations, often under round barrows, to a predominance of cremations. The Urnfield Tradition in central and eastern Europe is generally equated with the <a href=""entry://Hallstatt, Gmunden, Austria""><span class=""links"">HALLSTATT</span></a> sequence as defined by Paul <a href=""entry://Reinecke, Paul""><span class=""links"">REINECKE </span></a> in the early years of the 20th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, and has been divided into five phases. Each is characterized by diagnostic pottery and metal types. By the end of the second millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, the Urnfield Tradition had spread through Italy, northwestern Europe, and as far west as the Pyrenees. It is at this time that fortified hilltop settlements and sheet-bronze metalworking also spread widely across Europe, leading some authorities to equate these changes with the expansion of the <a href=""entry://Celt""><span class=""links"">CELTS</span></a>.

<b>Uruk (Warka), Iraq</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">This is the largest archaeological site in southern Iraq, situated east of the present course of the Euphrates. The Sumerians knew the site as Unu, the Akkadian speakers as Uruk. The Akkadian name appears in the Bible as Erech.The site was first investigated by William Loftus in the mid 19th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>, but it was not until 1912 that systematic excavations began, albeit sporadically at first, under the direction of Julius Jordan for the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft. As a result of this work it is now known that the site began in the 5th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, the Ubaid period, growing to urban proportions by the early 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. By the later 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, the late Uruk period, the city covered at least 100ha and was the largest settlement in Sumer: the world's first city and housing the first urban society.In the late 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> Uruk encompassed two distinct centres: Eanna and Kullaba. Kullaba was probably dedicated to the sky god An and centred on the so-called White Temple which had gypsum plastered walls and comprised a long central room with an altar and offering table, flanked on both the long sides by smaller rooms. The temple itself stood on a platform or proto-ziggurat 13m high. Some 500m to the east was Eanna, dedicated to the city goddess Inanna. Here again temples and large ceremonial buildings abounded. Around 3000 bc the temples at both Kullaba and Eanna were remodelled, that at Eanna becoming and remaining the focus of Uruk's ritual and civic existence for nearly three millennia. Amongst the debris from the rebuilding of Eanna the excavators found thousands of fragmentary clay tablets bearing pictograms, probably an early form of <a href=""entry://Sumer""><span class=""links"">SUMERIAN</span></a>. Other rather unusual artefacts include fine sculpture and cylinder seals.The city continued to expand to its maximum of about 400ha in 2900 bc. At this time a massive defensive enclosure 10km in length encircled the settlement. Evidence from surrounding villages suggests that at this time many of the communities previously living in the countryside moved into the town. This was the high point of its existence and it was at this period that rulers such as <a href=""entry://Gilgamesh, The Epic of""><span class=""links"">GILGAMESH</span></a> governed the city, later to appear in epics as superhuman beings. The ziggurat that dominates the site today was built around 2000 bc by Ur-Nammu, but by that time the site was already in decline. Although Babylonian and Assyrian rulers maintained the Eanna temples down into the 6th century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> or beyond, the city had lost its position. The final occupants of the site were the <a href=""entry://Parthians""><span class=""links"">PARTHIANS</span></a> who built a small temple to Gareus around ad 100.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: R. M.

<div class=""content"">Within a scientifically constituted archaeology the idea of value-free interpretation means aspiring to the exclusion of value-laden terms and value judgements. While it is accepted that the selection of material for investigation involves value judgements about how interesting or relevant it may be on the basis of academic or professional values, the overall aim is to separate ‘facts’ from ‘interpretation’. That this is either possible or desirable has been widely challenged.

In the 8th and 9th centuries they raided the rivers and coasts of western Europe, including the Isle of Man and Ireland. In 865 their raids on eastern England led to the conquest of much of the eastern part of the country with a capital and major trading port at York (Jorvik).

<div class=""content"">Communities occupying the central Andean highlands of Peru in the period ad 750 to ad 1000 that were bound together by extensive networks of political and economic control. At the centre of the system was the site of Wari itself in the Ayacucho Valley which was an urban centre that started as the capital of its region and rose to control surrounding areas. Provincial centres are known at Pikillaqta, Jincamocco, Cajamarca, and the unfinished site of Viracochapampa. Archaeologically, the most distinctive features of the Wari are its architecture and urban planning: great rectangular structures set out on a rigid grid plan that was subdivided into square or rectangular plots called ‘patio groups’. Each patio comprised an open central area edged by long narrow rooms, sometimes two or three deep and up to three storeys high. Few doors allow access between patio groups, and it has been suggested that the intention of Wari architecture is in part to restrict movements within each enclosure. The Wari empire emerged during the <a href=""entry://early Intermediate Period""><span class=""links"">EARLY INTERMEDIATE PERIOD</span></a> as Huarpa cultures interacted with the nearby <a href=""entry://Nasca Culture""><span class=""links"">NASCA</span></a> Culture at a time of intense interregional exchanges and widespread disruption to existing cultural traditions."

<div class=""content"">A wooden or metal wheel with paddles or buckets of some kind attached to the outside so that when set in a watercourse it will rotate as a result of pressure from the movement of the water. The energy captured by such wheels in the form of rotary motion is usually transmitted via a connecting rod to some kind of machinery. Three main kinds of vertically set waterwheel can be identified: the <i>undershot</i> wheel rotated by water passing below the wheel; the <i>overshot</i> wheel where water is fed onto the top of the wheel, filling buckets which unbalance the wheel causing it turn; and the <i>breastshot</i> wheel where water is fed onto the wheel at an intermediate level. Water wheels appear to have been first used in the Greco-Roman world during the 1st century <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. The Roman engineer Vitruvius writing between 20 bc and 11 bc describes what is essentially an undershot wheel set vertically with a horizontal drive shaft. The use of such water wheels appears to have spread fairly rapidly within the Roman world and beyond, being known in Gaul by ad 370.

<div class=""content"">Early Bronze Age culture of central southern England defined by Stuart <a href=""entry://Piggott, Stuart""><span class=""links"">PIGGOTT </span></a> in 1938 on the basis of a series of well-known richly furnished burials under round barrows in the Wessex region of Dorset, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Berkshire, and surrounding areas. Later, in 1954, Arthur ApSimon proposed subdividing the Wessex Culture into two consecutive phases initially on the basis of the dagger typology: Wessex I (<i>c.</i>2000&ndash;1650 bc) with richly furnished inhumation graves containing bronze triangular daggers (Bush Barrow type), axes, beads, and buttons of amber and shale, and gold dress fittings. The most famous example is the Bush Barrow burial near Stonehenge, Wiltshire. Wessex II (<i>c.</i>1650&ndash;1400 bc) was characterized by ogival daggers (Camerton&ndash;Snowshill type) together with cremation replacing inhumation and faience beads becoming more common. Goldwork is less common in Wessex II graves. Connections between both phases of the Wessex Culture and contemporary communities in northern France are widely accepted (e.g. with the Armorican Tumulus Culture), and these date to the European early Bronze Age, Reinecke A1 and A2. There has been much discussion of the possibility of long-distance links to the Aegean world, but most can be discounted on chronological grounds. Wessex I is closely associated with the construction and use of the later phases of Stonehenge, specifically Stonehenge 3. In recent decades the Wessex Culture has been seen as a limited social stratum within a broader cultural phenomenon rather than a distinct cultural grouping."

<div class=""content"">A very large Cotswold&ndash;Severn-style long barrow with a chalk mound some 100m long and up to 3m high, perhaps constructed in two or more phases. Extensive excavations directed by Stuart <a href=""entry://Piggott, Stuart""><span class=""links"">PIGGOTT </span></a> and Richard <a href=""entry://Atkinson, Richard John Copland""><span class=""links"">ATKINSON </span></a> between 1955 and 1956 revealed that the mound was built from chalk quarried out of two flanking ditches originally 3m deep and 7m wide. The chamber, small in comparison to the mound, is of transepted plan and opens from the east end of the mound. Two pairs of cells open from the passage and there is a fifth cell at the far end of the passage. When first constructed the tomb was entered from a small forecourt which was later filled with stones. The burials lay scattered across the floors of all the cells within the chamber; at least 46 individuals in all, although many were incomplete disarticulated skeletons. Some pottery and personal ornaments were included with the burials. One of the burials had probably been shot with an arrow tipped by a leaf-shaped flint arrowhead. Radiocarbon dates suggest that the main period of use was between 3800 bc and 3400 bc. Sometime after 3000 bc the tomb fell out of use and was blocked up. Soil and stones were placed in the passage and chambers, and stones were piled up in the forecourt.

<div class=""content"">Style of plain or little decorated early and middle Neolithic pottery found in the western parts of the British Isles, especially Ireland. In 1961 Humphrey Case defined Western Neolithic ware pottery as being round-based bowls, normally thin-walled, hard, generally dark-brown, and with a shouldered profile. Four substyles were recognized in Ireland: Dunmurry style; Ballymarlagh style, Limerick style, and the Lyles Hill style. The last mentioned was used by Isobel Smith in 1974 to help define a widespread class of early Neolithic pottery that she called the <i>Grimston&ndash;Lyles Hill</i> series; these vessels are now more commonly known as <a href=""entry://carinated""><span class=""links"">CARINATED</span></a> bowls."

<div class=""content"">Deserted medieval village covering about 16ha in a small valley amid the rolling chalk downland of the Yorkshire Wolds of northeast England. Visible earthworks include roads, a fishpond, the foundation of a manor house, and 30 peasant houses set out in regular rows. Extensively excavated between 1950 and 1990 under the direction of John Hurst and Maurice Beresford, this site has made an important contribution to understanding the development and desertion of traditional medieval villages in England. The earliest occupation on the site appears to have been in Anglo-Saxon times, perhaps from the 8th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> onwards. Over the ensuing centuries a regular pattern developed with timber longhouses each set in a yard or ‘toft’, the holdings being ranged along the main streets. There were two manor houses of more substantial construction, and a church established in the 12th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small>. Around the village there were open fields and paddocks. It was originally the centre of a large parish containing five villages, four of them now deserted.

"wheel","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>wheel</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[Ar].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Wooden or metal disc attached at its central point to an axle or pivot in such a way that it can rotate freely to allow a vehicle or other mechanical device attached to the axle to move freely. Widely regarded as one of the single most important inventions ever made, the idea of a wheel seems to have cropped up in many cultures from early times. However, its application in pre-industrial societies is mainly confined to agriculturalist and pastoral societies in the Old World. One reason for this is that wheeled vehicles can only be used on relatively flat terrain or along constructed bearing surfaces such as roads and tracks. Another prerequisite is the availability of draught animals to pull wheeled vehicles.The earliest evidence of wheels comes from Uruk, Iraq, where depictions of what appear to be sledges mounted on four wheels appear on pictograms of the early 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. From the later 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> there are a series of depictions of wheeled vehicles on pottery or as ceramic models across a wide swathe from the Near East via central Europe to the Atlantic coastlands: from the TRB culture in southern Poland, the late Copper Age of Hungary, the Kura-Araxes Culture in Transcaucasia, the Pit Grave cultures of southern Russia, and the Corded Ware cultures of northwest Europe. In all cases these wheels appear to be solid wooden discs with a thickened hub. Actual examples of such wheels have been found dating to the mid 3rd millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>, for example at De Eese, the Netherlands. Later, multi-part discs were made, often with three elements secured together with cross-pieces on either side.Spoked wheels appear from the mid 2nd millennium, first in the Transcaucasus region but soon afterwards within broadly the same areas that already use wheeled vehicles. By the 1st millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> iron tyres were being fixed to the outside of the rim of spoked wheels, proving to be a far more robust yet lightweight structure. Wheels were not used indigenously in the Americas, nor in Africa south of the Sahara."

<div class=""content"">A method of setting out archaeological excavation trenches in a pattern of regular square or rectangular boxes with baulks between, pioneered by Sir Mortimer Wheeler at sites in India and southern Britain. The boxes provided suitable subdivisions for the organization and control of labour, for the recording of finds, and, most importantly, so that following the excavation of each unit it was possible to record the stratigraphy in the sides of the baulks, and this developed both a vertical sequence for individual parts of the site and a means of correlating layers and deposits across the site in the horizontal plane. At the end of the excavation the baulks were removed to provide a single view of the lower levels of the whole area. Although useful, the small size of the boxes (typically 3m by 3m) and the fixed position of the baulks throughout the sequence are major encumbrances and this system has now largely been replaced by open-area excavation."

<div class=""content"">British archaeologist (Rik to his friends) well known for his excavations at Colchester, St Albans, Maiden Castle, and Stanwick, amongst many other pieces of fieldwork that made major contributions to the development of excavation and recording techniques. Born in Glasgow but brought up in Saltaire, Bradford, from the age of four, he was educated at Bradford Grammar School and University College, London, where he read classics. In 1913 he won the first Franks studentship and a year later married Tessa Verney . Between 1913 and 1915 he worked for the Royal Commission on the Historic Monuments of England before joining the Royal Field Artillery. He was posted to France in 1917 and as Major Wheeler had a week in the thick of Passchendaele before serving in Italy and then Germany. He was awarded the MC and was mentioned in despatches, his military experience bringing out his powers of leadership and dashing style. After the war he was appointed keeper of archaeology in the National Museum of Wales but in 1926 he left Wales to become Director of the London Museum. Together with his wife he threw himself into transforming the collections in Lancaster House and raising money to establish an academy in which to train archaeologists. In 1937 he founded the Institute of Archaeology in London University, now the largest university department of archaeology in Britain, and was its first director. In the period from the early 1920s through to 1939 the Wheelers excavated many important sites including Lydney Roman Temple, Gloucestershire (1928&ndash;9), Roman and Belgic Verulamium, Hertfordshire (1930&ndash;3), and Maiden Castle, Dorset (1934&ndash;7). In this work Wheeler developed and introduced new approaches to stratigraphic excavation, including what later became known as the <a href=""entry://Wheeler system""><span class=""links"">WHEELER SYSTEM</span></a>. In 1936 a great partnership was broken when Tessa died.Shocked by political events in 1938&ndash;9, Wheeler raised an anti-aircraft battery at Enfield which was later expanded into the 42nd Royal Artillery Regiment which joined the Eighth Army in North Africa. Wheeler was at El Alamein and in the long advance to Tunis. He also fought in Italy. In 1943 he accepted an appointment as Director-General of the Indian Archaeological Survey, requiring him to regenerate and structure a substantial organization, providing training and developing new publications for what was a demoralized group of staff when he took over. He was made a CIE in 1947, returning to London in 1948 to a part-time professorship in the University of London and a role as honorary secretary to the British Academy. He was knighted in 1952. Although he retired in 1968, he maintained an interest in all thing archaeological until his death. Wheeler was always interested in popularizing archaeology and, together with Glyn Daniel, was an early proponent of archaeology on television. In 1954 he was voted television personality of the year. Amongst many honorary positions and awards, Wheeler became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1922, a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1968, a Fellow of the British Academy in 1970, Director of the Society of Antiquaries 1940&ndash;4 and 1949&ndash;54, President of the Society of Antiquaries 1954&ndash;9, Trustee of the British Museum 1963&ndash;73, and Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board 1964&ndash;6).<br class=""nLine"" />[Abio.: 1955, <i>Still digging</i>.

Born in Edinburgh, he attended Edinburgh High School before being apprenticed to a steel engraver. Between 1837 and 1842 he worked in London as an engraver and popular writer, but returned to Edinburgh to run an artist's supplies and print shop. Although Wilson developed an interest in history and matters antiquarian from a relatively early age, it was not until he was invited to help turn the collections of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland into a modern national museum that he turned from antiquarianism to archaeology. In reorganizing the collection he adopted the Danish model of ordering the artefacts according to the <a href=""entry://Three Age System""><span class=""links"">THREE AGE SYSTEM</span></a>. Wilson's arrangement presented an evolutionary approach to viewing the artefacts, and this also came across in the catalogue that he wrote to go with the exhibition. Later, in 1851, he published an extended version of the catalogue as <i>Archaeology and prehistoric annals of Scotland</i> (London: Macmillan). This was the first comprehensive treatment of early Scotland based on material culture and the first time that the term ‘prehistoric’ was used in English. Although Wilson received an honorary LLD from the University of St Andrews, he was unable to get an academic position in Scotland. In 1853, with help from friends in Edinburgh, he was appointed to the Chair of History and English Literature in University College, Toronto, Canada. Wilson enjoyed teaching in Canada and continued his interest in archaeology, but all the while expanded his interest in anthropology and ethnography.

<div class=""content"">A series of later Stone Age microlithic industries found widely across southern Africa and dating to the period 6000 bc through to ad 500 or later. Named after a small rock-shelter near Alicedale in the eastern Cape Province of South Africa, the lithic industries include small convex scrapers, thumbnail scrapers, adzes, segmented blades, and crescent-shaped backed blades, but organic materials are also known, together with occupied caves and burials. Rock painting is well represented. The economy was based on the exploitation of a wide range of plant and vegetable species and marine, aquatic, and animal resources including melkhoutboom and antelope. Changes in the relative percentage of different classes of stone tools can be seen over the duration of the tradition, and a <i>Coastal Wilton</i> and <i>Interior Wilton</i> are widely recognized.

<div class=""content"">Large historic town in central southern England situated beside the River Itchen. At the time of the Roman conquest the site was already a major tribal centre, and was soon adopted as the capital of the new administrative area and named Venta Belgarum. Defences were constructed in ad 60&ndash;70 and the rectangular grid of streets was established at about the same time within the walls. By the 2nd century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> the town covered 58ha. After the decline of Roman power Winchester continued to be occupied, and in the 7th century a substantial church was built: the Old Minster. There was a major revival in its fortunes in the later 9th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> when it became a <a href=""entry://burh""><span class=""links"">BURH</span></a> with planned streets and a strong defensive system. The Old Minster was extended several times, and in the 970s the open-air tomb of St Swithin was incorporated into the structure. The town again rose to prominence to became the capital of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex.Winchester continued to thrive through later centuries as a regional centre, market, and the seat of a bishopric. Today it is the county town of Hampshire. In 1961 Winchester achieved a special significance in archaeological terms in being the first English town to have a permanent field unit established to carry out both rescue and research projects in and around the city. Headed by Martin Biddle, the Winchester Archaeological Unit has carried out numerous excavations and surveys, and continues to do so.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: T. B. James, 1997, <i>Winchester</i>.

<b>windmill</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[MC].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">An industrial monument in which a set of machinery dedicated to a particular purpose, usually grinding corn, is powered by the motion of a wheel to which a series of sails are attached so that it can be turned by the force of the wind, the machinery itself being housed in some kind of structure around or below the aerially mounted sails. In northern Europe windmills have been recorded from the 12th century <small class=""smCap"">ad</small> onwards, and many remain in a form not unlike those common in the Middle Ages. By the 17th century windmills were a common sight in town and countryside. The earliest types were <i>postmills</i> where the whole structure revolves around a central wooden post rising from a ground frame comprising two intersecting beams known as cross-trees. These cross-trees were sometimes set in a round mound of earth and stone or rested on brick or stone piers. Above the ground frame was a superstructure containing the machinery that pivoted on the central post so that the whole thing could be turned to move the sails into an optimum position to take full advantage of the wind. From the 14th century <i>towermills</i> began to appear (also called smockmills) in which the greater part of the structure was stationary with only the cap at the top, carrying the sails, able to be rotated into the wind. Tower mills were therefore far more substantial, usually of timber on a brick or stone base, but occasionally having the whole tower of brick or stone. Archaeologically, early windmills of both main types are represented by low earth mounds or circular foundations."

<b>Windmill Hill Culture</b><span class=""red""><b><i>[CP].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">Middle Neolithic culture defined in 1954 by Stuart Piggott as typical of communities occupying central southern England. Based on the cultural assemblage recovered from the type-site of <a href=""entry://Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, England""><span class=""links"">WINDMILL HILL</span></a>, the culture was founded upon mixed farming, especially cattle husbandry and the cultivation of wheat and barley. In addition to causewayed enclosures the population built long barrows that also provided repositories for the dead. The pottery was well made and frequently decorated. Trading connections with other parts of the British Isles and near continent were well attested through evidence for exchanges of stone axes and pottery. Radiocarbon testing relating to Windmill Hill Culture sites date them to the period 3600&ndash;3000 bc, although the term Windmill Hill Culture itself is now almost obsolete."

<div class=""content"">One of the largest causewayed enclosures yet discovered in Britain. It has an area of about 8ha, and its outer ditch has a diameter of approximately 360m. The boundary earthworks comprise three roughly concentric rings of interrupted ditches which originally had internal banks. It is notable that the ditches do not lie around the top of the hill, but rather run down the northern slope. Windmill Hill was excavated on several occasions, most notably between 1925 and 1939 by Alexander Keiller, in 1957&ndash;8 by Isobel Smith, and in 1988 by Alasdair Whittle .The earliest occupation dates to about 3800 bc when there was a small unenclosed site in a woodland clearing. It was probably about 3500 bc that the enclosure was built, all three ditch circuits being open at broadly the same time. Within the enclosure ditches there is a considerable quantity of domestic rubbish (pottery, bones, flintworking waste, etc.). There was clear evidence of recutting in the ditches, suggesting that they were periodically cleared out. There were also a number of burials (mostly infants) on the ditch floors, and human bones were found scattered throughout the ditch fills. The enclosure ditches were not redug after about 2500 bc, although debris from later occupation, presumably from a settlement in the vicinity, found its way into the upper silting of the ditches. The purpose of the enclosure has been much debated. Isobel Smith suggested that it was a seasonal rallying point for dispersed farming communities who gathered there for festivals and trade, a view that is widely supported.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: A.

Ceramic vessels developed for the storage and consumption of wine appear from Bronze Age times onwards in the eastern and central Mediterranean. The wild vine (Vitis vinifera sylvestris) was once widely distributed around the Mediterranean and between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It was in this last-mentioned area, in Armenia and southern Georgia, for example, that vines were probably first domesticated in the 4th millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> (Vitis vinifera sativa).

The monument comprises an earthwork enclosure 88m across formed by a bank and internal ditch up to 12m wide. There is a single entrance to the northeast. The site was fully excavated in 1926&ndash;8 under the direction of Maud Cunnington, after being discovered through aerial photography a short while before. Excavations in the interior revealed traces of a circular wooden building represented by six concentric circles of postholes. The building is very similar to those found inside Durrington Walls, and one possibility is that Woodhenge was a shrine or temple adjacent to a settlement inside the larger henge enclosure. The long axis of the rings of postholes at Woodhenge points to the entrance of the henge enclosure and also aligns with the midsummer rising sun. Also in the interior was a child's grave and a possible stonehole. The finds from the site included quantities of grooved ware pottery.

<b>writing</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Ge].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">The arrangement of letters or symbols in groups or sequences to express defined and recognized meanings, developed independently in three parts of the world at different times, usually in connection with the elaboration of administrative systems or the recording of ritual/ceremonial matters. Although some early <a href=""entry://rock art""><span class=""links"">ROCK ART</span></a> might have employed combinations of symbols to represent meaning, the earliest writing as such is generally taken to be <a href=""entry://Sumer""><span class=""links"">SUMERIAN CUNEIFORM</span></a> which used an increasing range of phonetic syllable signs during the early 3rd millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small>. This system developed over the succeeding centuries to form Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Hititte, Hurrian, and Old Persian.Egyptian hieroglyphic script developed about 3100 bc and changed little down to the Christian era. In India writing was developed in the Indus Valley from about 2500 bc. Finally, in Greece an indigenous hieroglyphic script was initiated in Crete in about 2200 bc, later to develop into Linear A around 1650 bc and Linear B around 1300 bc. The first true alphabet, with signs for individual letters/ sounds, seems to have been developed in the Levant soon after 2000 bc, one of the earliest alphabetic inscriptions being from Serabit al-Khadim in Sinai which can be dated to about 1700 bc. The Ugaritic alphabet started with a script of 32 letters, but over succeeding centuries this was modified to a set of 22 letters. Proto-Canaanite script is generally held to be the direct antecedent of the three main alphabetic families: Arabic, Phoenician, and Greek.A second cradle for the development of writing was in China where there is an uninterrupted literary tradition that can be traced back 3500 years to the pictography of the late <a href=""entry://Shang""><span class=""links"">SHANG DYNASTY</span></a> around 1500 bc. The third independent development of writing was in the New World, where during the Late Formative Period of Mesoamerica logosyllabic scripts emerged around 300 bc to form four systems: epi-Olmec, Mayan, Oaxacan, and Izapan."

<div class=""content"">An imaging technique used to study the structure and composition of objects or materials. The specimen is placed on a radiosensitive surface, usually a photographic plate or real-time sensor, and then bombarded with short-wavelength high-energy electromagnetic radiation (X-rays). The image is recorded as darker and lighter tones according to the intensity of the X-rays that pass through the different parts of the sample material, the structure and composition of the material differentially absorbing X-rays. X-radiography is extensively used in archaeology to study metal objects, especially iron, where corrosion products mask the form of the original piece and any decoration that may once have been visible. It is also used to examine large objects prior to excavation under laboratory conditions (e.g. cremation urns; mummies), paintings and drawn images that have several layers to them, and human body parts and biological samples."

<div class=""content"">Destructive method for determining the mineralogy of crystalline materials such as ceramic, glass, stone, and corrosion products derived from certain kinds of metal. The sample is powdered and mounted either on a glass slide or on a platform to fit within an X-ray camera. Monochromatic X-rays are focused on the sample and the transmitted rays are then recorded using X-ray plates or photographic film. The spacing between crystal lattice planes in different mineral species and the incident angle of the X-ray beam determine the series of X-ray intensities that are transmitted through the sample and onto the recorder. The identification of minerals is based on the spacing between high-spots in the diffraction pattern while relative concentrations can be estimated using the intensity of signal recorded. Sample matching can be done manually or statistically to group similar materials and to relate such groups to potential source materials."

<div class=""content"">Non-destructive method for determining the elemental composition of natural and man-made materials such as ceramic, glaze, glass, obsidian, pigments, paint, and coins as an aid to determining their source, technology of production, and similarity to other examples of comparable style or form. A sample is exposed to an X-ray source causing it to fluoresce and emit secondary X-rays. The wavelengths of the released energy, known as fluorescent X-rays, are detected and measured as a spectrograph. Component elements can be identified on the basis of the unique wavelength of their fluorescent X-rays, while concentrations can be estimated from the intensity of the released X-rays. Since only the surface of an object is studied, care needs to be taken that corrosion and decay do not affect the analysis."

<div class=""content"">An ethnic group which established itself as a major Chinese dynasty after overthrowing the Shang Dynasty in about 1027 bc. Once established, the Zhou Dynasty was the longest lasting in Chinese history, surviving down to 256 bc. The dynasty is traditionally divided into two major phases, the Western or Royal Zhou (1027&ndash;771 bc) and the Eastern Zhou (770&ndash;221 bc). During the Zhou Dynasty many of the numerous small states which characterized China in the first millennium <small class=""smCap"">bc</small> were united and organized into successively stronger groupings. Originally a pastoralist people, the Zhou kingdom was organized on a feudal basis. During the Eastern Zhou royal power declined and there was a concomitant growth in the feudal fiefs, some becoming quasi-independent kingdoms. Major developments during Zhou times included the discovery of iron-working, the introduction of coinage, the construction of defensive works that would later form part of the Great Wall of China, and the institution of tiered administration. The Zhou Dynasty was eventually conquered by its rivals, the state of Qin, in about 220 bc."

<b>Çatal Hüyük, Turkey</b></b>
<span class=""red""><b><i>[Si].</b></i></span>
<div class=""content"">A large Neolithic tell standing on the edge of the Konya Plain near Çumra in south central Turkey. Extensive excavations have taken place in the East Mound at the site, first by James Mellaart between 1961 and 1964 and more recently since 1993 by Ian Hodder and a large international team. The East Mound covers about 13.5ha and has 20m of stratified deposits dating to between 6400 bc and 5600 bc. From at least 6300 bc Çatal Hüyük seems to have been a village of mud-brick houses, each built to a fairly standard plan with a kitchen living room and storage area spread over about 25 square metres. The houses were built against one another with no streets or courtyards in between, suggesting that access was through the roof. Built-in furniture includes benches and platforms. Some houses had painted and relief ornamentation on the walls that included bull motifs and stylized images of a human female, in some cases giving birth. Stylized bulls heads (bucrania) were on the walls of some rooms. Burials under the floor were common, those in the highly decorated houses often being accompanied by precious objects. Mellaart argued that the decorated houses were shrines, but this view is not shared by Hodder and later writers.<br class=""nLine"" />Economic evidence shows that cereals were cultivated and that cattle, perhaps locally domesticated, made up 90 per cent of the animal bone assemblage. Sheep and goats were hunted and may have been domesticated in the later levels. Woodworking, weaving, obsidian working, and perhaps some incipient metalworking in copper and lead are represented. The inhabitants of the settlement had extensive trading links with western Asia. Bull horns and cattle motifs have such a prominent place that they must have been highly significant in the belief systems and ideology of the population, together with the so-called ‘mother goddess’.<br class=""nLine"" />[Sum.: J.

Excavated intermittently between 1964 and 1981 by Robert Braidwood, the occupation of the site begins about 7300 bc. Five main phases were identified, all aceramic. In phases I and II there were the fragmentary walls of rectangular houses and round pit-ovens. The inhabitants of these phases were reliant on wild animals, but some traces of domesticated cereals were present. In phases IV and V domesticated sheep, goat, and pig were present alongside the domesticated cereals. Even in the later phases, however, hunting still made an important contribution to the economy. The site is also important for the quality of its architecture even from the earliest levels and the fact that in the later phases there is evidence for the small-scale use of locally derived copper.<br class=""nLine"" />[Rep.: L.
