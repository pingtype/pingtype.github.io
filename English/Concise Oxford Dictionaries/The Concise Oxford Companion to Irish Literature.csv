The priests with Patrick are frightened by these strange-looking men with their enormous wolfhounds; when the saint exorcises the warriors, legions of devils leave them.

<b>Anglo-Irish literature</b>,<div class=""content"">a term used to describe Irish writing in English which helps to distinguish this tradition from English literature and literature in Gaelic. The term Anglo-Irish was applied increasingly by 19th-cent. historians of the Protestant <a href=""entry://ascendancy""><span class=""links"">ascendancy</span></a> to register growing awareness of the political and social circumstances of British settlers in Ireland. It came into general use as a term to describe Irish writing in English only after the Anglo-Irish had ceased to be the dominant class following the Land War [see <a href=""entry://Land League""><span class=""links"">Land League</span></a>]. Thomas <a href=""entry://MacDonagh, Thomas""><span class=""links"">MacDonagh </span></a>, in <i>Literature in Ireland: Studies Irish and Anglo-Irish</i> (1916), argued that Anglo-Irish literature could express Irish cultural identity, and that the use of <a href=""entry://Hiberno-English""><span class=""links"">Hiberno-English</span></a> would help further its distinctness. In <i>Anglo-Irish Essays</i> (1917), John <a href=""entry://Eglinton, John""><span class=""links"">Eglinton </span></a> applied the term generally to Irish writers after John <a href=""entry://Bale, John""><span class=""links"">Bale </span></a>. It had already gained currency as a term for modern Irish writing in English when the bibliographer Stephen <a href=""entry://Brown, Stephen""><span class=""links"">Brown </span></a> employed it in 1919 to describe the body of writing investigated in Ernest Boyd's <i>Ireland's Literary Renaissance</i> (1916). In <i>Synge and Anglo-Irish Literature</i> (1931), Daniel <a href=""entry://Corkery, Daniel""><span class=""links"">Corkery </span></a> associated it with an attitude of mind, expressed in the work of <a href=""entry://Somerville and Ross ""><span class=""links"">Somerville and Ross </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a>, and Lady <a href=""entry://Gregory, Lady""><span class=""links"">Gregory </span></a>, which he saw as alien to Irish life.<br class=""nLine"" />Since then the term has been adopted for all periods in literary histories and bibliographies. In 1968 A. N. <a href=""entry://Jeffares, A[lexander] N[orman]""><span class=""links"">Jeffares </span></a> founded the International Association for the Study of Anglo-Irish Literature (IASAIL, later IASIL, where the term is dropped to refer to ‘Irish Literatures’) which has done much to promote world-wide academic study of all of Irish writing. The term cannot comfortably be applied to most Irish writing after 1922, for there is something less than satisfactory in describing Thomas <a href=""entry://Kinsella, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Kinsella </span></a>, or Seamus <a href=""entry://Heaney, Seamus [Justin]""><span class=""links"">Heaney </span></a> as Anglo-Irish writers, hence IASIL rather than IASAIL.<br class=""nLine"" />Anglo-Irish literature has taken as recurrent themes the country of Ireland itself, its land, government, and laws; its different and often mutually antagonistic political and religious cultures; and matters of history and society, language and tradition. As a literature of a country colonized by Britain, it has been especially preoccupied with questions of national identity.<br class=""nLine"" />Language was always a crucial issue, in that the history of Anglo-Irish literature was co-extensive with the substitution of English for Irish as the language of the majority. An enriching consequence of the displacement of Irish has been a questioning or comic attitude to language, leading to subtlety and nuance in the use of Hiberno-English, as well as to crude <a href=""entry://stage-Irishman""><span class=""links"">stage-Irish</span></a> misrepresentation. It has been profoundly influenced by the indigenous literature in Irish, from which it derived an atmosphere imbued with ancient Celtic <a href=""entry://mythology""><span class=""links"">mythology</span></a>, a love of nature's intricacy and detail, and an earthy realism. The <a href=""entry://literary revival""><span class=""links"">literary revival</span></a>, a late flowering of Anglo-Irish literature, drew extensively upon the variety of its sources, with Lady Gregory and Synge building upon native elements.See <p class=""blk"">A.N.&nbsp;Jeffares, <i>Anglo-Irish Literature</i> (1982) and &nbsp;Deane, <i>A Short History of Irish Literature</i> (1986).</p>"

"archaeology, Irish","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>archaeology, Irish</b>.<div class=""content"">The study of the human past in Ireland, through analysis of the material remains of different cultures, has established that when New Stone Age (neolithic) farmers arrived about 3000 BC they encountered very few inhabitants, though evidence exists for earlier settlements near beaches in Antrim, Down, and Louth, and along the River Bann extending back as far as 6000 BC. The presence of neolithic settlers from about 3000 BC is deduced from artefacts such as pottery and flint arrow- and axe-heads, as well as by the form of megalithic long-barrow and passage tombs&mdash;tombs constructed of large stones covered over by elongated earth barrows or circular mounds. The long-barrows are of two types: the court tomb and the portal tomb (the latter also frequently known as the portal dolmen). The court tomb is so called because the passage leading into the burial chamber at the recessed end of the barrow opens out to an open space or court immediately in front of the burial chamber itself. There are more than 300 court tombs sited mostly in the northern half of the country with concentrations in Mayo, Sligo, north Donegal, and around Carlingford Lough. Portal tombs are so called from the two large upright stones forming the entrance to the burial chamber; a capstone is set over these and slopes backwards to rest on backstones. Originally covered by a barrow, in their denuded state they are striking features of the Irish landscape. Ireland has some 150 examples of portal tombs, mostly in the court tomb area.<br class=""nLine"" />The passage tombs are a separate category to the long-barrow types, and include some of the most remarkable megalithic constructions in Europe, among them <a href=""entry://New Grange""><span class=""links"">New Grange</span></a>, Knowth, Dowth in Co. Meath, and Carrowkeel in Co. Sligo. The passage tombs are most often set on a hilltop inside a large circular mound surrounded by kerbstones. The burial chamber is entered by a passage, often of considerable length. Many of the stones are engraved with ornamentations such as spirals, interconnecting loops, lozenges, and circles with lines emanating from them. The tombs are mainly concentrated along an axis from the mouth of the Boyne to Sligo, with other examples on the Antrim coastline and in Leinster. They date from roughly the same period as the long-barrow tombs but would appear to represent a more advanced culture.<br class=""nLine"" />In the Bronze Age remains were interred with food vessels or beakers, hence the term ‘Beaker Folk’. During the Bronze Age Ireland had a significant metal industry, and exported artefacts in bronze, copper, and gold to Britain and the Continent. Bronze rapiers and gold torcs survive from <i>c.</i>1000 BC, while from <i>c.</i>700 BC there are trumpets and cauldrons in bronze, as well as many types of gold ornament. From this period the type of lake-dwelling known as the crannóg, wooden platforms built near the lake's edge, make their appearance. With the <a href=""entry://Celts""><span class=""links"">Celts</span></a>, who probably began to arrive <i>c.</i>300 BC, came the Iron Age culture known as La Tène, after a site in Switzerland, which had a characteristic style of ornamentation seen on such monuments as the Turoe Stone, and in metalwork. The Celts also introduced the ring fort, which remained the basis of the social structure of pre-Christian Ireland.<br class=""nLine"" />Amongst the hill forts are <a href=""entry://Emain Macha""><span class=""links"">Emain Macha</span></a>, Ráth na Ríogh at <a href=""entry://Tara""><span class=""links"">Tara</span></a>, Grianán Ailigh in Donegal, and Dún Aonghusa on Aranmore.

Some carry <a href=""entry://ogam""><span class=""links"">ogam</span></a> inscriptions. There are also stone circles which belong to the early Bronze Age.

<b>bardic poetry</b>
<i>(also bardic schools, bardic learning, etc.)</i>,<div class=""content"">also known as classical poetry, is used to refer to the writings of poets trained in the bardic schools of Ireland and Gaelic Scotland down to the middle of the 17th cent. Poetic schools existed in Ireland before Christianity, and the training poets received in them had its origins in the druidic learning associated with the religion of Celtic Gaul, Britain, and Ireland. In early writings the terms ‘bard’ and ‘fili’ are both used for ‘poet’, a fili being someone with a special responsibility towards traditional knowledge, <a href=""entry://law in Gaelic Ireland""><span class=""links"">laws</span></a>, language, grammar, and senchus (lore, including <a href=""entry://dinnshenchas""><span class=""links"">dinnshenchas</span></a>, place-lore), whereas a bard was a poet or versifier. The term ‘bard’ is used, most often pejoratively, in the Anglo-Irish <a href=""entry://Anglo-Irish chronicles""><span class=""links"">chronicles</span></a> to refer to members of the poetic caste in Gaelic Ireland, and it was, though with some misgivings [see <a href=""entry://Bergin, Osborn [Joseph]""><span class=""links"">Osborn Bergin </span></a>], adopted to refer to poetry composed in the variety of syllabic rhyming metres known as dán díreach [see Irish <a href=""entry://metrics, Irish""><span class=""links"">metrics</span></a>] practised by Irish and Scottish poets from the 6th to the 17th cents. With the advent of Christianity the fili's role and functions were gradually absorbed into the Church's pastoral and educational activities.<br class=""nLine"" />In the 12th cent. the poets established schools throughout Ireland comparable to the monastic centres of learning. Each bardic school was associated with a poetic family: the <a href=""entry://Ó hUiginn""><span class=""links"">Ó hUiginns</span></a> had theirs in Sligo, the <a href=""entry://Ó Dálaigh""><span class=""links"">Ó Dálaighs</span></a> in Cork, and the <a href=""entry://Ó hEÓdhasa""><span class=""links"">Ó hEÓdhasas</span></a> in Fermanagh. Teaching was conducted orally, but there was also instruction from Irish and Latin <a href=""entry://manuscripts in Irish""><span class=""links"">manuscripts</span></a>; the course of study often lasted seven years; and tuition was given in language, <a href=""entry://metrics, Irish""><span class=""links"">metrics</span></a>, <a href=""entry://genealogy""><span class=""links"">genealogy</span></a>, Latin, dinnshenchas, <a href=""entry://mythology""><span class=""links"">mythology</span></a>, and history. Students composed alone in the dark on allotted subjects and in given metres, reciting their verses in public performance. Each poetic family had a head, who would have the support of a Gaelic dynastic lord (the patrons of the Mac an Bhairds, for example, were the O'Donnells), in return for which the poet would compose eulogies, exhortations, and elegies.<br class=""nLine"" />From the 12th to the 17th cents. the bardic caste enjoyed high prestige, and became the secular chroniclers and interpreters of a society which was deeply conservative and based on privilege. They developed a formalized literary language which changed little, if at all, over this period. Poets could, and often did, move from one part of Ireland to another, or between Gaelic Scotland and Ireland, with little difficulty. Their approach to their official duties, whether of inauguration, advice, or lament, was to appeal to the past. Not all of this verse was official: many of the poems that figure in the <a href=""entry://Fionn cycle""><span class=""links"">Fionn</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Ulster cycle""><span class=""links"">Ulster</span></a>, <a href=""entry://mythological cycle""><span class=""links"">mythological</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://historical cycle""><span class=""links"">historical cycles</span></a> were composed by poets trained to some degree or other in the schools of the learned bardic families. The craft, sophistication, and self-conscious linguistic wit of bardic poetry also inform the <a href=""entry://dánta grádha""><span class=""links"">dánta grádha</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />The fortunes of the bardic order were closely involved with those of the Gaelic aristocracy, and when that began to collapse under the Elizabethan and Tudor reconquests the poetic institution also declined.

<b>Behan, Brendan</b>
<i>(Breandán Ó Beacháin )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1923&ndash;1964),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> playwright. Born in Dublin into a talented Republican family, he was taught by the Christian Brothers until 14. Behan joined Fianna Éireann, the junior branch of the <a href=""entry://IRA""><span class=""links"">IRA</span></a>, at an early age. He became a house-painter like his father. In 1939 he was arrested in Liverpool for taking part in an IRA bombing campaign. During his three-year sentence, spent mostly in Borstal in Suffolk, he began to write. Shortly after his release in 1941 Behan attempted to kill a detective and served five years in prison. The autobiographical <i><a href=""entry://Borstal Boy""><span class=""links"">Borstal Boy</i></a></span>, not published until 1958 was begun around this time. He also wrote poetry in Irish. He wrote his first play, <i>The Landlady</i>, while in prison at the Curragh, and <i>The <a href=""entry://Quare Fellow, The""><span class=""links"">Quare Fellow</i></a></span>. <i>The Quare Fellow</i> was rejected by both the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey</span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Gate Theatre""><span class=""links"">Gate</span></a> before being staged at the experimental Pike Theatre by Alan Simpson and Carolyn Swift . A successful London production directed by Joan Littlewood followed in 1956. Behan's self-destructive career as showman began after a notorious BBC television interview in which he appeared drunk and belligerent. His next play <i>The <a href=""entry://Hostage, The""><span class=""links"">Hostage</i></a></span> (1958), first produced in Irish as <i>An <a href=""entry://Giall, An""><span class=""links"">Giall</i></a></span> at the Damer Hall in Dublin (1958), has proved to be his most enduring work for the stage. Behan's marriage to Beatrice ffrench-Salkeld in 1955 failed to tame his damaging life-style, even after he was diagnosed as diabetic. A trip to New York in 1960 proved disastrous. He wrote very little subsequently, although he discovered the tape-recorder and, with <i>Brendan Behan's Island</i> (1962), found he could make books from anecdotes.

Berkeley went to London in 1713 and published <i>Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous</i>. He became friendly with Addison, Pope, and Richard <a href=""entry://Steele, Sir Richard""><span class=""links"">Steele </span></a>, through Swift, who presented him at Court. <i>De Motu</i> (1721) criticized Newton's philosophy of nature and Leibniz's theory of force. He returned in 1721 to Ireland. In 1724 Berkeley was appointed Dean of Derry, but he wished to establish a missionary college in Bermuda. He sailed for Rhode Island in 1729, and established himself in Newport, awaiting funds, returning in 1731 when the money was not forthcoming. <i><a href=""entry://Alciphron, or The Minute Philosopher""><span class=""links"">Alciphron</i></a></span> (1732), written during his stay in Rhode Island, is an apologetic work designed to combat atheism and free-thinking. His <i>Theory of Vision Vindicated</i> (1733) defends his first essay. A polemical work on mathematics, <i>The Analyst</i> (1734), shows that free-thinking mathematicians are themselves guilty of logical absurdity. In 1734 he was appointed Bishop of Cloyne, and he took up residence in Co. Cork in the following year. He was particularly exercised by the poor economic state of Ireland at the time. He gave an account of the facts and proposed remedies in <i>The <a href=""entry://Querist, The""><span class=""links"">Querist</i></a></span>, published in three parts in 1735, 1736, and 1737. He wished to promote harmony between the established Church and the Catholic clergy, and in <i>Words to the Wise</i> (1749) he appealed for conciliation. One of Berkeley's last published works was <a href=""entry://Siris""><span class=""links"">Siris</span></a>: <i>A Chain of Philosophical Reflexions and Inquiries concerning the Virtues of Tar-Water</i> (1744). He believed in tar-water as a universal medical panacea. His philosophy is a rejoinder to John Locke's on the nature of perception and the material world. Berkeley took the view in his <i>Principles</i> and <i>New Theory of Vision</i> that a sufficient explanation of knowledge can be found in the claim that our perceptions constitute what there is (hence <i>esse est percipi</i>, ‘to be is to be perceived’). This denial of objects independent of minds and their contents is immaterialism. He had, also, recourse to a God who underpins human experience of a common rather than a private world.

Educated in Dublin and London, he became an actor under the name ‘Lee Moreton’ . The success of his comedy <i><a href=""entry://London Assurance""><span class=""links"">London Assurance</i></a></span> at Covent Garden in 1841 led, in the following four years, to twenty-two plays being produced on the London stage. After marrying a rich French widow in 1845 he went to Paris. When his wife died he returned to London in 1848, where profligate spending soon led to bankruptcy. Boucicault began a second career as an actor, and met his future wife, Agnes Robertson . When she went to America in 1853 to exploit her London success, he went with her. His success in the USA with <i>The <a href=""entry://Colleen Bawn, The""><span class=""links"">Colleen Bawn</i></a></span> (1860), made him decide to return to London. In 1872 he returned to America, touring all the larger cities in the USA and Canada. He spent his last years as the impoverished director of an actingschool in New York. He was one of the most prolific playwrights of the 19th cent., writing some 150 plays. His greatest achievement lay in melodrama. Plays such as <i>The Poor of New York</i> (1857), <i>The <a href=""entry://Octoroon, The""><span class=""links"">Octoroon</i></a></span> (1859), <i>The Colleen Bawn</i> (1860), <i>Omoo</i> (1864), <i><a href=""entry://Arrah-na-Pogue""><span class=""links"">Arrah-na-Pogue</i></a></span> (1864/5), <i>The Long Strike</i> (1866), <i>Flying Scud</i> (1866), <i>After Dark</i> (1868), <i>Belle Lamar</i> (1874), and <i>The <a href=""entry://Shaughraun, The""><span class=""links"">Shaughraun</i></a></span> (1875) are masterpieces of the genre.

In 1921, after a brief spell as an art student in London, she became engaged to a lieutenant, but she did not marry him.

In 1923, she published <i>Encounters</i>, a collection of stories, and married Alan Cameron. The stories collected in <i>Ann Lee</i>'s (1926) and <i>Joining Charles</i> (1929) were followed by <i>Friends and Relations</i> (1931), a novel dealing with English middle-class life, and <i>To the North</i> (1932), which explores passions underlying the social façade. <i>The Cat Jumps</i> (1934), <i>Look at all Those Roses</i> (1941), and <i>The <a href=""entry://Demon Lover, The""><span class=""links"">Demon Lover</i></a></span> (1945), contain short stories, a form which she felt allowed for extremes of experience.

"Burke, Edmund","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Burke, Edmund</b><div class=""content""><i>(1729&ndash;1797),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> political philosopher; born at Arran Quay, Dublin, the son of a Protestant lawyer and a Catholic mother, Mary Nagle from Co. Cork. He spent some years in Co. Cork with his mother's people, then joined the Quaker School in Ballitore, Co. Kildare, before going to TCD. He studied law at the Middle Temple in London. <i>A Vindication of Natural Society</i> (1756) was a defence of the established social order. In 1757 he married Jane Nugent, a Catholic, and in the same year published <i>A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the <a href=""entry://Sublime and Beautiful""><span class=""links"">Sublime and Beautiful</i></a></span>, his treatise on aesthetics. In 1758 he began to edit the newly-established <i>Annual Register</i>, a yearly digest of politics, history, and the arts. In 1765 Burke became private secretary to Lord Rockingham, the Prime Minister, and was returned as MP for Wendover, throwing himself into Commons activity. <i><a href=""entry://Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents""><span class=""links"">Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents</i></a></span> (1770) grew out of his anger at the failure of the Rockingham ministry to control George III's interventionist approach to Parliament. In 1773 Burke spent a month in Paris; there he encountered Diderot, one of the French <i>philosophes</i> whom he would later attack in his <i><a href=""entry://""entry://Reflections on the Revolution in France""""><span class=""links"">Reflections on the Revolution in France</i></a></span>, and also met Louis XV, the Dauphin, and the Dauphine Marie Antoinette at Versailles. In April 1774, by which time he was the Rockingham spokesman on American affairs, he delivered his <i>Speech on American Taxation</i> in the Commons, arguing vehemently against the imposition of a tea tax. In this year he also became MP for Bristol. Around this time he became a close friend of Charles James Fox. He invested in the East India Company and began to take an interest in Indian affairs. Burke was the driving force behind a Commons select committee on India, whose Ninth Report (1782) gave a detailed account of mismanagement and corruption in the East India Company. He attacked Warren Hastings, Governor-General of Bengal, whose impeachment was to occupy him on and off from 1786 to 1795, when Hastings was finally acquitted. On the centenary of the Glorious Revolution (4 November 1788) Dr Richard Price, a Dissenting minister, gave a speech in London welcoming the events unfolding in France, Burke read the speech in early 1789 and immediately began writing his <i><a href=""entry://""entry://Reflections on the Revolution in France""""><span class=""links"">Reflections</i></a></span>. A powerful defence of English constitutional liberty, it developed and expanded the central tenets of his political thought. Burke's <i>Appeal from the Old to the New Whigs</i> (1791) warned against the tyranny of government by democratic majority. Fearful that revolutionary principles would find a ready audience in Ireland, Burke supported the Catholic Committee in Dublin then campaigning for relief measures [see <a href=""entry://Catholic Emancipation""><span class=""links"">Catholic Emancipation</span></a>]. His <i><a href=""entry://Letter to Sir H. Langrishe""><span class=""links"">Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe</i></a></span> (1792) argued the necessity of representation for Catholics. <i><a href=""entry://Letters on a Regicide Peace""><span class=""links"">Letters on a Regicide Peace</i></a></span> (1795/6) urged Britain to defend the established order in Europe. In a <i><a href=""entry://Letter to a Noble Lord, A""><span class=""links"">Letter to a Noble Lord</i></a></span> (1796) he defended himself against an insult in the House of Lords regarding his civil-list pension, offering a dignified appraisal of his own career in the service of constitutional freedom. Although dying of stomach cancer, he continued to attack French expansionism and to excoriate the Protestant ascendancy in the Dublin Parliament for their intransigence on the Catholic question. Burke was the architect of modern British conservative thought, the leading principles of which he shaped in his reflections upon the great questions of his time.

Under his influence he joined the Church of Ireland. The first version of <i>‘The <a href=""entry://‘Lough Derg Pilgrim, The’""><span class=""links"">Lough Derg Pilgrim</i></a>’</span> appeared in Otway's <i><a href=""entry://Christian Examiner and Church of Ireland Magazine, The""><span class=""links"">Christian Examiner</i></a></span> in 1828, followed later that year by <i>‘The Broken Oath’</i> and the serialized novella, <i><a href=""entry://Father Butler""><span class=""links"">Father Butler</i></a></span>. <i>Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry</i> (1830) were critical accounts of rural life and customs followed by a second series in 1833.

In 1855 he published <i>Willy Reilly and his Dear Colleen Bawn</i>, which ran to over thirty editions.

"Catholicism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Catholicism</b><div class=""content"">emerged as a distinctive force in Ireland during the late 16th and 17th cents., when it became clear that the imposition of the new Anglican State Church had failed, and that the Counter-Reformation had put down roots among the majority population. Irish Catholics were politically impotent at the beginning of the 18th cent. because of the <a href=""entry://Penal Laws""><span class=""links"">Penal Laws</span></a>. An adversarial relationship with the State created an essentially domestic Church, deprived of the public dimension of Continental Catholicism. In a cultural milieu where social and religious behaviour was largely regulated by custom, the central religious events were communal occasions such as the wake, pattern (a celebration of a local patron saint's feastday), and station (when Mass was said in a house for which neighbours gathered). In the aftermath of the French Revolution the British and Vatican administrations moved to neutralize the threat of a Jacobinized Irish Catholic population. Catholic Relief Acts were passed in 1792 and 1793 and Maynooth College was opened in 1795. Daniel <a href=""entry://O'Connell, Daniel""><span class=""links"">O'Connell </span></a> channelled the national question into a Catholic stream. The rapid politicization of Irish Catholics paved the way for Catholic Emancipation in 1829. Catholicism would henceforth be a dominant force within Irish nationalist culture. Throughout the 19th cent. Irish Catholicism became more assertive and more Roman in character, as the institutional Church eclipsed its vernacular predecessor. The development of a heroic historiography of Irish Catholic resistance also permitted the Church to see itself as the historical, psychic, and societal core of Irish experience. With the emergence of the southern <a href=""entry://Irish State""><span class=""links"">Irish State</span></a>, the Catholic Church was accorded a ‘special position’ in the 1937 Constitution (a clause removed by referendum in 1972). Irish Catholicism increasingly became a target for oppositional intellectuals in the 1960s and 1970s, yet it remained resistant to modernizing influences in some respects."

Two northern varieties of British, Pictish and Cumbrian, died out in the early Middle Ages, while Cornish survived until the 18th cent. The Celtic languages are most closely related to the Italic group of languages and somewhat more remotely to the Germanic. The Celtic languages are frequently classified into q-Celtic and p-Celtic, according to whether they retained the Indo-European sound ‘q’ or changed it to ‘p’. The q-Celtic languages are Celtiberian and Gaelic. All the others are p-Celtic. For the past 2,000 years the Celtic languages have been under pressure from the Germanic and Latin languages. In Britain and Ireland the languages survived to modern times but in an ever-decreasing geographical area."

From around 1000 to 100 BC they spread out from their original territory, probably that area of present-day central Europe in which the border of southern Germany meets that of the Czech Republic and Austria, ranging eventually from Britain and Ireland to Spain, Transylvania, Galatia, and Italy. At <i>c.</i>500 BC, the beginning of the second period of the Iron Age, the La Tène period&mdash;so named after a site discovered in the 19th cent. at Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland&mdash;the Celts begin to enter the written record in the works of Greek historians. The oldest archaeological evidence relating to them comes from Hallstadt, Austria, and dates to <i>c.</i>700 BC. Celtic peoples had settled in Britain from the 5th cent. BC. From about the 3rd cent. BC it is reasonable to refer to a Celtic presence in Ireland. Of the pre-Celtic language or languages of Ireland nothing is known. The Romans did not annex Ireland, with the consequence that, until the invasion of the <a href=""entry://Viking invasion""><span class=""links"">Vikings</span></a> in the 9th cent., Celtic civilization and culture survived intact in Ireland. Celtic society, as with most Indo-European societies, was patriarchal. Its religion [see Irish <a href=""entry://mythology""><span class=""links"">mythology</span></a>] associated deities with rivers, wells, and trees. The oak was sacred, and there were animal-gods, such as Taruos in Gaul (Irish tarbh), and the mare Epona [Irish ech, reflecting the p/q differentiation&mdash;see <a href=""entry://Celtic languages""><span class=""links"">Celtic languages</span></a>]. They believed in an afterlife, which was why they showed such disregard for death in battle. Fasting against an enemy, a widespread Indo-European custom, was sometimes used to obtain redress of a wrong."

In 1967 a Bill was passed allowing for the unbanning of books after twelve years; gradually censorship relaxed in the 1970s and 1980s."

His role as the originator of the stereotypical view dominating the chronicles was applauded by John Hooker in his contribution to Holinshed's <i>Chronicles</i> (1577), and later condemned in the leading work of <a href=""entry://Gaelic historiography""><span class=""links"">Gaelic historiography</span></a>, Geoffrey <a href=""entry://Keating, Geoffrey""><span class=""links"">Keating's </span></a>
<i><a href=""entry://Foras Feasa ar Éirinn""><span class=""links"">Foras Feasa ar Éirinn</i></a></span> (1613&ndash;34).

<i>A Discovery of the True Causes Why Ireland Was Never Entirely Subdued</i> (1612), Barnaby Rich's <i>A New Description of Ireland</i> (1617), and Fynes Moryson's <i>Itinerary</i> (1617) are pervaded by comparisons between the Irish and uncivilized races in other historical and geographical contexts, whether the barbarians of classical antiquity, the savage American ‘Indians’ of the New World, or the Britons before the Roman invasion. In the chronicles Ireland is commonly split into highly differentiated geopolitical regions. The civility of town life in the Pale [see <a href=""entry://Irish State""><span class=""links"">Irish State</span></a>] and the agricultural wealth of heavily colonized Munster were starkly contrasted with the dank woods and impassable bogs where lurked the Irish rebels. The dangers of such regions are described in works such as William Camden's <i>Britannia</i> (1586). Many of the ethnographic themes and xenophobic caricatures sketched crudely in these writings were later refined into comedy by Anglo-Irish writers from Maria <a href=""entry://Edgeworth, Maria""><span class=""links"">Edgeworth </span></a> to Charles <a href=""entry://Lever, Charles [James]""><span class=""links"">Lever </span></a>. Their racist verdict on Gaelic Ireland before and after the Norman invasion was challenged by historiographers in the native tradition such as Philip <a href=""entry://O'Sullivan Beare, Philip""><span class=""links"">O'Sullivan Beare </span></a>, Keating, and Roderick <a href=""entry://O'Flaherty, Roderick""><span class=""links"">O'Flaherty </span></a>."

<b>Clarke, Austin</b>
<i>[Augustine Joseph ]</i><div class=""content""><i>(1896&ndash;1974),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> poet, playwright, and novelist. Born in Dublin, and educated by the Jesuits, and at UCD where he studied under Douglas <a href=""entry://Hyde, Douglas""><span class=""links"">Hyde </span></a> and Thomas <a href=""entry://MacDonagh, Thomas""><span class=""links"">MacDonagh </span></a>. <i>The Vengeance of Fionn</i> (1917), a narrative poem, brought immediate recognition. He fell unhappily in love with the playwright Geraldine <a href=""entry://Cummins, Geraldine [Dorothy]""><span class=""links"">Cummins </span></a>, and suffered a mental collapse. On New Year's Eve 1920 he and Cummins married in a registry office, and he lost his post at UCD, apparently because of the civil marriage. In 1922 Clarke left for London and worked as a book-reviewer for fifteen years. His interest in Irish saga continued with <i>The Cattle Drive in Connaught</i> (1925), which tells of the disputes that lead to <i><a href=""entry://Táin Bó Cuailnge""><span class=""links"">Táin Bó Cuailnge</i></a></span>, but his growing fascination with medieval Ireland is reflected in <i>The Son of Learning</i> (performed 1927, possibly written earlier), a play based upon the 12th-cent. <i><a href=""entry://Aislinge meic Conglinne""><span class=""links"">Aislinge Meic Conglinne</i></a></span>. In <i>Pilgrimage and Other Poems</i> (1929), he turned to the drama of racial conscience which was to become the dominant theme of his work. <i>The <a href=""entry://Bright Temptation, The""><span class=""links"">Bright Temptation</i></a></span> (1932), first of his three romances of medieval Ireland, interweaves motifs from Irish tales, a device that culminates in the ingenuity of <i>The <a href=""entry://Sun Dances at Easter, The""><span class=""links"">Sun Dances at Easter</i></a></span> (1952); but <i>The <a href=""entry://Singing-Men at Cashel, The""><span class=""links"">Singing-Men at Cashel</i></a></span> (1936) gives a portrayal of a conscience-stricken mind. In 1938 he was the subject of an offensive caricature in Samuel <a href=""entry://Beckett, Samuel [Barclay]""><span class=""links"">Beckett's </span></a>
<i><a href=""entry://Murphy""><span class=""links"">Murphy</i></a></span>, where his experiments with Gaelic prosody and his sexual repression are mocked in the figure of Austin Ticklepenny . In 1937 Clarke returned to Ireland with his wife Nora Walker, settling at Bridge House, Templeogue. As he had failed in a divorce action against Geraldine Cummins his marital position was irregular, and he suffered another nervous breakdown. The sombre poems of <i>Night and Morning</i> (1938) suggest the psychological impasse he had reached. Clarke began a prolonged silence as a poet, not broken until <i>Ancient Lights</i> (1955). During the 1940s he devoted himself to verse drama. With Robert Farren [<a href=""entry://Ó Faracháin, Roibeárd""><span class=""links"">Ó Faracháin</span></a>] he established the <a href=""entry://Lyric Theatre Company""><span class=""links"">Lyric Theatre Company</span></a>. Among the more successful of his own plays are <i>The Flame</i> (1930) and <i>As the Crow Flies</i> (1943), for radio. The poetry written after 1955 showed a renewed energy. In protest against social injustices in contemporary Ireland, he added a satiric dimension to his quarrel with Irish Catholicism, attacking specific instances of clerical and state abuse. <i>Later Poems</i> (1961) greatly extended his reputation. Several substantial collections followed, including <i>Flight to Africa</i> (1963) and the sequence <i>Mnemosyne Lay in Dust</i> (1966), a long poem dealing with his period in St Patrick's Hospital. He wrote prolifically into his 70s, returning to mythological subjects in his last poems. <i>‘The Healing of Mis’</i> and <i>Tiresias</i> (1971) are exuberantly sexual narratives. He wrote two volumes of autobiography, <i><a href=""entry://Twice Round the Black Church""><span class=""links"">Twice Round the Black Church</i></a></span> (1962) and <i>A <a href=""entry://Penny in the Clouds, A""><span class=""links"">Penny in the Clouds</i></a></span> (1968).

On his return to Dublin in 1910 he organized the Socialist Party of Ireland. In 1913 he established the Citizen Army in order to protect worker's rights during the Lock-Out Strike. At the outbreak of the First World War he opposed attempts to introduce military conscription in Ireland. In 1916 he was appointed commander of the Republican forces in Dublin, acting from headquarters at the GPO [see <a href=""entry://Easter Rising""><span class=""links"">Easter Rising</span></a>]. Though badly wounded in the fighting, he was sentenced to death by a British court martial and executed strapped in a chair on 12 May. <i>Labour in Irish History</i> (1910), the most influential of his writings, interprets early Irish society as socialist."

His play <i>King and Hermit</i> (1909) dramatizes a conflict between civil authority and the spirit. <i>A Munster Twilight</i> (1916) was a collection of short stories drawing on his familiarity with the west Cork <a href=""entry://Gaeltacht""><span class=""links"">Gaeltacht</span></a> to illustrate the persistence of Gaelic culture. Cork city is the setting for his novel <i>The <a href=""entry://Threshold of Quiet, The""><span class=""links"">Threshold of Quiet</i></a></span> (1917), a gloomy meditation on Irish Catholic discontent. The play, <i>The Yellow Bittern</i> (1917), centres on the dying Cathal Buí <a href=""entry://Mac Giolla Ghunna, Cathal Buí""><span class=""links"">Mac Giolla Gunna </span></a> and deals with the relative merits of the Gaelic poets of Munster and Ulster. From 1901 Corkery had been a frequent contributor to D. P. <a href=""entry://Moran, D[avid] P[atrick]""><span class=""links"">Moran's </span></a>
<i>Leader</i> newspaper, sharing Moran's brand of ‘Irish-Ireland’ nationalism. <i>The Labour Leader</i> (1920) was performed at the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>; the theme is a Cork dockers' strike in which the leader Davro (modelled on Patrick Pearse ) calls for militant action. <i>The Hounds of Banba</i> (1920), a collection of stories, reflected Corkery's republicanism. In <i>The Hidden Ireland</i> (1924) he described the lives, work, and social conditions of writers such as Aodhagán <a href=""entry://Ó Rathaille, Aodhagán""><span class=""links"">Ó Rathaille </span></a>, Eoghan Rua <a href=""entry://Ó Súilleabháin, Eoghan Rua""><span class=""links"">Ó Súilleabháin </span></a>, and Brian <a href=""entry://Merriman, Brian""><span class=""links"">Merriman </span></a>, giving an account also of the <a href=""entry://aisling""><span class=""links"">aisling</span></a>, a form of vision-poem especially favoured by Munster <a href=""entry://Jacobite poetry""><span class=""links"">Jacobite poets</span></a>.<br class=""nLine"" />Corkery completed an MA at UCC in 1931, becoming Professor of English there. In the same year he published his thesis as <i>Synge and Anglo-Irish Literature</i>. With the appearance of the work on Synge, Corkery's conception of Irish society and Irish writing came under attack, and was long to remain a target for revisionist critiques of Irish-Ireland ideology. Corkery's last collection of stories, <i>Earth Out of Earth</i> (1939), showed him returning to urban settings in a mood of sympathy and tolerance. He could be doctrinaire, but his best work reveals an understanding of rural and urban life in Ireland, a sympathy for the oppressed, together with an appreciation of their longing for freedom.

The story of his origin as given in <i><a href=""entry://Compert Con Culainn""><span class=""links"">Compert Chon Culainn</i></a></span> (<i>Birth of Cú Chulainn</i>) relates that he was fathered by the god Lug [see Irish <a href=""entry://mythology""><span class=""links"">mythology</span></a>] on Deichtine, and brought up as Sétanta. His boyhood deeds (macgnímartha), narrated by Fergus in <i>Táin Bó Cuailnge</i>, mark him out as destined to become a famous if short-lived warrior. According to Fergus he received his name when Sétanta, being late for a feast at the house of Culann the smith, is attacked by the hound guarding the enclosure and kills it. The smith complains of his loss, and Sétanta undertakes to act as his guard-dog, at which the <a href=""entry://druids""><span class=""links"">druid</span></a> Cathbad renames him Cú Chulainn (the hound of Culann). In <i><a href=""entry://Tochmarc Emire""><span class=""links"">Tochmarc Emire</i></a></span> he courts and wins Emer despite the opposition of her father, Forgall Manach.

A monstrous female envoy from the fairies appears to the unmarried poet in a dream, summoning him to the court of Queen Aoibheall to answer charges of wasting his manhood when women are dying for love. He listens to complaints on subjects such as the celibacy of the clergy and marriages between old and young for purely economic reasons. At last Aoibheall pronounces judgment on the poet, who awakens as he is being severely chastised by the women of the court. <i>Cúirt an Mheán-Oíche</i> draws on the European courtly love tradition and its bawdier offshoots. These elements are subsumed into the framework of the native <a href=""entry://aisling""><span class=""links"">aisling</span></a> genre.

"dialects of Irish","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>dialects of Irish</b>.<div class=""content"">Before the 16th cent. the forms of written Irish display little variation which can be correlated with differences of region or of class. There was universal adherence in writing to a well-defined norm. The fully developed standard found in the earliest texts was already non-regional in character and was maintained by an educated class. Deviations occur increasingly from the 16th cent., but few fully localized texts, showing sufficient diagnostic features for a more detailed dialectology, occur before the 18th. From this period some fully localized records are, however, available. The most striking of these is <i>The <a href=""entry://Book of the Dean of Lismore""><span class=""links"">Book of the Dean of Lismore</i></a></span>, a 16th-cent. Perthshire text in Scots orthography. On the Isle of Man, a new orthography expressing the local dialect was developed in the 17th cent. By the end of the 18th cent. Gaelic Scotland had fully developed its own modification of traditional orthography. Knowledge of dialectal variation must primarily depend on what has been recorded of the spoken language over the last century in the Highlands, Ireland, and Man. Two large-scale dialectological surveys have been carried out: Heinrich Wagner's <i>Linguistic Atlas and Survey of Irish Dialects</i> in four volumes (1958&ndash;69) and Kenneth Jackson's <i>Linguistic Survey of Scottish Gaelic</i> (1993)."

The name has been derived from the <a href=""entry://Indo-European""><span class=""links"">Indo-European</span></a> particle dru-with the second element coming from the Indo-European root wid-, ‘to know’; but most linguists regard the word as being cognate with the Greek word for ‘oak’, a tree with which the druids are constantly associated in early sources. Most of our knowledge about the druids of Gaul and Britain is derived from classical authors. The greater part of the earliest commentaries, chiefly those by Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Caesar, can be shown to be based on the lost writings of Posidonius. Strabo and Diodorus Siculus divide the learned classes of Gaul into three, Strabo designating them druids, vates [corresponding to Irish filid], and bards. Although druidesses are mentioned in later classical sources and in early Irish literature, there is no evidence for their existence in the early period. Their main functions would seem to have been those of philosopher, judge, and teacher. While reference is made to their role as teachers they most often appear as wizards, with the power to influence the elements and to predict the future."

Some of the best short lyrics are found in unique copies in the marginalia of religious manuscripts.

Following an abortive attempt to take Dublin Castle, the main events of the Rising centred on the positions taken up by the insurgents, notably at the GPO (occupied by the main body under Pearse, Connolly, Clarke, and MacDiarmada ), the Four Courts (under Edward Daly and Sean Heuston ), the College of Surgeons on St Stephen's Green (under Michael Mallin and Countess <a href=""entry://Markievicz, Countess Constance""><span class=""links"">Markievicz </span></a>), Jacob's Factory (under MacDonagh and Major John MacBride ), the South Dublin Union (under Ceannt and Cathal Brugha ), and Boland's Mill (under Eamon <a href=""entry://De Valera, Eamon""><span class=""links"">de Valera </span></a>).

When her father died in 1547 her half-brother Edward, then 10 years old, acceded to the throne. He was followed in 1553 by Elizabeth's Catholic half-sister Mary, daughter of Catherine of Aragon. Mary, aided by her husband, Philip of Spain, osught to restore the Catholic faith. When Mary Tudor &mdash;known in English history as ‘Bloody Mary’ because of her persecution of Protestants&mdash;died in 1558, Elizabeth became Queen, to popular jubilation. She led England back to the Reformation, and became head of both Church and State. Elizabeth was excommunicated by Pope Pius V in 1570. She determined to proceed with the Reformation in Ireland [see <a href=""entry://Protestantism""><span class=""links"">Protestantism</span></a>] through the artful exploitation of contending claimants to traditional Gaelic lordships. In 1580 a force of Spanish and Italians, sent to assist the rebellion in Munster led by James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald, entrenched themselves at Smerwick in Kerry (Port del Oro), but were ruthlessly put to the sword by Arthur, Lord Grey de Wilton, to whom Edmund <a href=""entry://Spenser, Edmund""><span class=""links"">Spenser </span></a> acted as secretary.

Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, succeeded Essex as Elizabeth's commander in Ireland, defeating O'Neill and a Spanish force at the Battle of <a href=""entry://Kinsale, Battle of""><span class=""links"">Kinsale</span></a> in December 1601. The <a href=""entry://Flight of the Earls""><span class=""links"">Flight of the Earls</span></a> from Lough Swilly in 1607 completed the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland.

<b>Emain Macha</b>,<div class=""content"">the capital of the Ulaid (Ulstermen) in early Irish writing. Pseudo-historical tradition assigns its foundation to the 7th cent. BC and its collapse to about the 4th cent. AD, when the Ulaid dynasty was driven into the east of the province. The legendary site is identified with Navan Fort, a large earthwork approximately 2 miles west of Armagh, which Macha [see Irish <a href=""entry://mythology""><span class=""links"">mythology</span></a>] marked out with her breast-pin (eo-muin), having won the sovereignty of Ireland. A series of round houses, presumably associated with the regional aristocracy, gave way in the 1st cent. BC to the erection of a massive circular temple or hall. This was subsequently buried under a stone cairn and covered with an earthen mound. The literary associations of Emain Macha centre on its pivotal position as the capital of the Ulaid in the <a href=""entry://Ulster cycle""><span class=""links"">Ulster cycle</span></a>, like Camelot in the Arthurian tales.

<b>Famine, the</b>
<i>(‘the Great Hunger’)</i><div class=""content"">(1845&ndash;1848), a national disaster caused by the devastation of the potato crop by the fungus <i>phythopthera infestans</i>, reducing yields to two-thirds of normal levels in 1845 and to about one-fifth in 1846. The 1847 crop was healthy but only one-tenth of the pre-famine acreage had been planted, while the fungus reappeared in 1848. Failure on this scale wiped out the main food supply of well over half the population, pushed up the price of other foods, and caused the collapse of a tillage economy based on the intensive use of labour paid for with small plots of potato ground. Sir Robert Peel's Tory administration was able to respond effectively to the partial failure of 1845 by importing maize (‘Indian meal’) for sale at controlled prices. The Whig Government that took office in June 1846 sought to meet the much greater losses of the next year with public works, replaced from Spring 1847 by the distribution of free food from soup kitchens; but these measures proved wholly inadequate. Best estimates are that around one million people died, mainly from typhus and other diseases, while over a million emigrated between 1845 and 1851.

Field Day offered to writers and readers a ‘fifth province of the mind’ in which potential identities for Ireland could be explored outside the constraints of existing traditions. It first produced Friel's <i><a href=""entry://Translations""><span class=""links"">Translations</i></a></span> in 1980 in Derry. In 1982 Friel's The <i><a href=""entry://Communication Cord, The""><span class=""links"">Communication Cord</i></a></span> farcically re-interrogated many of the issues of <i>Translations</i>.

Friel's <i><a href=""entry://Making History""><span class=""links"">Making History</i></a></span> (1988) explored how historians can be prisoners of their own narratives. In 1990 Seamus Heaney provided a version of Sophocles' <i>Philoctetes as The Cure at Troy</i>. Tom Kilroy's <i>The Madam MacAdam Travelling Show</i> (1992) was a comic study of the nature of playing.

Heaney's <i>Open Letter</i> was a verse protest against his recent inclusion in a collection of ‘British’ poetry; and Deane's <i>Civilians and Barbarians</i> explored the destructive simplifications implicit in those terms. Thereafter, pamphlets continued to be published in groups of three. The largest of its critical undertakings was the publication of the three-volume <i>Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing</i> (1991), edited by Deane, presenting Irish writing in Irish, Latin, and English from earliest times.

"Finnegans Wake","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Finnegans Wake</b><div class=""content"">(1939), a novel by James <a href=""entry://Joyce, James [Augustine Aloysius]""><span class=""links"">Joyce </span></a> written in a highly innovative ‘dream-language’ combining multilingual puns with the stream-of-consciousness technique developed in <i><a href=""entry://Ulysses""><span class=""links"">Ulysses</i></a></span>. The title is taken from an Irish-American ballad about Tim Finnegan, a drunken hod-carrier who dies in a fall from his ladder and is revived by a splash of whiskey at his wake. It also suggests that <a href=""entry://Fionn mac Cumhaill""><span class=""links"">Fionn mac Cumhaill</span></a> will return to be punished once more for his recurrent sins. The structure of the work is largely governed by Giambattista Vico's division of human history into three ages (divine, heroic, and human), to which Joyce added a section called the <i>‘Ricorso’</i>, or return. It also systematically reflects Giordano Bruno's theory that everything in nature is realized through interaction with its opposite. The central figures of the <i>Wake</i> are Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker (HCE), Anna Livia Plurabelle (ALP), Shem the Penman, Shaun the Post, and Issy&mdash;respectively the parents, sons, and daughter living at the Mullingar Inn in Chapelizod, Co. Dublin. In a sense, however, these are not characters at all but aspects of the Dublin landscape, with the Hill of Howth and the River Liffey serving as underlying symbols for male and female in a world of flux. Other recurrent characters are the four old men, collectively called Mamalujo and modelled on the four evangelists and also an apostolic group of twelve who feature as clients in the pub, or members of a jury. The narrating voice of individual sections can generally be identified with one or other member of this polymorphous cast. In <i>‘Shem the Penman’</i>, the autobiographical section of the work, Joyce describes the work as an ‘epical forged cheque’ made up of ‘once current puns, quashed quotatoes, messes of mottage’. The narrative line of <i>Finnegans Wake</i> consists of a series of situations relating to the sexual life of the Earwicker family. HCE perpetrates a sexual misdemeanour in the Phoenix Park. ALP defends him in a letter written by Shem and carried by Shaun . The ‘litter’ is retrieved by a hen scratching in the midden. The boys endlessly contend for Issy's favours. HCE grows old and impotent, is buried, and revives. Aged ALP prepares to return as her daughter Issy to catch his eye again; and the book ends with an unfinished phrase (‘
along the’) flowing into the first words of the first paragraph (‘river-run
’). <i>Book I</i>. <i>‘The Fall’</i> retells the story of Tim Finnegan against mythical and historical backgrounds ranging from the Tower of Babel to the Wall Street Crash. <i>Book II</i>. <i>‘The Mime of Mick, Nick and the Maggies’</i> is a matinée performance in ‘the Feenicht's Playhouse’ based on children's games and full of Dublin theatrical lore. In <i>‘Night-lessons’</i> the children are at their homework studying a classroom textbook to which Shem and Shaun add rubrics in the margins. <i>‘Scene in the Pub’</i> features two television plays: <i>‘The Norwegian Captain’</i> is a love-story concerning a hunchback sailor and the daughter of a ship's chandler; the other, <i>‘How Buckley Shot the Russian General’</i> is based on a Crimean story told by Joyce's father. In <i>‘Mamalujo’</i> the romance of Tristan and Isolde is narrated by the four old men in the guise of seagulls hovering above the lovers' boat. <i>Book III</i>. <i>‘The Four Watches of Shaun’</i> describes the passage of Shaun the Post along the Liffey in a barrel. Shaun's censorious attitude combines freely with a prurient interest in sexual matters. The <i>‘Yawn’</i> chapter is a seance or an inquisition. Lying at the centre of Ireland at the Hill of Uisneach in Co. Westmeath, Shaun reveals a treasure-trove of Irish culture whose contents are transmitted in a radio broadcast involving a welter of voices. <i>Book IV</i>. The <i>‘Ricorso’</i> is a triptych with St Kevin and St Patrick in the side positions and St Laurence O'Toole at the centre. Anna Livia's letter defending HCE is given its fullest statement. The <i>Wake</i> ends with her soliloquy. Joyce began <i>Finnegans Wake</i> in autumn 1922 by accumulating material in a notebook known as <i>Buffalo Notebook</i>. Many episodes appeared as separate publications between 1924 and 1932, during which time the book was known as <i>‘Work in Progress’</i> and its final title kept a secret. Joyce frequently compared the <i>Wake</i> to another complex Irish literary production, the <i><a href=""entry://Book of Kells""><span class=""links"">Book of Kells</i></a></span>. <i>If Finnegans Wake</i> is about creation on a theological scale, its characteristic amalgam of sadness and laughter marks it as a comic masterpiece.See <p class=""blk"">&nbsp;Beckett et al., <i>Our Exagmination round His Factification for an Incamination of Work in Progress</i> (1929);</p> and <p class=""blk"">&nbsp;Bishop, <i>Joyce's Book of the Dark</i> (1986)</p>."
"Fionn cycle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Fionn cycle</b>
<i>(Fíanaigecht or Fiannaíocht) or the Ossianic cycle</i>,<div class=""content"">a body of stories centred on the exploits of the mythical hero <a href=""entry://Fionn mac Cumhaill""><span class=""links"">Fionn mac Cumhaill</span></a>, his son <a href=""entry://Oisín""><span class=""links"">Oisín </span></a> (whence ‘Ossianic’), and other famous members of the fian (warrior-band) of Fionn, collectively known as the Fianna, who hunt, fight, conduct raids, and live an open-air nomadic life. This set of literary conventions reflects a feature of early Irish society in that such bands of warriors did live outside the structures of that society while retaining links with it. One of the characteristics of the cycle is its frequent celebration of the beauty of nature, and birdsong, mountain, river, and seashore are frequently evoked. The Fionn cycle developed in Munster and Leinster and may reflect a desire on the part of medieval story-tellers and scribes in these areas to develop a counterbalance to the <a href=""entry://Ulster cycle""><span class=""links"">Ulster cycle</span></a>. However the tales spread throughout Ireland and Scotland. By the 12th cent. the literary shaping of a very old tradition of oral Fionn tales was firmly established and took one of its most impressive forms in <i><a href=""entry://Acallam na Senórach""><span class=""links"">Acallam na Senórach</i></a></span>, a compendious gathering of Fionn stories and poems uniting pagan and Christian elements, though not without strain. The cycle is set in the 3rd cent. AD, but, in the tradition, a number of the Fianna survive into Christian Ireland, providing the theme of the <i>Acallam</i>. Here St <a href=""entry://Patrick, St""><span class=""links"">Patrick</span></a> welcomes and blesses the recital of <i>Fionn lore</i> by <a href=""entry://Caoilte mac Rónáin ""><span class=""links"">Caoilte</span></a>, but in the <a href=""entry://lays""><span class=""links"">lays</span></a> that developed from the 12th cent. onwards exchanges between Oisín and Patrick become more acrimonious, the saint's dogma being countered by defiance. James <a href=""entry://Macpherson, James""><span class=""links"">Macpherson </span></a> based his Ossianic pieces on these lays. Prose tales developed too, such as <i><a href=""entry://Eachtra Bhodaigh an Chóta Lachtna""><span class=""links"">Eachtra Bhodaigh an Chóta Lachtna</i></a></span>, <i><a href=""entry://Bruidhean Chaorthainn""><span class=""links"">Bruidhean Chaorthainn</i></a></span>, <i><a href=""entry://Cath Finntrágha""><span class=""links"">Cath Finntrágha</i></a></span>, and <i><a href=""entry://Feis Tighe Chonáin""><span class=""links"">Feís Tighe Chonáin</i></a></span>. In these stories the Fianna retain their roles as protectors of Ireland; Fionn's divinatory powers are in evidence; and there is a marked responsiveness to natural beauty."
"Fionn mac Cumhaill","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Fionn mac Cumhaill</b>,<div class=""content"">hero of the <a href=""entry://Fionn cycle""><span class=""links"">Fionn</span></a> or Ossianic cycle of tales, leader of a band of warriors (fían) under the High King <a href=""entry://Cormac mac Airt ""><span class=""links"">Cormac mac Airt </span></a>. Fionn's troop, known as the Fianna, assumed pre-eminence in Irish storytelling tradition, and accounts of their exploits came to be known as Fianaigecht or Fiannaíocht. As a member and leader of a fian, a band of nomadic hunters and warriors, Fionn was to some extent an outlaw; yet he was also a poet, diviner, and sage. His father, Cumhall, was a leader of the Tara fian in the service of <a href=""entry://Conn Cétchathach""><span class=""links"">Conn Cétchathach </span></a>, High King of Ireland, while his mother was Muirne (or Muireann), daughter of a <a href=""entry://druids""><span class=""links"">druid</span></a>, so that his parentage combined warrior and visionary elements. As well as being endowed with physical courage, Fionn possesses a gift of special insight which he can summon by biting his finger. Thereafter he finds himself inspired with imbas (great knowledge) whenever he puts the damaged finger into his mouth. By chewing his thumb to the marrow&mdash;an activity known as teinm laída (chewing the pith)&mdash;or by putting it under his déad feasa (tooth of knowledge) he can attain the state of wisdom. When Cormac mac Airt becomes King, Fionn serves him and protects Ireland from foreign invasion, as narrated in <i><a href=""entry://Cath Finntrágha""><span class=""links"">Cath Finntrágha</i></a></span>. Noted members of Fionn's warrior-band were Caoilte mac Rónáin, and <a href=""entry://Conan Maol mac Mórna""><span class=""links"">Conán mac Mórna </span></a> the buffoon. Fionn had his headquarters at the Hill of Allen in Co. Kildare (Almu or Almha). In the main tale of the Fionn cycle, <i><a href=""entry://Tóraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne""><span class=""links"">Tóraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne</i></a></span>, Fionn appears as a vindictive and jealous older man, initially threatened by the youthful Diarmuid but eventually getting Gráinne back. According to <i>Aided Finn</i> (<i>Death of Fionn</i>), Fionn is killed by the five sons of Urgriu after he has been weakened in combat. In folk tradition he is still alive and ready to help Ireland in times of need. Fionn (‘bright’, ‘fair’) has been seen as a variation on Lug, a divinity of the Tuatha Dé Danann; he is also associated through his name with light, and linked to Welsh Gwynn, as well as with the Celtic origins of Vienna.

"folklore","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>folklore</b>.<div class=""content"">A very rich body of folklore survives in Ireland, owing to the country's position on the western periphery of Europe, an innately conservative element in Irish tradition, and the importance which that tradition attaches to oral narration. Irish folk narrative may be divided into the following categories: native hero-tales of mythical or literary origin; adaptations of international folk-tales; oral legends which purport to describe occurrences in ordinary life; and numerous minor forms such as verse anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. The hero-tales and longer types of international folk-tale are told quite formally and are found almost exclusively in Irish. Shorter or more conversational genres, such as ghost and fairy legends and a wide variety of humorous lore, flourish to an equal extent in Irish and English. Folk renditions of stories from the <a href=""entry://Ulster cycle""><span class=""links"">Ulster cycle</span></a> have their sources in <a href=""entry://manuscripts in Irish""><span class=""links"">manuscript</span></a> retellings from the post-medieval period. The most popular of these have been accounts of the youthful deeds of <a href=""entry://Cú Chulainn""><span class=""links"">Cú Chulainn </span></a> and of Deirdre (<i>see <a href=""entry://Longes mac nUislenn""><span class=""links"">Longes mac nUislenn</i></a></span>). Folklore concerning <a href=""entry://Fionn mac Cumhaill""><span class=""links"">Fionn mac Cumhaill</span></a> is very common. The international wonder-tale, telling of events in a world long past, was the dominant genre in the repertoire of the Irish story-teller. Hundreds of versions of these wonder-tales have been collected in Ireland, such as the story of the dragon-slayer who rescues a princess and upstages a dishonest rival. There were many forms of short oral legends, involving accounts of marvellous events interrupting normal life; or occurrences with a supernatural origin, such as the lore of rivers which claim their victims once a year. The rich fairy lore of Ireland [see <a href=""entry://sídh""><span class=""links"">sídh</span></a>] is the subject of many oral legends. Stories about Christ followed European tradition, for the most part; and legends concerning saints derived from Irish and European medieval literature, and from local devotion. The lore of the saints <a href=""entry://Patrick, St""><span class=""links"">Patrick</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Brigit, St""><span class=""links"">Brigit</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Colum Cille [Columba] ""><span class=""links"">Colum Cille </span></a> was widespread. <a href=""entry://Cormac mac Airt ""><span class=""links"">Cormac mac Airt </span></a>, <a href=""entry://Brian Bóroime ""><span class=""links"">Brian Bóroime </span></a>, and more recent figures such as Oliver <a href=""entry://Cromwell, Oliver""><span class=""links"">Cromwell </span></a> and Daniel <a href=""entry://O'Connell, Daniel""><span class=""links"">O'Connell </span></a> figure in the legends, while more localized lore concerns warriors, outlaws, tyrants, sportsmen, clergymen, and individuals such as Biddy <a href=""entry://Early, Biddy""><span class=""links"">Early</span></a>, the healer from Co. Clare. Especially popular were stories about poets, such as Eoghan Rua <a href=""entry://Ó Súilleabháin, Eoghan Rua""><span class=""links"">Ó Súilleabháin; </span></a> and humorous anecdotes regarding a variety of learned individuals, such as Jonathan <a href=""entry://Swift, Jonathan""><span class=""links"">Swift </span></a> or John Philpot <a href=""entry://Curran, John Philpot""><span class=""links"">Curran </span></a>.

The American-Irish anthropologist and linguist Jeremiah <a href=""entry://Curtin, Jeremiah""><span class=""links"">Curtin </span></a> scrupulously collected a wide variety of narrative from native Irish speakers. W. B. <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a> and Lady <a href=""entry://Gregory, Lady""><span class=""links"">Gregory </span></a> collected and published material from <a href=""entry://Hiberno-English""><span class=""links"">Hiberno-English</span></a> narration.

"folksong in Irish","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>folksong in Irish</b><div class=""content"">comprises a body of material very great in extent and impressive in quality. Singing and story-telling were the most common forms of entertainment in Gaelic culture, and singers were praised for their skills of delivery and interpretation; for their powers of ornamentation in the style known as <a href=""entry://sean-nós""><span class=""links"">sean-nós</span></a>; and for their ability to involve the listeners in the mood and atmosphere of the song. That dramatic elements were significant in performance is suggested by the traditional form of request: ‘abair amhrán’, ‘say a song’. The folksongs of the Irish are amongst the richest folk legacies in Western Europe, combining as they do music and poetry of great antiquity. The <a href=""entry://Irish language""><span class=""links"">Irish language</span></a>, unlike <a href=""entry://Hiberno-English""><span class=""links"">Hiberno-English</span></a>, did not on the whole accommodate itself to the <a href=""entry://ballads in Ireland""><span class=""links"">ballad</span></a>. Such narrative as there is, is often uncertain, and emphasis is placed instead on emotion and situation. As in other folk traditions, by far the most common type of folksong in Irish concerns love. In many a male persona is entranced by the beauty of the girl he loves (e.g. <i>‘An Chúilfhionn’</i>, <i>‘Bean Dubh an Ghleanna’</i>). He often implores the girl to go away with him, leaving the family who oppose him (e.g. <i>‘Uileacán Dubh O’</i>). In other songs it is the girl who proclaims her love, and sometimes she is deserted (e.g. <i>‘Domhnall Óg’</i>, <i>‘An Droighneán Donn’</i>), or married to an old man (e.g. <i>‘An Seanduine Dóite’</i>). <i>‘Róisín Dubh’</i>, originally a love-song, was later given a political slant, so that by the time James Clarence <a href=""entry://Mangan, James Clarence""><span class=""links"">Mangan </span></a> translated it as <i>‘My <a href=""entry://‘Dark Rosaleen, My’""><span class=""links"">Dark Rosaleen</i></a>’</span> the female figure had become a symbol of nationhood. In this way the love conventions of heightened emotion were often transposed to patriotic verse (e.g. <i>‘Droimeann Donn Dílis’</i>). Another class of songs deals with specific historical occurrences. Thus ‘Cill Chais’ laments the destruction of the Butlers' seat at Kilcash, near Clonmel, Co. Tipperary. <i>‘Seán Ó Duibhir an Ghleanna’</i> is a song remembering the dispossession of a Gaelic landowner in 17th-cent. Munster. Religious songs concerning Christ's passion or the sufferings of the Virgin Mary are common. There are songs on local tragedies such as drownings and accidents, and from the 18th cent. onwards an increasing number deal with failed uprisings, hangings, transportation, and emigration. There are satiric songs mocking meanness and tyranny, songs in praise of drink and drinkers, while other pieces celebrate heroic feats of valour or of sport. Macaronic songs, in Irish and English, are frequent; they deal humorously with a variety of subjects and the English is quaintly ornamented to match the often inflated poetic style of the Irish.

In 1967 he moved to Donegal, first to Muff and in 1982 to Greencastle. Two collections of short stories, <i>The Saucer of Larks</i> (1962) and <i>The Gold in the Sea</i> (1966), display a strong sense of place. <i>The <a href=""entry://Enemy Within, The""><span class=""links"">Enemy Within</i></a></span>, produced by the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a> in 1962, revealed his command as a dramatist. <i><a href=""entry://Philadelphia, Here I Come!""><span class=""links"">Philadelphia, Here I Come!</i></a></span> (1964) confronted traditional Irish subject-matter in a stimulating and original form. A series of related plays explored the theme of love, <i>The <a href=""entry://Loves of Cass McGuire, The""><span class=""links"">Loves of Cass McGuire</i></a></span> (1966), <i><a href=""entry://Lovers""><span class=""links"">Lovers</i></a></span> (1967), and <i><a href=""entry://Crystal and Fox""><span class=""links"">Crystal and Fox</i></a></span> (1968). They were followed by <i>The Mundy Scheme</i> (1969), a political satire, and <i>The Gentle Island</i> (1971), whose ironic title masks a violent confrontation between myth and reality. In the early 1970s the <a href=""entry://‘Troubles, the’""><span class=""links"">Troubles</span></a> in the North of Ireland drew Friel into an artistic response, resulting in two contrasting plays, <i>The <a href=""entry://Freedom of the City, The""><span class=""links"">Freedom of the City</i></a></span> (1973), a direct reaction to contemporary events, and <i><a href=""entry://volunteers""><span class=""links"">Volunteers</i></a></span> (1975), a more symbolic treatment of Irish history. In <i><a href=""entry://Living Quarters""><span class=""links"">Living Quarters</i></a></span> (1977) he turned to the family unit in dissolution, a theme given a historical dimension in <i><a href=""entry://Aristocrats""><span class=""links"">Aristocrats</i></a></span> (1979). The four monologues used in <i><a href=""entry://Faith Healer""><span class=""links"">Faith Healer</i></a></span> (1979) testify to his search for a dramatic technique that can marry content and form. With the foundation of <a href=""entry://Field Day""><span class=""links"">Field Day</span></a> Theatre Company in 1980 Friel's career took a new turn. The first production was his own <i><a href=""entry://Translations""><span class=""links"">Translations</i></a></span> (1980), a play about the mapping of Ireland by the Ordnance Survey in the 1830s which became a landmark in the debate over historical revisionism. There followed two more Field Day productions of Friel plays: Chekhov's <i>Three Sisters</i> (1981), and <i>The <a href=""entry://Communication Cord, The""><span class=""links"">Communication Cord</i></a></span> (1982), a sister play to <i>Translations</i>. Friel's next play for Field Day, <i><a href=""entry://Making History""><span class=""links"">Making History</i></a></span> (1988), showed him relating questions of myth and history to cultural and ideological debate. With <i><a href=""entry://Dancing at Lughnasa""><span class=""links"">Dancing at Lughnasa</i></a></span> (1990) a new play by Friel was premièred by the Abbey for the first time since 1979. In content this play represents a return to an autobiographical strand in his work. In <i>Wonderful Tennessee</i> (1993) three couples confront their own and each other's failures against a backdrop of nature with hints of ritual and mystery. <i>Molly Sweeney</i> (1994), at the <a href=""entry://Gate Theatre""><span class=""links"">Gate Theatre</span></a>, returns to the dramatic structure of <i>Faith Healer</i>, where different voices offer their constructions of events. <i>Give Me Your Answer, Do!</i> (1997) returns to the familial tensions of <i>Aristocrats</i>, save that here the realm of imagination is pitted against necessity. The play emits a strange aloof calm and radiance. Friel's work explores the tensions between tradition and change in individuals and in society. His plays investigate the inner spaces that shape the belief and passion which determine outer actions. See <p class=""blk"">Alan Peacock (ed.), <i>The Achievement of Brian Friel</i> (1992)</p>."

"Gaelic League","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gaelic League</b>, <i>the (Connradh na Gaeilge)</i>,<div class=""content"">was founded at 9 Lower O'Connell St., Dublin, on 31 July 1893, with the purpose of keeping the Irish language spoken in Ireland at a time when census returns indicated that the number of native Irish-speakers was in rapid decline as a consequence of high emigration and the abandonment of the language in favour of English. The founding members were Douglas <a href=""entry://Hyde, Douglas""><span class=""links"">Hyde </span></a> (President), Eoin <a href=""entry://MacNeill, Eoin""><span class=""links"">MacNeill </span></a> (Secretary), Fr. William Hayden, SJ, Thomas O'Neill <a href=""entry://Russell, T[homas] O'Neill""><span class=""links"">Russell </span></a>, Charles P. Bushe, Pádraig Ó Briain, Mártan Ó Ceallaigh, Patrick Hogan, James Cogan, and Thomas W. Ellerkerr . In seeking to revive Irish as a living language the Gaelic League followed the aims of its immediate precursors, the <a href=""entry://Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language, The""><span class=""links"">Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language</span></a> of 1876 and the <a href=""entry://Gaelic Union, the""><span class=""links"">Gaelic Union</span></a> of 1880. While insisting from the outset on its non-sectarian and non-political character, the League's vision was broadly nationalist, building on the ideas promoted by Hyde in his lecture <i>‘On the Necessity for De-Anglicizing Ireland’</i> to the National Literary Society [see <a href=""entry://literary revival""><span class=""links"">literary revival</span></a>] in 1892. The Gaelic League broke new ground in establishing itself as a popular movement based on a branch structure throughout the country. An important part in the dissemination of League ideas was played by the timirí (messengers), whose visits were often followed by the múinteoir taistil (travelling teacher). Administrative skills developed by the <a href=""entry://Land League""><span class=""links"">Land League</span></a> and the Gaelic Athletic Association (<a href=""entry://GAA""><span class=""links"">GAA</span></a>) supplied a significant input to the new organization, while opportunities for social mixing between young men and women offered a widely attested stimulus to new membership. By 1908 there were almost 600 branches, chiefly in English-speaking areas. However, the League's foothold in the <a href=""entry://Gaeltacht""><span class=""links"">Gaeltacht</span></a> areas was negligible. The activities of the branches included Irish-language classes and social gatherings where Irish music and dancing were promoted. The League also produced a weekly newspaper&mdash;originally <i>Fáinne an Lae</i>, followed by <i>An <a href=""entry://Claidheamh Soluis, An""><span class=""links"">Claidheamh Soluis</i></a></span>, among whose editors were MacNeill and Patrick <a href=""entry://Pearse, Patrick H[enry]""><span class=""links"">Pearse </span></a>. A publishing house was established in 1900, and already by 1909 some 150 books had appeared under the Connradh na Gaeilge imprint. The list of authors included virtually every major writer involved in the creation of a modern literature in Irish, among them Pearse, Pádraic <a href=""entry://Ó Conaire, Pádhraic Óg""><span class=""links"">Ó Conaire </span></a>, P. S. <a href=""entry://Ó Duinnín, an tAthair Pádraig [S.]""><span class=""links"">Ó Duinnín </span></a>, and An tAth. Peadar <a href=""entry://Ó Laoghaire, An tAthair Peadar""><span class=""links"">Ó Laoghaire </span></a>. As time went by many of the more ardent Gaelic Leaguers became increasingly impatient with the non-political stance of the leadership. Hyde tried in vain to keep the League a broad cultural movement clear of political involvement, but a vote in favour of committing the organization to ‘a free, Gaelic-speaking Ireland’, at the 1915 Ard Fheis (annual conference), drove him to resign as President. Numerous Leaguers went on to participate in the <a href=""entry://Easter Rising""><span class=""links"">Easter Rising</span></a> in 1916. The educational policy of the new State was deeply coloured by Gaelic League ideas, while the special status given to Irish in the 1937 Constitution was consistent with the League's primary objective.

"Gaeltacht","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gaeltacht</b>,<div class=""content"">the name given to the Irish-speaking districts in Ireland. It is estimated that in 1851 there were such communities in perhaps twenty-three of the thirty-two counties of Ireland when the number of Irish-speakers in the country was about one and a half million. By 1891, though there were still nearly three-quarters of a million native Irish-speakers in the country, Irish was in full retreat to the Atlantic seaboard. While the <a href=""entry://Gaelic League""><span class=""links"">Gaelic League</span></a> sought to arrest and reverse the language change from Irish to English throughout the country, the extent and population of the Gaeltacht areas continued to decline. In 1925 the Irish Free State established a Commission which recommended making competence in Irish obligatory for all senior civil servants dealing with the people of the Gaeltacht, together with economic development (based on indigenous resources), improved educational opportunities, and the planned resettlement of Gaeltacht families. A small new Gaeltacht was ‘planted’ in Co. Meath in the 1930s and has survived. But the Gaeltacht has continued to contract since the 1920s. In 1972 the Gaeltacht was provided with its own radio station, Radio na Gaeltachta. Cooperative and community projects and renewed vitality in aspects of popular culture (notably <a href=""entry://sean-nós""><span class=""links"">sean-nós</span></a> singing) may be seen as countersigns to the main story of decline. The 1980s and 1990s provided evidence of a new confidence in their indigenous culture and language among sections of Gaeltacht youth."

He supported the Free State [see <a href=""entry://Civil War""><span class=""links"">Civil War</span></a>] and was kidnapped by Republicans, from whom he escaped by swimming the Liffey, a feat commemorated in his first substantial collection of poetry, <i>An Offering of Swans</i> (1923).

"Goldsmith, Oliver","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Goldsmith, Oliver</b><div class=""content""><i>(1728&ndash;1774)</i><br class=""nLine"" /> man of letters; born in Pallas, Co. Longford, though the family moved to Lissoy, near Ballymahon, Co. Westmeath. His college career at TCD involved painful humiliations and he was frequently in disciplinary trouble. In 1752 he studied medicine at Edinburgh, visited the Highlands the year after, and then set off on a Continental tour, making his way by flute-playing and singing. Returning destitute to London in 1756, he acted, practised medicine, and corrected proofs. He met Ralph Griffiths, editor of the <i>Monthly Review</i>, and began contributing to his journal. His <i>An Inquiry into Present State of Polite Learning</i> (1759) called for an unaffected style and temper. He became editor of a weekly journal, <i>The Bee</i>, writing most of the eight numbers himself. In 1760&ndash;1 the series of Chinese letters later published as <i>The <a href=""entry://Citizen of the World, The""><span class=""links"">Citizen of the World</i></a></span> (1762) appeared in John Newbery's <i>Public Ledger</i>. About this time he met Samuel Johnson, and in 1763 he was a founding member of the Club that met in the Turk's Head in Soho. <i>A History of England</i> (1764) in the form of a letterseries from a nobleman to his son was a popular success. <i>The Traveller, or a Prospect of Society</i> (1764), begun during his European wanderings, shows Goldsmith praising the ‘sympathetic mind’ which tries to see the good in all. In 1764 Johnson, intervening to save Goldsmith from arrest over debt, sold the manuscript of <i>The <a href=""entry://Vicar of Wakefield, The""><span class=""links"">Vicar of Wakefield</i></a></span> (1766). Its mixture of sentiment and irony won Goldsmith many admirers. In 1767 Goldsmith's <i>The <a href=""entry://Good-Natur'd Man, The""><span class=""links"">Good-Natur'd Man</i></a></span> was produced. In this comedy Goldsmith turned back towards the humour of <a href=""entry://Farquhar, George""><span class=""links"">Farquhar </span></a>, whom he greatly admired. His <i>Roman History</i> (1769) was followed by a <i>History of England</i> (1771), and from around 1767 he laboured at a <i>History of the Earth and Animated Nature</i> (1774). In 1770 <i>The Deserted Village</i> appeared. The poem mixes memories of childhood around Ballymahon with criticism of the enclosures taking place in the English countryside. The second of his plays, <i><a href=""entry://She Stoops to Conquer""><span class=""links"">She Stoops to Conquer</i></a></span> (1773), is a freewheeling comedy consummately realizing the preference for ‘laughing’ over ‘weeping’ comedy outlined in his essay in the <i>London Magazine</i> for the same year. <i>Retaliation</i> (1774) light-heartedly takes revenge on friends, including Edmund <a href=""entry://Burke, Edmund""><span class=""links"">Burke </span></a>, who had teased him. From letters to his friend Bob Bryanston, it is evident that Ireland was close to Goldsmith's heart. His standpoint on the country finds its most direct expression in <i>‘A Description of the Manner and Customs of the Native Irish’</i> (1759), and in his <i>‘History of Carolan, the Last Irish Bard’</i> (1760), both of which are deficient in accurate information about Gaelic language and culture. Goldsmith's Irishness is ultimately conveyed in the calm but ironic perspective he offers on English life and manners. See <p class=""blk"">A.&nbsp;Sells, <i>Oliver Goldsmith</i> (1974)</p>."

The relationship with Millevoye ended in 1899, by which date she was deeply involved in Yeats's life and work. During this period and later she insisted on keeping their relationship non-physical, preferring to regard it as a ‘spiritual union’. In Dublin she founded Inghinidhe na hÉireann (‘Daughters of Ireland’) in 1900, and later launched <i>Bean na hÉireann</i> (1908), a journal advocating militancy and feminism.

<b>Gregory, Lady</b>
<i>(née [Isabella] Augusta Persse )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1852&ndash;1932),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> dramatist, folklorist, and translator. Born in Roxborough, Co. Galway, she was educated privately. In 1880 she married Sir William Gregory of Coole Park, former Governor of Ceylon, and after the birth of their only child Robert in 1881 they wintered in Egypt, where they supported the nationalist Arabi Bey, the subject of her first publication, <i>Arabi and His Household</i> (1882). She and Wilfrid Scawen <a href=""entry://Blunt, Wilfrid Scawen""><span class=""links"">Blunt </span></a>, with whom she had an affair, campaigned to prevent Arabi's execution. While involved with Blunt she wrote a love-sequence called <i>‘A Woman's Sonnets’</i>, published anonymously in Blunt's <i>Love Lyrics and Songs of Proteus with the Love Sonnets of Proteus</i> (1892). After her husband's death in 1892, she edited his <i>Autobiography</i> (1894). The following year she met W. B. <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a> for the first time, and in 1897 he stayed with her at Coole, beginning a creative friendship that lasted for life. Under his influence her interest in Irish <a href=""entry://folklore""><span class=""links"">folklore</span></a> revived, and she began to study Irish mythology, taking her research into the field. From 1897 she and Yeats spent much time collecting folklore around Coole and further afield. Also in 1897, she, Yeats, and Edward <a href=""entry://Martyn, Edward""><span class=""links"">Martyn </span></a> conceived the idea of establishing a National Theatre [see <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>]. Coole became a haven for many of the writers of the <a href=""entry://literary revival""><span class=""links"">literary revival</span></a>, most of whom carved their initials on the autograph tree still standing in the gardens. In 1898 she edited Mr. Gregory's <i>Letter-Box</i> containing the political correspondence of her husband's grandfather. She prepared a translation of <i>‘An Pósaidh Gléigeal’</i> by <a href=""entry://Raiftearaí, Antoine""><span class=""links"">Raiftearaí </span></a> for <i>‘Dust Hath Closed Helen's Eye’</i>, Yeats's 1899 essay on the poet.

Her first original play, <i>Twenty Five</i>, was produced in 1903 with Yeats's <i>The Hour-Glass</i>. On the opening night of the Abbey <a href=""entry://Spreading the News""><span class=""links"">Spreading the News</span></a> was staged with Yeats's <i>On Baile's Strand</i> [see <a href=""entry://Cuchulain cycle""><span class=""links"">Cuchulain cycle</span></a>]. Recognizing the need to balance the poetic intensity of much of the Abbey programme with more realistic scenes, she set out as a comic dramatist. She provided a Kiltartan Molière in <i>The Doctor in Spite of Himself</i> (1906), <i>The Rogueries of Scapin</i> (1908), <i>The Miser</i> (1909), and <i>The Would-Be Gentleman</i> (1923). <i><a href=""entry://Kincora""><span class=""links"">Kincora</i></a></span> (1905) was a ‘folk history’ play, a form she returned to with <i>The <a href=""entry://White Cockade, The""><span class=""links"">White Cockade</i></a></span> (1905), <i>The Canavans</i> (1906), <i>Dervorgilla</i> (1907), <i>The <a href=""entry://Deliverer, The""><span class=""links"">Deliverer</i></a></span> (1911), and <i>Grania</i> (1911), each dealing with crucial moments of conflict in Ireland's past. The sheer volume of administration and creative work she undertook in these years on behalf of the Abbey and the literary revival is impressive. She continued to write comedy in <i>Halvey</i> (1906), <i>The <a href=""entry://Image, The""><span class=""links"">Image</i></a></span> (1909), and <i>Damer's Gold</i> (1912). She prepared <i>The Kiltartan History Book</i> (1909), <i>The Kiltartan Wonder Book</i> (1910), and <i>Irish Folk History Plays</i> (1912) for publication. <i>The <a href=""entry://Rising of the Moon, The""><span class=""links"">Rising of the Moon</i></a></span>, a play with a strongly revolutionary theme was written with Douglas <a href=""entry://Hyde, Douglas""><span class=""links"">Hyde </span></a> and produced in 1907, the year which also saw the production of <i>The Workhouse Ward</i> under its earlier title <i>The Poorhouse. Our Irish Theatre</i> (1913) is the history of the Abbey Theatre from her viewpoint, and while it underestimated the work of the <a href=""entry://Fay, Frank""><span class=""links"">Fay brothers</span></a>, it is revealing about the extent of her creative influence, especially on Yeats and on <a href=""entry://Synge, [Edmund] J[ohn] M[illington]""><span class=""links"">Synge </span></a>. In 1915 <i>Shanwalla</i>, a ghost play, was produced; in that year her nephew Hugh Lane was drowned when the <i>Lusitania</i> was sunk by a German U-boat. She campaigned for the return of his collection of paintings from London. <i>The Kiltartan Poetry Book</i> (1918), a collection of translations from the Irish, was followed by <i>Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland</i> (2 vols., 1920) which represented the fruits of more than twenty years of shared fieldwork and thought with W. B. Yeats. <i>An <a href=""entry://Old Woman Remembers, The""><span class=""links"">Old Woman Remembers</i></a></span> (1923), a nationalist historical monologue, was recited by Sara <a href=""entry://Allgood, Sara""><span class=""links"">Allgood </span></a> at the Abbey. Her last plays were <i>Sancha's Master</i> (1927) and <a href=""entry://Dave""><span class=""links"">Dave </span></a> (1927). In <i>Coole</i> (1931) she recorded the history of her house. Coole Park was sold to the Forestry Commission in 1927, with Lady Gregory receiving a life tenancy, but it was demolished for no good reason in 1941. Lady Gregory became entirely committed to the cultural nationalism of the literary revival. She saw the decline of the Irish language as one of the great cultural landslides of 19th-cent. Ireland, the other being the <a href=""entry://Famine, the""><span class=""links"">Famine</span></a>. She wrote for her own people in Kiltartan, believing, with Yeats, that art which was not rooted in people's lives was shallow. Her great labour and artistic vision are celebrated in two of Yeats's finest poems, <i>‘Coole Park</i>, 1929’ and <i>‘Coole Park and Ballylee</i>, 1931’, written during her last illness from breast cancer.

In 1829 he published <i>The <a href=""entry://Collegians, The""><span class=""links"">Collegians</i></a></span>, a tale of crime and punishment which draws heavily on his familiarity with Irish Catholic society.

The purportedly autobiographical narrative is conducted by Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon, who tells of his voyages to Lilliput, Brobdingnag, Laputa, and the country of the Houyhnhnms. Intended as a political satire addressed to the contemporary English audience, it also allowed Swift to elaborate his views on the relation between reason and civilization. Gulliver travels first to Lilliput, where the diminutive inhabitants refer to their visitor as the ‘Man-Mountain’. In Brobdingnag the perspective is reversed: Gulliver is diminutive and the Brobdingnagians gigantic. On his next journey he visits the flying island Laputa and neighbouring Lagado and Luggnagg. Laputa's inhabitants are obsessed with astronomical speculations involving mathematics and music which Gulliver finds incomprehensible. On his last voyage Gulliver visits the land of the horses, or Houyhnhnms, who live by the dictates of reason and whose language is the ‘perfection of nature’. Having listened to Gulliver's account of European politics in general they decide that he is a Yahoo, the vilest form of life in their country."

"Heaney, Seamus [Justin]","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Heaney, Seamus [Justin]</b><div class=""content""><i>(1939&ndash; ),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> poet. Born in Co. Derry, he was educated at St Columb's College and QUB. He taught for a year and then became a lecturer at QUB. His first collection, <i>Death of a Naturalist</i> (1966), is rooted in childhood experiences of life in rural Co. Derry. <i>Door into the Dark</i> (1969) shows a willingness to go beyond the familiar into the unknown. <i>Wintering Out</i> (1972) deals with exposure and endurance in poems that are circumspect about the re-emergent civil and sectarian conflict of the Northern Ireland <a href=""entry://‘Troubles, the’""><span class=""links"">Troubles</span></a>. Relaxing his former grip on the physical world, the poet now works through more nebulous intimations in his search for symbols adequate to the conflict. In 1972 Heaney moved from Belfast to Glanmore, Co. Wicklow, working for a time as a freelance writer and then at Carysfort College in Co. Dublin. <i>North</i> (1975) was his most controversial volume. The poetry involves a profound ambivalence of feeling, recognizing on the one hand the grounds for ‘civilized outrage’ at atrocity and on the other the impulse towards ‘intimate revenge’. In <i>Field Work</i> (1979) a new voice is heard, and there is a movement outwards into the light. A central sequence entitled <i>‘Glanmore Sonnets’</i> contains mature love-poems that reflect a rueful awakening to life's tangled issues. A selection of Heaney's critical writings (<i>Preoccupations: Selected Prose</i> 1968&ndash;1978) appeared in 1980. The following year he accepted a post as Visiting Professor at Harvard where, in 1984, he was elected Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Poetry. 1982 saw the publication of a children's poetry anthology, <i>The Rattle Bag</i>, co-edited with Ted Hughes . In 1983 <i>Sweeney Astray</i>, Heaney's translation of the Middle Irish romance <i><a href=""entry://Buile Shuibne""><span class=""links"">Buile Shuibne</i></a></span>, was published by <a href=""entry://Field Day""><span class=""links"">Field Day</span></a>, the Derry theatre company of which he had been a Director since its formation in 1980. The centrepiece of Heaney's next collection, <i>Station Island</i> (1984), is the title-poem, set at <a href=""entry://Lough Derg""><span class=""links"">Lough Derg</span></a>, a traditional site of pilgrimage. The poem dramatizes a series of dream encounters with literary ghosts and dead figures from his personal history. <i>The Haw Lantern</i> (1987) is coloured by a newly-political language, conditioned by Heaney's admiration for Eastern European poets such as Zbigniew Herbert and Czeslaw Milosz . The T.S. Eliot Memorial Lectures at Canterbury in 1986 were published as <i>The Government of the Tongue</i> (1988)&mdash;a title which underlines Heaney's conviction that poetry is a form of responsible language. <i>The Cure at Troy</i> (1990), a play based on Sophocles' <i>Philoctetes</i>, and first performed by Field Day, dramatizes questions of personal conscience, duty, and loyalty to the tribe. In 1989 he was elected to the Chair of Poetry at Oxford. <i>Seeing Things</i> (1991) attests to a continued attentiveness to everyday reality, but also shows a concern with a metaphysical vision. This book evinces a buoyant confidence and a relaxed visionary quality. In 1993 he issued <i>The Midnight Verdict</i>, a verse translation of extracts from Brian <a href=""entry://Merriman, Brian""><span class=""links"">Merriman's </span></a>
<i><a href=""entry://Cúirt an Mheán-Oíche""><span class=""links"">Cúirt an Mheán-Oíche</i></a></span> bracketed by versions from Ovid's <i>Metamorphosis</i>, a juxtaposition allowing him to present a view of gender conflict. <i>The Redress of Poetry</i> (1995), was collected in Oxford Lectures, and in that year he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature. In <i>The Spirit Level</i> (1997) a tough allegiance is evoked, while the poetry seeks to reconcile deep divisions. <i>Beowulf</i> (1999) is a deeply-felt version of the Anglo-Saxon warrior-epic.

His return to Belfast on retirement in 1972 marked the beginning of a period of intense poetic activity. In the 1940s his poetry had been strongly influenced by the notion of Ulster regionalism, and his anthology <i>Rhyming Weavers and Other Country Poets of Antrim and Down</i> (1974), reflects an interest in the dialect verse of the Protestant radicals [see <a href=""entry://weaver poets""><span class=""links"">weaver poets</span></a>]. His later poetry, too, is much concerned with exploring the Scots, English, and Irish elements that make up his concept of Ulster identity. <i>‘The Colony’</i> elaborates a parallel between a Roman colony and <a href=""entry://plantation""><span class=""links"">plantation</span></a> Ireland. He is responsive to nature and expresses sympathy with the imaginative world of the Irish Catholics. As a poetry of the non-conformist conscience, Hewitt's work reflects his belief in progress, independence of mind, and rationalism.

"Hiberno-English","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Hiberno-English</b>,<div class=""content"">the term applied to those varieties of English which were and are spoken, and sometimes written, in Ireland. These varieties are also sometimes referred to as Anglo-Irish or Irish-English. They are distinct from other varieties of English in that they have their own grammatical structures, vocabularies, sound systems, pronunciations, and patterns of intonation. The most significant varieties are the Northern and the Southern: roughly speaking, those to the north or the south of a line drawn from Bundoran in the west to Dundalk in the east. The dialect of parts of the north and east of Ulster is also, and perhaps more appropriately, termed Ulster Scots. Modern Hiberno-English derives from the <a href=""entry://plantation""><span class=""links"">plantations</span></a> of the 16th and 17th cents. Parts of the north and east of Ulster were settled by lowland Scots (giving rise to Ulster Scots) and the rest of Ulster, Leinster, and Munster were settled by regional dialect speakers of English, many of whom are likely to have come from the north of England. From its introduction Modern Hiberno-English was at a remove from the English of England, and remained conservative by comparison. However, it was in almost continuous contact with Irish, so that the influence of that language was considerable and pervasive. As Modern Hiberno-English progressively superseded Irish it often added (at least temporarily) further elements from that language, but it also lay upon a deep substratum of Irish, which is exposed in the English speech of natural bilinguals. Hiberno-English, like other regional varieties of English, is in general a spoken rather than a literary language. In the late 17th and 18th cents. a number of Irish-born dramatists achieved success in England with plays that made use of the <a href=""entry://stage-Irishman""><span class=""links"">stage-Irishman</span></a> and his speech to point to the follies and cruelties of English society.

<i>The <a href=""entry://Shaughraun, The""><span class=""links"">Shaughraun</i></a></span> (1874). Although the stage-Irishman and his language survived into the 20th cent., a new realism in the portrayal of the Irish and their language emerged in the <a href=""entry://literary revival""><span class=""links"">literary revival</span></a>, notably in the work of <a href=""entry://Gregory, Lady""><span class=""links"">Lady Gregory </span></a> and <a href=""entry://Synge, [Edmund] J[ohn] M[illington]""><span class=""links"">Synge </span></a>. Synge's approach is developed to a degree in the Dublin plays of Sean <a href=""entry://O'Casey, Sean""><span class=""links"">O'Casey </span></a>. Modern Irish drama is free to handle any subject-matter and any kind of character and will use the appropriate language, whether Hiberno-English or not.

<i><a href=""entry://Castle Rackrent""><span class=""links"">Castle Rackrent</i></a></span> (1800), the whole of which is narrated by a southern Hiberno-English speaker.

His major works include: <i>Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</i> (1725), <i>An Essay on the Passions with Illustrations on the Moral Sense</i> (1728), and <i>A Short Introduction to Moral Philosophy</i> (1747). Hutcheson's moral philosophy greatly influenced contemporaries such as his own pupil Adam Smith, while David Hume sent <i>A Treatise of Human Nature</i> to him for comment. His work formed an important link between Locke and Scottish rationalist thought. Much of his ethical thinking is directed against self-interest as the overriding motive, and he is credited with laying the foundation of classical utilitarianism with the doctrine of ‘the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers’. At Glasgow, Hutcheson was part of the <i>‘New Light’</i> theological group, with strong links with the non-subscribing Presbyterian movement represented in Ireland by John <a href=""entry://Abernethy, John""><span class=""links"">Abernethy </span></a>, Robert Molesworth, and others.

<b>Hyde, Douglas</b><div class=""content""><i>(1860&ndash;1949), scholar, cultural activist, and first President of Ireland, 1938&ndash;45.</i><br class=""nLine"" /> Born at Frenchpark, Co.

B. <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a>. He studied law, winning several college prizes in literature and oratory while beginning to publish original poems in Irish under the pseudonym ‘An Craoibhín Aoibhinn’ (‘The Pleasant Little Branch’). In 1888 Yeats included three folk-tales translated by him in <i>Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry</i>, where notice is given of Hyde's forthcoming <i>Leabhar Sgéaluigheachta</i> (1889), a collection of stories and rhymes in Irish made by him from living speakers. <i>Beside the Fire</i> (1890) reprinted the three tales along with others and provided facing-page translations in an adaptation of <a href=""entry://Hiberno-English""><span class=""links"">Hiberno-English</span></a> usage. In 1890 Hyde began publishing in <i>The <a href=""entry://Nation, The""><span class=""links"">Nation</i></a></span>
<i>a</i> series of <i>‘The Songs of Connacht’</i> with commentary and translations. He spent a year teaching at the University of New Brunswick, Canada, before becoming President of the newly formed National Literary Society [see <a href=""entry://literary revival""><span class=""links"">literary revival</span></a>] on his return in 1891. His inaugural address to the Society, ‘On the Necessity for De-Anglicizing Ireland’, on 25 November 1892 argued for the preservation and revival of all that was best in Irish language and culture. In October 1893 he married Annette Kurtz . When the <a href=""entry://Gaelic League""><span class=""links"">Gaelic League</span></a> was founded by Eoin <a href=""entry://MacNeill, Eoin""><span class=""links"">MacNeill </span></a>, Thomas O'Neill <a href=""entry://Russell, T[homas] O'Neill""><span class=""links"">Russell </span></a>, and others in July 1893, Hyde became its President, resigning his office in the National Literary Society. His determination to keep the League out of political involvements held sway until the rise of the <a href=""entry://Irish Volunteers""><span class=""links"">Irish Volunteer</span></a> movement, when the League's constitution was changed at the Dundalk Ard Fheis (AGM) of 1915 to declare the aim of achieving a free, Gaelic-speaking Ireland. Hyde resigned immediately. His <i>Love Songs of Connacht</i> (1893) collected the series of poems published in the <i>Nation</i> in 1890 and continued in the <i>Weekly Freeman</i>, 1892&ndash;3. Publication in book form allowed the opportunity of recasting a number of them into English verse, reproducing the rhymes and metres of the originals in the manner initiated by Edward <a href=""entry://Walsh, Edward""><span class=""links"">Walsh </span></a>. Hyde's commentary for these songs describes the Gaelic world out of which they come, while the literal translations carry into English the directness of the originals. <i>The Story of Early Gaelic Literature</i> (1895), a first attempt at a literary history of a complex body of material, was followed by the magisterial <i>A Literary History of Ireland</i> (1899). A more popular contribution to the language revival was <i><a href=""entry://Casadh an tSúgain""><span class=""links"">Casadh an tSúgáin</i></a></span>, a play written by Hyde from a scenario by Yeats and performed by the Gaelic League Amateur Dramatic Society at the Gaiety Theatre in 1901, with Hyde playing the lead part of Red Hanrahan. In 1905 Hyde became Professor of Modern Irish at UCD, and in the following year he went on a fund-raising tour of the USA (described in <i>Mo Thuras go hAmerice</i>, 1937), where he raised money for the Gaelic League. <i>Religious Songs of Connacht</i> (1905&ndash;6) collected, translated, and provided commentary upon Connacht religious folklore. <i>Songs Ascribed To Raftery</i> (1907), which had also appeared in serial form in newspapers, was an edition of the poet's works [see Antoine <a href=""entry://Raiftearaí, Antoine""><span class=""links"">Raiftearaí </span></a>], with a commentary on his life. Other volumes of folklore were <i>Legends of Saints and Sinners</i> (1916) and <i>Sgéalta Thomáis Uí Chathasaigh</i> (1939).

During the <a href=""entry://Civil War""><span class=""links"">Civil War</span></a> the name was retained by the Republicans, referred to as ‘Irregulars’. Only a small minority of the IRA continued operations after the main body, led by Eamon <a href=""entry://De Valera, Eamon""><span class=""links"">de Valera </span></a>, entered constitutional politics in 1927. From the 1930s to the 1960s the organization engaged in a campaign of violence in <a href=""entry://Northern Ireland""><span class=""links"">Northern Ireland</span></a> and Great Britain. Stringent measures in the North and de Valera's use of internment in the Republic resulted in the apparent termination of the movement in 1957. Under pressure of the events of the Northern Troubles of 1967&ndash;72, however, the IRA re-emerged to defend nationalist communities under sectarian attack. It soon took the form of a ‘liberation’ army fighting in the name of the Irish Republic and claimed the ‘national right to self-determination’ as its mandate for attacks on the army and police, on Unionists, and later on Catholics co-operating with security forces. When the Marxist-orientated Official IRA declared a unilateral cease-fire in 1972, the chiefly Ulster membership reformed itself as the Provisional IRA (‘Provos’), with Sinn Féin as its political wing. By the 1990s its campaign of bombing and assassination, together with reprisals by Protestant paramilitaries (UDA, UVF, and UFF) and the activities of the security forces, had caused over 3,000 deaths in Ulster and elsewhere. After protracted talks between Sinn Féin and the leader of the Socialist and Democratic Labour Party (SDLP), John Hume, the IRA declared a ceasefire in August 1994. In February, 1996 the ceasefire ended, after political inaction, with bombs in London, Manchester, and Northern Ireland. In 1997, after a new Labour government was elected in Britain, the IRA renewed the ceasefire, and work began towards the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Despite continuing political stalemate, the IRA guns remained silent into 2000."

"Irish language","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Irish language</b>.<div class=""content"">Irish is a member of the Celtic family of languages and, before it split in recent centuries into Modern Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx, was the sole attested representative of a distinct branch known to historical linguists as Goidelic [see <a href=""entry://Celtic languages""><span class=""links"">Celtic languages</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Indo-European""><span class=""links"">Indo-European</span></a>]. The language is frequently referred to as Gaelic, and the recent dialectal divergence of Irish is sometimes recognized by differentiating the three main dialects as Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx Gaelic. The earliest Celtic settlements in Ireland may reasonably be associated with the beginnings of the Iron Age, around 500 BC. The descendants of these Celtic settlers, commingled with the descendants of earlier inhabitants of the island, make their first appearance in history almost 1,000 years later as one of the barbarian peoples who were encroaching on the British province of the declining Roman Empire. These adventurers were by then a linguistically and culturally unified Goidelic-speaking society, and were known to other peoples in the region as Scoti. The Anglo-Norman powers became involved in the Irish-speaking world, first in Scotland and then in Ireland a century later [see <a href=""entry://Norman invasion""><span class=""links"">Norman invasion</span></a>]. In doing so, they initiated a political process by which gradually, over 400 years, the Irish-speaking regions lost their autonomy and became a denigrated periphery within London's sphere of influence. In Scotland, the south and east became fairly rapidly English-speaking; and by the 14th cent. the use of Irish had receded to the Galloway area in the south-west and to the Highlands in the north; it then held its position for about three centuries in Galloway, and until the 20th cent. in the Highlands and Isles. In Ireland, though substantial communities of Norman French and English-speakers were introduced during the early phases of Anglo-Norman expansion, the Irish language retained its dominance and, by the late 15th cent., was again the language of all sections of Irish society. The Irish language then came under renewed pressure in Ireland. The Tudor and Stuart suppressions and population resettlements (1534&ndash;1610), the Cromwellian settlement (1654), the <a href=""entry://Williamite War""><span class=""links"">Williamite War</span></a> (1689&ndash;91), and finally the enactment of the <a href=""entry://Penal Laws""><span class=""links"">Penal Laws</span></a> (1695) had the cumulative effect of eliminating the Irish-speaking aristocracy and learned classes and of destroying their institutions. As a result of these developments, by the 18th cent. Irish was, with few exceptions, the language of the disenfranchised and the dispossessed. In Galloway it was in terminal decline. It remained the language of the great mass of the population throughout the Highlands, Ireland, and Man, and continued to be used extensively in literature, religion, and local community affairs. Irish speakers included the poorest classes and, though they increased in number in the late 18th cent. and in the first decades of the 19th, reaching over four million, they were unprotected against the calamities which were to befall them repeatedly as the 19th cent. progressed. They were decimated by recurring famine, the most devastating period being 1845&ndash;8 [see the <a href=""entry://Famine, the""><span class=""links"">Famine</span></a>], and by the large-scale emigration which followed. According to the 1851 census of population, the first to include a question on language, the total number of Irish-speakers (including Irish-English bilinguals) had been reduced to 1,524,286, or just below a quarter of the population of Ireland. There are two reasons why, 100 years later, Irish still survives. Firstly, the rate of language shift slowed as it encountered around the western seaboard the densely populated areas, officially at the time called ‘congested districts’, in which communities were almost autonomous in their subsistence economies and had little access to competence in English. These are the areas, known collectively by the term <a href=""entry://Gaeltacht""><span class=""links"">Gaeltacht</span></a>, where an Irish-speaking tradition has continued. Secondly, towards the end of the 19th cent., there emerged a vigorous Irish-language restoration movement [see <a href=""entry://Gaelic League""><span class=""links"">Gaelic League</span></a>]. The latter contributed significantly to a renewal of the idea of political separatism. As a consequence, Irish was designated as the ‘national language’ in the constitution of the Irish State in 1922."

<b>Irish State</b>,<div class=""content"">the (1922&ndash;). The modern political entity that governs three-quarters of the island has a short history but a long pedigree, tracing its origins to a distinct Irish nation from the earliest times. After the Act of <a href=""entry://Union, Act of""><span class=""links"">Union</span></a> of 1800 a separatist movement began to emerge, originating with the struggle for <a href=""entry://Catholic Emancipation""><span class=""links"">Catholic Emancipation</span></a> led by Daniel <a href=""entry://O'Connell, Daniel""><span class=""links"">O'Connell </span></a>, nurtured by the Repeal Association, radicalized by <a href=""entry://Young Ireland""><span class=""links"">Young Ireland</span></a>, and galvanized by the catastrophic experience of the <a href=""entry://Famine, the""><span class=""links"">Famine</span></a>. Crucially, the Gaelic concept of the sovereignty of Ireland [see Irish <a href=""entry://mythology""><span class=""links"">mythology</span></a>] was conflated with the modern idea of nationhood, while the insular character of the territory suggested a corresponding natural political unity. An Irish Republic was proclaimed by Patrick <a href=""entry://Pearse, Patrick H[enry]""><span class=""links"">Pearse </span></a> at the outset of the <a href=""entry://Easter Rising""><span class=""links"">Easter Rising</span></a>, and following the landslide victory of <a href=""entry://Sinn Féin""><span class=""links"">Sinn Féin</span></a> candidates in the general election of 1918, a separatist Irish parliament (Dáil Éireann) was established in Dublin in 1919, on behalf of which the <a href=""entry://IRA""><span class=""links"">IRA</span></a> fought the <a href=""entry://Anglo-Irish War, the""><span class=""links"">Anglo-Irish War</span></a>. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 created an Irish Free State of twenty-six counties, the Better Government of Ireland Act of 1920 having already established the six northern counties as the state of <a href=""entry://Northern Ireland""><span class=""links"">Northern Ireland</span></a>, thus institutionalizing the partition of the island. The newly formed Free State was defined by its Constitution as a dominion of the British Commonwealth. A new Constitution of 1937, largely drawn up by Eamon <a href=""entry://De Valera, Eamon""><span class=""links"">de Valera </span></a>, contained a more explicit declaration of sovereignty and removed the king from internal affairs. The State, now called Éire or Ireland, remained associated for purposes of external relations with the Commonwealth. Impatience with this compromise led a coalition government under J. A. Costello to declare a Republic with effect from 18 April 1949. The creation under the 1937 Constitution of a popularly elected non-executive Presidency provided a Head of State. The administrative structure and legal system was built round British precedent and practice, as was the Civil Service. However, a conservative Catholic ethos was established involving <a href=""entry://Censorship of Publications Act""><span class=""links"">censorship</span></a> and an embargo on divorce legislation. Irish neutrality during the Second World War increased the cultural and economic isolationism of the country. Later, free-trade policies with investment incentives under the Whitaker plan for economic development, implemented by Seán Lemass in 1958, in conjunction with United Nations membership in 1955 and membership of the European Economic Community in 1973, resulted in wider political affiliations with associated benefits and disadvantages. <i>Rapprochement</i> with Northern Ireland, the object of antipartition propaganda throughout the history of the State, became a matter of constructive policy with the signing of a series of bilateral accords with the British Government from the Sunningdale Agreement (1973), to the Good Friday Agreement (1998)."

<b>Jacobite poetry</b>.<div class=""content"">The underlying values of Gaelic political poetry for most of the 18th cent. can be identified as Jacobite; and the main poets of the period can be classified as Jacobite poets, i.e. poets who championed the cause of <a href=""entry://James II""><span class=""links"">James II</span></a> (in Latin <i>Jacobus</i>, hence Jacobite) and his descendants. Underpinning all Jacobite thinking was traditional social theory, which claimed that a divinely ordained and rightful hierarchical order had been ruptured in 1688 [see <a href=""entry://Williamite War""><span class=""links"">Williamite War</span></a>] and could be restored only by the return of the true king. Return and restoration were common elements both in Jacobite propaganda and in the traditional Irish ideology of kingship [see Irish <a href=""entry://mythology""><span class=""links"">mythology</span></a>]. A particularly potent theme was the foretelling of the restoration of the rightful king by an indigenous prophet. This prophecy was frequently presented in the <a href=""entry://aisling""><span class=""links"">aisling</span></a>, a stylized and ornate poetic genre in which the poet, wandering forth by river, glen, mountain, or sea, accosts a beautiful woman who, revealing herself to be Ireland, delivers her message that right will be restored when the true king returns.

Although he was initially unwilling to alarm Protestant opinion unduly, James's Irish policy was increasingly influenced by Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnell, who became Lord Deputy in 1686 and created the virtual Catholic monopoly of places in the judiciary, the army, and central and local government that is celebrated in the poetry of Dáibhí <a href=""entry://Ó Bruadair, Dáibhí""><span class=""links"">Ó Bruadair </span></a>. On 5 November 1688 William of Orange, Dutch husband to James's Protestant daughter Mary, invaded England to secure it for the Protestant interest. James fled to France. From there Louis XIV sent him to Ireland, where Tyrconnell retained control. In a Parliament of May&ndash;July 1689, James disappointed his Irish supporters by opposing bills asserting the independence of the Irish Parliament.

<b>Joyce, James [Augustine Aloysius]</b><div class=""content""><i>(1882&ndash;1941),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> novelist; born in Rathgar, Dublin, to May and John Stanislaus Joyce, the latter, figuring in his son's books as Simon Dedalus . Joyce went to Clongowes Wood, entered the Royal University at St Stephen's Green [see <a href=""entry://universities""><span class=""links"">universities</span></a>] on a scholarship, and there studied languages together with courses in mathematics and philosophy. He began to write prose sketches in 1900 with the composition of <a href=""entry://epiphany""><span class=""links"">epiphanies</span></a>, short writings in the form either of dramatic vignettes or prose-poems. These short notations were first circulated by him in manuscript, but later used to indicate moments of heightened perception in the novels from <i><a href=""entry://Stephen Hero""><span class=""links"">Stephen Hero</i></a></span> to <i><a href=""entry://Ulysses""><span class=""links"">Ulysses</i></a></span>. A broadside against the Irish Literary Theatre [<a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>], attacking W. B. <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a> and the other leaders of the dramatic movement for ‘surrender[ing] to the popular will’, appeared as <i>‘The Day of the Rabblement’</i> (1901). On completion of his degree, Joyce met and felt himself rebuffed by leaders of the Irish <a href=""entry://literary revival""><span class=""links"">literary revival</span></a>. His antipathy to Patrick <a href=""entry://Pearse, Patrick H[enry]""><span class=""links"">Pearse </span></a> soon took the form of a satirical sketch of an Irish-language class given by a Mr Hughes in <i><a href=""entry://Stephen Hero""><span class=""links"">Stephen Hero</i></a></span>&mdash;the novel where, in 1904, he set about marshalling his arguments against simplistic views of Irishness, sexuality, and politics. After first enrolling at the medical school of the Royal University, he left Dublin for Paris on 1 December 1902 with a view to training there instead, but encountered difficulties over entrance qualifications. He returned for Christmas, but left again on 23 January 1903, to be recalled by a telegram in August informing him of his mother's impending death. Back in Dublin he embarked on a period of dissipation with Oliver St John <a href=""entry://Gogarty, Oliver St John""><span class=""links"">Gogarty </span></a>, but continued the literary notices for the <i>Daily Express</i> which he had begun to write in 1902. He briefly stayed with Gogarty at the Martello Tower in Sandycove, 9&ndash;15 September 1904, quitting in a spirit of mutual distrust which was never entirely overcome. Three stories of what was to be the <i><a href=""entry://Dubliners""><span class=""links"">Dubliners</i></a></span> (1914) collection were invited by George <a href=""entry://Russell, George [William]""><span class=""links"">Russell </span></a> and appeared in <i>The <a href=""entry://Irish Homestead, The""><span class=""links"">Irish Homestead</i></a></span> (Aug.&ndash;Dec. 1904). In June 1904 he met Nora Barnacle, a girl from Galway who was working as a chambermaid. His love for her opened a source of ordinary human feeling upon which he drew at all stages of his career, basing Molly Bloom and Anna Livia Plurabelle in <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Finnegans Wake</i> on her vitality. In October 1904 Joyce left Dublin with Nora for a teaching post in Trieste, where he remained for ten years. From there, he sent twelve stories of <i>Dubliners</i> to the London publisher Grant Richards, but it was not to appear until 1914. With Joyce's encouragement, his brother Stanislaus joined them in 1905 and became an economic mainstay for the family. He left the Berlitz School in 1907, taking with him some private pupils who provided better rates of payment. In 1909 he undertook to open a Dublin cinema, the Volta (the first in Ireland), for a Triestino company. Owing to his choosing Italian rather than American films, the audience rapidly fell off. In 1913 Yeats alerted Ezra Pound to Joyce's talent, and when Joyce sent him the first chapter of his autobiographical novel in its revised form Pound found a publisher for it: <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> first appeared serially in <i>The Egoist</i> (2 Feb. 1914&ndash;1 Sept. 1915) and then in book form in New York (1916), an Egoist Press edition following in London (1917). Meanwhile, Joyce had reopened negotiations with the publisher Grant Richards, and <i>Dubliners</i> was issued in London on 15 June 1914. Joyce now began to receive financial support through Pound's advocacy, notably from Miss Harriet Shaw Weaver (co-editor of <i>The Egoist</i> with Dora Marsden ). Improved finances and Pound's critical support gave Joyce the confidence to commence a novel which he had contemplated as a final story for <i>Dubliners</i>. He began writing <i>Ulysses</i> with the <i>‘Calypso’</i> episode on 1 March 1914, and had completed the first three chapters (‘Telemachiad’) by early 1915. The First World War compelled Joyce to move to Zürich, arriving 30 June 1915. There he continued with <i>Ulysses</i>. Joyce returned at the cessation of hostilities to Trieste (mid-October 1919) before moving to Paris (8 July 1920) on Pound's advice. There he soon met Sylvia Beach, who offered to bring out <i>Ulysses</i> under her Shakespeare &amp; Company bookshop imprint, with the help of Adrienne Monnier. The book appeared in time for Joyce's 40th birthday, 2 February 1922. With the production of his play <i><a href=""entry://Exiles""><span class=""links"">Exiles</i></a></span> in 1919, Joyce fulfilled an early ambition to write for the theatre. <i>Exiles</i>, a study of jealousy, was begun in 1913, when he was urging Nora towards infidelities (which she resisted) in a spirit of emotional inquiry. During the autumn of 1922 he began to compile notes for a new book, incorporating unused material from <i>Ulysses</i>. During that year he studied Sir Edward Sullivan's 1920 Studio edition of the <i><a href=""entry://Book of Kells""><span class=""links"">Book of Kells</i></a></span>, drawing his friends' attention to the Irishness of its densely patterned illuminations. On 10 March 1923 he wrote a draft of the first episode, <i>‘King Roderick O'Conor’</i>. The ensuing labour of <i>‘Work in Progress’</i>&mdash;as the book was known before publication&mdash;took seventeen years, during which Joyce experienced physical, mental, and emotional trials. Sections of <i>Finnegans Wake</i> were published in avant-garde magazines including <i>Transatlantic Review</i> (Apr. 1924), <i>Criterion</i> (July 1925), <i>Navire d'argent</i> (Oct. 1925), and <i>transition</i> (Apr. 1927&ndash;Apr./May 1938). Episodes and combinations of episodes were published as <i>Anna Livia Plurabelle</i> (1928); <i>Tales Told by Shem and Shaun</i> (1929); and <i>Haveth Childers Everywhere</i> (1930). <i>Finnegans Wake</i> was completed on 13 November 1938 and published on Joyce's 57th birthday, on 2 February 1939. The outbreak of the Second World War caused the Joyces to move to Gérand-le-Puy, the town near Vichy where Maria Jolas (editor of <i>transition</i> with her husband Eugene) kept a bilingual school attended by Joyce's grandson Stephen (b. 1932). In December 1940, the family entered Switzerland with special visas&mdash;all except Lucia, his son, who was by then in a sanatorium. Joyce died after an apparently successful operation for an ulcerated duodenum on 13 January. See <p class=""blk"">Michael Groden et al.

Monaghan, he left school at 13. <i>Ploughman and Other Poems</i> (1936) was followed by a commissioned autobiography, <i>The <a href=""entry://Green Fool, The""><span class=""links"">Green Fool</i></a></span> (1938). In 1939 Kavanagh moved to Dublin, which was to become his permanent home. From the mid-1930s his brief lyric poems, which had tended to be vaguely rural, were more sharply realized. In <i>The <a href=""entry://Great Hunger, The""><span class=""links"">Great Hunger</i></a></span> (1942) he emerged as an anti-pastoral yet visionary poet. It was followed by his most sociologically ambitious poem, the posthumously-published <i>Lough Derg</i> (1971), a narrative commentary on a Lough Derg pilgrimage. Kavanagh's second collection of poems was <i>Soul for Sale</i> (1947). An autobiographical novel with a farmer-poet hero, <i><a href=""entry://Tarry Flynn""><span class=""links"">Tarry Flynn</i></a></span> (1948), went through numerous redraftings throughout the 1940s. In 1952 he edited the short-lived <i><a href=""entry://Kavanagh's Weekly""><span class=""links"">Kavanagh's Weekly</i></a></span>. His literary criticism, often intemperate, was cruelly dismissive of his fellow Irish writers. He advocated that literature should record the writer's affectionate response to ordinary phenomena and commonplace happenings. He substituted ‘parochialism’, the evocation of a particular place, for the cult of Irishness, and in <i><a href=""entry://Envoy""><span class=""links"">Envoy</i></a></span> he stressed the importance of ‘personality’&mdash;individuality rather than ethnicity&mdash;in art. In March 1955 Kavanagh was operated on for lung cancer. Restoration to health was followed by a spate of rapturous lyrics collected in <i>Come Dance with Kitty Stobling</i> (1960). <i>His Collected Poems</i> was published in 1964 and his <i>Collected Prose</i> in 1967."

Born in Listowel, he was educated by the Christian Brothers before going to Northampton, where he worked at various jobs and began to write. He returned to Listowel in 1954 and began managing a public house. His first play, <i><a href=""entry://Sive""><span class=""links"">Sive</i></a></span> (1959), performed by the Listowel Drama Group, was then staged by the Southern Theatre Group, giving him a firm base in Cork when the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a> rejected his work. Keane turned out stage successes all through the 1960s. His plays are set in the life of Co. Kerry, combining melodrama with realism. In some of them Keane manifests a strong social conscience, as in the musical <i>Many Young Men of Twenty</i> (1961) and <i>Hut 42</i> (1962), both concerned with emigration. <i>The <a href=""entry://Field, The""><span class=""links"">Field</i></a></span> (1965), probably his best play, depicts an obsession with the land. <i>Big Maggie</i> (1969) heralds a new emancipation in Irish society.

In France he collected the material for <i>Eochair-sciath an Aifrinn</i>, a prose work in defence of the Mass written in 1610&ndash;13. On returning to Ireland he occupied a parish at Tubrid in his native part of Co. Tipperary.

In the 1620s he exhaustively examined all the historical manuscripts and materials he could find. The entire work seems to have been complete in 1634. Although <i>Foras Feasa ar Éirinn</i> is often seen as a synthetic compilation of Gaelic historiography and the final statement of a doomed people, Keating himself conceived it as a grounding for an emergent composite Catholic nation of Ireland. <i>Trí Biorghaoithe an Bháis</i> (<i>Three Shafts of Death</i>) is a typical 17th-cent. tract reflecting the post-Tridentine obsession with death. He also wrote <i>Saltair Mhuire</i>, a brief treatise on the rosary, which exemplifies the Marian emphasis of Counter-Reformation <a href=""entry://Catholicism""><span class=""links"">Catholicism</span></a>.

For Kinsella this involved studies in Old Irish literature, culminating in his translation of <i><a href=""entry://Táin Bó Cuailnge""><span class=""links"">Táin Bó Cuailnge</i></a></span>, published superbly by Dolmen as <i>The Táin</i> (1969). Kinsella's poetry now turned downward into the psyche, towards origin, myth, and individuation, reflecting an interest in Jungian psychology. <i>Notes from the Land of the Dead</i> (1972) confronts fragmentation and absurdity with meticulous self-scrutiny. <i>Butcher's Dozen</i> (1972) reacts with outrage to the Widgery Report and its almost total exoneration of the British Paratroop Regiment from culpability for the shooting of thirteen civilians on Bloody Sunday (Derry, 30 January 1972). This volume was the first of the series to appear under his own Peppercanister imprint which issued poems and sequences, later gathered for trade editions. <i>A Selected Life</i> (1972) and <i>Vertical Man</i> (1973) are poems celebrating the composer Seán <a href=""entry://Ó Riada, Seán""><span class=""links"">Ó Riada </span></a>, while <i>The Good Fight</i> (1973) commemorates John F. Kennedy . These were reprinted in <i>Fifteen Dead</i> (1976) and <i>Song of the Night</i> (1978). In Peppercanister issues such as <i>Songs of the Psyche</i> (1985), <i>Out of Ireland: A Metaphysical Love Sequence</i> (1987), and <i>St Catherine's Clock</i> (1987) Kinsella shows himself equal to the troubled realities of spiritual life in the late 20th cent. The Peppercanister sequences continued under the auspices of John F. <a href=""entry://Deane, John F.""><span class=""links"">Deane's </span></a> Dedalus Press with <i>Fifteen Poems from Centre City</i> (1990), <i>Madonna and Other Poems</i> (1991), and other editions, including <i>Godhead</i> (1999). Working with Seán <a href=""entry://Ó Tuama, Seán""><span class=""links"">Ó Tuama </span></a>, Kinsella produced <i>An Duanaire: Poems of the Dispossessed, 1600&ndash;1900</i> (1981), an anthology of Irish verse written after the defeat at <a href=""entry://Kinsale, Battle of""><span class=""links"">Kinsale</span></a>. He also edited <i>The New Oxford Book of Irish Verse</i> (1986), translating many of the Gaelic poems. <i>Collected Poems</i> appeared in 1995."

Born in Belfast he was educated at University College, Oxford, interrupting his studies there to serve in the First World War. After being wounded in 1918 he was discharged, published <i>Spirits in Bondage</i> (1919), and resumed his studies, becoming a Fellow in English at Magdalen in 1925. His rediscovery of the significance of orthodox Christianity in the modern world in 1929 was reflected in <i>The Pilgrim's Regress: An Allegorical Apology for Christianity, Reason and Romanticism</i> (1933). His belief that literature could strengthen moral awareness informed his <i>Allegory of Love</i> (1936), a study of courtly love. These concerns are also evident in his science fiction in the trilogy <i>Out of the Silent Planet</i> (1938), <i>Perelandra</i> (1943, later retitled <i>Voyage to Venus</i>) and <i>That Hideous Strength</i> (1945). <i>The Problem of Pain</i> (1940) established him as an exponent of belief. <i>The Screwtape Letters</i> (1942), advice from an experienced devil to a younger colleague on how to tempt sinners, was followed by <i>Mere Christianity</i> (1952); <i>Miracles</i> (1947); <i>The Four Loves</i> (1960); and <i>A Grief Observed</i> (1961), on the death of his wife, Joy Davidman, in 1960. The seven tales of the Narnia Chronicles for children began with <i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> (1950) and ended with <i>The Last Battle</i> (1956).

"literary revival","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>literary revival</b>,<div class=""content"">a term used to describe the modern Irish literary movement, lasting from around 1890 and the fall of <a href=""entry://Parnell, Charles Stewart""><span class=""links"">Parnell </span></a> to about 1922, a date marking the end of the <a href=""entry://Anglo-Irish War, the""><span class=""links"">Anglo-Irish War</span></a> and the publication of <i><a href=""entry://Ulysses""><span class=""links"">Ulysses</i></a></span>. As a movement it originated in the earlier cultural developments of the 19th cent.: the antiquarian studies of Sylvester <a href=""entry://O'Halloran, Sylvester""><span class=""links"">O'Halloran </span></a> and Charlotte <a href=""entry://Brooke, Charlotte""><span class=""links"">Brooke </span></a> culminating in the work of the Ordnance Survey co-ordinated by George <a href=""entry://Petrie, (Sir) George""><span class=""links"">Petrie </span></a>; and the idealistic popular balladry and fiction of the <a href=""entry://Young Ireland""><span class=""links"">Young Ireland</span></a> movement expressed in the columns of <i>The <a href=""entry://Nation, The""><span class=""links"">Nation</i></a></span>. In the early 1890s it seemed to W. B. <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a> that the time was right for a new cultural movement in Irish society which would replace the political one for Home Rule [see <a href=""entry://Irish Parliamentary Party""><span class=""links"">Irish Parliamentary Party</span></a>]. He immersed himself in Irish legend and <a href=""entry://folklore""><span class=""links"">folklore</span></a>, and set about enthusing others. <i>His Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry</i> (1888) represented months of hard work, in which he was assisted by Douglas <a href=""entry://Hyde, Douglas""><span class=""links"">Hyde </span></a>, whose <i>Beside the Fire</i> (1890), an anthology of tales with facing translations, is the first authentic collection of folklore in Irish. In 1892 Yeats, T. W. <a href=""entry://Rolleston, T[homas], W[illiam]""><span class=""links"">Rolleston </span></a>, and Charles Gavan <a href=""entry://Duffy, Charles Gavan""><span class=""links"">Duffy </span></a> set up the Irish Literary Society in London; in Dublin Yeats founded the National Literary Society in the same year, with Hyde as first President. This cultural activity was carried forward by the foundation of the <a href=""entry://Gaelic League""><span class=""links"">Gaelic League</span></a> in 1893, with Hyde again becoming its first President. Also in that year appeared his <i>The Love Songs of Connacht</i>. In the 1890s the new Irish writings of Yeats and others found ready acceptance among British readers, who were attracted to a culture not yet entirely modernized. In a world growing increasingly industrialized, the Celts and other so-called primitive peoples were thought to possess an instinctive understanding and knowledge, qualities reflected in Yeats's <i>The <a href=""entry://Celtic Twilight, The""><span class=""links"">Celtic Twilight</i></a></span> (1893, 2nd edn. 1902), which grew out of his recollections of Sligo and Howth and showed his respect for the intuitions of Irish country people. A formative book, it gave the movement a popular name. A desire to return to ancient truth is revealed in the title of George <a href=""entry://Russell, George [William]""><span class=""links"">Russell's </span></a>
<i>Homeward: Songs by the Way</i> (1894). Yeats met Edward Martyn, George Moore, Lady <a href=""entry://Gregory, Lady""><span class=""links"">Gregory </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Synge, [Edmund] J[ohn] M[illington]""><span class=""links"">Synge </span></a> in the 1890s and these friendships formed a dynamic set of relationships that determined the course of the revival for the next ten years or more and led to the founding of the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>. Research into Gaelic language and literature, after a period of relative inactivity in the 1870s and 1880s, began to revive, in particular with Standish Hayes <a href=""entry://O'Grady, Standish Hayes""><span class=""links"">O'Grady's </span></a>
<i>Silva Gadelica</i> (1892), a large anthology of stories from the various branches of classic Irish narrative (see <a href=""entry://tale-types""><span class=""links"">tale-types</span></a>). George <a href=""entry://Sigerson, George""><span class=""links"">Sigerson's </span></a>
<i>Bards of the Gael and Gall</i> (1897), an anthology of translated Irish verse from the earliest times, proclaimed the antiquity of Irish poetry. The Gaelic League sponsored editions of Irish writings, notably Aodhagán <a href=""entry://Ó Rathaille, Aodhagán""><span class=""links"">Ó Rathaille </span></a> and Eoghan Rua <a href=""entry://Ó Súilleabháin, Muiris""><span class=""links"">Ó Suilleabháin </span></a>. Patrick <a href=""entry://Pearse, Patrick H[enry]""><span class=""links"">Pearse </span></a> became editor of the Gaelic League weekly <i>An <a href=""entry://Claidheamh Soluis, An""><span class=""links"">Claidheamh Soluis</i></a></span>, 1903&ndash;9, and argued for a modern literature in Irish. <a href=""entry://Cú Chulainn""><span class=""links"">Cú Chulainn </span></a>, the dominant fictional figure of the revival, and the embodiment of the heroic nationalism celebrated and criticized in many of its writings, was the subject of the second volume of Standish James <a href=""entry://O'Grady, Standish James""><span class=""links"">O'Grady's </span></a>
<i><a href=""entry://History of Ireland""><span class=""links"">History of Ireland</i></a>: Cuculain and his Contemporaries</span> (1880) and of his novel <i>The Coming of Cuculain</i> (1895). Cú Chulainn entered Yeats's own poetry in 1892 with <i>‘Cuchulain's Fight with the Sea’</i>. However, the stories of the <a href=""entry://Ulster cycle""><span class=""links"">Ulster</span></a> and other cycles of Irish literature seemed to Yeats to be ‘a wild anarchy of legends’, so that when he and Lady Gregory joined forces she undertook to shape the Cú Chulainn stories into the coherent narrative of <i><a href=""entry://Cuchulain of Muirthemne""><span class=""links"">Cuchulain of Muirthemne</i></a></span> (1902). Yeats drew upon this work for his <a href=""entry://Cuchulain cycle""><span class=""links"">Cuchulain cycle</span></a> of plays; and the hero was also a powerful symbol for Patrick Pearse . The union of aristocrat and peasant which Yeats and Lady Gregory tried to realize left out the Catholic middle classes, who became more vocal as the 20th cent. progressed. Catholic and Gaelic nationalism had a spokesman in D. P. <a href=""entry://Moran, D[avid] P[atrick]""><span class=""links"">Moran </span></a>, the editor of <i>The Leader</i> (founded 1900), which tended to regard the revival as a dalliance of the remnants of an outmoded Anglo-Irish <a href=""entry://ascendancy""><span class=""links"">ascendancy</span></a>. Synge's <i>The <a href=""entry://Playboy of the Western World, The""><span class=""links"">Playboy of the Western World</i></a></span> (1907) was received as an insult. <a href=""entry://Joyce, James [Augustine Aloysius]""><span class=""links"">Joyce</span></a> stood aside from the revival, his hero Stephen Dedalus in <i>A <a href=""entry://Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, A""><span class=""links"">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i></a></span> (1916) escaping the nets of nationalism, family, and religion. At the Abbey Theatre the management were frequently in disagreement with the actors, who regularly expressed views favouring a more overtly nationalist policy. The <a href=""entry://Easter Rising""><span class=""links"">Easter Rising</span></a> (1916) had amongst its leaders writers who had been influenced by cultural nationalism, but who were ready to act out in reality some of its images. Yeats was later to ask, ‘Did that play of mine send out | Certain men the English shot?’, referring to <i><a href=""entry://Cathleen Ni Houlihan""><span class=""links"">Cathleen Ni Houlihan</i></a></span> (1902), a play which had Maud <a href=""entry://Gonne, Maud""><span class=""links"">Gonne </span></a> in the title-role, embodying nationalist intensity. With Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> (1922) and Yeats's <i>‘Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen’</i> (published 1922) the revival draws to a close. Against nationalist fixity Joyce sets the broad humanity of Leopold Bloom, Jew, citizen of the world, and good man; and Stephen Dedalus, the artist. Yeat's poem, written in the aftermath of the Rising and in the midst of the Anglo-Irish War, declares that ‘no work can stand’. The revival helped to create an image of a pastoral, mythic, unmodernized Ireland that influenced subsequent writers and artists. Some, like Austin <a href=""entry://Clarke, Austin""><span class=""links"">Clarke </span></a> and F. R. <a href=""entry://Higgins, F[rederick] R[obert]""><span class=""links"">Higgins </span></a>, continued to exploit the image of an idealized west in poems and novels based on folklore and myth. Others openly mocked the ethos of the revival, as in Samuel <a href=""entry://Beckett, Samuel [Barclay]""><span class=""links"">Beckett's </span></a> dismissal of it as <i>‘Cuchulainoid’</i>. In the 1980s <a href=""entry://Field Day""><span class=""links"">Field Day</span></a> reopened the issues of the revival, sometimes calling for the abandonment of its myths, but more often questioning its premisses to test their value for late 20th-cent.

His verse is cast in the form of traditional <a href=""entry://ballads in Ireland""><span class=""links"">folksong</span></a> (<i>Songs of Donegal</i>, 1921), and works best when juxtaposed with the horror of modern war (<i>Soldier Songs</i>, 1917).

<b>Macklin, Charles</b>
<i>[McLoughlin, Charles]</i><div class=""content""><i>(?1697&ndash;1797),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> actor and playwright. Born probably in Culdaff, Co. Donegal, he moved in early life to Dublin, where he played the heroine in Thomas Otway's <i>Orphan</i>. After his success he ran away to act in London but was brought home. In 1725 he was engaged by the Lincoln's Inn Fields company, and from 1731 began appearing regularly in comic roles. In 1741 he achieved a sensational success with <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, playing Shylock as a tragic villain. Macklin's championing of realistic delivery in place of a declamatory manner greatly influenced contemporaries, notably David Garrick. In 1744 he re-opened the Haymarket Theatre with Samuel Foote and others; among the productions his own plays, such as <i>King Henry VII</i> (1746) and <i>The Fortune Hunters</i> (1750), failed repeatedly. For many years he acted alternately in London and in Dublin, initially under Thomas <a href=""entry://Sheridan, Thomas (the Younger)""><span class=""links"">Sheridan </span></a> at <a href=""entry://Smock Alley Theatre""><span class=""links"">Smock Alley</span></a>, and later in the <a href=""entry://Crow Street Theatre""><span class=""links"">Crow Street</span></a> and Capel Street theatres also. Excepting the jingoistic <i>King Henry VII</i> (composed during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745), his plays are comedies and farces, of which the most successful were <i><a href=""entry://Love à la Mode""><span class=""links"">Love à la Mode</i></a></span> (1759) and <i>The Man of the World</i> (1781). These revolve around regional characters: a <a href=""entry://stage-Irishman""><span class=""links"">stage-Irishman</span></a> and a fortune-hunting Scot, a stereotypical Englishman and a Jew. Macklin had success in Dublin with <i>The <a href=""entry://True-Born Irishman, The""><span class=""links"">True-Born Irishman</i></a></span> (1762), a satire on the snobbish affectations of English metropolitan manners."

It caused an immediate furore, resulting in a <a href=""entry://Boycott, Captain""><span class=""links"">boycott</span></a> of his father's school and ensuing litigation. In 1919 his first play, <i>The Rebellion in Ballycullen</i>, was produced by the Abbey. Three novels followed, all written in the spirit of disillusionment: <i>The Clanking of Chains</i> (1919) is the story of a disappointed nationalist; <i>In Clay and Bronze</i> (1920) records his own artistic growth; and <i>Mirror in the Dusk</i> (1921) paints a gloomy picture of rural life. In 1924 he succeeded James <a href=""entry://Stephens, James""><span class=""links"">Stephens </span></a> as Registrar of the National Gallery of Ireland. His association with the Abbey continued with two comedies (<i>The Glorious Uncertainty</i>, 1923, and <i>Look at the Heffernans!</i>, 1926), and the complex and brooding <i>Margaret Gillan</i> (1933).

Antrim, where his father was Church of Ireland rector, he was educated at Marlborough public school and then Merton College, Oxford. He taught Classics at Birmingham University, 1929&ndash;36. Mac-Neice then taught at Bedford College, London, before joining the BBC in 1941, where he worked in the renowned Features Department run by Laurence Gilliam . During the 1930s MacNeice was a leading figure among the new generation of left-wing English poets&mdash; Stephen Spender, Cecil <a href=""entry://Day-Lewis, C[ecil]""><span class=""links"">Day-Lewis </span></a>, and W. H. Auden (with whom he collaborated on <i>Letters from Iceland</i>, 1937). His first collection, <i>Blind Fireworks</i> (1929), explored a personal landscape, but the political concerns of the decade encroached more strongly in <i>Poems</i> (1935). <i>The Earth Compels</i> (1938) is a collection permeated by omens of war, while <i>Autumn Journal</i> (1939), a verse meditation in twenty-four sections, was occasioned by the Munich Crisis in September 1938 when the British Government attempted to appease Hitler. The collections which MacNeice published during the 1940s, <i>Plant and Phantom</i> (1941), <i>Springboard</i> (1944), and <i>Holes in the Sky</i> (1948), engage with the issues of personal and communal responsibility posed by war. In <i>Ten Burnt Offerings</i> (1952) and <i>Autumn Sequel</i> (1954), however, the scope widens as the mood relaxes. In <i>Visitations</i> (1957) he began to develop a concentrated ‘parable-poem’. In <i>Solstices</i> (1961) and <i>The Burning Perch</i> (1963) his acute sense of mortality fuses with a darkly ironic outlook on contemporary society. MacNeice died of pneumonia after going down potholes in Yorkshire with BBC engineers. MacNeice's experience of and reaction against his Irish background led him to reject religious and secular orthodoxy, and to celebrate an ‘incorrigibly plural’ universe. At the same time he remained interested in questions of belief, reflecting his Ulster Protestant background in a continuing fascination with the Bible. <i>The Poetry of W. B. Yeats</i> (1941) was the first serious critical book on <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats</span></a>. His moral realism has had a marked influence on later northern poets such as Seamus <a href=""entry://Heaney, Seamus [Justin]""><span class=""links"">Heaney </span></a>, Michael <a href=""entry://Longley, Michael""><span class=""links"">Longley </span></a>, Derek <a href=""entry://Mahon, Derek""><span class=""links"">Mahon </span></a>, and Paul <a href=""entry://Muldoon, Paul""><span class=""links"">Muldoon </span></a>, and on southern poets such as Brendan <a href=""entry://Kennelly, Brendan""><span class=""links"">Kennelly </span></a>.

The poems of Ossian were immensely popular all over Europe: Goethe quoted extracts in <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther</i> (1774), and Napoleon affected a certain style of speech which was known as <i>ossianer</i>.

<b>Mahon, Derek</b><div class=""content""><i>(1941&ndash; ),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> poet. Born in Belfast, he grew up in Glengormley, and was educated at TCD. He worked as a teacher, and as a journalist. He was writer in residence in NUU, 1978&ndash;9, and TCD, 1988, and moved to New York. His work responds in a complex manner to a northern, Protestant, middle-class background. Without a community to which he can easily belong, Mahon in <i>Night Crossing</i> (1968), his first collection, is drawn to the forgotten and neglected. In <i>Lives</i> (1972) the central issue is the relation of self to the world, with the imagination coming under pressure. Rather than exploring the past, Mahon's poems often project into an apocalyptic future. In <i>The Snow-Party</i> (1975) form and chaos are held in delicate equipoise. <i>Poems:</i> 1962&ndash;1978 (1979) was followed by <i>Courtyards in Delft</i> (1981), many of the poems in this volume reappearing in <i>The Hunt by Night</i> (1982). Meditations on war, human decay, lost innocence, and cultural decline are accompanied by a growing uncertainty. Mahon's recurring settings are desolate Northern landscapes, deserted beaches, and scenes of cosmic isolation. In <i>Antarctica</i> (1985), symbolic landscape is even more wasted and extreme. Mahon translated Gérard de Nerval's <i>The Chimeras</i> (1982); Molière's <i>School for Husbands as High Time</i> (1985), which was presented by <a href=""entry://Field Day""><span class=""links"">Field Day</span></a> in 1984; Molière's <i>School for Wives</i> (1986); and <i>Selected Poems of Philippe Jaccottet</i> (1988). <i>The Hudson Letter</i> (1995) and <i>The Yellow Book</i> (1998) are volumes in which form relaxes into loose-rhyming couplets as social satire grows harsher. <i>Collected Poems</i> appeared in 1999."

During 1833 he met George <a href=""entry://Petrie, (Sir) George""><span class=""links"">Petrie </span></a>, John <a href=""entry://O'Donovan, John""><span class=""links"">O'Donovan </span></a> and Eugene <a href=""entry://O'Curry, Eugene""><span class=""links"">O'Curry </span></a>, scholars who were to supply him with versions of Irish poems on which he based his translations. Petrie employed him in the Ordnance Survey Office, 1833&ndash;9. His prose contributions to Dublin journals mix autobiographical fantasy, psychological self-scrutiny, and free-wheeling speculation. His wide reading ranged from contemporary German, French, and Spanish authors to Persian, Hungarian, and Icelandic poetry of all periods. From 1835 he regularly contributed to the <i><a href=""entry://Dublin University Magazine, The""><span class=""links"">Dublin University Magazine</i></a></span> an <i>‘Anthologia Germanica’</i>, comprising translations of modern German Poetry. A gloomy and introverted figure, he played the part of a poet in outlandish clothes, including a voluminous cloak, green spectacles, and pointed hat. In early life Mangan had been jilted, and he remained unmarried. In spite of his heavy abuse of alcohol he worked strenuously, and produced a large quantity of verse variously signed and initialled, or unsigned, or under pseudonyms such as <i>‘The Man in the Cloak’</i>. In 1837 he began for the <i><a href=""entry://Dublin University Magazine, The""><span class=""links"">Dublin University Magazine</i></a></span> a series of Oriental translations entitled <i>‘Literae Orientales’</i>, being versions of Persian, Turkish, and Arabic poems. In 1846 he wrote some of his finest poems and translations, spurred into creative activity by the worsening conditions in the country during the <a href=""entry://Famine, the""><span class=""links"">Famine</span></a>. Contributions to <i>The Nation</i> for that year included <i>‘Siberia’</i>, <i>‘Dark Rosaleen’</i>, and <i>‘Sarsfield’</i>.

Mangan composed about this time an <i>Autobiography</i> which gives a lurid and unreliable account of his early years.

"martyrologies","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>martyrologies</b><div class=""content"">(félirí), calendars of saints’ days and festivals, with a saint assigned to each day of the year other than the feast-days and festivals such as Christmas or Corpus Christi. Often, as in <i>Félire Oengusso</i> (<i>Calendar of Oengus</i>), there is a text for every day of the year. The earliest surviving martyrology, the <i>Martyrology of Tallaght</i>, composed <i>c.</i>830, was based on a version of a martyrology which entered Irish Church tradition through Iona, which itself drew upon martyrological learning that developed from the ecclesiology of St Jerome (<i>fl.</i> 400). <i>Félire Oengusso</i> was also composed at Tallaght by Oengus the <a href=""entry://Céle Dé""><span class=""links"">Céle Dé</span></a> (client of God, Culdee), and reflects Tallaght's status as a centre of the Culdee reform movement. The <i>Martyrology of Gorman</i> was written in verse between 1166 and 1174 by Mael Muire ua Gormáin, abbot of an Augustinian monastery at Knock, Co. Louth, drawing upon the <i>Martyrology of Tallaght</i>. A martyrology recently discovered in Turin was also composed in the second half of the 12th cent. and shows signs of having been composed in the midlands. The <i>Psalter of Cashel</i> has been lost since the 17th cent. but its text, largely drawn from <i>Félire Oengusso</i>, can be partly restored by reference to extracts from it made by John <a href=""entry://Colgan, John""><span class=""links"">Colgan </span></a>. The <i>Martyrology of Donegal</i> was written by Míchéal <a href=""entry://Ó Cléirigh, Míchéal""><span class=""links"">Ó Cléirigh </span></a> in 1630 and concerns itself exclusively, unlike all its predecessors, with Irish saints.

<b>Maturin, Charles Robert</b><div class=""content""><i>(1780&ndash;1824),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> novelist. Born in Dublin of a Huguenot [see <a href=""entry://Protestantism""><span class=""links"">Protestantism</span></a>] family, educated at TCD and ordained in 1803, he was appointed curate at Loughrea in the west of Ireland, marrying Henrietta Kingsbury a year later. The time he spent in the west made a deep impression on his romantic imagination, and his memories of its landscape inspired much of his work, particularly <i>The <a href=""entry://Milesian Chief, The""><span class=""links"">Milesian Chief</i></a></span> (1812). In 1805 he became curate of St Peter's parish, Aungier St., Dublin, where he remained until his death. Maturin himself financed publication of <i>The <a href=""entry://Fatal Revenge, The""><span class=""links"">Fatal Revenge</i></a></span> (1807) and <i>The <a href=""entry://Wild Irish Boy, The""><span class=""links"">Wild Irish Boy</i></a></span> (1808) before a reversal of family fortunes forced him to turn his love of writing to commercial gain. His literary career, combined with his reputation for eccentricity, dandyism, and a love of dancing and theatre, prevented his preferment in the Church. <i><a href=""entry://Women""><span class=""links"">Women</i></a>, or Pour et Contre</span> (1818) is a romantic story of a young man who chooses between a daughter and her mother without realizing that they are related. Maturin turned to the stage with <i><a href=""entry://Bertram""><span class=""links"">Bertram</i></a></span>, a tragedy which, with Edmund Kean in the title-role, was the season's hit at Drury Lane in 1816. Though the author visited London on the strength of it, his subsequent dramas, <i>Manuel</i> (1817) and <i>Osmyn the Renegade</i> (1819), did not succeed as well. With <i><a href=""entry://Melmoth the Wanderer""><span class=""links"">Melmoth the Wanderer</i></a></span> (1820), a work of lasting interest, he returned to fiction. From the moment of its appearance its power was recognized.

Neglected in Ireland, he did, however, find a readership in France, all of his novels being translated by 1825, with Baudelaire and Hugo declaring their admiration for his work, while Balzac produced a sequel, <i>Melmoth réconcilié</i> (1835), in his <i>Comédie humaine</i>. Oscar <a href=""entry://Wilde, Oscar [Fingal O'Flahertie Wills]""><span class=""links"">Wilde </span></a>, related to Maturin on his mother's side, adopted the pen-name ‘Sebastian Melmoth ’ after his release from Reading Gaol.

A life-long enthusiasm for military life, apparently frustrated by parental wishes, resulted in <i>Stories of Waterloo</i> (1829) and <i>The Bivouac</i> (1837) which earned him the name of father of the military novel. His world of irresponsible young men let loose in the playground of colonial Ireland set the tone for much of Anglo-Irish fiction, notably the ‘rollicking’ novels of Charles <a href=""entry://Lever, Charles [James]""><span class=""links"">Lever </span></a> who did not scruple to plagiarize him.

"metrics, Irish","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>metrics, Irish</b><div class=""content"">can be divided into two formal categories, accentual and syllabic. Early Irish accentual verse, often described as <a href=""entry://roscad""><span class=""links"">rosc (or roscad)</span></a>, is characterized by having a regular number of stressed feet but an irregular number of syllables in the lines. Syllabic Irish verse developed out of the older accentual forms but is distinguished by an equal number of syllables in the lines, and regularity of stress only in the line-endings, where it occurs in meeting the requirement for rhyme between final stressed words. Syllabic verse is generally organized in four-line strophes, whereas the number of lines in a rosc passage is not fixed. A later type of accentual verse is known as amhrán. The amhrán or song metres have a richly assonated stanzaic form, and are also accentual. Broadly speaking, the extant corpus of rosc, syllabic verse, and amhrán suggests three successive periods in the history of Irish versification. Among the very earliest surviving poems in Irish is the accentual (or rosc) eulogy known as <i><a href=""entry://Amra Choluim Cille""><span class=""links"">Amra Choluim Cille</i></a></span>, apparently composed soon after the death of <a href=""entry://Colum Cille [Columba] ""><span class=""links"">Colum Cille </span></a> in 597. While there is no syllabic verse in existence that may be dated earlier than AD 650, such metres (núa-chrutha, ‘new forms’) dominated for the next millennium. The bulk of Old and Middle Irish verse consists of two types of metre, deibhidhe and rannaigheacht, and deibhidhe is by far the more popular metre in the period of classical Modern Irish. The emergence of strict dán díreach (classical syllabic verse) and the new literary standard of Classical Modern Irish (AD <i>c.</i>1200&ndash;1650) was the result of a thorough and systematic investigation of both the literary and spoken forms of the language current in the 12th cent. Accentual verse finally reemerges in <a href=""entry://manuscripts in Irish""><span class=""links"">manuscripts</span></a> at the end of the 17th cent., but references to earlier makers of amhrán, and the highly developed form in which it appears, attest to a long, unrecorded tradition.

"monasticism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>monasticism</b><div class=""content"">was the dominant form of ecclesiastical and scholarly life in Ireland from the 6th to the 12th cents., when the <a href=""entry://bardic poetry""><span class=""links"">bardic schools</span></a> emerged, and remained central to Gaelic society until the 16th cent., when the Dissolution of the Monasteries associated with the English Reformation was extended by Crown authorities to Ireland. The foundations of the Norman period [see <a href=""entry://Norman invasion""><span class=""links"">Norman invasion</span></a>], such as the Cistercian abbeys at Mellifont and Jerpoint, reflected the advent of Continental influence in Ireland. In the earlier period, the communities associated with the Celtic Church in Ireland were fully integrated with native Christian culture in its social and literary aspects. The main foundations were <a href=""entry://Clonmacnoise""><span class=""links"">Clonmacnoise</span></a>, said to have been founded by St <a href=""entry://Ciarán""><span class=""links"">Ciarán </span></a>; <a href=""entry://Iona""><span class=""links"">Iona</span></a>, founded by St <a href=""entry://Colum Cille [Columba] ""><span class=""links"">Colum Cille </span></a>; <a href=""entry://Glendalough""><span class=""links"">Glendalough </span></a>, founded by St Kevin; and <a href=""entry://Monasterboice""><span class=""links"">Monasterboice</span></a>, founded by St Buithe. Most of the earliest churches of Ireland were either small communities living a religious life, or tiny churches where a single cleric served the immediate community. The 7th cent. saw the growth of monastic communities in which clergy led a communal life. Clustered around such communities were agricultural dependants, craftsmen, and traders, forming small monastic towns. Monastic churches, large and small, maintained schools and cultivated both the copying of books and writing of literature. By the 8th cent. copies of many books composed in Irish schools had reached monastic libraries in France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. The high level of intellectual activity in the Irish monasteries of this period is evident from the contemporary development of <a href=""entry://law in Gaelic Ireland""><span class=""links"">law</span></a> as a civic discipline. Legal tracts in Latin and Irish during the 7th, 8th, and 9th cents. reveal a close examination of biblical law, with some traces of Roman jurisprudence. In this environment Irish writing was adapted to the Latin alphabet. The saga literature of Ireland which has survived from earliest times owes its preservation to the monastic scriptoria."

<b>Montague, John</b><div class=""content""><i>(1929&ndash; ),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> poet. Born in Brooklyn, New York, and sent at the age of 4 to live with aunts in Garvaghey, Co. Tyrone, he was educated at St Patrick's College, Armagh, UCD, and Yale. He lived in Paris and taught at Berkeley and at UCC. His first four volumes of poetry&mdash;<i>Forms of Exile</i> (1958), <i>Poisoned Lands</i> (1961), <i>A Chosen Light</i> (1967), and <i>Tides</i> (1970)&mdash;examine personal experience, family, and community, expressing disaffection with a puritanical Ireland and demystifying the romantic myths of the past. In <i>The Rough Field</i> (1972) Montague adapts the panoramic but individualized technique of the American epic devised by Walt Whitman and William Carlos Williams in order to examine the disintegration of Ulster life. An elegiac tone recalling <a href=""entry://Goldsmith, Oliver""><span class=""links"">Goldsmith's </span></a>
<i>The <a href=""entry://Deserted Village, The""><span class=""links"">Deserted Village</i></a></span> is mixed with bitterness and anger as the poet contemplates Ulster's colonial history. His perspective is nationalist, the poetry expressing an intensely personal realization of historical experience, but seeking also to discover a mythic dimension in Irish rural life. Composed of a series of lyrics, the poem ranges from the townland of Garvaghey (from the Irish garbhachadh, <i>‘a rough field’</i>) to Paris and New York. <i>A Slow Dance</i> (1975) contains poems about nature as a healing power, but loss and death are never far away in the book's harsh vision of the dance of life and death. <i>The Great Cloak</i> (1978), a collection of love-poems, sheds the burden of history. <i>The Dead Kingdom</i> (1984) returns to <i>The Rough Field</i>'s concerns with family and politics. <i>Mount Eagle</i> (1989) confirms an achieved serenity. <i>Time in Armagh</i> (1993), <i>Border Sick Call</i> (1995), and <i>Smashing the Piano</i> (1999), bring a stoical composure and a humane perspective to bear on the traumas of personal and community history. Montague's characteristic short-lined verse, a modernist version of <a href=""entry://bardic poetry""><span class=""links"">bardic poetry</span></a>, reflects the effort made to balance intensity and economy. Montague also published <i>Death of a Chieftain</i> (1964), a collection of nine stories; and <i>The Lost Notebook</i> (1987), a novella dealing with the loss of innocence. <i>The Figure in the Cave</i> (1990) collects reminiscences and literary essays."

"Moore, Brian","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Moore, Brian</b><div class=""content""><i>(1921&ndash;1999),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> novelist. Born in Belfast into a Catholic family, he did not follow his father and elder brother into medicine, and after leaving St Malachy's College in 1938 joined the Air Raid Precautions Unit in 1940, an experience reflected in <i>The Emperor of Ice-Cream</i> (1965). In 1943 he enlisted in the British Ministry of War Transport, working in North Africa and, later, as a port official with the Allied occupation forces in Naples and Marseilles. Moore emigrated to Canada in 1948 and took citizenship in 1953. His experiences as a new immigrant, when he took uncongenial work as a proof-reader, gave him material for <i>The Luck of Ginger Coffey</i> (1960). In 1951 he married Jacqueline Sirois ; he moved to the USA in 1959, first to Long Island and New York, then to Malibu, California, where he lived with his second wife, Jean Denney, whom he married in 1967. In addition to novels, he has written short stories and film scripts. <i>Judith Hearne</i> (1955), republished as <i>The <a href=""entry://Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne, The""><span class=""links"">Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne</i></a></span> (1956), <i>The <a href=""entry://Feast of Lupercal, The""><span class=""links"">Feast of Lupercal</i></a></span> (1957), and <i>The Emperor of Ice-Cream</i>, all novels set in Belfast, deal with the struggle to achieve personal autonomy in a narrowly religious and repressive society. The determinism of these first novels, in which individual identity is virtually overwhelmed by religious, social, and family pressures, is undercut in <i>An Answer From Limbo</i> (1962), <i>I Am Mary Dunne</i> (1968), and <i>Fergus</i> (1970). Set in North America, these works begin a reassessment, where responsibility for one's adult being cannot be deterministically apportioned to nurture. The quasi-fictional <i>The Revolution Script</i>, dealing with the kidnapping and murder of a Quebec politician, appeared in 1971 and the novella <i><a href=""entry://Catholics""><span class=""links"">Catholics</i></a></span> in 1972. The protagonist of <i>The <a href=""entry://Mangan Inheritance, The""><span class=""links"">Mangan Inheritance</i></a></span> (1979) confronts the image of what he could become were he to repudiate traditional familial values and follow his fantasy of artistic self-fulfilment. <i>The Temptation of Eileen Hughes</i> (1981) was followed by three novels involving different attitudes to religious belief and authority, <i>Cold Heaven</i> (1983), the historical novel <i>Black Robe</i> (1985), set in 17th-cent. Canada, and <i>The <a href=""entry://Colour of Blood, The""><span class=""links"">Colour of Blood</i></a></span> (1987), set in a Soviet bloc country. <i>Lies of Silence</i> (1990) and <i>No Other Life</i> (1993) embody Moore's concern with ethical questions in a political context. The first, a thriller set in the contemporary Ulster <a href=""entry://‘Troubles, the’""><span class=""links"">Troubles</span></a>, centres on the moral dilemma of a man forced to drive a bomb to a human target while his wife is held hostage. In <i>No Other Life</i>, a retired white missionary priest examines his role in the education and rise of a messianic Caribbean leader. The novel is loosely based on contemporary events in Haiti. In <i>The Statement</i> (1995) Moore explores the mentality and the combination of patriotism and compromise that lead a Nazi sympathizer in Vichy France to collaborate with brutality. <i>The Magician's Wife</i> (1997) is concerned with showing the human cost of sacrificing personal integrity for vanity and ambition. When he died Moore was working on a novel dealing with the poet Rimbaud's years in the desert, after relinquishing his art.

Although born in Limerick, he was raised and educated in Belfast, before moving to work in London, 1876&ndash;92. Throughout his career he issued a book or more each year, the early ones being mostly set in the South Seas (<i>Under Hatches</i>, 1888; <i>From the Bush to the Breakers</i>, 1893). He was most successful with <i>I Forbid the Banns</i> (1893), a play about sectarian division, and wrote 18th cent. studies such as <i>The Jessamy Bride</i> (1897), on Dr Johnson's circle. <i>The Truth About Ulster</i> (1914) illustrates the dangers of sectarianism in relation to social history. He died at Lewes in Suffolk."
"Moore, George [Augustus]","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Moore, George [Augustus]</b><div class=""content""><i>(1852&ndash;1933),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> novelist. Born at Moore Hall, Ballyglass, Co. Mayo, he was the eldest son of George Henry Moore (d. 1870), Nationalist MP, Catholic landowner, racehorse trainer, and one-time friend of Maria <a href=""entry://Edgeworth, Maria""><span class=""links"">Edgeworth </span></a>. Moore went briefly to Oscott College, a minor Catholic public school near Birmingham. Left unsupervised and largely in the company of stable-boys at Moore Hall, he nurtured the ambition of becoming a jockey. Spared a military career by his father's death, and heir to 12,000 acres, Moore left for Paris in 1873, determined to be a painter. Moore came to realize that he had little talent for painting and decided to write instead. He met Mallarmé, at whose suggestion he went to the Nouvelle Athènes in Montmartre, a café and a meeting-place for the Impressionists and their friends. There he met Manet (who painted him three times), Degas, and others. Poor harvests and rent failures in the west of Ireland forced Moore to return to England in late 1879. Having begun as a poet he turned to prose and resolved to follow Zola's naturalistic experiments. His first novel, <i>A Modern Lover</i> (1883), dealt with the exploitation of women by an unscrupulous artist, and was banned by Mudie's commercial library. Undeterred, he brought out <i>A <a href=""entry://Mummer's Wife, A""><span class=""links"">Mummer's Wife</i></a></span> (1885) with Henry Vizetelly, Zola's publisher in English, using a one-volume format aimed at book-buyers rather than borrowers. The driving-force of <i>A <a href=""entry://Drama in Muslin, A""><span class=""links"">Drama in Muslin</i></a></span> (1886) is his awareness of various forms of social injustice in Ireland. At Moore Hall he found a changed and changing world. The age of deference was over; he half-feared, half-despised his tenants, and he recognized that landlords like himself had no future. He outraged nationalist opinion in <i><a href=""entry://Parnell and His Island""><span class=""links"">Parnell and His Island</i></a></span> (1887), a collection of bitterly satirical essays, mixing pity and contempt, with the latter making the stronger impression. In <i>The Confessions of a Young Man</i> (1888) he detached himself even further from the places, people, and ideals of his childhood and youth, striking instead the pose of an aesthete. Moore wrote articles on literature and art for a number of magazines, later collected as <i>Impressions and Opinions</i> (1889) and <i>Modern Painting</i> (1893). He published two unsuccessful novels, <i>Mike Fletcher</i> (1889) and <i><a href=""entry://Vain Fortune""><span class=""links"">Vain Fortune</i></a></span> (1891), but with the publication of <i><a href=""entry://Esther Waters""><span class=""links"">Esther Waters</i></a></span> (1894) he established himself as a writer with a keen awareness of the vulnerability of women in society. He made no attempt to repeat his success. Instead he tried his hand as a playwright and continued to experiment with short fiction, as in <i>Celibates</i> (1895), a book of stories about people whom life has overcome. He embarked on two musical novels, <i><a href=""entry://Evelyn Innes""><span class=""links"">Evelyn Innes</i></a></span> (1898) and <i>Sister Teresa</i> (1901). Around this time he first met Maud Burke, later Lady Cunard, for whom he was to have a deep and lasting affection. Edward <a href=""entry://Martyn, Edward""><span class=""links"">Martyn </span></a>, his cousin and childhood friend, introduced him to W. B. <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a> in 1897, when Moore became an unlikely ally in the attempt to establish an Irish national theatre [see <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>]. Moore had some experience with the Independent Theatre in London, and he helped Martyn with his play <i>The Tale of a Town</i> (later rewritten as <i>The <a href=""entry://Bending of the Bough, The""><span class=""links"">Bending of the Bough</i></a></span>, 1900). In 1901 he moved to Dublin and took a house in Upper Ely Place. However, Moore had little patience with Yeats's idea of heroic drama and they quarrelled. Though not an Irish-speaker himself, he threw himself behind the language movement, writing <i>The <a href=""entry://Untilled Field, The""><span class=""links"">Untilled Field</i></a></span> (1903) for translation into Irish, to be used by the <a href=""entry://Gaelic League""><span class=""links"">Gaelic League</span></a>. This book forced him to analyse the state of Ireland, his motives in returning, and the chances of success for the <a href=""entry://literary revival""><span class=""links"">literary revival</span></a>. In 1903, wishing to draw attention to the reactionary nature of Irish <a href=""entry://Catholicism""><span class=""links"">Catholicism</span></a>, he declared himself a Protestant in <i>The Irish Times</i>. However, <i>The <a href=""entry://Lake, The""><span class=""links"">Lake</i></a></span> (1905) dealt earnestly with the subject of belief and religious conviction. Here Moore developed the <i>‘melodic line’</i>, a self-consciously fluid rhythmic prose based on oral speech patterns, an effect not unlike the stream-of-consciousness technique pioneered in <a href=""entry://Joyce, James [Augustine Aloysius]""><span class=""links"">Joyce's </span></a>
<i><a href=""entry://Ulysses""><span class=""links"">Ulysses</i></a></span>. <i>Hail and Farewell</i>, his three-volume history of the revival, is his comic masterpiece. The account of family and childhood caused a breach with his brother Maurice which was never fully healed. After the first volume was published (<i>Ave</i>, 1911), he decided it would be tactless to stay on in Dublin and by the time the others appeared (<i>Salve</i>, 1912; <i>Vale</i>, 1914) he was again settled in London. Moore spent the remaining twenty-three years of his life at 121 Ebury St. In 1913 he travelled to the Holy Land to research the background for <i>The <a href=""entry://Brook Kerith, The""><span class=""links"">Brook Kerith</i></a></span> (1916). Amongst his later works are: <i>A <a href=""entry://Story-Teller's Holiday, A""><span class=""links"">Story-Teller's Holiday</i></a></span> (1918), <i><a href=""entry://Héloïse and Abelard""><span class=""links"">Héloïse and Abelard</i></a></span> (1921), the conversational memoirs <i>Avowals</i> (1919), and <i>Conversations in Ebury Street</i> (1924). With the burning of Moore Hall in February 1923, Moore lost his last link with Ireland and declared it was not a country for a gentleman. While writing <i><a href=""entry://Aphrodite in Aulis""><span class=""links"">Aphrodite in Aulis</i></a></span> he became ill with uraemia, but he continued working to the end. At his own request his ashes were buried on Castle Island in Lough Carra, across the lake from Moore Hall. See <p class=""blk"">&nbsp;Cave, <i>A Study of the Novels of George Moore</i> (1978).</p>"
"Moore, Thomas","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Moore, Thomas</b><div class=""content""><i>(1779&ndash;1852),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> poet; born in Aungier St., Dublin, the son of a Catholic merchant. He was educated at TCD, where he befriended the <i><a href=""entry://United Irishman, The""><span class=""links"">United Irishman</i></a></span> Robert <a href=""entry://Emmet, Robert""><span class=""links"">Emmet </span></a>. Moore's first book, a translation of the <i>Odes of Anacreon</i> (1800), appealed to the Prince of Wales, who agreed to have the volume dedicated to him. <i>The Poetical Works of the Late Thomas Little Esq</i>. (1801) purported to be a collection of verses by a youthful amatory poet who died at 21. Byron met him in 1811, and they became close friends. <i>Epistles, Odes, and Other Poems</i> (1806) reflect his experiences of the Caribbean and America. When Francis Jeffrey savaged the book in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, Moore challenged him to a duel, which was stopped in time. Moore's <i>Irish Melodies</i>, based on the airs recorded by Edward <a href=""entry://Bunting, Edward""><span class=""links"">Bunting </span></a>, was first issued in two volumes in 1808 and ran to an additional eight volumes up to 1834. The early numbers evoke leaders of the 1798 Rebellion, in words and music full of sorrowing futility. Beneath the emotional pathos, there was often the veiled hint of sedition and a warning that violence would break out again in Ireland if justice were not done to the Irish Catholics. <i>National Airs</i> (6 vols., 1818&ndash;28) were based on music from other <a href=""entry://ballads in Ireland""><span class=""links"">folksong traditions</span></a> than the Irish. <i>Corruption and Intolerance</i> (1808), two long poems in harsh rhyming couplets, rage against the machinations employed to pass the Act of <a href=""entry://Union, Act of""><span class=""links"">Union</span></a> and the intolerance in Anglo-Irish relations. <i>A Letter to the Roman Catholics of Dublin</i> (1810) argued for conciliation. From 1808 Moore participated in the Kilkenny theatre festival, and there he met Elizabeth Dyke, an actress whom he married in 1811 when she was 16. <i>Intercepted Letters, or The Two-Penny Post Bag</i> (1813), a collection of squibs and comic verse, met with success, its mockery of court vanity and anti-Catholic prejudice appealing to the liberal reformers who gathered at Holland House in London. <i><a href=""entry://Lallah Rookh""><span class=""links"">Lallah Rookh</i></a></span> (1817) was greeted with enthusiastic acclaim on publication, though some critics reverted to old charges of licentiousness and impiety. A trip to France inspired <i>The Fudge Family in Paris</i> (1818), a collection of verse letters to different correspondents, mocking British anti-Napoleonic policy of the time. Deeply in debt, Moore left for the financial asylum of the Continent with Lord John Russell, his future editor and later Prime Minister. In Venice Byron gave him the manuscript of his projected <i>Memoirs</i>. On his return to England he published <i>The Loves of the Angels</i> (1822), a poem which sought to describe the effects of original sin. <i>Fables for the Holy Alliance</i> (1823) attacked the post-Napoleonic entente between Russia and Austria. <i>Memoirs of Captain Rock, the Celebrated Irish Chieftain</i> (1824) was a history of Ireland from the standpoint of a Whiteboy [see <a href=""entry://secret societies""><span class=""links"">secret societies</span></a>], which argued that English misrule begets Irish violence. On Byron's death in 1824 a dispute arose about the <i>Memoirs</i>. At the behest of Byron's widow and half-sister, these were burnt in the London office of the publisher John Murray . Moore's <i>Memoirs of the Life of the Right Honourable Richard Brinsley Sheridan</i> (1825) did not spare the Prince Regent for his neglect of the dying <a href=""entry://Sheridan, Richard Brinsley""><span class=""links"">Sheridan </span></a>. <i>Letters and Journals of</i> Lord Byron, <i>with Notices of his Life</i> (2 vols., 1830) was based on recollections of Byron. Thereafter, Moore began work on a <i>Life of Lord Edward Fitzgerald</i> (1831). In 1832 Gerald <a href=""entry://Griffin, Gerald""><span class=""links"">Griffin </span></a> and his brother William tried to persuade Moore to stand as an MP for Limerick as part of the <a href=""entry://Repeal of the Union""><span class=""links"">Repeal campaign</span></a>, but he declined. Next he embarked upon a four-volume <i>History of Ireland</i> (1935&ndash;46), but his scholarship, minute and searching in its way, did not have the command of the professional. <i>The Poetical Works of Thomas Moore</i>, collected by himself, in ten volumes, was issued in 1841. <i>The Memoirs, Journal, and Correspondence</i> (1853&ndash;6) were edited by his friend Russell, and savaged by John Wilson <a href=""entry://Croker, John Wilson""><span class=""links"">Croker </span></a>, reviewing in <i>The Critical Quarterly</i>. His reputation declined swiftly after his death and his work has often been trivialized. See <p class=""blk"">&nbsp;de Vere White, <i>Tom Moore: The Irish Poet</i> (1977).</p>"

Born in Dublin, of Anglo-Irish parents, she was brought up in London and educated at Badminton and Somerville College, Oxford. From 1948 to 1963 she was Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy at St Anne's College, Oxford. Only two of her novels are set in Ireland, <i>The <a href=""entry://Unicorn, The""><span class=""links"">Unicorn</i></a></span> (1963) and <i>The <a href=""entry://Red and the Green, The""><span class=""links"">Red and the Green</i></a></span> (1965); nevertheless, Irish people appear more or less prominently in many of her works. Some of these Irish references are ironic or playful, occasionally using stereotypes of charm and irresponsibility, but the country also appears to fascinate her as a place of moral decisiveness. In <i><a href=""entry://Under the Net""><span class=""links"">Under the Net</i></a></span> (1954) the hero's friend Finn retreats from the uncertainties of London to his home country. In <i>The Philosopher's Pupil</i> (1983) Emma is preoccupied with conflict in Ireland. Her early novels, <i>Under the Net, The Flight from the Enchanter</i> (1956), <i>The Sandcastle</i> (1957), <i>The Bell</i> (1958), <i>A Severed Head</i> (1961), and <i>An Unofficial Rose</i> (1962), deal with the discovery of freedom and purpose. Her next group of novels, <i>The Unicorn, The Italian Girl</i> (1964), <i>The Red and the Green</i>, and <i>The Time of the Angels</i> (1966), explore in a highly wrought manner questions of self-assertion, artistic creativity, issues of faith, and political conviction. <i>The Nice and the Good</i> (1968) belongs with the third phase of her work, which shows a more subtle discrimination of character and morality. Works of this period are <i>A Fairly Honourable Defeat</i> (1970); <i>The <a href=""entry://Black Prince, The""><span class=""links"">Black Prince</i></a></span> (1973); and the outstanding <i>The <a href=""entry://Sea, The Sea, The""><span class=""links"">Sea, The Sea</i></a></span> (1978). Her later works, <i>Nuns and Soldiers</i> (1980), <i>The Philosopher's Pupil, The Good Apprentice</i> (1985), <i>The Message to the Planet</i> (1989), and <i>The Green Knight</i> (1993) show a looser structure, continuing to investigate the problem of evil.

He left Ireland and found employment with a banking house in London. During 1752&ndash;4 he launched and edited the <i>Gray's Inn Journal</i>. He qualified as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn and practised successfully until 1788, when deafness forced his retirement. In 1756 he wrote a Drury Lane farce called <i>The Apprentice</i> and earned £800 by it. This was followed by <i>An Englishman from Paris</i> (1756). <i>The Upholsterer, or What News?</i> (1757) was a farce on tradesmen meddling in politics. Murphy tried his hand at tragedy with <i>The Orphan of China</i> (1755). His later plays include <i>The Way to Keep Him</i> (1760), <i>The Citizen</i> (1761), and <i><a href=""entry://Three Weeks After Marriage""><span class=""links"">Three Weeks After Marriage</i></a></span> (1776). He also attempted classical themes in <i>Zenobia</i> (1768) and <i>Arminius</i>, a pro-war play which secured him a royal pension in 1798.

<b>Murphy, Tom [Thomas]</b><div class=""content""><i>(1935&ndash; ),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> playwright. Born in Tuam, Co. Galway, he was educated by the Christian Brothers before attending the technical school. He became a metalwork teacher at Mountbellew near Tuam. He acted locally and wrote the one-act play, <i>On the Outside</i> (1959), with Noel O'Donoghue, which dealt with class tensions. In 1960 Murphy sent <i>A Whistle in the Dark</i> to Ernest <a href=""entry://Blythe, Ernest""><span class=""links"">Blythe </span></a> at the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>, who rejected it. It had a successful production in London. After <i>The Fooleen</i>, later retitled <i>A Crucial Week in the Life of a Grocer's Assistant</i>, was also rejected by the Abbey in 1961, Murphy emigrated to England. <i>Famine</i> (1968) dealt with the ‘natural extravagance’ of youth which wants to expand into love. <i>A Crucial Week in the Life of a Grocer's Assistant</i> (1969), part expressionist dream-play, part naturalism, balances the pull of excitement and emigration against the attractions of the known and familiar. Murphy returned to Ireland in 1970. <i>The Morning After Optimism</i> (1971), made use of a complex range of theatrical resources. In a forest of images James and Rosie, a pimp and his whore, encounter their better selves, the dream lovers Edmund and Anastasia. <i>The Sanctuary Lamp</i> (1975) features two outcasts, the Irish Francisco and the English Henry, who overturn a confession box in a church, finding refuge in friendship and fellow-feeling. In <i>The Blue Macushla</i> (1980) the night-club of the title is a false sanctuary, run by the corrupt Eddie O'Hara, who is involved in <a href=""entry://IRA""><span class=""links"">IRA</span></a> activities. <i>Conversations on a Homecoming</i> (1985) was produced by the <a href=""entry://Druid Theatre""><span class=""links"">Druid Theatre</span></a> in Galway, with which Murphy was writer in association, 1983&ndash;5. It is set in the White House, a run-down pub, where Michael's friends gather to celebrate his return from the USA. Music is central in <i>The <a href=""entry://Gigli Concert, The""><span class=""links"">Gigli Concert</i></a></span> (1983), where it symbolizes an ideal perfection. <i><a href=""entry://Bailegangaire""><span class=""links"">Bailegangaire</i></a></span> (1985) returns to a more naturalist form, but these two plays represent an affirmation of the human spirit in the face of adversity. <i>Too Late for Logic</i> (1989) returns to the exploration of family ties. <i>The Wake</i> (1998) deals with the return of an Irishwoman, now a whore in New York, to her native village, where havoc is let loose. Murphy is a playwright who explores individual and community identity to reveal the great gulf that lies between the ideals projected by the founders of the <a href=""entry://Irish State""><span class=""links"">Irish State</span></a>, and by the Catholic Church, and the actual conditions in which people live and their mental and emotional states.

"mythological cycle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>mythological cycle</b>,<div class=""content"">the. The division of medieval Irish literature into four cycles&mdash;mythological, <a href=""entry://Ulster cycle""><span class=""links"">Ulster</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Fionn cycle""><span class=""links"">Fionn</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://historical cycle""><span class=""links"">historical</span></a> or king&mdash;is a modern one. There is virtually no segment of medieval narrative that is without a mythological constituent or dimension: the Ulster tales may be characterized by heroic endeavour, but mythic themes play a large role in them; the historical tales offer a rich documentation of Celtic and Indo-European myth and ritual particularly in relation to <a href=""entry://kingship""><span class=""links"">kingship</span></a>; and the Fionn cycle, inextricably intertwined with the supernatural world of the <a href=""entry://sídh""><span class=""links"">sídh</span></a> (fairies), belongs more to the mythological than to the heroic frame of thought. However, the mythological cycle may be taken to refer to those tales which deal specifically with the gods of pagan Ireland. Of the tales normally considered part of the mythological cycle, by far the most important is <i><a href=""entry://Cath Maige Tuired""><span class=""links"">Cath Maige Tuired</i></a></span>. Its central topic is the mythic battle between the divinities of pagan Ireland, the Tuatha Dé Danann, and that other mythological people, the Fomoiri [see <a href=""entry://mythology""><span class=""links"">mythology</span></a>], who continually threatened disruption of social order and prosperity. <i>Cath Maige Tuired</i> is concerned with the arrival in Ireland of the Tuatha Dé Danann and their conquest of their predecessors, the Fir Bolg, which figure also in <i><a href=""entry://Lebor Gabála Érenn""><span class=""links"">Lebor Gabála</i></a></span>. They take control of Ireland, but the Fir Bolg are permitted to retire to the province of Connacht. This is the battle in which Nuada Argetlám (Silver-Arm, the equivalent of Welsh Lludd Llaw Ereint), King of the Tuatha Dé, is said to have lost his arm, later replaced with one wrought in silver by the divine leech Dian Cécht.

<b>mythology</b>,<div class=""content"">Irish, the body of mythological narrative and verse which informed and reflected public and private belief and behaviour in pagan Ireland, not directly accessible to modern scrutiny, but reflected in the extant mythological literature that has survived in the <a href=""entry://manuscripts in Irish""><span class=""links"">manuscripts</span></a> of monastic scribes and redactors. The manuscript survivals are complemented by other comparable material: Welsh/British literature, classical comments on the Celts, and the iconography and epigraphy of Celtic and Romano-Celtic monuments in Britain and the Continent. The inevitably fragmentary nature of this material, and its inadequacy in reflecting pagan Celtic belief, accentuate the apparent heterogeneity and disorganization of the tradition and disguise its underlying consistency. The often complex and nuanced thematic structures that emerge from the extant texts indicate the existence in an earlier period of a coherent and organized mythological system. The god Lug is (sam)ildánach (‘skilled in many arts together’), like his Gaulish counterpart, the <i>‘inventor of all the arts’</i> in Caesar's account. He gave his name to Lugdunum/Lyon. The youthful conqueror of malevolent oppressors, his feast was celebrated throughout the Celtic lands, and to some extent still is in Ireland and Brittany in the <a href=""entry://Lughnasa""><span class=""links"">Lughnasa</span></a> festival. As the divine archetype of sacral <a href=""entry://kingship""><span class=""links"">kingship</span></a> he is closely associated with the goddesses identified with the integrity of the land under several aspects. Because of her validating function as goddess of sovereignty, she sometimes assumes an assertive persona which is variously reflected in the literary portrayals of <a href=""entry://Medb""><span class=""links"">Medb </span></a>, Macha [see <a href=""entry://Emain Macha""><span class=""links"">Emain Macha</span></a>], and even the very human Deirdre [<i>see <a href=""entry://Longes mac nUislenn""><span class=""links"">Longes mac nUislenn</i></a></span>]. The sovereignty myth figured by the triad of <a href=""entry://Ériu""><span class=""links"">Ériu</span></a>, Fódla, and Banba had at its core a ritual in which the new ruler accepted a drink from the goddess and subsequently mated with her. <i><a href=""entry://Brigit, St""><span class=""links"">Brigit</i></a></span> (‘the Exalted One’) is patron of poetry, healing, and craftsmanship, equivalent in name to Brigantí/Brigantia, tutelary deity of the British tribe of the Brigantes, and in function similar to the Gaulish goddess called ‘Minerva’ by Caesar . Boann, personification of the Boyne [see <a href=""entry://New Grange""><span class=""links"">New Grange</span></a>], the sacred river with its own prolific mythology, has the Dagda for her husband and Mac ind Óc/Oengus for her son, forming a triune family abundantly attested in the rest of the Celtic world as well as in universal mythology. Kingship, the pivotal institution of early Irish society, has its own rich mythology woven into the legends of famous kings such as Conaire, <a href=""entry://Cormac mac Airt ""><span class=""links"">Cormac mac Airt </span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Niall Noígiallach""><span class=""links"">Niall Noígiallach</span></a>, and embodying many reflexes of Indo-European ideology.

"Norman invasion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Norman invasion</b>.<div class=""content"">The insular world of Gaelic Ireland was significantly breached with the arrival of the Anglo-Normans in the years following 1169. After the defeat of the Vikings at Clontarf in 1014, the government of the country became radically unstable, creating a situation in which the <i><a href=""entry://Annals of the Four Masters""><span class=""links"">Annals of the Four Masters</i></a></span> entry for the year 1145 can describe the country as ‘a trembling sod’. The Norman invasion was precipitated, according to tradition, by Dermot MacMurrough (Diarmait Mac Murchadha ), King of Leinster, in a struggle against the O'Neill, O'Brien, and O'Rourke families. In 1152 MacMurrough abducted Tiernan O'Rourke's wife Dervorgilla . In 1166, Roderick O'Conor, High King of Ireland, and O'Rourke attacked Diarmait, who retreated to Bristol and thence to Aquitaine, where he sought assistance from Henry II. Henry had already acquired authority to invade Ireland in a Papal Bull (<i>Laudabiliter</i>) secured by John of Salisbury from Adrian IV (the English Pope Nicholas Breakspear) in 1155. Basing himself in Bristol, Dermot gathered an army around the nucleus provided by Richard FitzGilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke (known as Strongbow in Irish tradition). After the initial incursion of a limited Norman party at Baginbun in Wexford in 1169, Strongbow arrived with 200 knights and 1,000 men-at-arms in 1170. The success of the mailed knights and their bowmen was immediate. When Dermot died in 1171 Strongbow assumed the office of King of Leinster. Henry II came to Ireland in order to secure the feudal loyalty of the Normans, and many Irish chieftains. Strongbow died in 1175, by which year Leinster and part of Munster were in Norman hands but Ulster and Connacht remained Gaelic. The appointment of Prince John as Lord of Ireland by his father in 1175 and his succession to the throne of England in 1199 initiated the second phase of the conquest. John made extensive grants in Gaelic territories to his Norman liege-lords, establishing the Butler, Fitzgerald, and de Burgh dynasties of Ireland. The penetration of Gaelic society by cultural forms associated with the Normans made a lasting alteration in the development of Irish culture, for instance in the <a href=""entry://dánta grádha""><span class=""links"">dánta grádha</span></a>, the Irish lays [see <a href=""entry://laoithe""><span class=""links"">laoithe</span></a>], and in the elaboration of native patterns of story-telling by the addition of romantic elements. There were, also, a number of literary productions in Norman French and in English (such as <i>The <a href=""entry://Land of Cokaygne, The""><span class=""links"">Land of Cokaygne</i></a></span>); and English began to be used as the language of commerce and administration beyond the Pale. Extensive political and economic changes reflected the process of feudalization intrinsic to the Norman system of social administration and land use. Gaelic writers varied in the degree of their attachment to the Normans and their legacy, the closest point being reached in Geoffrey <a href=""entry://Keating, Geoffrey""><span class=""links"">Keating's </span></a>

"Northern Ireland","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Northern Ireland</b><div class=""content"">came into being shortly before the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 [see <a href=""entry://Anglo-Irish War, the""><span class=""links"">Anglo-Irish War</span></a>], which established a sovereign Irish Free State [see <a href=""entry://Irish State""><span class=""links"">Irish State</span></a>] within the United Kingdom. The northern state owed its existence to the strongly-felt antipathy of Ulster Unionists to Home Rule legislation [see <a href=""entry://Irish Parliamentary Party""><span class=""links"">Irish Parliamentary Party</span></a>], which they identified with rule by a preponderantly Roman Catholic and economically underdeveloped population that had traditionally been the religious and racial enemy of northern Protestants since the 17th-cent. Ulster <a href=""entry://plantation""><span class=""links"">plantation</span></a>. On 28 September 1912, almost half a million Northern Protestant men and women signed an Ulster Covenant vowing resistance to Home Rule under the leadership of Edward <a href=""entry://Carson, Edward""><span class=""links"">Carson </span></a> and the Unionist Council. Under the Better Government of Ireland Act of 1920 (with effect from 1 May 1921), Northern Ireland was equipped with a parliament at Stormont from 1932 on the outskirts of Belfast, constructed on the Westminster model and subject to the authority of the imperial parliament. Commonly&mdash;but erroneously&mdash;called Ulster or the Province, Northern Ireland had at the outset a clear two-thirds Protestant majority of which one-third was Church of Ireland and two-thirds Presbyterian. Together these dominated political life under a succession of conservative Unionist governments led by James Craig (Viscount Craigavon ), 1921&ndash;40, J. M. Andrews, 1940&ndash;3, and Sir Basil Brooke (Lord Brookborough ), 1943&ndash;63. Meanwhile Catholics found themselves systematically excluded from political office and discriminated against in matters of employment and housing. However, the extension of British post-war legislation in health and education began to bring the benefits of the Welfare State to all sections of the Northern population from 1947. This had the effect of creating the generation who formed the nationalist movements of the 1960s&mdash;notably the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, 1967; People's Democracy, 1968; and the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP). With the accession of Terence O'Neill to the premiership came the promise of liberalization in the North and friendly overtures towards the neighbouring Republic. An ultra-Protestant reaction in 1966 led to the formation of the new Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Revd Ian Paisley, Moderator of his own Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and later founder of the Democratic Unionist Party in 1971, soon emerged as leader of the ultra-Protestants. Protestant violence at Burntollet during a Belfast-Derry march, abetted by the RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary), led to the battle of the Bogside, and the introduction of the British army on 15 August 1969 at the request of the new premier, James Chichester-Clark (Lord Moyola). A reinvigorated <a href=""entry://IRA""><span class=""links"">IRA</span></a> emerged to defend the nationalist community and quickly took the offensive in a campaign of shootings and bombings. Internment was implemented disastrously on 9 August 1971&mdash;the intelligence lists were out of date and UVF paramilitaries were exempted. Thirteen civilian marchers were shot dead by British paratroopers on ‘Bloody Sunday’ in Derry on 30 January 1972, and direct rule by secretary of state was introduced in March of that year. The Sunningdale Agreement between Britain and Ireland (1973) established a power-sharing executive which was brought down by the Ulster Workers' Council strike of May 1974. A concerted policy of criminalization was levelled against the IRA by the Tory government of Margaret Thatcher (who narrowly escaped becoming one of the IRA's assassination victims). In November 1985 the Hillsborough Agreement confirmed that neither government would support unity without the clear and formal consent of the Northern majority. Talks between John Hume of the SDLP and Gerry <a href=""entry://Adams, Gerry""><span class=""links"">Adams </span></a> of Sinn Féin in Autumn 1993, and a joint declaration by the Irish and British governments with the assent of the Official Unionists under James Molyneux, raised the possibility that peace might ‘break out’ in early 1994, confirmed by the IRA and Loyalist ceasefires later in the year. The IRA ended its ceasefire in 1996 with the bombing of Canary Wharf in London, and Sinn Féin were barred from the inter-party talks under the Chairman George Mitchell, a U.S. Senator. In 1997 Tony Blair was elected Prime Minister at Westminster and brought a fresh impetus to the process of peacemaking, along with Mo Mowlam, Secretary of State. In July 1997 the IRA renewed its ceasefire, Sinn Féin joined the talks, and signed up to the Mitchell principles, which were based on compromise and non-violence. In 1998 Mitchell, after exhausting and nail-biting negotiations involving both governments and all parties (apart from the Democratic Unionist Party) brokered the ‘Good Friday Agreement’, which put in place wide-ranging strategies of accommodation between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and between Ireland and Britain. In 1999 a devolved assembly was formed in Stormont, only to be revoked in 2000 when agreement could not be reached on the decommissioning of weapons."

Tyrone, the son of a Customs Officer. Having spoken Irish at home and learnt his English from books, he was educated by the Christian Brothers in Synge Street, Dublin, before proceeding to UCD. In 1935 he joined the Civil Service, rising to be principal officer for town planning. <i><a href=""entry://At Swim-Two-Birds""><span class=""links"">At Swim-Two-Birds</i></a></span> (1939) was hailed critically but sold poorly. O'Nolan's next novel, <i>The <a href=""entry://Third Policeman, The""><span class=""links"">Third Policeman</i></a></span>, went the round of publishers in 1940 and met with repeated rejections in wartime England, causing him such disappointment that he made no further attempts to have it published. (It appeared posthumously in 1967.) R. M. Smyllie, editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>, invited him to contribute a humorous column <i>‘Cruiskeen Lawn’</i>, which ran in the paper from 1940 until his death. For the first year the column was mainly in Irish, but it drifted into English and continued thus exclusively. Some of the material was simply humorous but much of it was satirically directed against politicians, bureaucrats, and mediocrities in office. A satirical Irish novel, <i>An <a href=""entry://Béal Bocht, An""><span class=""links"">Béal Bocht</i></a></span> (1941), had a limited market until it appeared in English as <i>The Poor Mouth</i> (1964). In 1953 the Civil Service persuaded him to take voluntary retirement. A bleak period ended on reissue in 1960 of <i>At Swim-Two-Birds</i> which enjoyed tremendous success. O'Nolan soon produced <i>The Hard Life</i> (1961).

After <i><a href=""entry://Without My Cloak""><span class=""links"">Without My Cloak</i></a></span> (1931), the story of a Catholic family like her own, she turned to depicting the inner lives of young women reaching adulthood only to find themselves in conflict between their moral training and the call of sexual love. Confronted with the choice, the heroines of <i>The Ante-Room</i> (1934) and <i>Mary Lavelle</i> (1936) choose differently, Agnes in the former novel accepting abstinence while Mary in the latter embraces sexual initiation. <i>The <a href=""entry://Land of Spices, The""><span class=""links"">Land of Spices</i></a></span> (1941) is an examination of the spiritual development of a dedicated nun, as she recovers her capacity for love.

This theme was pursued with theatrical brilliance in the two plays which followed, <i><a href=""entry://Juno and the Paycock""><span class=""links"">Juno and the Paycock</i></a></span> (1924) and <i>The <a href=""entry://Plough and the Stars, The""><span class=""links"">Plough and the Stars</i></a></span> (1926). <i>Juno and the Paycock</i>, though dealing with the violence of the <a href=""entry://Civil War""><span class=""links"">Civil War</span></a>, had enough charm in the characters of Captain Boyle and Joxer his parasite to lighten its darker sides, but <i>The Plough and the Stars</i>, set at the time of the 1916 <i><a href=""entry://Easter Rising""><span class=""links"">Easter Rising</i></a></span> (its title referring to the Citizen Army emblem) caused deep offence. There was a riot in the theatre, and <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a> railed against those who had ‘disgraced themselves again’, proclaiming the author as the new Synge. <i>The <a href=""entry://Silver Tassie, The""><span class=""links"">Silver Tassie</i></a></span> (1928), dealing with the horror of the First World War, was an attempt to break away from realism. After its rejection by Yeats and the Abbey it had a London production, where it met with a lukewarm response. Disillusioned with the Abbey, and at odds with the ethos of the new <a href=""entry://Irish State""><span class=""links"">Irish State</span></a>, O'Casey now settled in England where he had met and married Eileen Carey Reynolds in 1927. <i>I Knock at the Door</i>, the first volume of <i>Autobiographies</i>, appeared in 1939, subsequent volumes continuing to 1954. In 1940 the O'Caseys moved to Totnes in Devon. Throughout these years O'Casey retained his conviction, formed in his years with Larkin's Union, that communism would provide a solution to the problems of poverty and injustice, views reflected in the plays <i>The <a href=""entry://Star Turns Red, The""><span class=""links"">Star Turns Red</i></a></span> (1940), <i><a href=""entry://Red Roses for Me""><span class=""links"">Red Roses for Me</i></a></span> (1942), <i><a href=""entry://Purple Dust, The""><span class=""links"">Purple Dust</i></a></span> (1945), and <i><a href=""entry://Oak Leaves and Lavender""><span class=""links"">Oak Leaves and Lavender</i></a></span>, each of which has a worker-hero. The later experimental works, <i><a href=""entry://Cock-a-doodle Dandy""><span class=""links"">Cock-a-Doodle Dandy</i></a></span> (1949), <i>The <a href=""entry://Bishop's Bonfire, The""><span class=""links"">Bishop's Bonfire</i></a></span> (1955), and <i>The <a href=""entry://Drums of Father Ned, The""><span class=""links"">Drums of Father Ned</i></a></span> (1959), have a generalized Irish setting and are allegories based upon a Utopian vision of human transformation. In <i>Behind the Green Curtains</i> (1962, published 1961) he attacks Ireland directly, but there is a kind of reconciliation in <i>The Moon Shines on Kylenamoe</i> (published 1961), a one-act play.

He was involved in the agitation for <a href=""entry://Catholic Emancipation""><span class=""links"">Catholic Emancipation</span></a> from 1804, achieving it in 1829. He then campaigned for <a href=""entry://Repeal of the Union""><span class=""links"">Repeal</span></a>. Following his climb-down in agreeing to cancel a mass meeting at Clontarf in 1843, he was convicted of seditious conspiracy in a state trial of 1844. Released on appeal after four months, he sought new alliances but never regained his former dynamism. O'Connell's political ideas were those of an advanced secular radical, supporting parliamentary government, manhood suffrage, equality of opportunity, and the separation of Church and State. Yet his success depended on his ability, working in close alliance with the Catholic clergy, to channel the complex blend of concrete grievances, sectarian animosities, and vague aspirations towards social transformation that animated the Catholic masses. He combined an apocalyptic and often inflammatory rhetoric with the pursuit of limited objectives by constitutional means.

<b>O'Connor, Frank</b>
<i>(pseudonym of Michael O'Donovan )</i><div class=""content""><i>(1903&ndash;1966),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> short-story writer, translator, and novelist. Born in Cork, he was raised in poverty by his mother largely in the absence of his father, a British soldier and Irish nationalist. O'Connor's formal education ended at 12, but thereafter he read voraciously, encouraged by Daniel <a href=""entry://Corkery, Daniel""><span class=""links"">Corkery </span></a>, who directed him to Russian fiction, Gaelic poetry, and nationalism. During the <a href=""entry://Civil War""><span class=""links"">Civil War</span></a> O'Connor took the Republican side and was interned in Gormanstown in 1923. The romantic idealism of the struggle for independence coupled with the barbarism of guerilla warfare and a general sense of betrayal shaped two of his most powerful books: his first volume of short stories, <i><a href=""entry://Guests of the Nation""><span class=""links"">Guests of the Nation</i></a></span> (1931), and the highly partisan study of Michael <a href=""entry://Collins, Michael""><span class=""links"">Collins </span></a>, <i>The Big Fellow</i> (1937). After his release O'Connor became a librarian and quickly established himself as a disruptive presence in Dublin literary circles. He came under the influence of W. B. <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a>, with whom he established the Irish Academy of Letters in order to oppose <a href=""entry://Censorship of Publications Act""><span class=""links"">censorship</span></a>. <i>Guests of the Nation</i> was followed by a novel, <i>The Saint and Mary Kate</i> (1932), and <i>The Wild Bird's Nest</i> (1932), a volume of translations from the Irish published by the <a href=""entry://Cuala Press, The""><span class=""links"">Cuala Press</span></a> from which Yeats happily adapted material as the need arose. The genial but detached narrator of O'Connor's short stories emerged in a second collection, <i>Bones of Contention</i> (1936), while the poems in <i>Three Old Brothers</i> (1936) were more stilted and mannered. <i>In the Train</i> (1937) and <i>Moses' Rock</i> (1938) were written for the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>, which he served as a director 1935&ndash;9. In 1939 O'Connor married the Welsh actress Evelyn Bowen, and settled in Woodenbridge, Co. Wicklow. <i>Crab Apple Jelly</i> (1944) focuses on the frustrations and repressions of respectable middle-class Ireland in tales such as <i>‘The Lucys’</i> and <i>‘The Mad Lomasneys’</i>. Much of his best work in the 1940s was banned under the Censorship Act as indecent, notably the novel <i><a href=""entry://Dutch Interior""><span class=""links"">Dutch Interior</i></a></span> (1940) and a vigorous translation of Brian <a href=""entry://Merriman, Brian""><span class=""links"">Merriman's </span></a>
<i><a href=""entry://Cúirt an Mheán-Oíche""><span class=""links"">Cúirt an Mheán-Oíche</i></a></span>, as <i>The Midnight Court</i> (1945). Also proscribed were two volumes of short stories: <i>The Common Chord</i> (1947), a collection focused on the theme of love, and <i>Traveller's Samples</i> (1951). In 1951 he was invited to lecture in the USA, and there he married Harriet Rich . Out of his university teaching in America grew three critical works: <i>The Mirror in the Roadway</i> (1956), a study of the novel; <i>The Lonely Voice</i>, an analysis of the short story (1962); and <i>The Backward Look</i> (1967), a history of Irish literature from the earliest times.

<b>O'Donovan, Gerald</b> (baptized Jeremiah)<div class=""content""><i>(1871&ndash;1942),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> novelist. Born in Co. Down, the son of a travelling pierbuilder from Cork, he was educated in Maynooth and ordained in 1895. He left the priesthood in 1904 following disagreements with Thomas O'Dea, the conservative Bishop of Clonfert. Moving to Dublin and then London, he worked for the British propaganda department in the First World War and wrote a patriotic novel about the Home Front (<i>How They Did It</i>, 1920). His other novels are set in Ireland. The semi-autobiographical <i><a href=""entry://Father Ralph""><span class=""links"">Father Ralph</i></a></span> (1913) recounts the gradual disillusionment of an energetic and intelligent young priest who leaves the priesthood when the Pope condemns modernism. <i>Waiting</i> (1914) concerns the social ostracism of a Catholic who marries a Protestant. <i>Conquest</i> (1920) takes the form of dinner-table discussions on the <a href=""entry://Anglo-Irish War, the""><span class=""links"">Anglo-Irish War</span></a>, coming down on the side of Irish freedom. Other novels dealing with the obstacles to freedom of conscience are <i>Vocations</i> (1921) and <i>The Holy Tree</i> (1922).

<b>O'Faolain, Sean</b><div class=""content""><i>(1900&ndash;1991),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> man of letters. Born John Whelan in Cork city, into a family recently moved from the country. His father was a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary, while his mother ran a boarding house in Half Moon Street catering for artists working at the nearby Opera House. He was educated by the Presentation Brothers and was influenced by Daniel <a href=""entry://Corkery, Daniel""><span class=""links"">Corkery </span></a>, who cultivated his literary interests but whose cultural politics he later repudiated. In 1918 he entered UCC and became involved in the Republican movement. As a member of the <a href=""entry://Gaelic League""><span class=""links"">Gaelic League</span></a>, he visited the West Cork <a href=""entry://Gaeltacht""><span class=""links"">Gaeltacht</span></a>, taking cycling holidays with the slightly younger Frank <a href=""entry://O'Connor, Frank""><span class=""links"">O'Connor </span></a>. During these expeditions he met his future wife, Eileen Gould (<a href=""entry://O'Faolain, Eileen""><span class=""links"">O'Faoláin </span></a>). O'Faolain's childhood and formative years are described in his autobiography <i>Vive Moi</i> (1964). It recounts how he took the Republican side in the <a href=""entry://Civil War""><span class=""links"">Civil War</span></a>, becoming a director of propaganda for the <a href=""entry://IRA""><span class=""links"">IRA</span></a>. He returned to studies and took an MA at Harvard on a Commonwealth scholarship, 1926&ndash;9, marrying in Boston in 1928. A period was spent teaching at Strawberry Hill College in England before his return to Ireland as a writer in 1933. O'Faolain's early fiction arises from these experiences. <i>Midsummer Night Madness and Other Stories</i> (1932) draws on the initial romance of and later disillusionment with nationalist revolutionary activity. In the next phase, with a series of historical novels, <i>A Nest of Simple Folk</i> (1934), <i><a href=""entry://Bird Alone""><span class=""links"">Bird Alone</i></a></span> (1936), and <i>Come Back to Erin</i> (1940), he constructed a family saga extending from the <a href=""entry://Fenian movement""><span class=""links"">Fenian Rising</span></a> to the War of Independence and the years following. His fictional studies of idealism were paralleled by biographies of political figures in <i>Eamon <a href=""entry://De Valera, Eamon""><span class=""links"">de Valera</i></a></span> (1933, 1939); <i>The King of the Beggars</i> (1938), a life of Daniel <a href=""entry://O'Connell, Daniel""><span class=""links"">O'Connell </span></a>; and <i>The Great O'Neill</i> (1942), a life of Hugh <a href=""entry://O'Neill, Hugh""><span class=""links"">O'Neill </span></a>. In <i>Newman's Way</i> (1952) he found an opportunity to develop his own conception of a liberal tradition of Catholicism. <i>The Irish</i> (1948), a study of national character, brought together many of his ideas on tradition, culture, and the modern intellectual. His second volume of stories, <i>A Purse of Coppers</i> (1937), reflects the bleak conditions of life in Ireland in the 1930s. In <i>Teresa and Other Stories</i> (1947) and <i>The Man Who Invented Sin</i> (1949), a detached yet human perspective on Ireland emerges. In these and subsequent volumes (<i>I Remember, I Remember</i>, 1948; <i>The Heat of the Sun</i>, 1966; <i>The Talking Trees</i>, 1971; and <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, 1976) technique becomes more assured as moral awareness deepens. From 1940 to 1946 O'Faolain edited <i>The <a href=""entry://Bell, The""><span class=""links"">Bell</i></a></span>, the literary journal he founded, commissioning articles of a documentary and social nature while analysing aspects of contemporary life and thought in his editorials, which frequently lashed out against the cultural and religious climate of a period still dominated by the <a href=""entry://Censorship of Publications Act""><span class=""links"">Censorship Act</span></a> of 1928. His polemical hostility to traditionalism is evident in his impatience with the Catholic and Gaelic ideal of Ireland, and in his attacks on his mentor Daniel Corkery's attempt to formulate a criterion for literary value based on cultural identity. <i>The Collected Stories</i> appeared as three volumes (1980&ndash;2).

<i>Introduction to the Study of the History and Antiquities of Ireland</i> (1772) led him to undertake a thorough investigation of the extant sources of Irish myth and legend, and an ambitious series of legendary histories and fictions.

After the assassination of his father by Shane O'Neill (?1530&ndash;1567) in 1558, he was brought up by Sir Henry Sidney at Penshurst. He commanded a troop of horse against the Irish in the Desmond War in the 1570s. He secured his position against dynastic enemies in Ulster by building up a range of strategic connections with major Gaelic families, including his own marital alliance with the O'Donnells of Tír Conaill (Co. Donegal). In 1585 he was made Earl of Tyrone, but soon began to resist attempts to extend Tudor control over Ulster, making political overtures to Philip II of Spain. In 1592 he organized the escape of Red Hugh <a href=""entry://O'Donnell, Red Hugh""><span class=""links"">O'Donnell </span></a> from imprisonment in Dublin Castle. O'Neill continued an outward show of loyalty to the Crown, but in February 1595 he captured the Blackwater Fort, and was proclaimed a traitor. On 14 August 1598 O'Neill defeated and killed Sir Nicholas Bagenal at the Battle of the Yellow Ford. O'Neill now extended his authority through the midlands and into Munster, whilst O'Donnell consolidated Connacht. In September 1601, when the long-promised Spanish expeditionary force landed at Kinsale under Don Juan del Aquila, O'Neill was persuaded by O'Donnell to attempt to release the Spaniards from the siege laid by Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy and his Irish allies. A premature attack on Mountjoy's forces resulted in a rout by his cavalry and a long retreat back to Ulster through a hostile countryside. O'Neill's submission resulted in a lenient treaty. The expansion of English power in Ulster proceeded rapidly in the following years and O'Neill came under increasing suspicion as Rory O'Donnell and the Maguires continued their entanglement with Spain.

<b>O'Riordan, Conal Holmes O'Connell</b>
<i>(pseudonym ‘F. Norrys Connell ’)</i><div class=""content""><i>(1874&ndash;1948),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> playwright and novelist. Born in Dublin, the son of a QC, and educated at Belvedere and Clongowes Wood College, he was prevented from following an army career by a horse-riding injury. His early fiction reveals an indifference to social convention. <i>In the Green Park</i> (1894), a short-story collection, comprises tales of Greek deities transported to a London club in the hallucinated imaginings of a concussed man. <i>Strange Women</i> (1895) is a tangled novel of upper-class bohemian life with an energetic Foreign Legion plot. Other books were <i>The Fool and His Heart</i> (1896), <i>How Soldiers Fight</i> (1899), <i>The Nigger Knights</i> (1900), <i>The Follies of Captain Daly</i> (1901), and <i>The Pity of War</i> (1906). Among three short plays for the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a> was <i>The Piper</i> (1908), a humane critique of Irish nationalism set in 1798. After <a href=""entry://Synge, [Edmund] J[ohn] M[illington]""><span class=""links"">Synge's </span></a> death O'Riordan was appointed theatre-manager at the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey</span></a>. During the First World War he went to the front with the YMCA rest units. On his return he commenced working on twelve novels tracing the history of an upper-middle-class Irish family. He started with the <i>‘Adam’</i> series (<i>Adam of Dublin</i>, 1920; <i>Adam and Caroline</i>, 1921; and <i>Adam and Marriage</i>, 1922) before turning to the chronologically earlier <i>‘Soldier’</i> series (comprising chiefly <i>Soldier of Waterloo</i>, 1928; <i>Soldier's Wife</i>, 1935; and <i>Soldier's End</i>, 1938). Others in the series deal chiefly with loveless marriages, as in <i>The Age of Miracles</i> (1925), <i>Judith Quinn</i> (1939), and <i>Judith's Love</i> (1940)."

The characters of the ogam alphabet had names taken from trees, where e.g. b, signified by a single stroke, was known as beithe (birch), or s, signified by four strokes, was known as sail (willow).

When old Mahon appears, they turn upon their hero despite his offer to ‘slay his da’ a second time. Escaping from their clutches, he tames his father, and the two leave the stage disdainful of the gullible Mayo peasants. The play was condemned by nationalists as a travesty of western Irish life, and treated as a <a href=""entry://stage-Irishman""><span class=""links"">stage-Irish</span></a> libel evoking a peasantry of alcoholics and fantasists rather than a people ready to assume self-government."

In a series of political poems written <i>c.</i>1640&ndash;60 the fortunes of the Catholic Church are linked inextricably with the fortunes of the body politic. The enemy, who is destined to be driven from Ireland, is identified as being both Protestant and English-speaking. In these poems, represented in Cecile O'Rahilly's edition (see below), a communal voice emerges, the narrator speaking in the first person plural on behalf of a dispossessed people. One of their constant sources of hope was the house of Stuart. To the poets of the 1680s, witnessing the unprecedented reforms, implemented by <a href=""entry://James II""><span class=""links"">James II</span></a>, it seemed that a prophecy was being fulfilled. To Dáibhí <a href=""entry://Ó Bruadair, Dáibhí""><span class=""links"">Ó Bruadair </span></a> it was evident that the Irish now ‘had a real king’. In exile in France James assumed an idealized role as the perfect Irish king destined to return and save his people. His son and grandson also inherited that role, and for most of the 18th cent, the main focus of Irish political poetry was the house of Stuart and the Jacobite cause.

In 1820 the Covent Garden manager, Henry Harris, bought the theatrical patent and built the Theatre Royal (later Royal Theatre), Hawkins St., Dublin. It opened in 1821 with a performance of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>. From 1871 the Royal Theatre was rivalled by the Gaiety. Theatre on King St. under the management of the brothers John and Michael Gunn (opening with <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>); and following a disastrous fire at the ‘Old’ Royal in 1880 the Hawkins St. building remained derelict until reopened by a consortium in 1897. The Gaiety stuck to its well-tried popular repertory of melodramas, comedies, and musicals, though both theatres scheduled touring opera companies throughout the year. At the Queen's Royal Theatre&mdash;first opened on Great Brunswick St. (now Pearse St.) as the Adelphi in 1829 and rebuilt in 1844&mdash;there emerged a national theatre in the sense that the political melodramas mounted by the English actor-manager J. W. <a href=""entry://Whitbread, J[ames] W[illiam]""><span class=""links"">Whitbread</span></a> between 1880 and 1907 attracted Dublin audiences with a mixture of patriotism and theatricality.

"Protestantism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Protestantism</b>.<div class=""content"">In 16th-cent. England the State successfully sponsored the realignment, over two generations, of popular religious allegiances. In Gaelic Ireland, the Reformation made virtually no headway. The <a href=""entry://Old English""><span class=""links"">Old English</span></a> of the Pale [see <a href=""entry://Irish State""><span class=""links"">Irish State</span></a>], a conservative provincial élite, were willing to accept royal supremacy, but showed little enthusiasm for reformed doctrine and liturgy. Even within the Church of Ireland, many of the first generation of clergy were no more than nominal adherents to the new faith. In the decades that followed the <a href=""entry://plantation""><span class=""links"">plantations</span></a> of Munster and Ulster, the Church of Ireland made little attempt to break out of its minority status. The growing numbers of Scots settling in Ulster brought Presbyterianism with them. The restoration of monarchy in 1660 meant a renewal of an episcopal Church of Ireland. Dissent in the three southern provinces, still seen as a major problem in the 1660s, thereafter dwindled into insignificance. Quakers now shed their radical origins to become a prosperous, largely self-contained sect. After 1691 the Government sponsored around twenty small colonies of Huguenots, refugees from France. A second immigrant sect were the Palatines, Protestant refugees from the Rhineland, who arrived in 1709. The shrinkage of dissent in the south was not matched in Ulster, where Presbyterians, already by the mid-17th cent. the largest single denomination, continued to grow in numbers and strength. Yet relations with the established Church remained tense. Much of the party conflict of Whig and Tory in these years centred on the question of whether it was Catholics or dissenters that presented the greater threat to the established Church. The sacramental test, introduced in 1704 and not repealed until 1780, excluded Presbyterians as well as Catholics from offices of trust or profit under the Crown. But the radicalism of the Ulster <a href=""entry://United Irishmen""><span class=""links"">United Irishmen</span></a> in the 1790s, and the vitality of Ulster Liberalism up to the Home Rule crisis of 1885&ndash;6 [see <a href=""entry://Irish Parliamentary Party""><span class=""links"">Irish Parliamentary Party</span></a>], were based in part on continued Presbyterian antipathy towards what they perceived as an Anglican-dominated establishment. The Church of Ireland of the 18th cent. enjoyed both wealth and legal privilege, while serving only one-eighth or so of the population. Lower-class members were thinly scattered in the rural south, but were more numerous in Ulster, and also in many of the towns of Munster and Leinster; Dublin was, up to the middle of the century, a predominantly Protestant city. Following a tradition established by Archbishop James <a href=""entry://Ussher, James""><span class=""links"">Ussher </span></a> in the 1620s, historians emphasized the continuity between the Church of Ireland and the early Christian Church, appropriating to themselves the idealized image of an island of saints and scholars. All denominations of Irish Protestantism were affected, from the end of the 18th cent., by movements of religious revival. John Wesley visited Ireland twenty-one times between 1747 and 1789 and Irish Methodism continued to expand rapidly in the early 19th cent. From Samuel <a href=""entry://Ferguson, Sir Samuel""><span class=""links"">Ferguson </span></a> and his colleagues in the <i>‘Orange Young Ireland’</i> of the 1840s to <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a> and other participants in the <a href=""entry://literary revival""><span class=""links"">literary revival</span></a>, there were repeated attempts to construct a historical and cultural tradition that would reconcile Protestantism and Irishness. At another level there was a ruthless and pragmatic struggle to maintain privilege. After 1922 this formerly dominant minority found themselves in an <a href=""entry://Irish State""><span class=""links"">Irish State</span></a> whose official ideology advanced the interests of the Catholic majority. Between 1926 and 1971 the Protestant population of independent Ireland fell by more than 40 percent, partly as a result of the tough line taken by the Catholic Church on the upbringing of children of religiously mixed marriages (<i>Ne Temere</i>). In Northern Ireland, meanwhile, Unionism continued to appeal to an explicitly Protestant identity, reinforced by the threat, real and imagined, of Catholic nationalism.

<b>Reid, Forrest</b><div class=""content""><i>(1875&ndash;1947),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> novelist; born in Belfast, educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institute and then apprenticed to the tea trade before going to Cambridge, where he was encouraged to write by E. M. Forster . The fifteen books that he produced after his return to Belfast were chiefly fictional and autobiographical studies of boyhood and adolescence. The earlier of two autobiographies, <i>Apostate</i> (1926), reveals a rebellious disdain for middleclass Protestant ethics. The earliest novel, <i>The Kingdom of Twilight</i> (1904), elicited detailed comments from Henry James, who repudiated the dedication of his next (<i>The Garden God</i>, 1905) because of its homosexual overtones. During the next four decades, Reid lived privately in Belfast and established himself as a noted stylist. <i><a href=""entry://Cheyney, Peter""><span class=""links"">Peter Waring</i></a></span> (1937) is a radical revision of the earlier <i>Following Darkness</i> of 1912, which tells of a boy's troubled upbringing. <i>The Bracknels: A Family Chronicle</i> (1911), rewritten as Denis Bracknel in 1947, portrays a harsh father. <i><a href=""entry://Brian Westby""><span class=""links"">Brian</i></a> Westby</span> (1934) tells of the reunion of a father and his teenage son from whom he has been separated by divorce. In the <a href=""entry://Tom Barber trilogy""><span class=""links"">Tom Barber</span></a> novels a boy's life is examined at successively earlier stages (Uncle Stephen, 1931; <i>The Retreat</i>, 1936; and Young Tom, 1944). <i>At the Door of the Gate</i> (1915) is his one novel about working-class Belfast. A second autobiography, <i>Private Road</i> (1940) describes Reid's meeting and discussions with George <a href=""entry://Russell, George [William]""><span class=""links"">Russell </span></a>."

His other collections continued more or less in this vein, and include <i>The Earth Breath and Other Poems</i> (1897), <i>The Divine Vision and Other Poems</i> (1904), and <i>Collected Poems</i> (1913). In 1897 Russell joined Sir Horace <a href=""entry://Plunkett, Sir Horace""><span class=""links"">Plunkett's </span></a> Irish Agricultural Organization Society (IAOS), supervising the setting-up of co-operative banks in the west of Ireland. His version of <i>Deirdre</i> (1902), performed by the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre's</span></a> precursor, had Constance <a href=""entry://Markievicz, Countess Constance""><span class=""links"">Markievicz </span></a> in the title-role. He edited <i>The <a href=""entry://Irish Homestead, The""><span class=""links"">Irish Homestead</i></a></span>, the journal of the IAOS, 1905&ndash;23, using its columns to encourage many young writers, including Padraic <a href=""entry://Colum, Padraic""><span class=""links"">Colum </span></a>, Seumas <a href=""entry://O'Sullivan, Seumas""><span class=""links"">O'Sullivan </span></a>, and Eva <a href=""entry://Gore-Booth, Eva [Selena]""><span class=""links"">Gore-Booth </span></a>. In ‘On Behalf of Some Irishmen Not Followers of Tradition’, he attacked the deployment of myth to enlist nationalist feelings, a poem fiercely criticized by Joseph Mary <a href=""entry://Plunkett, Joseph Mary""><span class=""links"">Plunkett </span></a> in 1913. In that year he supported the Dublin Strikers during the Lock-out [see James <a href=""entry://Larkin, James""><span class=""links"">Larkin </span></a>]. The outbreak of the First World War seemed to confirm man's severance from the sources of wisdom, and <i>Gods of War, With Other Poems</i> (1915) challenges the prevailing war fever. <i>The National Being</i> (1916) presents a synthesis of his ideas on non-militant nationalism, spiritual concerns, and idealistic principles. Other prose works include <i>The Candle of Vision</i> (1918), a collection of essays describing his inner life. Two novels, <i>The <a href=""entry://Interpreters, The""><span class=""links"">Interpreters</i></a></span> (1922) and <i>The Avatars</i> (1933), outline his spiritual message. In 1922 he became editor of <i>The <a href=""entry://Irish Statesman, The""><span class=""links"">Irish Statesman</i></a></span>, which incorporated <i>The Irish Homestead</i>, and continued in that role until 1930. He went on writing poems and prose, publishing collections such as <i>Enchantment and Other Poems</i> (1930) and <i>The House of the Titans and Other Poems</i> (1934). The prose work, <i>Song and Its Fountains</i> (1932), continues the enquiry begun in <i>The Candle of Vision</i>. Escaping from a ‘nation run by louts’ he went to live in England after 1933, first in London and then in Bournemouth.See <p class=""blk"">&nbsp;Summerfield, <i>That Myriad-Minded Man: A Biography of G.

Such protest was generally the work of small local groups, linked by no more than the adoption of a common name&mdash;Whiteboys, Oakboys, Steelboys, Threshers, Carders, Cravats, Rockites, Terry Alts &mdash;or at most by the transmission from place to place of an oath of association.

"Shaw, George Bernard","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Shaw, George Bernard</b><div class=""content""><i>(1856&ndash;1950),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> playwright; born in Dublin, he was the third child of a down-at-heel family with pretensions to respectability. Shaw detested the several schools he attended. In 1876, he moved to London where his mother had been living for some years, in flight from an alcoholic marriage. He wrote five novels in four years, 1879&ndash;83: <i>Immaturity, The Irrational Knot, Love Among the Artists, Cashel Byron's Profession</i>, and <i>An Unsocial Socialist</i>. During his early years in London he was converted to socialism and became a vegetarian in 1881 after reading a tract by Shelley . In 1884 he joined the Fabian Society. He had an affair with Jenny Patterson, who subsequently became jealous of rivals such as the actress Florence Farr . <i>The <a href=""entry://Philanderer, The""><span class=""links"">Philanderer</i></a></span>, written in 1893, draws on Shaw's experiences in this triangular relationship. In 1898, aged 42, he married Charlotte Payne-Townshend, a cousin of Edith <a href=""entry://Somerville, Edith Œnone""><span class=""links"">Somerville </span></a>. Shaw's literary reputation was first established as a music, art, and theatre critic for various London periodicals. He frequently invoked the plays of Ibsen as a foil to the banality of contemporary English drama. A lecture of 1890 was published in expanded form as <i>The Quintessence of Ibsenism</i> (1891). Another early hero of Shaw's was Wagner, about whom he wrote <i>The Perfect Wagnerite</i> (1898), a treatise on <i>The Ring</i>. Shaw's career as a playwright began in 1892 with <i><a href=""entry://Widowers' Houses""><span class=""links"">Widowers' Houses</i></a></span>. By 1896 he had completed the seven plays which were gathered under the title <i>Plays Pleasant and Unpleasant</i> (1898). The three further works completed by the end of the century were published as <i><a href=""entry://Three Plays for Puritans""><span class=""links"">Three Plays for Puritans</i></a></span> (1901). <i><a href=""entry://Arms and the Man""><span class=""links"">Arms and the Man</i></a></span> (1894), the first of the ‘plays pleasant’, had its première at Florence Farr's Avenue Theatre with W. B. <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats's </span></a>
<i>The Land of Heart's Desire</i> as a curtain-raiser. In <i>Three Plays for Puritans</i> he attacked a narrow and unimaginative conception of religion, making the wrathfully vindictive Mrs Dudgeon in <i>The <a href=""entry://Devil's Disciple, The""><span class=""links"">Devil's Disciple</i></a></span> (1897) an epitome of joyless and rigid Puritanism. During 1901&ndash;2 Shaw began the composition of <i><a href=""entry://Man and Superman""><span class=""links"">Man and Superman</i></a></span> (1905), which explored his new ‘religion’ of Creative Evolution. He adopted the notion of the Life Force as a response to the 19th-cent. debates concerning will, power, evolutionism, and the role of the individual in thinkers such as Nietzsche, Darwin, and later Bergson . Shaw's reputation increased markedly in the first decade of the 20th cent. <i><a href=""entry://John Bull's Other Island""><span class=""links"">John Bull's Other Island</i></a></span> (1904), <i><a href=""entry://Major Barbara""><span class=""links"">Major Barbara</i></a></span> (1905), and <i>The <a href=""entry://Doctor's Dilemma, The""><span class=""links"">Doctor's Dilemma</i></a></span> (1906) were all produced at the Court Theatre by the actor-manager Harley Granville-Barker. <i>John Bull's Other Island</i>, originally commissioned by Yeats for the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey</span></a>, was not produced there for political reasons, but when <i>The <a href=""entry://Shewing-up of Blanco Posnet, The""><span class=""links"">Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet</i></a></span> (1909) was banned in England, it was staged at the Dublin theatre. <i><a href=""entry://Pygmalion: A Romance in Five Acts""><span class=""links"">Pygmalion</i></a></span> (written 1912) crowned his success in the prewar period. His love affair with the ‘perilously bewitching’ Mrs Patrick Campbell began in 1912. Her captivating but often exasperating personality is reflected in the characters of Hesione in <i><a href=""entry://Heartbreak House""><span class=""links"">Heartbreak House</i></a></span> (1921), the Serpent in <i><a href=""entry://Back to Methuselah""><span class=""links"">Back to Methusaleh</i></a></span> (1923), and Orinthia in <i>The <a href=""entry://Apple Cart, The:""><span class=""links"">Apple Cart</i></a></span> (1929). Immediately after the outbreak of the First World War, Shaw wrote the polemical essay, <i>Common Sense About the War</i> (1914), in which he attacked the official British rationale for entry into the struggle. Shaw's outspoken criticism of the execution of the leaders of the <a href=""entry://Easter Rising""><span class=""links"">Easter Rising</span></a> did little to commend him to British public opinion. His major creative achievement in the war years was <i><a href=""entry://Heartbreak House""><span class=""links"">Heartbreak House</i></a></span>, written in the atmosphere of doom evoked by Zeppelin air raids on civilian targets in London and other English cities. The horror of the war left a deep imprint on <i><a href=""entry://Back to Methuselah""><span class=""links"">Back to Methusaleh</i></a>: A Metabiological Pentateuch</span> (1922). In the 1920s <i><a href=""entry://Saint Joan""><span class=""links"">Saint Joan</i></a></span> (1923) was acclaimed on both sides of the Atlantic, and in 1925 Shaw was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. The political character of <i>The Apple Cart</i> (1928) is partly explained by the fact that he had been engaged in writing <i>The <a href=""entry://Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism, The""><span class=""links"">Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism</i></a></span> (1928) since 1925. Many of Shaw's later plays are remarkable for their experimental character. Plays such as <i><a href=""entry://Geneva""><span class=""links"">Geneva</i></a></span> (1936), portraying the age of Fascist ideologies, reveal a sense of near despair about national and international political organizations. He died following an illness precipitated by a fall from an apple-tree he was pruning in his garden at Ayot St Lawrence. Most of the plays of Shaw's early and middle period, up to and including <i>Heartbreak House</i>, were developed from the mould of late 19th-cent. naturalism. With the science fiction scenario of <i>Back to Methuselah</i>, Shaw entered the final phase of his play-writing career. In later plays such as <i><a href=""entry://Too True to be Good""><span class=""links"">Too True to Be Good</i></a></span> (1931) fantastic incidents become increasingly common. Whereas the characters in Shaw's early and middle plays are drawn with psychological insight, in later work the characterization tends towards allegory and cartoon. As an iconoclast with an Irish sense of distance from the English life he enjoyed and mocked, he employed his gifts in the exposure of humbug and hypocrisy in his time, and in the subversion of sanctimonious value systems. A Shaw play leaves not so much the sense of a proven thesis as an awareness of open-ended possibilities and irreducible complexity, and of the depth, subtlety, and humour of his treatment of human relationships.

He was educated at Samuel <a href=""entry://Whyte, Samuel""><span class=""links"">Whyte's</span></a> school in Dublin. The family moved in 1770 to Bath, where his observations of social life provided him with the mainstay of his comedies. In the following year he eloped to France with Elizabeth Ann Linley, and married her while both were minors. Sheridan began writing for the stage to make money. His first play, <i>The <a href=""entry://Rivals, The""><span class=""links"">Rivals</i></a></span> (1775), was successful, and this was followed in the same year by <i><a href=""entry://St. Patrick's Day""><span class=""links"">St. Patrick's Day</i></a></span>, a farce, and then by <i>The <a href=""entry://Duenna, The""><span class=""links"">Duenna</i></a></span>, a comic opera.

In 1776 he bought out David Garrick's half-share in Drury Lane with borrowed money and became its manager.

Sheridan was ruined when Drury Lane burnt down in 1809.

His earliest plays, written as <i>‘George Morshiel’</i>, were performed by the <a href=""entry://Ulster Literary Theatre""><span class=""links"">Ulster Literary Theatre</span></a>. His association with the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>, begun in 1921 with the one-act <i>Bedmates</i>, continued with some thirty plays. Early work such as <i>Paul Twyning</i> (1922), <i>Professor Tim</i> (1925), <i>Cartney and Kevney</i> (1927), and <i>Grogan and the Ferret</i> (1933) are comedies, though often with a sardonic edge which Abbey productions generally down-played. From about the mid-1930s the satirical aspect of his work became more pronounced, notably in <i>The Passing Day</i> (1936). A major theme of Shiel's drama is the conflict between traditional habits of feeling and modern values, a tension that dominates <i>The New Gossoon</i> (1930). <i>The Rugged Path</i> (1940) and its sequel, <i>The Summit</i> (1941), are more serious plays, showing how the Dolis clan arouses atavistic fears in order to bully the progressive farmers in the valley. Shiels's plays were conventionally realistic in form, though the use of stark situations often makes a disconcerting impact."

By the time of Violet's death in 1915, they had collaborated on five novels (<i>An Irish Cousin</i>, 1889; <i><a href=""entry://Naboth's Vineyard""><span class=""links"">Naboth's Vineyard</i></a></span>, 1891; <i>The <a href=""entry://Real Charlotte, The""><span class=""links"">Real Charlotte</i></a></span>, 1894; <i>The Silver Fox</i>, 1898; and <i>Dan Russel the Fox</i>, 1911), and had achieved fame as the authors of the <i>‘Irish R.M.’</i> stories, issued in three separate volumes (<i><a href=""entry://Some Experiences of an Irish R.M.""><span class=""links"">Some Experiences of an Irish R.M.</i></a></span>, 1899; <i>Further Experiences of an Irish R.M.</i>, 1908; and <i>In Mr. Knox's Country</i>, 1915).

"Spenser, Edmund","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Spenser, Edmund</b><div class=""content""><i>(?1552&ndash;1599),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> poet. Born in London, he studied at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, and was briefly in the service of <a href=""entry://Elizabeth I""><span class=""links"">Elizabeth</span></a> I's favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. <i>The Shepheardes Calendar</i> (1579), marked the arrival of a poet of even greater promise than Philip Sidney, to whom the poem is dedicated. In 1580 he became secretary to Arthur Grey, Lord Wilton, Viceroy of Ireland, and accompanied him to Dublin. Grey was recalled after two years, charged with cruel and dishonourable conduct against the Irish. Spenser never wavered in his support for the methods used to suppress the Desmond Rebellion. After Grey's disgrace he stayed on to become clerk to the council of the Munster <a href=""entry://plantation""><span class=""links"">plantation</span></a> and later Sheriff of Cork. Spenser's rank secured him Kilcolman Castle with a large estate near Doneraile in Co. Cork, granted in 1586 and confirmed in 1590. There he lived with his family from 1588 to October 1598, when his home was burnt down by the Earl of Desmond during Hugh <a href=""entry://O'Neill, Hugh""><span class=""links"">O'Neill's </span></a> rebellion. He died shortly after his return to London and was buried in Westminster Abbey. While living in Ireland Spenser wrote <i>The Faerie Queene</i> (I&ndash;III, 1590; IV&ndash;VI, 1596), the first great English poem since Chaucer, as well as most of his other works. <i>Colin Clouts Come Home Againe</i> (1595) expresses his pleasure at coming home to Kilcolman after seeing the first volumes of <i>The Faerie Queene</i> through the press in London. <i>Amoretti and Epithalamion</i> (1595), a sonnet sequence and marriage-poem, celebrates his wedding to Elizabeth Boyle in 1594, and evokes the topography of Cork city and county in one of the masterpieces of English Renaissance poetry. <i>The Faerie Queene</i> comprises a series of allegorical quests by knights who symbolize the Protestant virtues (temperance, etc.) and who encounter magicians, sorceresses, and wicked Saracens intent on diverting them from their duty. Ireland and its conflicts are present in different ways in the poem: in Arthegall, Knight of Justice in Book v, who embodies Lord Grey's attributes; in the pastoral landscapes of VI, derived from the rivers and mountains around Kilcolman; and in the cannibals, also in VI, who are part Irish kerns (soldiers for hire), part Virginian savages. The ‘Mutabilitie Cantos’, which are all that survive of the seventh book, are set on Galtee-more (called Arlo by Spenser, after Aherlow ), in the Galtee mountain range. In <i>A <a href=""entry://View of the Present State of Ireland, A""><span class=""links"">View of the Present State of Ireland</i></a></span> (1596) Spenser associates the most culpable form of degeneracy not with the native Irish but with the Old English, who have adopted their language, laws, and customs. Ireland provided Spenser with wealth and leisure enough to enable him to write the greatest English Renaissance epic."

"stage-Irishman","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stage-Irishman</b>,<div class=""content"">a term for stereotypical Irish characters on the English-language stage from the 17th cent., also applied to characters in fiction in whom Irish national characteristics are emphasized or distorted. As a product of colonialism, the first stage-Irishman reflected a desire to stigmatize the native Irish as savages or anathematize them as traitors, while later versions sought more commonly to provide amusement to English audiences by exaggerating the traits which differentiated the Irish from the English. His chief identifying marks were disorderly manners and insalubrious habits, together with the <a href=""entry://Hiberno-English""><span class=""links"">Hiberno-English</span></a> dialect or brogue and a concomitant propensity for illogical utterance increasingly identified as his exclusive property and called ‘the Irish bull’. <i>The <a href=""entry://Irish Hudibras, The""><span class=""links"">Irish Hudibras</i></a></span> (1689) by James Farewell and its companion piece, <i><a href=""entry://Hesperi-Neso-Graphia""><span class=""links"">Hesperi-Neso-Graphia</i></a></span> (1716), are key texts in the evolution of the stereotype. To these ludicrous features was added an intense and seemingly inapposite pride in his native country. A small number of Irishmen are to be found in plays by Shakespeare and his contemporaries, the best known of these being Captain Macmorris in <i>Henry V</i>. The stage-Irish stereotype first emerged after the Restoration of the English-monarchy with Teg in Sir Robert Howard's <i>Committee</i> (1662). In late 17th- and 18th-cent, plays by authors such as Thomas D'Urfey, George Powell, John Durant Brevel, and Moses Mendez, the names of stage-Irishmen such as MacBuffle, Mactawdry, Mackafartey, and Machone, as well as Phaelim O'Blunder and a beggarwoman called Bet Botheram O'Balderdash, all indicate the chronic deprecation of Irish identity in metro-politan Britain during the period following the <a href=""entry://Williamite War""><span class=""links"">Williamite War</span></a>. Numerous stage-Irishmen were created by play-wrights from Ireland such as Isaac <a href=""entry://Bickerstaff[e], Isaac""><span class=""links"">Bickerstaffe </span></a>, Hugh <a href=""entry://Kelly, Hugh""><span class=""links"">Kelly </span></a>, John <a href=""entry://O'Keeffe, John""><span class=""links"">O'Keeffe </span></a>, and Richard Brinsley <a href=""entry://Sheridan, Richard Brinsley""><span class=""links"">Sheridan </span></a>, often inventing obsequious and ridiculous characters in order to ingratiate themselves with London audiences. In <i><a href=""entry://Love à la Mode""><span class=""links"">Love á la Mode</i></a></span> (1759) Charles <a href=""entry://Macklin, Charles""><span class=""links"">Macklin </span></a> added Sir Callaghan O'Brallaghan to the repertoire of loyalist Hibernians. He followed this with <i>The <a href=""entry://True-Born Irishman, The""><span class=""links"">True-Born Irishman</i></a>, or The Irish Fine Lady</span> (1762), a play which demonstrated the possibility of taking pride in Irish origins. Cultural patriotism was again attempted in <i>Variety</i> (1782) by Richard <a href=""entry://Griffith, Richard""><span class=""links"">Griffith </span></a>. As political and economic conditions in Ireland deteriorated throughout the 19th cent. a stereotype evolved in which the apparent vagaries of the Irish peasant were served up in a racist concoction known as ‘Irish drama’. In the Victorian period several authors successfully exploited their Irish background to produce such regional characters as Samuel <a href=""entry://Lover, Samuel""><span class=""links"">Lover's </span></a>
<i><a href=""entry://Rory O'More""><span class=""links"">Rory O'More</i></a></span> (1837) and <i><a href=""entry://Handy Andy""><span class=""links"">Handy Andy</i></a></span> (1842). From Charles <a href=""entry://Lever, Charles [James]""><span class=""links"">Lever </span></a> to <a href=""entry://Somerville, Edith Œnone""><span class=""links"">Somerville </span></a> and Ross, sketches of rural buffoonery made up a recurrent element in Irish writing. Not all successful images of the Irish peasant were so demeaning. Boucicault created <i><a href=""entry://Arrah-na-Pogue""><span class=""links"">Arrah-na-Pogue</i></a></span> (1864) around an Irish peasant whom audiences would laugh with rather than at. In <i><a href=""entry://John Bull's Other Island""><span class=""links"">John Bull's Other Island</i></a></span> (1904) George Bernard <a href=""entry://Shaw, George Bernard""><span class=""links"">Shaw </span></a> pronounced authoritatively on the extravagances of the stereotype.

<b>Stuart, [Henry] Francis [Montgomery]</b><div class=""content""><i>(1902&ndash;2000),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> novelist. Born Townsville, Australia, of Ulster parents, he was educated at Rugby School in England. In 1920 he married Iseult Gonne, daughter of Maud <a href=""entry://Gonne, Maud""><span class=""links"">Gonne </span></a>, and took part in the <a href=""entry://Civil War""><span class=""links"">Civil War</span></a> on the Republican side. He was interned at the Curragh until November 1923. <i>We Have Kept the Faith</i> (1924, enlarged 1992), a small collection of poems, was selected by W. B. <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a> for an award. Stuart's first novel, <i>Women and God</i> (1931), explores the way that Irish society is being eroded by increasing materialism. The next two novels, <i><a href=""entry://Pigeon Irish""><span class=""links"">Pigeon Irish</i></a></span> (1932) and <i>The <a href=""entry://Coloured Dome, The""><span class=""links"">Coloured Dome</i></a></span> (1932) explore the role of the outcast and the redemptive value of suffering. In 1933 <i>Men Crowd Me Round</i> was performed at the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>. <i>Things to Live For</i> (1934) is an account of events which helped to shape his philosophy and beliefs. Of the novels published in the years leading up to the war, <i>The <a href=""entry://White Hare, The""><span class=""links"">White Hare</i></a></span> (1936), <i>The Bridge</i> (1937), <i>Julie</i> (1938), and <i>The Great Squire</i> (1939), the first two show real artistic merit. By 1939 Stuart's career had reached a low ebb and he accepted a lecturing post at Berlin University, despite the onset of war. Stuart agreed, in 1942, to broadcast from wartime Germany to Ireland. His weekly talks, dealing with literary subjects and Irish politics, continued until 1944. Shortly after the war, Stuart and his companion Gertrud (‘Madeleine’) Meissner, whom he later married, were arrested by French forces and imprisoned until July 1946. Stuart wrote a trilogy of novels, <i>The <a href=""entry://Pillar of Cloud, The""><span class=""links"">Pillar of Cloud</i></a></span> (1948), <i><a href=""entry://Redemption""><span class=""links"">Redemption</i></a></span>, (1949), and <i>The <a href=""entry://Flowering Cross, The""><span class=""links"">Flowering Cross</i></a></span> (1950), which drew on these experiences and display a brooding intensity. Following a move to London in 1952, Stuart published five novels, <i>Good Friday's Daughter</i> (1952), <i>The Chariot</i> (1953), <i>The Pilgrimage</i> (1955), <i>Victors and Vanquished</i> (1958), and <i>The Angels of Providence</i> (1959). Returning to Ireland he began to work on a ‘memoir in fictional form’. The publication of <i><a href=""entry://Black List, Section H""><span class=""links"">Black List, Section H</i></a></span> (1971) heralded a new phase in Stuart's career. Merging fact and fantasy, Stuart updates old themes and turns from a mystical to a neurological quest. The success of <i>Black List, Section H</i> encouraged Stuart to write a more experimental form of fiction, and to explore the obsessive, alogical nature of minds like his own. <i><a href=""entry://Memorial""><span class=""links"">Memorial</i></a></span> (1973), <i>A <a href=""entry://Hole in the Head, A""><span class=""links"">Hole in the Head</i></a></span> (1977), <i>The <a href=""entry://High Consistory, The""><span class=""links"">High Consistory</i></a></span> (1981), <i>Faillandia</i> (1985), and <i>A <a href=""entry://Compendium of Lovers, A""><span class=""links"">Compendium of Lovers</i></a></span> (1990) use structural and narrative techniques to undermine the reliability of the text.

"Swift, Jonathan","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Swift, Jonathan</b><div class=""content""><i>(1667&ndash;1745),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> man of letters. Born in Dublin, he was educated at Kilkenny School and TCD. In 1689 he left Ireland and became personal secretary to Sir William Temple, a retired diplomat. He lived with him at Moor Park, Surrey, where he met Esther Johnson (<a href=""entry://‘Stella’""><span class=""links"">‘Stella’</span></a>). In 1694 he took holy orders and was appointed to Kilroot, Co. Antrim, where he began <i>A <a href=""entry://Tale of a Tub, A""><span class=""links"">Tale of a Tub</i></a></span> (1704), an attack on religious extremism. In 1699 Swift returned to Dublin, where he served as chaplain to the Earl of Berkeley, and obtained the vicarage of Laracor, Co Meath, the following year. In 1701 he published <i>Contests and Dissensions between the Nobles and the Commons in Athens and Rome</i>, supporting a system of checks and balances in government. In 1707 he wrote <i>The <a href=""entry://Story of the Injured Lady, The""><span class=""links"">Story of the Injured Lady</i></a></span> (1746), protesting that the Union between England and Scotland of that year was a betrayal of Ireland in favour of Scotland. In 1710 he was courted by the new Tory ministry, and began the <i>Journal to Stella</i> (1766&ndash;8). Over the next three years Swift worked for the Tories, taking on the editorship of <i>The Examiner</i> (1710&ndash;11), a weekly paper, and writing essays defending government foreign policy, such as <i>The Conduct of the Allies</i> (1711). While in London he met Esther Vanhomrigh, whom he later named ‘Vanessa ’ [<i>see <a href=""entry://Cadenus and Vanessa""><span class=""links"">Cadenus and Vanessa</i></a></span>]. He was also introduced to Alexander Pope and enjoyed the literary company of the Scriblerus Club. Swift reluctantly accepted the Deanery of St. Patrick's having hoped for an English post. After six years of relative silence Swift produced <i>A <a href=""entry://Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture, A""><span class=""links"">Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture</i></a></span> (1720), the first of many anonymous pamphlets by the new Dean on Irish affairs. He also began work on <i><a href=""entry://Gulliver's Travels""><span class=""links"">Gulliver's Travels</i></a></span>, but in 1724 this was interrupted by the controversy over Wood's half-pence, to which Swift contributed the famous <i><a href=""entry://Drapier's Letters, The""><span class=""links"">Drapier's Letters</i></a></span>, earning him the contemporary title of ‘<a href=""entry://Hibernian Nights' Entertainments, The""><span class=""links"">Hibernian Patriot</span></a>’. In 1726 he visited London with a copy of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, which was published in October of that year. <i>A Short View of the State of Ireland</i> (1728) expresses deep pessimism in relation to Ireland's unstable economy. He continued to write polemical pamphlets, the most bitter of which, <i>A <a href=""entry://Modest Proposal, A""><span class=""links"">Modest Proposal</i></a></span>, appeared in 1729. He spent increasing amounts of time with friends outside Dublin, especially with Thomas <a href=""entry://Sheridan, Thomas (the Elder)""><span class=""links"">Sheridan </span></a> (the Elder) at Quilca, Co. Cavan. Together they produced <i>The Intelligencer</i> (1729), a weekly paper on literary, economic, and social topics. With the author's assistance, George <a href=""entry://Faulkner, George""><span class=""links"">Faulkner </span></a> published the first edition of Swift's <i>Works</i> in 1735. In 1742 he was declared ‘of unsound mind and memory’, and for the next three years he was looked after by close friends. Although he repeatedly referred to himself as ‘an Englishman born in Ireland’, he came to feel increasingly alienated from, and vengeful towards, England.

"Synge, [Edmund] J[ohn] M[illington]","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Synge, [Edmund] J[ohn] M[illington]</b><div class=""content""><i>(1871&ndash;1909),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> playwright. Born in Rathfarnham, Co. Dublin, to a family of ecclesiastics and landowners. In childhood Synge began to study Charles Darwin, and found it increasingly difficult to accept his mother's religious outlook. Educated at TCD, where he learnt Irish, his interest in the language was rewarded with the Irish Prize (1892). He travelled to Germany, where he studied music; but, turning to literature, he settled in Paris in 1895. He attended lectures on Celtic civilization given by Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville at the Sorbonne, and wrote criticism for various journals. In 1896 in Paris Synge met W. B. <a href=""entry://Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a>, recently returned from Aran . Yeats urged Synge to abandon the attempt to make himself an interpreter of French literature in England, but to go to Aran and&ndash;as Yeats put it&ndash;‘express a life that has never found expression’. In 1897 Synge suffered the first attack of the Hodgkin's disease which would kill him. In May 1898 he visited Inishmore, largest of the Aran Islands, before moving on to Inishmaan. He returned to Aran in the summers of 1899, 1900, 1901, and 1902, amassing his notes for <i>The <a href=""entry://Aran Islands, The""><span class=""links"">Aran Islands</i></a></span>. Later visits to the congested districts of Connemara and Mayo, as well as to West Kerry, further enriched his knowledge of the west; but he did not give up his residence in Paris until 1903. In translations from <a href=""entry://Keating, Geoffrey""><span class=""links"">Keating</span></a> and other Irish originals Synge attended to the distinctive codes and rhythms of Irish; and drawing also upon the persistence in Hiberno-English of Gaelic speech patterns, he forged his uniquely bilingual dramatic language. <a href=""entry://Hyde, Douglas""><span class=""links"">Hyde</span></a> had employed a similar technique in <i>Love Songs of Connacht</i> (1893), but no one prosecuted this method with the wide-awake linguistic intelligence of Synge . Calling for a theatre which would once again reconcile reality and joy, Synge achieved this fusion in a language based on the actual speech of Irish people. Synge, recognizing that there was no tradition of Irish-language drama, and that none of the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey</span></a> actors was a native speaker, decided that his dramatic language would be a form of English based on the syntax and locutions of Irish. Synge's early work, such as <i>Vita vecchia</i> (1895&ndash;7) and <i>Étude morbide</i> (1899), fails through mawkishness and over-subjectivity. He completed <i>The Aran Islands late in</i> 1901, and in it he describes the shock of his encounter with the reality of people living their lives in close contact with nature and the elements. In 1902 he wrote <i><a href=""entry://In the Shadow of the Glen""><span class=""links"">In the Shadow of the Glen</i></a></span> (produced 1903); and <i><a href=""entry://Riders to the Sea""><span class=""links"">Riders to the Sea</i></a></span> (produced 1904), based on an incident he had heard recounted on Aran; and drafted the comedy <i>The <a href=""entry://Tinker's Wedding, The""><span class=""links"">Tinker's Wedding</i></a></span> (produced 1909). By the time the Abbey Theatre opened in 1904 Synge was accepted by Yeats and Lady Gregory as the leading playwright of the literary revival, becoming a Director in 1905, and Managing Director in 1908. In 1905 the Abbey staged <i>The <a href=""entry://Well of the Saints, The""><span class=""links"">Well of the Saints</i></a></span>, a play brutally contrasting the world of illusion with that of harsh fact. <i>The <a href=""entry://Playboy of the Western World, The""><span class=""links"">Playboy of the Western World</i></a></span>, in many respects the master-work of the Abbey Theatre, was staged in January 1907, provoking riotous demonstrations. The hero, a verbal master drawing upon the vocabulary of Connacht love-song, is also cowardly and vicious. The play subjects imagination to unflinching moral scrutiny. The riots occurred because the play offended a nationalist audience who wanted simpler images of the Western world. The role of Pegeen Mike was created for Molly <a href=""entry://Allgood, Molly""><span class=""links"">Allgood </span></a>, to whom Synge became engaged; but then Hodgkin's disease recurred, leading to the post-ponement of their marriage plans. The realization that his disease was fatal hangs over the mood of his last play, unfinished at his death, <i><a href=""entry://Deirdre of the Sorrows""><span class=""links"">Deirdre of the Sorrows</i></a></span>. Synge's poetry, published in <i>Poems and Translations</i> (1911), reflects his view that verse would have to become brutal if it was to recover its full humanity. Synge based his work on his own experience of Irish country people, and his writing reflects a ‘collaboration’, a term he used in the <i>Playboy</i> preface, between hardship and imagination. See <p class=""blk"">&nbsp;Kiberd, <i>Synge and the Irish Language</i> (1979); and C.&nbsp;, <i>The Drama of J. M. Synge</i> (1985).</p>"

The slua sí carry off mortals, most often children, if they are beautiful or otherwise exceptional, leaving a changeling (síofra or síobhra) behind. They also appear on coastlines, as mermaids (murúch, <a href=""entry://Hiberno-English""><span class=""links"">Hiberno-English</span></a> merrow). Solitary fairies are known variously as the leipreachán, represented as a cobbler; the clúracán, or drunken fairy; the fear dearg (‘red man’, the otherworld colour), or trickster; the fear gorta (‘hunger-man’), a phantom appearing at times of famine; the dallacán, a headless sprite who rides on the death-coach (cóiste bodhar, ‘silent coach’); the leannán sí, a fairy lover, who drives his or her mortal lover to distraction; and the bean sí (<a href=""entry://banshee""><span class=""links"">banshee</span></a>), who appears combing her red hair at the deaths of members of certain families. The púca (anglicé ‘pooka’) is the Irish form of the sprite familiar in English folklore as the night-mare."

Baptized by his own account Janus Junius (though more probably Seán Ó Tuathaláin), he was a native speaker of Irish. He appears to have converted to Presbyterianism at 15, studying thereafter in Glasgow and Leiden. As a thinker he advanced from theological liberalism to deism, then pantheism and possibly to atheism. His first work, <i>Christianity not Mysterious</i> (1696), opposes sacerdotal authority and fideism. Toland was vehemently attacked by Church of Ireland contemporaries such as William <a href=""entry://King, William""><span class=""links"">King </span></a>, and Robert <a href=""entry://Clayton, Robert""><span class=""links"">Clayton </span></a>.

Tone accompanied the fleet, which was prevented by bad weather from landing in Bantry in December 1796. A second projected invasion in 1797 with Dutch help likewise came to nothing.

"translation into Irish","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>translation into Irish</b><div class=""content"">of literary material is thought to have begun in the 9th cent. with classical stories from Latin [see <a href=""entry://classical literature in Irish translation""><span class=""links"">classical literature in Irish</span></a>]. These versions include translations of the destruction of Troy (<i><a href=""entry://Togail Troí""><span class=""links"">Togail Troí</i></a></span>) and the wanderings of Aeneas (<i>Imtheachta Aeniasa</i>) and have the distinction of being the earliest vernacular translations of classical texts in existence. Non-literary genres were not neglected: standard medical works such as the <i>Rosa Anglica</i> of John of Gaddesden, and the <i>Aphorisms</i> of Hippocrates were translated, wholly or in part. The impact of the Reformation led to Uilliam Ó Dómhnaill [see William <a href=""entry://Daniel[l], William""><span class=""links"">Daniel </span></a>] and William <a href=""entry://Bedell, William""><span class=""links"">Bedell's </span></a> translations of the Bible. The 18th and 19th cents. saw little in the way of translation into Irish, although Archbishop John <a href=""entry://MacHale, John""><span class=""links"">MacHale </span></a> translated Homer's <i>Iliad</i> (1844&ndash;71) and Moore's <i>Melodies</i> (1871). In the 20th cent. translation into Irish of a wide range of writing was steady. An tAthair Peadar <a href=""entry://Ó Laoghaire, An tAthair Peadar""><span class=""links"">Ó Laoghaire </span></a> translated <i>Don Quixote</i>, while George <a href=""entry://Moore, George [Augustus]""><span class=""links"">Moore </span></a> had the stories that eventually became <i>The <a href=""entry://Untilled Field, The""><span class=""links"">Untilled Field</i></a></span> done into Irish as <i>An tÚrghort</i> (1902) by Tadhg <a href=""entry://Ó Donnchadha, Tadhg""><span class=""links"">Ó Donnchadha </span></a> (‘Torna’). The poet Liam S. <a href=""entry://Gógan, Liam S.""><span class=""links"">Gógan </span></a> translated poets as diverse as Horace, Goethe, Verlaine, and Keats . Denis <a href=""entry://Devlin, Denis""><span class=""links"">Devlin </span></a> made versions of poems by Rimbaud . The most ambitious of all translators was Pádraig <a href=""entry://De Brún, Monsignor Pádraig""><span class=""links"">de Brún </span></a>, who made versions of Sophocles (<i>Antioghoine</i>, 1926), and a rhythmically compelling version of Homer's <i>Odyssey (An Odaisé</i>, 1990). <i>An Bíobla Naofa</i> (1981), translated by a team of scholars under the direction of Pádraig <a href=""entry://Ó Fiannachta, Pádraig""><span class=""links"">Ó Fiannachta </span></a> at Maynooth [see <a href=""entry://universities""><span class=""links"">universities</span></a>], formed the basis of a new Catholic liturgy in Irish [see also <a href=""entry://Bible in Irish""><span class=""links"">Bible in Irish</span></a>].

After teaching for a time, he turned to sculpture and started writing when he tired of modern abstraction, producing his first novel, <i>A Standard of Behaviour</i>, in 1958. Trevor's talent for the depiction of eccentrics is evident in <i>The <a href=""entry://Old Boys, The""><span class=""links"">Old Boys</i></a></span> (1964), and since then he has been a prolific writer of black comedies. Besides Basil Jaraby, a child-molester in <i>The <a href=""entry://Old Boys, The""><span class=""links"">Old Boys</i></a></span>, the gallery of nasty characters figured in Trevor's fiction includes Septimus Tuam in <i>The Love Department</i> (1966), Timothy Gedge in <i>The Children of Dynmouth</i> (1976), and Francis Tyte, the villain of <i>Other People's Worlds</i> (1980). In the 1980s Trevor devoted a number of novels to Irish political violence. Among these, <i>Fools of Fortune</i> (1983) and <i>The Silence in the Garden</i> (1988) encapsulate the turbulence of historical experience. Similar issues are explored in a number of short stories such as <i>‘Beyond the Pale’</i> and <i>‘Attracta’</i>.

The <i>Book of Leinster</i> version, though it produces a consistent narrative, is florid in style, whereas the other two preserve earlier and starker forms of the tale, written perhaps in the 8th cent. The <i>Táin</i> tells how <a href=""entry://Medb""><span class=""links"">Medb </span></a>, Queen of Connacht, makes a raid on the Ulaid (Ulstermen) to carry off the Donn (Brown) Cuailnge, a great bull from Cooley in Co.

When the Connacht army reaches Ard Cuillenn they find the first sign of <a href=""entry://Cú Chulainn""><span class=""links"">Cú Chulainn </span></a>, the hero of the narrative. A boy of 17, he defends Ulster alone since the Ulstermen are suffering a debility laid on them by Macha [see <a href=""entry://mythology""><span class=""links"">mythology</span></a>] for compelling her to race while pregnant. Cú Chulainn attacks the Connacht army in a series of devastating night raids, but the army still advances. Fergus makes an agreement with Cú Chulainn, committing him to a bout of single combat each day. A troop of boys, training in arms at <a href=""entry://Emain Macha""><span class=""links"">Emain Macha</span></a> and exempted from Macha's sickness because of their youth, now come against Medb and are killed. When Cú Chulainn awakes and finds that the boy-troop has been destroyed, he goes into a ‘warp-spasm’ (riastrad): in this enraged condition, he makes a great slaughter. According to a late and highly formulaic accretion to the story, Ferdia, Cú Chulainn's foster-brother, is persuaded to enter combat against him. The heroes fight for three days at Áth Fhirdia (Ardee, Co. Louth). Finally Cú Chulainn sends a lethal weapon called the gae bolga downstream, killing Ferdia when its barbs open out inside his body. After a fierce struggle between the bulls the Donn carries Finnbennach's carcass on his horns across Ireland.

"Ulysses","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ulysses</b><div class=""content"">(1922), a novel by James <a href=""entry://Joyce, James [Augustine Aloysius]""><span class=""links"">Joyce </span></a>, dealing with the events of one day in Dublin, 16 June 1904, and modelled on episodes in Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>. The central characters, Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and his wife Marion (‘Molly’), correspond to Telemachus, Ulysses, and Penelope, while several others also have Homeric counterparts. The chapters are known by the titles Joyce used during composition, though these do not appear in the published text: <i>‘Telemachus’</i>, <i>‘Nestor’</i>, <i>‘Proteus’</i>, jointly called the Telemachiad; <i>‘Calypso’</i>, <i>‘Lotuseaters’</i>, <i>‘Hades’</i>, <i>‘Aeolus’</i>, <i>‘Lestrygonians’</i>, <i>‘Scylla and Charybdis’</i>, <i>‘Wandering Rocks’</i>, <i>‘Sirens’</i>, <i>‘Cyclops’</i>, <i>‘Nausicaa’</i>, <i>‘Oxen of the Sun’</i>, <i>‘Circe’</i>, jointly called the Odyssey; and <i>‘Eumaeus’</i>, <i>‘Ithaca’</i>, and <i>‘Penelope’</i>, jointly called the Nostos. Highly experimental in form from the outset, and increasingly so in successive chapters, it makes extensive use of the techniques of stream of consciousness (or ‘interior monologue’) and stylistic parody. The separate itineraries of Stephen and Bloom are treated in alternate sections before they meet in the Holles St. National Maternity Hospital (‘Oxen of the Sun’), after which Bloom follows Stephen to the brothel quarter (‘Circe’) and takes him home via the cabman's shelter to 7 Eccles St. (‘Eumaeus’). Stephen accepts refreshment but refuses an offering of lodgings and departs alone (‘Ithaca’). Later Molly, in bed upstairs, mulls over her life as girl and woman in a soliloquy composed of four long, unpunctuated sentences, ending with a sexually compliant and life-affirming ‘Yes’ (‘Penelope’). Stephen Dedalus's day begins at the Martello Tower which he shares with Malachi (‘Buck’) Mulligan (‘Telemachus’). Stephen departs to teach for the last time at Mr Deasy's preparatory school (‘Nestor’). Reviewing his position as he walks on Sandymount Strand, he reflects on problems of perception, identity, and their relationship with nascent art (‘Proteus’). Drawing on the life and works of Shakespeare, he argues that art is a sublimation of personal experience in the National Library (‘Scylla and Charybdis’). In the offices of The <i><a href=""entry://Freeman's Journal, The""><span class=""links"">Freeman's Journal</i></a></span> he rejects the rhetoric of nationalist Irish culture (‘Aeolus’). When Bloom arrives at the Holles St. Hospital to pay his respects to a woman in labour, Stephen is drinking with medical students (‘Oxen of the Sun’). In Bella Cohen's brothel Stephen is visited by a ghoulish hallucination of his mother (‘Circe’). He smashes the lamp in the brothel and is knocked down by a soldier. Bloom, who has already taken charge of his money, effects a rescue. Leopold Bloom is an advertising canvasser married to an amateur singer. Sexual relations have ceased after the death in infancy of their son Rudolph some years before. Their one living child, Milly, is working as a photographer's assistant in Mullingar. Molly is having an affair with ‘Blazes’ Boylan, the manager of her musical tour. Bloom begins the day by making breakfast for Molly (‘Calypso’). Later, he collects a letter from a female correspondent, enters a Catholic church, and visits the Turkish baths (‘Lotuseaters’). At Paddy Dignam's funeral he extends his reflections on religion and its influence on Irish conduct, travelling to the Glasnevin cemetery with Stephen's father, Simon Dedalus, and several other Dubliners (‘Hades’). He visits the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> offices to place an advertisement and crosses paths with Stephen, whom he has already spotted on the journey to Glasnevin (‘Aeolus’). He takes a sandwich and a glass of wine in Davy Byrne's pub, reflecting on food and sensual appetite (‘Lestrygonians’). He goes to the Ormond Bar to answer his letter of the morning, hears Simon Dedalus and Ben Dollard singing, and glimpses Boylan setting out on a jaunting-car for his assignation with Molly (‘Sirens’). In Barney Kiernan's pub he is attacked by an intransigent nationalist, asserts his Irish nationality, defends the Jews, and declares against violence in politics (‘Cyclops’). Sexually aroused by Gerty MacDowell's display of underwear on Sandymount Strand near the Dignam household where he has gone to make insurance arrangements, he masturbates (‘Nausicaa’). In <i>‘Circe’</i> his anxiety spills into masochistic fantasy. In the penultimate chapter, we learn that Bloom's temperate reaction to his wife's infidelity includes the ‘antagonistic sentiments’ of ‘envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity’ (‘Ithaca’). <i>Ulysses</i> was first conceived as an additional story for <i><a href=""entry://Dubliners""><span class=""links"">Dubliners</i></a></span>, to be based on the occasion when a Dublin Jew called Alfred Hunter rescued Joyce after he had been knocked down in the street by the escort of a young woman in January 1904. The streets and houses of contemporary Dublin are portrayed with an exhaustive precision which owes its thoroughness to Joyce's use of Thom's Dublin Directory (1904), which enabled him to claim that the city could be rebuilt from the information in his novel.

"United Irishmen","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>United Irishmen</b><div class=""content"">is the name generally given to the insurgents of 1798 (or 'Ninety-Eight), whether in Ulster, Leinster, Munster, or Connacht, in spite of the different character of the various uprisings in regard to leadership, motivation, and progress. Strictly speaking the term refers to a political society founded in Belfast in October 1791 by Samuel McTier and Robert Simms . Originally intended as a response to the continuing failure of the <a href=""entry://Irish Parliament""><span class=""links"">Irish Parliament</span></a> to reform itself, the Society aimed at securing a measure of parliamentary reform, and for several years pursued its goal by constitutional means. It was hoped to unite all Irishmen in the pursuit of universal male suffrage; but despite the rapid establishment of a Dublin branch by Wolfe <a href=""entry://Tone, Theobald Wolfe""><span class=""links"">Tone </span></a> and Thomas Russell, the Society's early membership was drawn mostly from the Ulster Protestant community. In May 1794 the Dublin Society was included in the wave of proscription which was then afflicting most anti-government organizations. Following the disastrous revelation of the Government's ‘gradualist’ approach to <a href=""entry://Catholic Emancipation""><span class=""links"">Catholic Emancipation</span></a>, the United Irishmen re-emerged as a secret, oath-bound, elaborately organized and centrally-directed body. It was now Republican in outlook and aimed to separate the two kingdoms. Connections were established with the Defenders [see <a href=""entry://secret societies""><span class=""links"">secret societies</span></a>], originally a clandestine Catholic defence organization. The chief episodes of the 1798 Rebellion as reflected in popular tradition began with the brutal attacks on Presbyterian Republicans by militia and the yeomanry unleashed by General Lake throughout east Ulster. An early victim of judicial murder was William Orr, whose hanging for sedition in Antrim on 14 October 1797 became the subject of a famous ballad by William <a href=""entry://Drennan, William""><span class=""links"">Drennan </span></a>. In Leinster the organization was counting on a rising of an estimated 300,000 insurgents on 23 May, but the arrest of members of the Dublin Directory, including Lord Edward <a href=""entry://Fitzgerald, Lord Edward""><span class=""links"">Fitzgerald </span></a>, broke the chain of command. Martial law was declared on 30 March. In Co. Wexford, even though many Protestants joined the insurgents, the rising developed into a sectarian war with atrocities on both sides. The chief town fell to Fr. John Murphy of Boolavogue on 30 May. On 5 June, however, the insurgents under Bagenal Harvey were defeated at New Ross by British contingents led by Major-General Henry Johnson . The ruthless destruction of the insurgent remnant at Vinegar Hill, where Fr. Murphy and some 10,000 rebels were encamped outside Enniscorthy on 21 June, epitomized for folk memory the fate of the Croppies&mdash;so-called because of the short hair-cut of French revolutionary activists&mdash;who faced muskets and ordnance with pikes and farming implements. During the ensuing reprisals Fr. Murphy was brutally flogged, beheaded, and burnt in pitch. In Ulster the insurgents were mainly Presbyterians in religion and Republicans in politics. Martial events began with an attack on Antrim town on 7 June, resulting in the capture of Henry Joy <a href=""entry://McCracken, Henry Joy""><span class=""links"">McCracken </span></a> on Slemish Mountain and his execution by hanging in Belfast. In Co. Down Henry Monro led the insurgents at Saintsfield, and again in a pitched battle at Ballynahinch on 13 June. As in Wexford so in Co. Down: after the defeat of the insurgents, the militia and yeomanry indulged in several days of indiscriminate killing, with the connivance of General Lake. The final chapter of the 1798 Rebellion occurred in Mayo following the landing of French forces under General Humbert at Killala on 22 August. After an initial victory at the Races of Castlebar, when a large contingent of mixed British forces was ignominiously routed on 27 August, came the defeat of the 1,000-strong French party with their Irish allies when General Cornwallis surrounded them at Ballinamuck. Some time later the <i>Hoche</i> was taken in Lough Swilly by the British navy, and Wolfe Tone arrested on board. His death by suicide in order to avoid hanging ended the ‘conspiracy’ of the United Irishman. Robert Emmet's Rising of 1803, conducted in the same political spirit, is traditionally regarded as a separate event, chiefly because the Anglo-Irish <a href=""entry://ascendancy""><span class=""links"">ascendancy</span></a> was stampeded into passing the Act of <a href=""entry://Union, Act of""><span class=""links"">Union</span></a> in the interim.

<b>universities</b>.<div class=""content"">University education in Ireland commenced in 1591 with a royal charter for the foundation of Trinity College, Dublin. Among the first students to enter when it opened in 1592 were William <a href=""entry://Daniel[l], William""><span class=""links"">Daniel </span></a> and James <a href=""entry://Ussher, James""><span class=""links"">Ussher </span></a>, the latter making a journey to London in 1603 with Dr Luke Challoner in order to buy books to form the nucleus of a university library. By the 18th cent. it had come to include many Irish <a href=""entry://manuscripts in Irish""><span class=""links"">manuscripts</span></a>, including the <i><a href=""entry://Book of Kells""><span class=""links"">Book of Kells</i></a></span>, the <i><a href=""entry://Book of Leinster, the""><span class=""links"">Book of Leinster</i></a></span>, and the <i><a href=""entry://Book of Durrow""><span class=""links"">Book of Durrow</i></a></span>. Under the Act of <a href=""entry://Union, Act of""><span class=""links"">Union</span></a>, TCD Library acquired entitlement to copies of all books published in the Kingdom. From the outset the University was essentially an Anglican foundation with the primary purpose of promoting the Reformation. TCD became a large landowner under the <a href=""entry://plantation""><span class=""links"">plantations</span></a>. It remained the only chartered institution of higher learning in the country until 1795, when St Patrick's College, Maynooth, was founded as a Roman Catholic centre of higher education. It was not until 1970 that the Catholic clergy removed the ‘ban’ on Catholics entering TCD, although Presbyterians had been increasingly numerous there since the turn of the century. In 1800 Maynooth was opened to lay students, but within a short time it became an exclusively clerical seminary, granting awards of the Pontifical University in Rome. Because of the Anglican ethos of TCD, pressure mounted from the Roman Catholic and Presbyterian Churches in the early decades of the 19th cent. for what each could regard as appropriate third-level institutions. In 1845 legislation was passed establishing the Queen's University of Ireland, with constituent colleges in Belfast, Cork, and Galway. These were opposed as ‘godless colleges’ by many Presbyterians and by the Catholic hierarchy; and, because of their allegedly secular ethos and the absence of guarantees protecting Catholic educational interests, neither Queen's College, Cork, nor Queen's College, Galway, achieved the full support of Catholics. The Belfast College, catering for the predominantly Presbyterian population of the northeast, enjoyed greater success, however. In 1854, in an attempt to provide university education for Catholics from its own resources, the Church hierarchy founded the Catholic University of Ireland under the rectorship of Cardinal John Henry <a href=""entry://Newman, John Henry""><span class=""links"">Newman </span></a>. However, it lasted only four years. Increased pressure on government from an ever more confident Catholic clergy and middle class led to the abolition of the Queen's University and the establishment of the Royal University of Ireland in 1879. The Royal University was an examining body, publishing syllabuses and setting papers for which candidates were prepared mainly in various recognized colleges throughout the country, notably the Queen's Colleges and University College, Dublin (UCD). The latter was established on St Stephen's Green, in buildings that formerly housed the Catholic University, with members of the Society of Jesus for the most part as its lecturers, and it was here that James <a href=""entry://Joyce, James [Augustine Aloysius]""><span class=""links"">Joyce </span></a> received his university education. Also associated with the Royal University was Magee College in Derry, founded in 1865 as a Presbyterian theological institution. The Royal University was notable in that it was the first university in Ireland to admit women to degrees. In 1908 the National University of Ireland (NUI) and the Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) were established as two new and separate teaching universities. The National University was a federal university consisting of the University Colleges in Cork (UCC), Dublin (UCD), and Galway (UCG). St Patrick's College, Maynooth, became a recognized university institution within NUI. At the same time Magee College became an associate college of the University of Dublin (TCD), retaining this link until it was affiliated to the New University of Ulster (NUU) established at Coleraine in 1968. In 1984 NUU was amalgamated with the Northern Ireland Polytechnic to form the University of Ulster (UU), with campuses at Jordanstown (UUJ), Belfast (UUB), Coleraine (UUC), and Derry (UUM, though still known as Magee). Further additions to the university system in Ireland resulted from the transformation of the two National Institutes of Higher Education (NIHE) in Limerick and Dublin into the University of Limerick (UL) and Dublin City University (DCU) in 1989, St Patrick's College, Drumcondra, later becoming affiliated to the latter."

"Viking invasion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Viking invasion</b>.<div class=""content"">The first Irish incursions of the Norsemen, comprising ship-borne martial groups from Norway and Denmark, occurred in 795, when Rechru (now Lambay Island) in Dublin Bay was raided. The shallow-draught boats of the Vikings rendered many of the waterways of Ireland navigable to them, and by 820 they had consolidated their estuarial encampments and established control over the Shannon, the Nore, the Bann, and other rivers. Having first been raided in 795, the monastery founded by <a href=""entry://Colum Cille [Columba] ""><span class=""links"">Colum Cille</span></a> on Iona was extensively pillaged in 802, while in 806 sixty-eight members of the community were slaughtered. The political activities of the Vikings in Ireland were consolidated in 831 with the arrival of Turgesius (Thorgest). In 852 Olaf the White landed in Dublin and established the chief Scandinavian centre in Ireland. The Norsemen suffered their first major defeat at the hands of Mael Sechlainn II (Malachi), the last undisputed Uí Néill High King of Ireland, in a battle at <a href=""entry://Tara""><span class=""links"">Tara</span></a> in 980 [see <a href=""entry://kingship""><span class=""links"">kingship</span></a>]. In 994 Mael Sechlainn captured Dublin and installed as king Sitric Silkenbeard . A clash in 998 between Mael Sechlainn and <a href=""entry://Brian Bóroime ""><span class=""links"">Brian Bóroime </span></a>, the dominant king in Munster, resulted in an agreement to share the country north and south. The following year Brian captured Dublin, defeating a Viking and Leinster alliance, and reinstalled Sitric as king. Further hostilities broke out, according to tradition, when Brian's son Murchad insulted Maelmorda, King of Leinster, who turned for help to Sigurd, Earl of Orkney, and Brodir, King of Man. The forces assembled at Dublin by this alliance were defeated by Brian at the Battle of <a href=""entry://Clontarf, Battle of""><span class=""links"">Clontarf</span></a> on 23 April 1014, bringing Viking dominance to an end. The chief impact of the Viking invasion of Ireland, as elsewhere, was the disruption of the Christian institutions that formed the nucleus of literary culture in the early Middle Ages. The Viking trading colonies of littoral Ireland are usually regarded as the earliest prototypes of urban development in the country. Contemporary Irish accounts of the Vikings in Ireland are to be found in the <a href=""entry://annals, Irish""><span class=""links"">annals</span></a>, as well as in <i><a href=""entry://Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh""><span class=""links"">Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh</i></a></span>."

"Wilde, Oscar [Fingal O'Flahertie Wills]","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Wilde, Oscar [Fingal O'Flahertie Wills]</b><div class=""content""><i>(1854&ndash;1900),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> dramatist. Born in Dublin, the son of Sir William <a href=""entry://Wilde, Sir William R[obert Wills]""><span class=""links"">Wilde </span></a> and Jane Francesca <a href=""entry://Wilde, Lady""><span class=""links"">Wilde </span></a> (‘Speranza’), he was educated at Portora at Enniskillen, Co. Fermanagh, and TCD, where he was taught by the classicist John Pentland <a href=""entry://Mahaffy, Sir John Pentland""><span class=""links"">Mahaffy </span></a>. At Oxford, he won the Newdigate Prize for Poetry, and his chief mentor was Walter Pater . His first book, <i>Poems</i> (1881), hints at his themes of homosexuality, individualism, and Republican indifference to authority. In 1879 Wilde set up in London as a self-styled ‘Professor of Aesthetics’, intent on a crusade to civilize the English through lectures and essays on the reform of English dress and on house decoration, but also by his own example. So considerable was the impact of his self-promotion that he was engaged to undertake a lengthy lecture tour of North America during 1882. Although Wilde developed his public image considerably in this period (‘I have nothing to declare but my genius’), it was also a time when he consolidated the ideas which were to underpin his best satirical writings. Returning from America, he settled down to the career of a man of letters. For eighteen months he edited <i>The Woman's World</i> (in 1887&ndash;9), soliciting contributions from society ladies including his wife, Constance Lloyd. Together they made their Chelsea home at 16 Tite St. into the ‘House Beautiful’. Wilde's unsatisfactory Russian melodrama <i><a href=""entry://Vera""><span class=""links"">Vera</i></a>, or the Nihilists</span> was produced in New York in 1883. His literary fortunes began to rise in 1890 with <i>The <a href=""entry://Picture of Dorian Grey, The""><span class=""links"">Picture of Dorian Gray</i></a></span> in <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>, and this was followed by the publication of his collected essays and dialogues under the title of <i>Intentions</i> in 1891. From 1886 Wilde had been having sexual relationships with men, beginning with Robert Ross, who was to become his literary executor. In 1891 he met Lord Alfred Douglas, a young man sixteen years his junior. In his company Wilde ventured with increasing recklessness into the London world of boy-prostitution. At the same time, his writing began to deal more explicitly with homosexual themes. Wilde's liberationist outlook was further developed in <i>The Soul of Man Under Socialism</i> (1891), an aesthete's version of Marxism. <i>Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories</i> (1891) and <i>A House of Pomegranates</i> (1892), were volumes of tales for a more adult audience than <i>The Happy Prince</i> (1888), which had originated in his children's nursery. In 1891 he also wrote <i><a href=""entry://Lady Windermere's Fan""><span class=""links"">Lady Windermere's Fan</i></a></span>, inaugurating the drama of epigrammatic dandyism and moral paradox on which his fame is based. The performance of this play in the following year greatly increased his notoriety. Thereafter Wilde concentrated on three matters: the perpetuation of his stage success with <i>A Woman of No Importance</i> (1893), <i>An <a href=""entry://Ideal Husband, An""><span class=""links"">Ideal Husband</i></a></span>, and <i>The <a href=""entry://Importance of Being Earnest, The""><span class=""links"">Importance of Being Earnest</i></a></span> (both produced in 1895); a life of self-indulgence principally in company with Douglas; and a series of works of a religious nature which include <i><a href=""entry://Salomé""><span class=""links"">Salomé</i></a></span> (in French, 1893; in English, 1894), as well as <i>A Florentine Tragedy</i> and <i>La Sainte Courtisane</i>. In 1895 he was lured into instigating an action for criminal libel against Douglas's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, who had left a card in the Albemarle Club inscribed ‘To Oscar Wilde, posing as a somdomite’ [sic]. Forced to abandon the prosecution under cross-examination by Edward <a href=""entry://Carson, Edward""><span class=""links"">Carson </span></a>, Wilde was charged with gross indecency, convicted by jury on 25 May 1895, and sentenced to two years' hard labour. Towards the end of his imprisonment at Reading, Wilde wrote an account of his relationship with Alfred Douglas, first published by Ross in abridged form as <i><a href=""entry://De Profundis""><span class=""links"">De Profundis</i></a></span> (1905). After his release in 1897, Wilde immediately left England and drifted aimlessly around France and Italy, sometimes with Douglas, sometimes with Ross, using the pseudonym ‘Sebastian Melmoth’. Writing nothing other than <i>The <a href=""entry://Ballad of Reading Gaol, The""><span class=""links"">Ballad of Reading Gaol</i></a></span>, he indulged heavily in drink and sex. Wilde died in 1900, most likely of meningitis. See <p class=""blk"">&nbsp;Ellmann, <i>Oscar Wilde</i> (1987).</p>"

But the city of Derry, where citizens had closed the gates against a Jacobite army on 7 December 1688, withstood a lengthy siege (18 April&ndash;13 June), while Enniskillen Protestants defeated Jacobite forces at Belleek (7 May) and Newtownbutler (31 July).

He returned to live in Ireland in 1910, first at Greystones, Co. Wicklow, then in Dublin. Yeats began working consistently in oil from 1905. The mystical atmosphere of his later canvases reflects his conviction that there is a higher reality. Yeats wrote a number of plays. <i>Harlequin Positions</i> (1939), <i>La La Noo</i> (1942), and <i>In Sand</i> (1949) were produced at the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey's Peacock Theatre</span></a>. Three further plays, <i>Apparitions, The Old Sea Road, and Rattle</i>, appeared in a single volume in 1933. In their indifference to normal dramatic convention, and the openings they create for metaphysical surmise, they anticipate the stagecraft of Samuel <a href=""entry://Beckett, Samuel [Barclay]""><span class=""links"">Beckett </span></a>, a personal friend. Yeats also published a number of idiosyncratic works of pseudo-autobiography and fantastic narrative. <i>Sligo</i> (1930), <i>Sailing, Sailing Swiftly</i> (1933), <i>The Charmed Life</i> (1938), <i>Ah, Well</i> (1942), <i>And To You Also</i> (1944), and <i>The Careless Flower</i> (1947) display a liking for free association. In <i>The Amaranthers</i> (1936) James Gilfoyle, a Dubliner, makes a journey to a magical isle off the west of Ireland."

<b>Yeats, John Butler</b><div class=""content""><i>(1839&ndash;1922),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> portrait-painter, the father of W.

In the 1870s and 1880s the family moved frequently between Dublin, London, and Howth, the children often staying in Sligo with the Pollexfens. After his wife died in 1900 he settled in Dublin with his daughters Susan (‘Lily ’) and Elizabeth (‘Lollie ’).

<b>Yeats, W[illiam] B[utler]</b><div class=""content""><i>(1865&ndash;1939),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> poet, playwright, founder of the <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>, and driving force of the Irish <a href=""entry://literary revival""><span class=""links"">literary revival</span></a>; born in Dublin, the son of John Butler <a href=""entry://Yeats, John Butler""><span class=""links"">Yeats </span></a>, a portrait-painter whose own father was a Church of Ireland clergyman. Yeats's mother, Susan Pollexfen, came from a Sligo family that owned mills and a small shipping company. From 1867 to 1872 the Yeatses lived mainly in London, from 1872 to 1874 in Sligo, then in London again from 1874 to 1881. Yeats went to the Erasmus Smith High School in Dublin, 1881&ndash;3. In 1884 he entered the Metropolitan School of Art, and met George <a href=""entry://Russell, George [William]""><span class=""links"">Russell </span></a>. In 1885 he met John <a href=""entry://O'Leary, John""><span class=""links"">O'Leary </span></a>, who introduced him to translations of Irish literature into English. Stimulated by reading Standish James <a href=""entry://O'Grady, Standish James""><span class=""links"">O'Grady's </span></a> histories and fictions, he determined to give the legends and <a href=""entry://mythology""><span class=""links"">mythology</span></a> of Ireland new literary expression by writing poetry about Irish places. At the same time his interest in Indian thought and theosophy led him to the Dublin Hermetic Society. His first volume, <i>Mosada: A Dramatic Poem</i>, appeared in 1886. <i>The <a href=""entry://Wanderings of Oisin, The""><span class=""links"">Wanderings of Oisin</i></a></span> (1889), a long poem based on the <a href=""entry://Fionn cycle""><span class=""links"">Fionn cycle</span></a>, was published in the year when ‘the troubling of his life’ began in the meeting with Maud <a href=""entry://Gonne, Maud""><span class=""links"">Gonne </span></a>. In 1892 Yeats wrote his play <i>The <a href=""entry://Countess Cathleen, The""><span class=""links"">Countess Cathleen</i></a></span> for her, and addressed to her over the years many wistful love-poems. The marriage proposal that he made in 1891 was refused. In 1890 he joined the Hermetic <a href=""entry://Order of the Golden Dawn""><span class=""links"">Order of the Golden Dawn</span></a>; interested in magic, astrology, and the Cabbala, he made a study of Blake (whose poems he edited with Edwin J. Ellis in three volumes, 1893), as well as reading Swedenborg. His <i>Representative Irish Tales</i> and John Sherman and <i>Dhoya</i> were published in 1891, the year of <a href=""entry://Parnell, Charles Stewart""><span class=""links"">Parnell's </span></a> death. He began planning a new Irish Literary Society in London, hoping that a cultural revival could be launched. In the following June in Dublin he inaugurated the National Literary Society at a meeting in the Rotunda. <i>Irish Fairy Tales</i> and <i>The Countess Kathleen and Various Legends and Lyrics</i> were published in 1892. In this period his poetry became more obscure, while a collection entitled <i>The <a href=""entry://Celtic Twilight, The""><span class=""links"">Celtic Twilight</i></a></span> (1893) gave its name to the kind of poetry then being produced by imitators. This <i>‘Celtic’</i> poetry reached its ultimate development in the symbolic lyrics of his <i>The <a href=""entry://Wind Among the Reeds, The""><span class=""links"">Wind Among the Reeds</i></a></span> (1899). Having first met Lady <a href=""entry://Gregory, Lady""><span class=""links"">Gregory </span></a> in London during 1894 he visited her at Coole Park, her country house in Co. Galway in 1896 and spent long periods there during the summer for many years. Coole provided Yeats with a peaceful routine, and he did much work there, Lady Gregory rekindling his interest in folk tales and peasant speech. While staying at Coole in the summer of 1897, Yeats planned the Irish Literary Theatre with Lady Gregory, and another Co. Galway land owner, Edward <a href=""entry://Martyn, Edward""><span class=""links"">Martyn </span></a> at Duras House, in Kinvara [see <a href=""entry://Abbey Theatre, The""><span class=""links"">Abbey Theatre</span></a>]. Yeats became a member of the <a href=""entry://Irish State""><span class=""links"">Irish Republican</span></a> Brotherhood to please Maud Gonne, but soon grew disillusioned with revolutionaries, especially after the Dublin riots of 1897. In 1902, Maud Gonne acted in the title-role of <i><a href=""entry://Cathleen Ni Houlihan""><span class=""links"">Cathleen Ni Houlihan</i></a></span>, a play which made a great impression on Irish nationalists, causing Yeats to wonder later in reference to the leaders of the 1916 <a href=""entry://Easter Rising""><span class=""links"">Easter Rising</span></a> if it had ‘sent out certain men the English shot’. He was shattered by her sudden marriage to John MacBride in 1903, but continued to write love poetry to and about her. As President of the Irish National Dramatic Society, and Director of the Abbey Theatre, Yeats was deeply immersed in theatre policy and management during this period. Poems in <i>The <a href=""entry://Green Helmet, The""><span class=""links"">Green Helmet</i></a></span> (1910) and <i><a href=""entry://Responsibilities""><span class=""links"">Responsibilities</i></a></span> (1914) express disillusion. <i>On Baile's Strand</i> (1904) was the first of his plays about the Irish hero <a href=""entry://Cú Chulainn""><span class=""links"">Cú Chulainn </span></a>. An inveterate letter-writer, he also composed many essays: <i><a href=""entry://Ideas of Good and Evil""><span class=""links"">Ideas of Good and Evil</i></a></span> (1903) and <i>Discoveries</i> (1907) were followed in 1916 by <i>Reveries over Childhood and Youth</i>, being the first part of <i><a href=""entry://Autobiographies""><span class=""links"">Autobiographies</i></a></span>. His continuing interest in aristocratic art was reflected in imitations of the Japanese Noh, and 1916 saw a production of <i>At the Hawk's Well</i>, the first of his <i>Four Plays for Dancers</i> (1921). When the 1916 Rising took place in Dublin, Yeats realized that the Irish leaders executed for their part in it had been transformed into national martyrs through the ‘terrible beauty’ of their sacrifice. Among them was John MacBride . Yeats went to Normandy, where Maud Gonne was living with Seán (born 1904), her son by MacBride, and Iseult (1894&ndash;1954), her second child by Lucien Millevoye, a French right-wing politician. There he proposed marriage, was refused, and next proposed to Iseult, who gave no definite answer. In 1917, on receiving a final refusal, he turned to Georgie Hyde Lees, whom he married in 1917. Marriage transformed Yeats's life. His wife's automatic writing underpinned the views on history and human personality sketched in the prose <i>Per Amica Silentia Lunae</i> (1918) and which he systematized in <i>A <a href=""entry://Vision, A""><span class=""links"">Vision</i></a></span> (1925). Ownership of Thoor Ballylee, a medieval tower in Co. Galway, and of a town house at 82 Merrion Square gave him the sense of being rooted in Ireland. He became a senator of the Irish Free State [see <a href=""entry://Irish State""><span class=""links"">Irish State</span></a>] in 1922, chairing the committee on the new Irish coinage, and later causing a controversy with his defence of divorce in June 1925. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923. Of the collections in this period, <i>Michael Robartes and the Dancer</i> (1921) included a bleak vision of the future in <i>‘The Second Coming’</i>, and praise of ceremony in <i>‘A Prayer for my Daughter’</i>. The magnificent poems of <i>The <a href=""entry://Tower, The""><span class=""links"">Tower</i></a></span> (1928) focused on legends surrounding Thoor Ballylee, the problem of age, inherited characteristics, civil war, and love. <i>The <a href=""entry://Winding Stair, The""><span class=""links"">Winding Stair and Other Poems</i></a></span> (1933) continued this rhetorical poetry. Various medical conditions took their toll, though Yeats's output continued impressively with <i>Collected Poems</i> (1933), <i>Collected Plays</i> (1934), <i>Wheels and Butterflies</i> (1934), <i>A Full Moon in March</i> (1935), and <i>Dramatis Personae</i> (1935). After editing <i>The Oxford Book of Modern Verse</i> (1936), Yeats revised <i>A Vision</i> (1937), published <i>New Poems</i> (1938), planned <i>On the Boiler</i> (1939) and composed <i><a href=""entry://""entry://Purgatory""""><span class=""links"">Purgatory</i></a></span>
<i>and</i>
<i>The Death of Cuchulain</i>. Riversdale became his last Irish residence in 1932. He died at Roquebrune, Cap Martin in the South of France. The leading literary figure in Ireland in his time, who virtually invented modern Irish literature in English, and one of the greatest modern poets in any language, Yeats has cast a long shadow.

Young Ireland can be taken as representing the advent of Romantic nationalism in Ireland. Its members are mainly remembered as the first to make language and culture central to the concept of national identity. Attempts to organize an Irish rising in 1848 led only to a confrontation with police at Ballingarry, Co. Tipperary, subsequently derided as ‘the battle of the Widow McCormick's cabbage patch’."

Before returning to England in 1779, Young spent a period as agent to Lord Kingsborough's estate at Mitchelstown, Co. Cork.

"Ó Bruadair, Dáibhí","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Ó Bruadair, Dáibhí</b><div class=""content""><i>(?1625&ndash;1698),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> poet. Born in the area around Carrigtwohill in eastern Co. Cork, he received training at a <a href=""entry://bardic poetry""><span class=""links"">bardic</span></a> school. The body of his work almost uniquely provides a native Irish perspective on the social upheavals of the turbulent period between the <a href=""entry://Rebellion of 1641""><span class=""links"">Rebellion</span></a> of 1641 and its bitter sequel in <a href=""entry://Cromwell, Oliver""><span class=""links"">Cromwell's </span></a> campaign in Ireland, to the devastation of Catholic hopes with the Treaty of Limerick [see <a href=""entry://Williamite War""><span class=""links"">Williamite War</span></a>]. In one of Ó Bruadair's earliest poems, <i>‘Adoramus Te Christe’</i>, written about 1648 and beginning <i>‘Adhraim thú, a thaidhbhse ár gcrú’</i>, he dedicates his literary powers to the praise of the Lord. In much of his subsequent writings he addressed the transformation of Irish society in the 17th cent., and especially the changing fortunes of aristocratic Gaelic families. <i>‘Créacht do dháil mé’</i>, a poem dated at 1652, pours scorn on the Cromwellian upstarts who are taking over Irish lands in the new <a href=""entry://plantation""><span class=""links"">plantation</span></a> and settlement, attacking their affectations, mincing speech, and closecropped hair. In 1660 he removed to west Co. Limerick and wrote <i>‘Iomdha scéimh ar chur na cluana’</i>, an epithalamium on the marriage of Una Bourke of Cahirmoyle, whose parents, John Bourke and Anna Ní Urthuile, became his patrons and remained supporters of the Jacobite cause. Ó Bruadair seems to have enjoyed the support of several Jacobite households other than the Bourkes up to 1674, when he complains in <i>‘Is bearnadh suain’</i> that kindness and generosity have disappeared from his life. The new élite have, he claims, infected the manners and mores of even the Gaelic nobility, who now coldly disregard his grief-stricken pleas. At around this time also he wrote the cynical <i>‘Is mairg nach bhfuil im dhubhthuata’</i>, ironically wishing he were an uneducated lout who might fare better in the new economic order. In 1680 he described his circumstances&mdash;living penniless in the <i>‘Corner of a Churchyard in a Cottage
well-contented with his Stock, which is only a little Dog, a Cat, and a Cock’</i>. At around this time he wrote <i>‘D'aithle na bhfileadh n-uasal’</i>, expressing his sorrow at the decay of Irish learning as books and manuscripts lie rotting in forgotten corners. <i>‘Suim Purgadóra bhFear nÉireann’</i> is a verse chronicle of the years 1641&ndash;84, from the ‘betrayal’ of Charles I to the Popish Plot. At the succession of <a href=""entry://James II""><span class=""links"">James II</span></a>, Catholic and Jacobite hopes revived with a proclamation of religious freedom for Catholics. These developments are joyously recounted in a poem of 1687, <i>‘Caithréim an Dara Séamuis’</i>. In December 1688 he records his disgust at the Glorious Revolution, which installed William of Orange as King of England and Ireland. From the date when James landed in Ireland in the following year to Ó Bruadair's death, his poetry reflects the fortunes of the Jacobite cause with an immediacy of response that is as complex as it is agitated. <i>‘Caithréim Phádraig Sáirséal’</i> triumphantly recalls <a href=""entry://Sarsfield, Patrick""><span class=""links"">Sarsfield's </span></a> victory when he spiked William's artillery in a daring military exploit at Ballyneety, Co. Limerick. His famous poem <i>‘An Longbhriseadh’</i> (The Shipwreck) describes the country's situation after the departure of the <a href=""entry://Wild Geese""><span class=""links"">Wild Geese</span></a>. It would appear that little or no assistance was coming from any quarter, and that his erstwhile patrons were themselves reduced to poverty, but in <i>‘Geadh scannail le daoinibh’</i> (<i>c.</i>1693) he tells us that Anna Ní Urthuile has nevertheless given him the mantle off her own back. Ó Bruadair is unremitting in his view that utter calamity has overtaken Ireland, and he is certain that a great part of the blame must be laid on his own countrymen for their deceit and ungodliness.

<b>Ó Cadhain, Máirtín</b><div class=""content""><i>(1906&ndash;1970),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> novelist and short-story writer. Born in Cois Fharraige, in the Connemara <a href=""entry://Gaeltacht""><span class=""links"">Gaeltacht</span></a>, to a family of well-known story-tellers, Ó Cadhain was educated at the local national school in Spiddal and qualified as a teacher at Saint Patrick's College in 1926. He joined the <a href=""entry://IRA""><span class=""links"">IRA</span></a>, eventually becoming a recruiting officer and a member of the Army Council. He also became involved in Gaeltacht issues. He was a lifelong, often controversial, language-rights activist, declaring that ‘the Irish language is my life essence’. <i>Idir Shugradh agus Dáiríre</i> (1939) was a volume of stories based on the life of his own community. Because of his republican activities, Ó Cadhain spent most of the war years (1939&ndash;45) in the Curragh Internment Camp. His novel <i><a href=""entry://Cré na Cille""><span class=""links"">Cré na Cille</i></a></span> (1948) is a major work of modern Irish literature. It is a commentary on the foibles and futile preoccupations of men and women in Ó Cadhain's Gaeltacht community. In the collections <i>An Braon Broghach</i> (1948) and <i>Cois Caoláire</i> (1953) he integrates traditional content and modernist forms. After internment Ó Cadhain was appointed to the Government Translation Service. His final three collections, <i>An tSraith ar Lár</i> (1967), <i>An tSraith Dhá Tógail</i> (1970), and the posthumously published <i>An tSraith Tógtha</i> (1977), introduce the dehumanized, deracinated, and nameless people of the modern urban wasteland. In 1956 Ó Cadhain was appointed Junior Lecturer in Irish at TCD and he became Professor of Irish in 1969. <i>Athnuachan</i> (1995) was published after lying in typescript since 1951, when it won the <a href=""entry://tOireachtas, An""><span class=""links"">Oireachtas</span></a> prize. Ó Cadhain did not wish to publish it in his lifetime, because the central character, Beartla Mór, a hypochondriac old man obsessed with death, was based upon his uncle. It is a work as commanding as <i>Cré na Cille</i>, comic, grotesque, and tragic by turns. <i>Caiscín</i> (1998) collects his articles for <i>The Irish Times</i> published 1953&ndash;56. He is difficult to read in Irish because of an allusive style based not only on the rich heritage of his local dialect and its folk inheritance but also on the full range of the literary tradition.

Considered delicate as a child, young Ó Criomhthain continued to be breastfed to the age of 4, but ultimately outlived all of his contemporaries. Married in 1878 to Máire Ní Chatháin, they went on to produce ten children.

Ó Criomhthain was the first islander to achieve literacy in Irish, having taught himself to read and write the language. In 1917 Brian Ó Ceallaigh went to the island, met Ó Criomhthain, and urged him to write from his experience.

He transferred to the Civil Service in Dublin in 1938 and began to write poems, publishing two collections, <i>Coinnle Geala</i> (1942) and <i>Dánta Aniar</i> (1943), at his own expense. <i>Rogha Dánta</i> (1949) is a landmark in modern poetry in Irish, while <i>Ó Morna agus Dánta Eile</i> (1957) established him as a poet with a powerful and distinctive voice. Ó Direáin's work advances from nostalgic recollections of life in Aran to a later exploration of an urban environment, using bleak imagery based on the uncompromising landscape of the island. The poem <i>‘Stoite’</i> in <i>Rogha Dánta</i> engages with the theme of uprooted man adrift from the moral sanctions of traditional rural life, a subject that receives its most exhaustive treatment in <i>Ar Ré Dhearóil</i> (1963), where he explores a moral crisis inherent in ‘an chathair fhallsa’ (the false city). Attractively simple in theme and language, his work shows a capacity for acute observation. A striking feature is the repeated use of a simple vocabulary in which words such as cloch, cré, carraig, and trá (stone, clay, rock, and strand), serve to evoke the values which the poet sees as being eroded by modern urban society. Ó Direáin received awards from the Irish-American Cultural Institute Award, and the Freiherr Von Stein Foundation, Hamburg, as well as an honorary degree from NUI. He remained in the Civil Service until his retirement in 1975, and died in Dublin. See <p class=""blk"">&nbsp;Sewell, <i>Extending the Alhambra</i> (2000).</p>"

He fled to Riocard de Búrc (Richard Fitz William Fitz Adelm de Burgo) in Clanrickard, whose protection he sought in the poem <i>‘Créd agaibh aoidhigh i gcéin’</i>, praising de Burgo for his ‘foreign beauty’ and for adapting so completely to Gaelic culture. But Ó Dálaigh was forced to go on to Thomond, Limerick, then Dublin, before leaving for Scotland, where he remained in exile for some time.

<b>Ó hEódhasa, Eochaidh</b><div class=""content""><i>(?1560&ndash;1612),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> poet; head of the Ó hEódhasa poetic family and ollam [see <a href=""entry://áes dána""><span class=""links"">áes dána</span></a>] to three successive Maguire chieftains of Fermanagh: Cú Chonnacht (d. 1589), Hugh (d. 1600), and Hugh's halfbrother, Cú Chonnacht. The family home was at Ballyhose on Castlehume Lough, Lower Lough Erne, where his principal teacher was probably his father, Maoileachlainn Óg. Maguire gave Ó hEódhasa lands at Currin, near Ballinamallard, but the poem <i>‘T'aire riot a rí ó nUidhir’</i> complains that the holding is not commensurate with his status as ollam; and that he is too far from Hugh himself whose affection he both craves and demands. Another poem, <i>‘Mór an t-ainm ollamh flatha’</i>, rehearses the rights due to a chief-poet in similar terms. In 1600 Maguire joined Hugh <a href=""entry://O'Neill, Hugh""><span class=""links"">O'Neill </span></a> in Munster, where he was fighting the English and awaiting Spanish reinforcements. Ó hEódhasa stayed in Fermanagh, and a personal poem, ‘Fuar leam an adhaighse d'Aodh’, expresses his fear for his patron's safety, and his concern that Hugh is exposed to the bitter cold of a winter's night while on campaign. This poem is the basis of a passionate adaptation by James Clarence <a href=""entry://Mangan, James Clarence""><span class=""links"">Mangan </span></a>. Ó hEódhasa's poems to Maguire allow an insight into the very close relationship between poet and patron. Hierarchical and conventional, they embrace a personal dimension as well, animating the traditional expressions of devotion and loyalty. Hugh's halfbrother Cú Chonnacht succeeded him in the chieftainship. Ó hEódhasa wrote the inaugural ode <i>‘Fada léighthear Eamhain a n-aontomha’</i>, and when Cú Chonnacht went south in 1601 to join the Spaniards who had landed at Kinsale his ollam accompanied him. However, Ó hEódhasa was wounded in a skirmish and returned to Fermanagh, where he wrote <i>‘Fada óm intinn a hamharc’</i> for Cú Chonnacht . Of more than fifty surviving poems, about half are to the Maguires. He also dedicated poems to Red Hugh <a href=""entry://O'Donnell, Red Hugh""><span class=""links"">O'Donnell </span></a>, Toirdhealbhach Luineach Ó Néill, and the O'Byrnes of Wicklow, to the widow of one of whom he is said to have proposed marriage. ‘Mór theasda dh'obair Óivid’ celebrates the accession of James I in 1603.

<b>Ó Rathaille, Aodhagán</b><div class=""content""><i>(?1670&ndash;1729)</i><br class=""nLine"" />, poet; born at Scrahanaveele in Co. Kerry. After training in poetry, possibly at a latter-day <a href=""entry://bardic poetry""><span class=""links"">bardic school</span></a>, he appears to have spent some time in Iveleary between Macroom and Bantry . <i>‘Créachta Crích Fódla’</i>, written after the <a href=""entry://Boyne, Battle of the""><span class=""links"">Battle of the Boyne</span></a>, mourns the wounds inflicted upon Ireland. Ó Rathaille removed to Corcaguiney in Co. Kerry, where in <i>c.</i> 1708 he wrote <i>‘Is fada liom oíche’</i>, a heartbroken lament, expressing his grief at the shamefulness of the life he now has to lead. Ó Rathaille continued to lead an unsettled life, spending periods of time in Kerry and Limerick. <i>‘Tionól na bhFear Muimhneach’</i> is an <a href=""entry://aisling""><span class=""links"">aisling</span></a> describing Jacobite preparations in Munster for a forthcoming invasion. Other aisling poems, in particular <i>‘Mac An Cheannaí’</i>, <i>‘Maidean sul smaoin Titan’</i>, and <i>‘Gile na Gile’</i>, bring the form to a striking level of originality. In <i>‘Mac an Cheannaí’</i> Ireland, described as a beautiful maiden, looks south every day, hoping for the ships to come. In <i>‘Gile na Gile’</i> the maiden the poet encounters in the wilderness is Éire [see <a href=""entry://Ériu""><span class=""links"">Ériú</span></a>], but is not named as such. Ó Rathaille describes how the spéirbhean leads him to a mansion where she is held in thrall by an idiot. <i>‘Cabhair ní Ghoirfead’</i>, probably written in 1729, describes his moral and physical devastation. The rhythmic energy of Ó Rathaille's verse owes a great deal to his ability to infuse the amhrán metre [see Irish <a href=""entry://metrics, Irish""><span class=""links"">metrics</span></a>] with the vitality of impassioned speech. Ó Rathaille has been an inspiration and challenge to translators since <a href=""entry://Mangan, James Clarence""><span class=""links"">Mangan's </span></a> version of <i>‘Gile na Gile’</i> in <i>Poets and Poetry of Munster</i> (1849).

The collection <i>Brosna</i> (1964) confronts, in poems such as <i>‘Fiabhras’</i> or <i>‘Na Leamhain’</i>, the possibility that the self may be an illusion. In 1965 Ó Ríordáin resigned from the City Hall, suffering from fibrosis of the lungs.

<b>Ó Tuama, Seán</b><div class=""content""><i>(1926&ndash; ),</i><br class=""nLine"" /> poet, playwright, and critic. Born in Cork, he was educated at UCC, where he studied Irish and English and was taught by Daniel <a href=""entry://Corkery, Daniel""><span class=""links"">Corkery </span></a>. <i>Nuabhéarsaíocht</i> (1950), his anthology of modern poetry in Irish, drew attention to the modernism of contemporary Irish poetry. A founder of Compántas Chorcaí, a Cork drama group, he spent 1955&ndash;6 in France studying modern theatre. In 1961 he published a collection of poems, <i>Faoileán na Beatha</i>, which contains personal lyrics and dramatic meditations. Inspired by the innovations of European theatre, he wrote plays that combined song, direct narration, and swift transitions in mood. These early plays were issued as <i>Moloney agus Drámaí Eile</i> (1966) and <i>Gunna Cam agus Slabhra Óir</i> (1969), the latter about Maghnus <a href=""entry://Ó Domhnaill, Maghnus""><span class=""links"">Ó Domhnaill </span></a>. A sense of betrayed idealism underlies many poems in <i>Saol Fó Thoinn</i> (1978). With Thomas <a href=""entry://Kinsella, Thomas""><span class=""links"">Kinsella </span></a> he edited and translated <i>An Duanaire 1600&ndash;1900: Poems of the Dispossessed</i> (1981). <i>An Bás i dTír na nÓg</i> (1988) contains delicate elegies for his parents. <i>Death in the Land of Youth</i> (1997) has selected poems with translations by Peter <a href=""entry://Denman, Peter""><span class=""links"">Denman </span></a>."

"áes dána","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>áes dána</b> (<i>‘men of art’</i>),<div class=""content"">a collective term in Early Irish for the practitioners of the professions, trades, arts, and crafts. The social rank of the áes dána is reflected in Gaelic <a href=""entry://law in Gaelic Ireland""><span class=""links"">law</span></a> and literature. The most important literary treatment of the áes dána is in <i><a href=""entry://Cath Maige Tuired""><span class=""links"">Cath Maige Tuired</i></a></span>, in which the professionals practising at the court of the king of <a href=""entry://Tara""><span class=""links"">Tara</span></a> are listed as carpenter, smith, fighter, harper, warrior, poet and historian, sorcerer, physician, cupbearer, and brazier.<br class=""nLine"" /><i>Uraicecht Becc</i> (<i>Small Primer</i>), a tract of the 8th or 9th cent., makes a broad distinction between two classes of person enjoying certain immunities in Irish law. Of the áes dána, the poets (filid) belong in the upper rank with the land-owners (lords and freemen) and the clerics. The lower rank comprises ‘the people of every art besides’, who include wrights, blacksmiths, braziers, craftsmen, physicians, judges, druids, and others. Irish law distinguishes between the principal professions (prímdánae) and the lesser professions (fodánae), which are practised by various types of entertainer and by all musicians with the sole exception of the harper, who enjoys a higher status.<br class=""nLine"" />The most highly developed of the professional hierarchies is that of the poets. In <i>Uraicecht Becc</i>, seven types of poet are ranked from the ollam downwards. In addition to the poet (fili), there is another type of versifier, the bard, who lacked the professional training of the fili. There is no mention of the bard in <i>Uraicecht Becc</i>, but other texts supply classifications of bards. Three grades of judge are distinguished in <i>Uraicecht Becc</i>, the lowest grade being competent to decide on matters relating to the áes dána. There are many indications of the close interaction between Church and laity, and it is clear that in early Ireland the áes dána served both ecclesiastical and secular patrons. The term Aos Dána was adopted by the Irish Arts Council (An Chomhairle Ealaíon) for an affiliation of artists receiving pensions from the <a href=""entry://Irish State""><span class=""links"">Irish State</span></a>, set up in 1983 by Charles J.

In 1905/6 the Company toured in Ireland and Britain, and staged <i>The Eloquent Dempsey</i> by Boyle, a political farce; <i>The Doctor in Spite of Himself</i>, the first of Lady Gregory's translations of Molière into Kiltartanese, her version of the <a href=""entry://Hiberno-English""><span class=""links"">Hiberno-English</span></a> dialect of Galway; and Yeats's <i>Deirdre</i>. On 27 February 1907 the Abbey produced Synge's <i>The <a href=""entry://Playboy of the Western World, The""><span class=""links"">Playboy of the Western World</i></a></span>, with Fay playing the lead, the apparent amorality of which caused an uproar. <i>The <a href=""entry://Country Dressmaker, The""><span class=""links"">Country Dressmaker</i></a></span>, a first play by George <i><a href=""entry://Fitzmaurice, George""><span class=""links"">Fitzmaurice</i></a></span>, was staged in October. The Fay brothers, angry that Yeats kept all power to himself, Lady Gregory, and Synge, resigned in 1908. In that year a first play by Lennox <a href=""entry://Robinson, [Esmé Stuart] Lennox""><span class=""links"">Robinson </span></a> (<i>The <a href=""entry://Clancy Name, The""><span class=""links"">Clancy Name</i></a></span>) was staged.<br class=""nLine"" />Synge died in 1909 and the Abbey revived <i>The Playboy</i> to acclaim. In 1910 Lennox Robinson became manager. In his first season he produced Padraic Colum's <i><a href=""entry://Thomas Muskerry""><span class=""links"">Thomas Muskerry</i></a></span>, followed in the same year by Robinson's own <i>Harvest</i>, R. J. <a href=""entry://Ray, R. J.""><span class=""links"">Ray's </span></a>
<i>The Casting Out of Martin Whelan</i>, and T. C. <a href=""entry://Murray, T[homas] C[ornelius]""><span class=""links"">Murray's </span></a>
<i>Birthright</i>, thus inaugurating a new school of realistic drama. When Robinson did not close the theatre on 7 May, the day of Edward VII's death, Miss Horniman withdrew her subsidy. A new patent was granted to the Abbey, despite an attempt by the Theatre of Ireland (a rival group founded in 1906 and headed by Martyn and George <a href=""entry://Russell, George [William]""><span class=""links"">Russell </span></a>) to secure concessionary rights.<br class=""nLine"" />An American tour in 1911 caused much protest, the Irish-Americans disliking <i>The Playboy</i>. In 1914 A. Patrick Wilson replaced Robinson as manager, and was followed in 1915 by St John <a href=""entry://Ervine, St John [Greer],""><span class=""links"">Ervine </span></a> who produced <i>John Ferguson</i>, a play about Northern Protestantism. In 1916 a number of players saw active service in the <a href=""entry://Easter Rising""><span class=""links"">Easter Rising</span></a>, while the Proclamation was printed on the premises. Ervine resigned and J. Augustus Keogh took over. In 1916&ndash;17 six of Shaw's plays were staged, including <i>John Bull's Other Island</i>, <i><a href=""entry://Arms and the Man""><span class=""links"">Arms and the Man</i></a></span>, and <i><a href=""entry://Man and Superman""><span class=""links"">Man and Superman</i></a></span>. In December Robinson's <i>The <a href=""entry://Whiteheaded Boy, The""><span class=""links"">Whiteheaded Boy</i></a></span> was produced.<br class=""nLine"" />In 1918 Yeats organized the Dublin Drama League, with himself as president and Robinson as secretary, to promote foreign and European theatre. In 1919 Robinson returned as manager.<br class=""nLine"" />Robinson was made a director with Yeats and Lady Gregory . George <a href=""entry://Shiels, George""><span class=""links"">Shiels </span></a>, from Ulster, had a play, <i>Insurance Money</i>, performed in 1921, followed by <i>Paul Twyning</i> in 1922. Sean <a href=""entry://O'Casey, Sean""><span class=""links"">O'Casey's </span></a>
<i>The <a href=""entry://Shadow of a Gunman, The""><span class=""links"">Shadow of a Gunman</i></a></span> was produced in 1923 at the height of the <a href=""entry://Civil War""><span class=""links"">Civil War</span></a>. After complex negotiations with Ernest <a href=""entry://Blythe, Ernest""><span class=""links"">Blythe </span></a>, the Abbey became a subsidized National Theatre in 1924. This year also saw the première of O'Casey's <i><a href=""entry://Juno and the Paycock""><span class=""links"">Juno and the Paycock</i></a></span>. In 1926, when O'Casey's <i>The <a href=""entry://Plough and the Stars, The""><span class=""links"">Plough and the Stars</i></a></span>, was produced, there were violent scenes, Yeats declaiming to the audience that they had disgraced themselves again. O'Casey's next play, <i>The <a href=""entry://Silver Tassie, The""><span class=""links"">Silver Tassie</i></a></span>, was disliked by the directors, who rejected it.<br class=""nLine"" />Lady Gregory died in 1932, and in 1935 Yeats decided to expand the board, making F. R. <a href=""entry://Higgins, F[rederick] R[obert]""><span class=""links"">Higgins </span></a>, Brinsley <a href=""entry://MacNamara, Brinsley""><span class=""links"">MacNamara </span></a>, and Ernest Blythe directors, along with himself, Robinson, and Walter <a href=""entry://Starkie, Walter [Fitzwilliam]""><span class=""links"">Starkie </span></a>. When the new board staged <i>The Silver Tassie</i> MacNamara resigned on the grounds that it was blasphemous, and Yeats replaced him with Frank <a href=""entry://O'Connor, Frank""><span class=""links"">O'Connor </span></a>. The years after Lady Gregory's death began a bleak phase of the Abbey's history, extending to the 1960s, in which there was an emphasis on ‘PQ’ (‘peasant quality’, a degraded version of Synge's poetic intensity). Good plays, such as Carroll's <i>Shadow and Substance</i> (1937), or M. J. <a href=""entry://Molloy""><span class=""links"">Molloy's </span></a>
<i>The <a href=""entry://King of Friday's Men, The""><span class=""links"">King of Friday's Men</i></a></span> (1948), were often badly served by a stereotyped production style.<br class=""nLine"" />F. R. Higgins, managing director since 1938, died in 1941, and Blythe succeeded him. In the 1940s theatre in Irish improved, with Tomás <a href=""entry://Mac Anna, Tomás""><span class=""links"">Mac Anna </span></a> staging plays by Mícheál Mac <a href=""entry://Mac Liammóir, Micheál""><span class=""links"">Liammóir </span></a> and Piaras <a href=""entry://Béaslaí, Piaras""><span class=""links"">Béaslaí </span></a>. A School of Ballet, whose productions were choreographed by Ninette de Valois, ceased production in 1933.<br class=""nLine"" />On 18 July 1951 the Abbey burnt down. The company moved to the Queen's Theatre until 18 July 1966 when a new theatre opened on the old site. At the Queen's, the company relied upon the established classics of the Irish theatre and plays by well-known authors. In 1962, however, the Abbey presented Brian <a href=""entry://Friel, Brian""><span class=""links"">Friel's </span></a>
<i>The Enemy Within</i>, and many of his plays have had their first staging there, including <i>The <a href=""entry://Freedom of the City, The""><span class=""links"">Freedom of the City</i></a></span> (1973), <i><a href=""entry://Aristocrats""><span class=""links"">Aristocrats</i></a></span> (1979), and <i><a href=""entry://Dancing at Lughnasa""><span class=""links"">Dancing at Lughnasa</i></a></span> (1990). A new, experimental, tone was set in 1967 with Tomás Mac Anna's production of Brendan <a href=""entry://Behan, Brendan""><span class=""links"">Behan's </span></a>
<i><a href=""entry://Borstal Boy""><span class=""links"">Borstal Boy</i></a></span>. Tom <a href=""entry://Murphy, Tom [Thomas]""><span class=""links"">Murphy's </span></a> first play for the Abbey was <i>Famine</i> (1968), and the theatre continued to produce his work with plays such as <i>The Sanctuary Lamp</i> (1975), <i>The <a href=""entry://Gigli Concert, The""><span class=""links"">Gigli Concert</i></a></span> (1983), and <i>The Wake</i> (1998). Thomas Kilroy's <i><a href=""entry://Talbot's Box""><span class=""links"">Talbot's Box</i></a></span> (1977) made exciting use of stage-space to convey states of mind.<br class=""nLine"" />The 1980s and 1990s brought fresh experimentation and work of high quality, in particular Frank <a href=""entry://McGuinness, Frank""><span class=""links"">McGuinness's </span></a>
<i><a href=""entry://Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme""><span class=""links"">Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme</i></a></span> (1985); Tom <a href=""entry://Maclntyre, Tom""><span class=""links"">McIntyre </span></a> in <i>The <a href=""entry://Great Hunger, The""><span class=""links"">Great Hunger</i></a></span> (1983) chose a non-naturalistic imagist-style; while Stewart <a href=""entry://Parker, Stewart""><span class=""links"">Parker </span></a> anatomized the competing nationalist rhetorics of Ireland in <i><a href=""entry://Northern Star""><span class=""links"">Northern Star</i></a></span> (1985).
