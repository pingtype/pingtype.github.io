"abstract art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>abstract art</b><div class=""context"">A term which can generally be applied to any non-representational art (most <a href=""entry://decorative art""><span class=""links"">decorative art</span></a>, for example), but which is more specifically used, from the early 20th century onwards, to describe painting and sculpture which are deliberately non-representational. Implicit to abstract art is the notion that the work of art exists in its own right, and not necessarily as a mirror of reality. The Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky (1866&ndash;1944) is generally credited with producing the first abstract painting <i>c.</i>1910. In the decade 1910&ndash;20 a number of movements such as <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Suprematism""><span class=""links"">Suprematism</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://De Stijl""><span class=""links"">De Stijl</span></a> either developed or embraced abstraction.

"Abstract Expressionism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Abstract Expressionism</b><div class=""context"">A description generally applied to aspects of modern American painting in the late 1940s and early 1950s which were concerned both with the various forms of abstraction and with psychic self-expression. Abstract Expressionism was more of an attitude than a style, drew on many historical sources from Van Gogh to Matisse and Kandinsky, and embraced a wide variety of paintings ranging from the <a href=""entry://drip painting""><span class=""links"">drip paintings</span></a> of Jackson Pollock to the intensely coloured floating shapes of Mark Rothko. Although the term had been known since the 1920s, when it was used to describe Kandinsky's abstract paintings, it was first employed to describe contemporary painting in 1946, by Robert Coates in the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine. Championed by the critics Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg (who in 1948 declared that the future of western art depended on this phase in American painting), Abstract Expressionism gained widespread acceptance in the 1950s, at first in America and then internationally (the first American movement to do so), the European variant being <a href=""entry://Art Informel""><span class=""links"">Art Informel</span></a>, a term coined by Michel Tapié in 1952."
"Abstraction-Création","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Abstraction-Création</b><div class=""context"">The name taken by a group of abstract painters and sculptors formed in Paris in 1931 in the wake of the first international exhibition of abstract art held there in 1930. The association, whose membership at one time rose to 400, was a loose one embracing a wide range of non-figurative art including <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivism</span></a> (Gabo, Pevsner, and Lissitzky), <a href=""entry://Neo-Plasticism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Plasticism</span></a> (Mondrian), the expressive abstraction of Kandinsky, and some forms of abstract <a href=""entry://Surrealism""><span class=""links"">Surrealism</span></a>. Founded as a successor to the <a href=""entry://Cercle et Carré""><span class=""links"">Cercle et Carré</span></a>, it was intended, as its name implies, to encourage ‘creative’ abstraction. It arranged group exhibitions and published an illustrated annual <i>Abstraction-Création: Art non-figuratif</i> 1932&ndash;6. The emphasis increasingly fell on geometrical rather than expressive or lyrical abstraction due to the predominance of the Constructivists and the supporters of <a href=""entry://De Stijl""><span class=""links"">De Stijl</span></a>. After <i>c.</i>1936 the activities of the association dwindled as some of the leading Constructivists moved from France to England."

<b>academy</b><div class=""context"">[From the ancient Greek <i>akadēma</i>, a gymnasium near Athens where Plato taught his pupils philosophy] an association or school of artists, scholars, etc. arranged in a professional institution. In recent times the term was first used in Italy in the early 15th century to describe meetings of literati. By the 16th century it had been adopted to describe artists' corporations which included the teaching of subjects such as drawing after antique statuary and the live model, and also the study of anatomy, geometry, perspective, history, etc. Thus painting was raised from the status of a mere craft, as had been the case with medieval artists' <a href=""entry://guild""><span class=""links"">guilds</span></a>, to that of a <a href=""entry://liberal arts""><span class=""links"">liberal art</span></a>.

"Action painting","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Action painting</b><div class=""context"">A technique of painting in which paint is dribbled, splashed, and poured over the canvas. Its most famous exponent was the American painter Jackson Pollock (1912&ndash;56). The term was first used in 1952 by the critic Harold Rosenberg in his affirmation of the then current belief that a painting should reflect the actions of its creation. See <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM</span></a>."
"Actions","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Actions</b> (or <i>Aktionismus)</i><div class=""context"">Proceeding from the notion of the artist as actor and from an interest in the nature of the creative process, Actions was a catch-all term for live works presented inside art galleries or on city streets in the late 1950s and the 1960s by artists such as Yves Klein and Piero Manzoni. Around 1960 Klein started to make paintings with ‘living’ brushes&mdash;nude women covered in paint and ‘blotted’ onto canvas. Manzoni's ‘living sculptures’ consisted of individuals signed by the artist. ‘Aktionismus’ was a group of Viennese artists who created thematically related Actions beginning around 1960. They explored Freudian themes of erotic violence using bodily materials such as blood, meat, and semen in specially staged events. Their investigation of the dark side of the psyche was partly a reaction against the interest in creative abstraction which had characterized the 1950s. Actions and Aktionismus both anticipated the <a href=""entry://body art""><span class=""links"">body art</span></a> which followed in the later 1960s and 1970s."

The term was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, though aerial perspective had been known since antique mural painting. Among its most famous later exponents were the landscape painters Claude Lorrain and Turner. The French <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> landscape painter P.-H. de Valenciennes, in his fundamental treatise of 1800, <i>Élémens de perspective</i>…, described aerial perspective as ‘the effect of vaporous or ambient air between different objects’.

Its defining beliefs were in the supremacy of the beautiful and the autonomy of a work of art, adapted from the French concept of <a href=""entry://‘art for art's sake’""><span class=""links"">‘art for art's sake’</span></a>. The artist who most closely approached these ideals was the American James McNeill Whistler, most famously in the <i>Peacock Room</i> he decorated for F. R. Leyland (now in the Freer Art Gallery, Washington, DC). In addition to the peacock, the sunflower was also a popular motif of the Aesthetic Movement, and featured, for example, in the tiles and vases designed by William de Morgan.

By the 16th century the most important deposits were in the Rhineland and a local industry sprang up at Idar-Oberstein, creating gemstones from locally mined agate. In the mid-19th century there were 153 polishing shops in the area and agate had to be imported from Brazil. Agate was used for a wide variety of decorative objects. The Egyptians used it for cylinder seals, ring stones, and small vessels. Later it was employed as a layer stone from which <a href=""entry://cameo""><span class=""links"">cameos</span></a> were cut and mounted into jewellery, as well as other small items such as handles for knives and forks, manicure sets, and pill boxes.

<b>Anglo-Saxon</b><div class=""context"">Art produced in England during the period between the Germanic invasions of the later 5th century and the Norman Conquest of 1066. The invading Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and possibly Frisians settled all over lowland England, pushing the native British into Wales and the far south-west. Paganism replaced the Christianity that had survived from late Roman times and little of artistic interest survives from these years. However, missions of the 6th and 7th centuries encouraged a conversion to Christianity which led to the construction of stone buildings and crosses and the production of liturgical books, vessels, and vestments. At the same time a strong <a href=""entry://Celtic""><span class=""links"">Celtic</span></a> influence from the outlying parts of Britain ensured a rich mixture of traditions. This was severely disrupted, however, by the <a href=""entry://Viking""><span class=""links"">Viking</span></a> invasions beginning in the mid-9th century.

"antique","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>antique</b><div class=""context"">The physical remains of the Greek and Roman world, especially sculpture. The antique proved an inspiration for artists through the ages and, for many, a canon of perfection. Although traces of the antique are found throughout medieval art, it was in the early <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> of the 15th century that there was a strong revival of interest, with artists such as the sculptors Ghiberti and Donatello attesting to their admiration of antique statuary. Famous collections of antique art were formed, such as that of Lorenzo de' Medici in the gardens of San Marco, Florence, where the young Michelangelo first encountered the antique in any quantity. Vasari claimed that the perfection achieved by Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael was due in large measure to their study of the classical statues in the Vatican collection, especially the <i>Apollo Belvedere</i> and the <i>Laocoon</i>. By the mid-16th century the study of the antique was firmly established in the curriculum of many artists. In the following century it was famously defended by G. P. Bellori, collector, theorist, and friend of Poussin, in his essay <i>Idea</i> in which he claimed for classical statuary the embodiment of an absolute beauty. Further statues joined the academic canon such as the <i>Farnese Hercules</i> and the <i>Medici Venus</i>. After the perceived frivolities of the <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> in the first half of the 18th century, the antique was seen as a necessary corrective, extolled in the writings of Winckelmann and manifested in <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical art</span></a>. The perception of classical art was radically altered in the late 18th century by the discoveries of travellers to Greece and the growing realization that many Roman works of art were actually copies of Greek originals. By extension, ‘antique’ can generally be used to refer to anything that is vaguely old. Thus an ‘antiques shop’ can sell a whole variety of fine and decorative art that ranges in ‘antiquity’ from a few decades to (much more rarely) thousands of years."

<b>aquatint</b><div class=""context"">A tonal method of printmaking that is used in conjunction with linear <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etching</span></a>. The technique was invented by Jean Baptiste Le Prince (1734&ndash;81). As in etching, the copper plate is bitten by the action of immersion in acid. Granules of acid-resist laid on the plate result in a fine, reticulated patterning when the plate is inked and printed from, thus producing an effect not unlike a wash. For that reason, aquatint was particularly used in late 18th- and early 19th-century Britain for the reproduction of <a href=""entry://watercolour""><span class=""links"">watercolours</span></a> and topographical views, for example in the prints of Paul Sandby and Thomas Girtin. There are two distinct methods of aquatint. In the first a dust-box is used to blow particles of resin onto the copper plate. In the second the resin is dissolved in alcohol which is brushed over the plate; as the alcohol evaporates, particles of resin are left on the plate. The artist can vary the tones of different parts of his aquatint by subjecting them to bitings in the acid-bath of differing duration. The parts he wishes to print relatively light in tone can be protected by coating with stopping-out varnish, resistant to acid; those that are to print darker can be rebitten."

In 1948 Dubuffet founded a company, the <i>Compagnie de l'art brut</i>, to promote Art Brut, but it folded in 1951. Dubuffet's own paintings were strongly influenced by such art, which he perceived as refreshingly direct and emerging spontaneously from the unconscious mind."
"Art Deco","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

"art history","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>art history</b><div class=""context"">An academic discipline which, as its name implies, is concerned with the historical study of art in all its manifestations throughout the ages to the present day. Its origins can be traced back to the 1st century AD in the writings of Pliny the Elder who, in his <i>Natural History</i>, gave an account of the evolution of <a href=""entry://Greek art""><span class=""links"">Greek</span></a> sculpture and painting. In the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> the Italian artist Giorgio Vasari, in his celebrated <i>Lives of the Artists</i> 1550, chronicled the rise to pre-eminence of Italian artists. His essentially biographical approach was followed by a number of writers in Italy and northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. Art history really took root in western thought and culture in the 19th century, particularly in the German-speaking countries where chairs of art history were established at various universities. Many of the major public museums and galleries were also established around this time. A further intellectual impetus came about in the 1930s, its unfortunate cause being the enforced diaspora of many German and Central European Jewish intellectuals under the persecution of the Nazi regime. Among the many unintentional beneficiaries of this were the Universities of London (with its specialized art-historical institutes) and Princeton. At the heart of the modern conception of art history lies an apparent contradiction between object-based research and a desire to endow the subject with every conceivable degree of intellectual respectability and nuance. The latter has led, particularly since the Second World War, to the ever more frenzied incorporation of aspects of social history, Marxism, structuralism, feminism, <a href=""entry://semiotics""><span class=""links"">semiotics</span></a>, etc., and to the adoption, in the worst cases, of an almost impenetrable jargon which serves to obfuscate rather than clarify understanding and appreciation of the visual arts."
"Art Informel","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Art Informel</b><div class=""context"">A term devised by the French critic Michel Tapié in 1952.

"Art Nouveau","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Art Nouveau</b><div class=""context"">A style which originated in the 1880s and lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, encompassing the decorative arts, design, and architecture. Its characteristics were the use of flowing, expressive lines and <a href=""entry://whiplash curve""><span class=""links"">whiplash curves</span></a>, flower and leaf motifs, and female figures with long, undulating hair. The style developed in Britain from the <a href=""entry://Arts and Crafts Movement""><span class=""links"">Arts and Crafts Movement</span></a>, but influences also included Japanese art, <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Celtic""><span class=""links"">Celtic</span></a> art. From Britain it spread rapidly across Europe and North America. Designs could be seen in <i>The Studio</i> and <i>Jugend</i> magazines, at large international exhibitions, such as in Paris in 1900, and in department stores, such as Liberty in London. The style took its name from a shop, <i>La Maison de l'Art Nouveau</i>, opened in Paris in 1895 by Siegfried Bing, although in Italy it was known as <a href=""entry://Stile Liberty""><span class=""links"">‘Stile Liberty’</span></a> and in Germany and Scandinavia as <a href=""entry://Jugendstil""><span class=""links"">‘Jugendstil’</span></a>. Art Nouveau could be seen throughout Europe in the architecture of Antonio Gaudi (Barcelona) and Victor Horta (Brussels), the interior designs of Henry van der Velde, the glass of Louis Comfort Tiffany and Émile Gallé, the jewellery of René Lalique, the drawings of Aubrey Beardsley, and the posters of Alphonse Mucha. In Scotland, Charles Rennie Mackintosh developed a more rectilinear version in his architecture and furniture, which influenced artists of the Vienna <a href=""entry://Sezession""><span class=""links"">Sezession</span></a> and led the way to progressive industrial design in the 20th century."
"Arte Povera","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Arte Povera</b><div class=""context"">A term coined in 1967 by Germano Celant, ‘Poor Art’ was made from everyday materials such as cement, twigs, or newspapers, in deliberate contrast to traditional sculptural materials such as stone and metal. Its often metaphorical imagery was taken from nature, history, or contemporary life. Arte Povera was a phenomenon of the later 1960s and 1970s and is primarily associated with artists such as Michelangelo Pistoletto and Giulio Paolini, though it can also accurately be applied to non-Italian figures such as Joseph Beuys."
"artists' books","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>artists' books</b><div class=""context"">In the later 1960s and through the 1970s artists frequently turned to the book as a form suited to expressing ideas too complex for a single painting or sculpture. Dianne Vanderlip, to whom the term is credited, organized the exhibition <i>Artists Books</i> at the Moore College of Art, Philadelphia in 1967. International in scope, it consisted of works by major contemporary artists. Books could assume sculptural form as a pop-up book, or they might be investigations of the very nature of the book itself."
"Arts and Crafts Movement","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Arts and Crafts Movement</b><div class=""context"">The name given to the movement begun in England during the second half of the <a href=""entry://Victorian""><span class=""links"">Victorian</span></a> period, which revived handicrafts and raised the standards of design. It was inspired by the writings and teachings of William Morris (1834&ndash;96) and John Ruskin (1819&ndash;1900), who both deplored the effects of mass-production and mechanization on design and harked back to the standards of craftsmanship of the Middle Ages. Morris set out to re-create a hand-crafted industry with his hand-produced <a href=""entry://textile""><span class=""links"">textiles</span></a>, <a href=""entry://wallpaper""><span class=""links"">wallpaper</span></a>, book-designs, and furniture. His ideas and methods had a great influence on many craftsmen and designers of the period, such as C. R. Ashbee, Walter Crane, and A. H. Mackmurdo, and led to the foundation of a number of guilds, including the Guild of Handicraft and the Art Workers Guild. Designs, which usually incorporated naturalistic and plant forms, broke away from traditional Victorian fashions and, through exhibitions, had an influence on the developing <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a> style. The difficulty of producing hand-crafted pieces for a mass market led to the decline of the movement, but it left a legacy of studio potters, weavers, and silversmiths in the 20th century who chose traditional methods over industrial mass-production."

Although its influence was far more limited than, for example, that of the <a href=""entry://Gothic Revival""><span class=""links"">Gothic Revival</span></a>, the Assyrian Revival manifested itself both in the decorative arts, in the form of the ‘Assyrian style’ jewellery produced in England, and in the fine arts in the paintings of a number of later 19th century French <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> painters.

"Barbizon School","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Barbizon School</b><div class=""context"">A group of French landscape painters who worked in the forest of Fontainebleau south-east of Paris <i>c.</i>1830&ndash;70 and were based in the village of Barbizon on the western edge of the forest. The most important members were Jean-François Millet, Théodore Rousseau, Charles Jacque, Jules Dupré, Narcisse Diaz, and Constant Troyon; also associated with them were Camille Corot and Charles Daubigny. Much of their forest imagery of ancient oaks and desolate heaths, sometimes populated by the local peasants and their livestock, was inspired by Dutch 17th-century art. Their choice of imagery represented a reaction to the rapid urban growth of Paris and answered an increasing demand from bourgeois patrons for paintings of rural landscape, often imbued with a melancholy <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a>. The term ‘Barbizon School’ was not actually coined until 1890 when the Scottish dealer David Croal Thomson published his book <i>The Barbizon School of Painters</i>. By that time the so-called Barbizon artists were widely collected in Britain (especially Scotland), Europe, and the United States. Despite claims made for Barbizon as a forerunner of <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a>, its aims, its rural setting, and the techniques it employed were really very different to those of that later Paris-based movement."

"Baroque","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Baroque</b><div class=""context"">A term now generally used to describe art in Europe between <i>c.</i>1600 and <i>c.</i>1750. It is broadly accepted today that ‘Baroque’ implies dynamism and movement (particularly in architecture and sculpture), and a theatricality dependent on a mastery of space and geometry. The <a href=""entry://illusionism""><span class=""links"">illusionism</span></a> of Baroque painting is, nevertheless, founded on the ability to depict reality. All Baroque art, however outwardly dissimilar it may appear, is indebted to the technical achievements of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. The term itself originated in the mid-18th century when used by Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717&ndash;68) in a derogatory sense, to describe the allegedly excessive art of the preceding era. The word ‘Baroque’ was claimed to derive from the Portuguese <i>barroco</i> meaning a ‘pearl or tooth of unequal size’. It therefore implied imbalance and ugliness, as opposed to the ideal beauty and perfection sought by Winckelmann through the imitation of ancient, more particularly <a href=""entry://Greek art""><span class=""links"">Greek</span></a>, art. It was not until the later 19th century that ‘Baroque’, through the writings of a series of distinguished German art historians, lost its pejorative connotations and was considered as an art that was vital and distinct from that of the hallowed Renaissance. The Baroque was originally associated with post-Counter-Reformation Italy and with the concept of the unity of the arts, best exemplified in the work of Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598&ndash;1680), architect, sculptor, theatre set designer, and painter and the presiding artistic genius of 17th-century Rome. Essentially a Catholic art, the Baroque spread from Italy to Spain, the Spanish Netherlands, and later to southern Germany, numbering among its many masters such diverse figures as Borromini, Pietro da Cortona, and Rubens."

This reflected the concept of workshop training as opposed to academic studio education. Such communal idealism, partly a reaction against the horrors of the First World War, was very much based on the thinking of 19th-century writers such as John Ruskin and William Morris. The first Bauhaus was located in Weimar, Germany, and developed from the school of arts and crafts founded there in 1906 by the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar. In 1919 Walter Gropius was appointed as its director. It was Gropius who renamed it the Bauhaus and undertook extensive reorganization. A generally <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionist</span></a> aesthetic was soon replaced by the growing influence of Functionalism and an interest in industrial design, and artists of the calibre of Kandinsky, Klee, Feininger, and Schlemmer came to work at the Bauhaus. In 1925 it removed to Dessau in Anhalt where it acquired a splendid new glass and reinforced concrete building designed and built by Gropius in 1925&ndash;6. The architect Mies van der Rohe later became director and the Bauhaus was forced to transfer to Berlin in 1932 and was finally closed down by the Nazis the following year."

It was particularly prevalent in the United States and France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was characterized by formal planning overlaid with rich detail that was often overemphasized or overscaled. Victor Laloux's Hôtel de Ville in Paris (1897&ndash;1904) and Warren &amp; Wetmore's Grand Central Station in New York (1903&ndash;13) are good examples. The style can be found in Manhattan skyscrapers and town houses, Parisian blocks of flats, and British department stores.

"Biedermeier","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Biedermeier</b><div class=""context"">A style of art which appealed particularly to the middle and upper-middle classes of Germanic Europe (Austria, Germany) and Denmark, between the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the revolutions of 1848. The term was originally coined as a nom de plume, ‘Gottlieb Biedermeier’, by Ludwig Eichrodt and Adolf Kussmaul for publishing poetry in the Munich journal <i>Fliegende Blätter</i> 1854&ndash;7. The German adjective <i>bieder</i>, meaning plain, solid, unpretentious, allied to <i>meier</i> (closest to <i>Maier</i>, the equivalent of Smith or Jones) denotes the parodic nature of the enterprise. Biedermeier painting was distinguished by its concern with everyday subject-matter such as portraiture (particularly of the family), landscape, and still life, as opposed to the grand gestures of <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a>. Its other great achievement lay in the field of furniture, initially modelled very much on the French <a href=""entry://Empire""><span class=""links"">Empire</span></a> style, but with a strong preference for comfort and unpretentiousness allied to fine craftsmanship. By the 1880s the term was generally used in a pejorative sense, but the beginning of its rehabilitation can be dated to the Congress of Vienna exhibition of 1896, and its more general application to the fine arts dates from the Berlin Centennial exhibition of 1906 (itself an exercise in turn-of-the-century nostalgia and an attempt to reorder the history of German art)."

Despite Franz and Maria Marc's claim that they invented the title based on their liking of the colour blue and riding, the name, with its resonance of medieval knights and Christian warrior saints, probably had deeper roots in German and Russian culture. An explanation of the group's aims appeared in the almanac <i>Der Blaue Reiter</i> (the cover of which featured a drawing of a blue horseman by Kandinsky), published in 1912 and edited by Kandinsky and Marc. One of the most important volumes on art produced in the 20th century, it included Kandinsky's statement: ‘None of us seeks to reproduce nature directly…We are seeking to give artistic form to inner nature, i.e. spiritual experience.’ With its bright colours and often semi-abstract images inspired by a wide variety of sources, the Blaue Reiter was perhaps the most lyrical of the <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionist</span></a> movements of the early 20th century.

"Bolognese School","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Bolognese School</b><div class=""context"">Normally understood to refer to the high point of Bolognese achievements in the visual arts, brought about in the late 16th and early 17th centuries by painters such as the Carracci, Guido Reni, Francesco Albani, Lanfranco, and Guercino. The capital of the province of Emilia-Romagna in central Italy, Bologna straddles the Roman Via Emilia linking Rome and Ravenna. It underwent considerable expansion in the 15th century during the rule of the Bentivoglio family and became the second city of the Papal States following the Sack of Rome (1527). As a result of the reforms brought about by the Council of Trent mid-century, Bologna was very much in the vanguard of the Catholic Church. A number of art academies were formed there, the most important being Agostino and Annibale Carracci's founded in 1582, the teaching of which stressed both the study of nature and the importance of Roman classicism, as exemplified by Raphael's <i>St Cecilia</i>, which had arrived in the city in 1515. Annibale was called to Rome in 1595 to work for Cardinal Farnese in his palace there, where he produced his great <a href=""entry://fresco""><span class=""links"">fresco</span></a> cycle <i>The Loves of the Gods</i>. He was rapidly followed to Rome by many of the best Bolognese artists, who proceeded to dominate fresco decoration in Rome for the first 25 or so years of the century, aided in part by the papacy of the Bolognese Gregory XV (1621&ndash;3). The subsequent reputation of the Bolognese school remained high in academic circles: in the 18th century Guido Reni was considered by many to be second only to Raphael. In the 19th century, however, it was condemned by writers such as John Ruskin and has only emerged relatively recently from critical neglect."

"chinoiserie","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>chinoiserie</b><div class=""context"">A term used to describe western imitation of Chinese art, the patterns and motifs of which were adopted relatively early in the West as a result of the opening up of the trade routes to the East; examples included the <a href=""entry://silk""><span class=""links"">silks</span></a> produced in the 14th century at the Lucca silk factories and the blue-and-white <a href=""entry://porcelain""><span class=""links"">porcelain</span></a> manufactured in the late 16th century at the Medici porcelain factory. However, the term <i>chinoiserie</i> is more normally applied to objects produced in the 17th and, especially, the 18th centuries in which Chinese decoration was combined with European motifs. Examples from the 17th century included the pottery produced at <a href=""entry://Delft""><span class=""links"">Delft</span></a>, Nevers, and Southwark; French and English embroideries; Soho tapestries; Dutch and English <a href=""entry://japanning""><span class=""links"">japanned</span></a> furniture; and English <a href=""entry://silver""><span class=""links"">silver</span></a> of the 1680s engraved with oriental figures. In the 18th century the <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> style (whose practitioners included artists such as Watteau and Boucher) encouraged the further proliferation of Chinese motifs such as dragons, exotic birds, and strangely dressed Chinamen. Whole rooms were decorated in the Chinese taste, most notably those lined throughout with porcelain at <a href=""entry://Capodimonte""><span class=""links"">Capodimonte</span></a>, Italy, and Aranjuez, Spain.

It consisted of producing an image on light-sensitive photographic paper by exposing the paper to light which had passed through a glass plate. There were two different techniques of applying the design. One was essentially linear, whereby a whitened glass plate was laid on a black cloth and the design was scratched on to it. The black lines which appeared as a result of the scratching and partial exposure of the black cloth underneath corresponded exactly with the black lines that would be produced when the scratched plate was taken away from the cloth and laid face down in the sunlight over the light-sensitive paper. The other, rarer, method was a tonal one and involved building up, with a brush, layers of emulsion paint on the glass plate before it was placed over the paper for exposure. The thinner the paint, the more light would pass through and the darker that part of the image would print, and vice versa. Cliché-verre was taken up again in America in the 1970s."

<b>Colour Field painting</b><div class=""context"">A type of painting which evolved in the United States in the mid-1950s and continued until the late 1960s. Fields of colour were applied in an abstract manner across the canvas, which was regarded as a two-dimensional plane: conventional pictorial depth and gestural brushwork were rejected. Among the most important of the Colour Field painters were Elsworth Kelly, Morris Louis, and Kenneth Noland. Also known as <a href=""entry://Post-Painterly Abstraction""><span class=""links"">Post-Painterly Abstraction</span></a>, the title of an influential exhibition curated by Clement Greenberg for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1964, which incorporated <a href=""entry://Hard Edge painting""><span class=""links"">Hard Edge painting</span></a>."

"Commedia dell'Arte","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Commedia dell'Arte</b><div class=""context"">The Italian term for ‘professional comedy’, a type of improvised comic play popular in Italy and France from the 16th to the 18th centuries. It was performed in masks by travelling actors each of whom specialized in a character, such as Pantaloon, Harlequin, Scaramouche, and Pulcinella. These characters appeared in painted decorations as early as the 16th century but became popular throughout Europe during the 18th. They provided the models for many <a href=""entry://porcelain""><span class=""links"">porcelain</span></a> figures, produced in groups or series. In 1736 J. J. Kändler began his designs for <a href=""entry://Meissen""><span class=""links"">Meissen</span></a>, which influenced those produced at other factories such as <a href=""entry://Chelsea""><span class=""links"">Chelsea</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Bow""><span class=""links"">Bow</span></a>, Höchst, and <a href=""entry://Capodimonte""><span class=""links"">Capodimonte</span></a>.

<b>commode</b><div class=""context"">A low chest of drawers, originally of French design, for use in the drawing room. Its appearance was usually decorative and it became very popular during the 18th century, as its height matched that of the <a href=""entry://dado""><span class=""links"">dado</span></a> and did not interfere with the wall above. Various types of commodes were given particular names: a <i>commode en console</i>, with long legs and one shallow drawer, was intended to be placed beneath a mirror, a <i>commode à vantaux</i> had doors in front of the drawers, and a <i>petite commode</i> was small, with long legs and tiers of drawers. In the 19th century it was also the name for a bedroom cupboard."
"complementary colours","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>complementary colours</b><div class=""context"">Pairs of colours seen to be in strong contrast to one another. This is achieved through the strengthening of a <a href=""entry://secondary colours""><span class=""links"">secondary</span></a> (i.e. mixed) colour (for example green) when it is placed opposite the <a href=""entry://primary colour""><span class=""links"">primary colour</span></a> (in this instance red) that is adjacently positioned in the colour circle next to the two primaries (blue and yellow) which together make up that secondary colour. Similarly, blue strengthens orange and yellow strengthens violet. The optical interaction of colours in this manner was explored in particular by the chemist Michel-Eugène Chevreul who was appointed Director of Dyeing at the <a href=""entry://Gobelins""><span class=""links"">Gobelins</span></a> tapestry workshops in 1824. He published his chromatic circle of colours in 1839. The findings of Chevreul, and also of the aesthetician Charles Blanc, the latter first published in 1866, were highly influential on the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a> and, to an even greater degree, on Georges Seurat (1859&ndash;91). His pseudo-scientific system of using dots of pure colour relied on the ‘blending’ of these separate colours by the eye, resulting in a vibrancy of colour in his work unmatched by previous artists."

"Computer art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Computer art</b><div class=""context"">Art produced with the aid of or in imitation of what can be achieved with a computer. Computer art first appeared in the 1950s and was usually graphic in nature, consisting of the random arrangement of geometric shapes, for example. However, the increasing sophistication of computers and the development in the 1970s of tools such as the stylus or ‘light pen’ led artists such as Richard Hamilton and David Hockney to work interactively with displays on screens in what amounted to relatively direct ‘painting’ techniques. Computers have also been used to control or programme displays of <a href=""entry://Kinetic art""><span class=""links"">Kinetic art</span></a>."
"Conceptual art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Conceptual art</b><div class=""context"">A widespread movement from the mid-1960s through the 1970s, Conceptual art emphasized the artist's thinking, making any activity or thought a work of art without the necessity of translating it into physical form. The term gained currency after the publication in the summer 1967 issue of <i>Artforum</i> of the <a href=""entry://Minimal art""><span class=""links"">Minimal</span></a> artist Sol Lewitt's article ‘Paragraphs on Conceptual Art’. This dealt with the ‘primary structures’ of Robert Morris, simple polyhedrons which could be ‘visualized’ from any point of view. In its broadest sense, Conceptual art can be traced back to the primitive artist who included the backbone in his drawing of a fish because he ‘knew’ it was there, even though it was outwardly invisible. The <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, with its concern for accurate depiction, could be said to have firmly placed the emphasis on the perceptual rather than the conceptual."

<b>concrete</b><div class=""context"">A mixture of water, fine and coarse sand and stone gravel, and a <a href=""entry://binder""><span class=""links"">binder</span></a>, concrete was first used by the Romans, who employed it extensively in <a href=""entry://dome""><span class=""links"">domes</span></a> and <a href=""entry://vault""><span class=""links"">vaults</span></a>, often in association with brick or stone reinforcing. Since the 17th century Portland cement (a mixture of lime and clay) has been used as the binder, considerably increasing the strength of concrete. Reinforced with steel, concrete has revolutionized building construction and can be used for beams, <a href=""entry://column""><span class=""links"">columns</span></a>, and many other structural functions."
"Concrete art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Concrete art</b><div class=""context"">A term coined by Theo van Doesburg (1883&ndash;1931) who issued the manifesto <i>Art Concret</i> in Paris in 1930. It is applied to abstract art which is deliberately without any figurative or symbolic content. According to van Doesburg a picture had no other justification than ‘itself’ and was therefore completely autonomous: its construction would be simple and mechanical. Concrete art was taken up by the <a href=""entry://Abstraction-Création""><span class=""links"">Abstraction-Création</span></a> group who ensured its survival beyond the Second World War."
"connoisseurship","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>connoisseurship</b><div class=""context"">A specifically visual knowledge gained from looking at works of art. Connoisseurship requires the gift, and the constant exercise, of a keen visual memory and the ability to sympathize with the process of artistic creativity. A connoisseur (from the French <i>connaisseur</i>, ‘one who knows’) is someone who is often described as having ‘a good eye’ with which to attribute works of art, to distinguish different styles or periods. The term is particularly associated with the art historian Bernard Berenson (1865&ndash;1959), who identified so many Italian <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> works of art (and frequently provided certificates of authentification)."

"Constructivism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Constructivism</b><div class=""context"">A movement that originated in Russia <i>c.</i>1914, it dominated art there after the 1917 Revolution and spread to the West in the 1920s. It was characterized by its abstraction and its use of industrial materials such as glass, plastic, and standardized metal parts. Its archproponent, Vladimir Tatlin, put forward the concept of the ‘artist-engineer’, fulfilling the social needs of Soviet post-Revolutionary society. With the triumph of Constructivism and the founding of the Institute of Art Culture (<a href=""entry://Inkhuk""><span class=""links"">Inkhuk</span></a>) many Russian artists wedded to the more traditional concepts of the fine arts left their native country: among the émigrés were figures such as Wassily Kandinsky and the brothers Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner. In Russia, with the devaluation of traditional easel painting, Constructivism exerted its clearest influence in a number of other fields including architecture, <a href=""entry://typography""><span class=""links"">typography</span></a>, and theatre. Tatlin's wooden model for the gigantic monument (never built) he planned for the Third International became the symbol of Soviet Constructivism."
"Continuità","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Continuità</b><div class=""context"">A group of artists founded in Rome in 1961 with the critic Giulio Carlo Argan as its spokesman.

They came in different grades of hardness and were available either as sticks of crayon or encased in wood like a <a href=""entry://pencil""><span class=""links"">pencil</span></a>. Although the tonal range of conté crayons might seem similar to other black drawing materials, they have their own distinctive qualities. Whereas <a href=""entry://charcoal""><span class=""links"">charcoal</span></a>, for example, quickly clogs the surface of textured paper with its splintering, fragmentary particles, conté crayon is easier to control and the degree of darkness is directly proportionate to the pressure employed. Its most telling use was by Georges Seurat in his drawings of the 1880s."

"Cubism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Cubism</b><div class=""context"">Generally acknowledged to have been the most significant movement in 20th-century art, Cubism was created by Georges Braque (1882&ndash;1963) and Pablo Picasso (1881&ndash;1973) in the period 1907&ndash;14. It abandoned the traditional fixed viewpoint which had dominated western painting since the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, and instead explored a multiplicity of viewpoints to develop an accumulated idea of the subject. The term was first applied to a group of landscapes painted by Braque at L'Estaque in the summer of 1908 and rejected for exhibition that year at the <a href=""entry://Salon d'Automne""><span class=""links"">Salon d'Automne</span></a>. A member of the selection jury is said to have denigrated them as <i>petits cubes</i>, ‘little cubes’. By 1911 the word ‘Cubism’ had entered the English language. The stylistic genesis of Cubism lay in the late art of Cézanne (whose memorial exhibition had been held in 1907) and African art. These two influences were clearly visible in Picasso's <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> (Museum of Modern Art, New York) of 1906&ndash;7. Mature Cubism can be divided into two phases: <a href=""entry://Analytical Cubism""><span class=""links"">Analytical</span></a> (1909&ndash;11) and <a href=""entry://Synthetic Cubism""><span class=""links"">Synthetic</span></a> (1912&ndash;14). The former often involved an analysis of objects into their compound elements and rearranging them on the canvas in a new pictorial order. In both Picasso's and Braque's work there is a complex interpenetration of small intricate planes which fuse with one another and the surrounding space. There is little if any sense of spatial recession and colours are muted, often virtually monochromatic greys or browns. Braque was the first of the two to introduce stencilled lettering into his compositions around this time. He also experimented with mixing materials such as sand and sawdust with his paint to create new textures, thereby emphasizing the idea that a picture was a physical object in its own right rather than an illusionistic representation of something else. Picasso produced his first <a href=""entry://collage""><span class=""links"">collages</span></a> in 1912, heralding a break with the cerebral near-abstraction of Analytical Cubism. In Synthetic Cubism, in which the Spanish painter Juan Gris also played a vital role, the image was built up from pre-existing elements or objects, rather than being created through a process of fragmentation, as in Analytical Cubism. Colour was also reintroduced. By 1911 Cubism had become the dominant avant-garde idiom in Paris and was first shown in any quantity at the <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon des Indépendants</span></a>. In 1912 two of the many artists who had been attracted to Cubism, Gleizes and Metzinger, published <i>Du Cubisme</i>, which was translated into English in 1913. The English-speaking public was acquainted with Cubism by Roger Fry's second Post-Impressionist Exhibition held in London in 1912 and by the 1913 Armory Show in New York, in both of which Cubist works figured prominently. Among the movements which took Cubism as a starting point or an essential component were <a href=""entry://Constructivism""><span class=""links"">Constructivism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Futurism""><span class=""links"">Futurism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Orphism""><span class=""links"">Orphism</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Purism""><span class=""links"">Purism</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Vorticism""><span class=""links"">Vorticism</span></a>. Cubism was not confined to painting: a significant quantity of Cubist sculpture was produced, not least by Picasso, and, in the brief flowering of Cubism there before the First World War, Prague saw the construction of an innovative form of Cubist architecture."

"Dada","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Dada</b><div class=""context"">An anarchic movement which flourished <i>c.</i>1915&ndash;<i>c.</i>1922 and ridiculed traditional notions of form and beauty. Originally European, though it also took root in America, it was partly born out of the disillusionment engendered by the First World War. The name was apparently chosen at random by inserting a penknife in the pages of a dictionary (‘dada’ is French for ‘hobby-horse’). It was first used in 1916&mdash;by the poet Tristan Tzara according to the artist Jean Arp. Both were members of Dada's founding group of artists and writers in Zurich. Traditional media such as painting and sculpture were abandoned in favour of techniques and devices such as <a href=""entry://collage""><span class=""links"">collage</span></a>, <a href=""entry://photomontage""><span class=""links"">photomontage</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://ready-made""><span class=""links"">ready-mades</span></a>. Chance was credited with a valid role in the act of creation. By the end of the war Dada had spread to a number of German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, and Hanover, but it also took root almost simultaneously in New York, independently of Europe. Its main practitioners were figures such as Duchamp, Picabia, and Man Ray. Other centres of Dada came to include Paris and Prague. Although it was short-lived, Dada was highly influential and inspired many later anti-art movements in the course of the 20th century."

Exposure can last from 6&ndash;7 to 30&ndash;40 minutes, therefore many of the earliest daguerrotypes were landscapes rather than portraits. The process was invented by Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre (1787&ndash;1851), based in part on the experiments of his former collaborater Niepce, and made public in 1839.

It can be divided into the following major dynastic periods: Early (<i>c.</i>2925&ndash;<i>c.</i>2575 BC); Old Kingdom (<i>c.</i>2575&ndash;<i>c.</i>2150 BC); First Intermediate (<i>c.</i>2150&ndash;<i>c.</i>2018 BC); Middle Kingdom (<i>c.</i>2008&ndash;<i>c.</i>1630 BC); Second Intermediate (<i>c.</i>1630&ndash;<i>c.</i>1540 BC); New Kingdom (<i>c.</i>1540&ndash;<i>c.</i>1075 BC); Third Intermediate (<i>c.</i>1075&ndash;<i>c.</i>750 BC); Late (<i>c.</i>750&ndash;332 BC). There was also a Graeco-Roman postscript, dating from 332 BC&ndash;AD 395, testimony to the later domination of the Mediterranean world by Greece and Rome. Ancient Egyptian art reflected that civilization's religious beliefs, according to which the terrestrial life was merely a brief interlude compared to the eternal life which followed. The complex pantheon of deities (less familiar than that of <a href=""entry://Greek art""><span class=""links"">Greek</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Roman art""><span class=""links"">Roman art</span></a>) was in a constant state of flux, however, and varied according to the shifts in regional domination. The principal Egyptian gods were Amun, normally worshipped as a sun-god; Mut, originally a lion-headed war-goddess; Khonsu, a moon god; Isis, the divine mother goddess, patroness of the dead and of magic, wife of Osiris, and mother of Horus; Osiris, god of the next world, fertility, and regeneration, and with whom the dead king was identified; Horus, hawk and sky-god, with whom the living ruler was normally associated; Ptah, the creator god and patron of craftsmen, usually shown as a mummified king; Anubis, the jackal-headed god of <a href=""entry://necropolis""><span class=""links"">necropolises</span></a> and embalming; Re, the sun-god, closely identified with the king, who held the title ‘Son of Re’; Thoth, a god who appears in ibis and baboon forms and was patron of writing and scribers and god of the moon; Bastet, a cat or lioness goddess and a popular fertility deity; Bes, primarily a domestic god, protector of women in childbirth and associated with dance and music, depicted as a grotesque dwarf. The major monuments of Egyptian art consisted of its funerary statues and decorated tombs, with the <a href=""entry://pyramid""><span class=""links"">pyramids</span></a> of the Pharoahs and the smaller tombs of the lesser nobility situated in the extensive funerary districts. The most significant flowering of the arts occurred during the New Kingdom when great structures were erected along the entire length of the Nile valley in Egypt and Nubia. Enormous stone temples were built for the worship of the gods. A typical temple consisted of a massive gateway, a colonnaded courtyard, a hall of columns, a shrine chamber, and one or more chapels. The design of the <a href=""entry://column""><span class=""links"">columns</span></a> and <a href=""entry://capital""><span class=""links"">capitals</span></a> was based on plants, such as the palm and papyrus, and the walls were decorated with plant motifs. Some of the greatest temple remains are to be found at Luxor, Karnak, Abydos, Tell el-Amarna, and Abu Simbel. Stylistic conventions in painting remained relatively unchanged throughout the dynastic periods: the eye is shown frontally in a profile face and the shoulders are turned round so as to be presented parallel to the picture plane. A new note of three-dimensional realism was introduced in the Graeco-Roman period, however, and the coffin portraits of Roman Egypt are remarkably accurate portraits of real individuals."

"Egyptian Revival","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Egyptian Revival</b><div class=""context"">A style of architectural and interior design, using ancient Egyptian motifs, which is normally described as a severe and monumental variation of <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a>. It reached its peak in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, stimulated in part by Napoleon's Egyptian campaign of 1798, which inspired two major publications, both lavishly illustrated, Baron Vivant Denon's <i>Voyage dans la basse et la haute Égypte pendant les campagnes du Général Bonaparte</i> (1802) and the <i>Description d'Égypte</i> (1809&ndash;28), compiled by a team of scholars and published in 20 volumes. Architects and designers therefore had access to a wide repertoire of Egyptian ornament, including sphinxes, <a href=""entry://obelisk""><span class=""links"">obelisks</span></a>, pyramids, mummycases, etc. Among the outstanding achievements of the Egyptian Revival were Thomas Hope's ‘<i>Egyptian</i>’ or ‘<i>Black Room</i>’ (destroyed 1850) created for his London house off Portland Place, London; the enormous ‘Service égyptienne’ made at <a href=""entry://Sèvres""><span class=""links"">Sèvres</span></a> 1810&ndash;12 to Napoleon's directions and later presented by Louis XVIII to the Duke of Wellington (Apsley House, London); William Bullock's Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London (destroyed 1811); and numerous funerary buildings and tombs in such celebrated cemeteries as Père-Lachaise in Paris, and Kensal Green and Highgate, both in London."
"Eidophusikon","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Eidophusikon</b><div class=""context"">[From the Greek, ‘image of nature’] a miniature theatre, without actors, intended as an ‘imitation of Natural Phenomena, represented by Moving Pictures’. The Eidophusikon depicted events such as sunrise and sunset, storms, running waters, and conflagrations. It was devised by the painter Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg (1740&ndash;1812), who had extensive experience of theatre design, and was first performed in 1781 in his house in Lisle Street, London. The performances took place in an aperture approximately six feet wide, three feet high, and up to ten feet deep. There was often musical accompaniment. The Eidophusikon greatly impressed the painters Reynolds and Gainsborough and inspired the latter to devise his shadow box, constructed of movable glass plates, on which he painted landscapes and other subjects."
"Eight, The","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Eight, The</b><div class=""context"">A group of American artists formed by Robert Henri in 1907 to protest at the restrictive exhibition policies of the National Academy of Design. Other members included John Sloan, William Glackens, George Luks, Everett Shinn, Arthur Davies, Maurice Prendergast, and Ernest Lawson. They exhibited as an independent group at the Macbeth Galleries, New York in 1908, attracting large crowds and subsequently touring the exhibition to eight other cities, mainly in the Mid-West. Their nonacademic, realist art won a large public following. The 1908 exhibition is now considered a landmark in the foundation of a popularist, democratic American art.

"Elizabethan","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Elizabethan</b><div class=""context"">Describes the art and architecture produced in England during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558&ndash;1603). In painting (especially portrait <a href=""entry://miniature""><span class=""links"">miniatures</span></a> by artists such as Nicholas Hilliard) there was emphasis on exquisite detail and surface pattern, with vivid yet subtle colouring and complex silhouettes. Netherlandish influence was strongly felt in both sculpture and ornament, and in the <a href=""entry://decorative art""><span class=""links"">decorative arts</span></a>
<a href=""entry://embroidery""><span class=""links"">embroidery</span></a> was highly prized. The leading architect was Robert Smythson whose work at Longleat House (Wiltshire), Wollaton Hall (Nottinghamshire), and Hardwick Hall (Derbyshire) was characterized by a synthesis of traditional English planning allied to <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> classicism. Typical features included a love of symmetry, extensive fenestration, and the use of carved ornamental <a href=""entry://strapwork""><span class=""links"">strapwork</span></a>."
"Elizabethan Revival","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Elizabethan Revival</b><div class=""context"">An antiquarian style popular in England from the 1830s to 1860s and inspired by the <a href=""entry://Elizabethan""><span class=""links"">Elizabethan</span></a> style of the 16th century. In architecture the full Elizabethan vocabulary was employed with the reappearance of features such as gables, octagonal turrets, tall chimney-stacks, and heraldic ornament. The great hall reasserted its importance as the most important room in the house, wainscots were in oak, fireplaces were in the 16th-century style, and elaborate plaster ceilings of lozenge design were favoured. Possibly the most elaborate example of Elizabethan Revival architecture was Mentmore Towers, Buckinghamshire (1851&ndash;4), designed by Paxton and Stokes for Baron Mayer Amschel de Rothschild. The Revival also extended to furniture, silverware, and <a href=""entry://ceramic""><span class=""links"">ceramics</span></a>."
"emblem","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>emblem</b><div class=""context"">A visual image imbued with a symbolic meaning, usually accompanied by an explanatory text. Printed collections of emblems (emblem books) were extremely popular in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, especially in the Netherlands. A typical example would consist of a picture, motto, and explanatory verse (epigram), prompting thoughts of larger issues, frequently moral in nature. A considerable number of Dutch <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> scenes, by artists such as Jan Steen, carry moralizing meanings derived from emblem books."
"emboss","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

"emerald","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>emerald</b><div class=""context"">Part of the beryl group of stones, the name derives from the Greek <i>smaragdos</i> meaning green stone. Emeralds are a rich green colour, with only the finest specimens being transparent. Cleopatra owned an emerald mine east of Aswan in Upper Egypt. Today the best specimens come from Columbia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. There are many well-known emeralds, including those used in the British Crown Jewels. In the Treasury in Vienna there is a jug 12 cm. high, weighing 2,205 <a href=""entry://carat""><span class=""links"">carats</span></a>, cut from a single emerald."
"Empire","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Empire</b><div class=""context"">A term which, strictly speaking, describes the decorative and architectural style that developed in France during Napoleon's reign as emperor (1804&ndash;14), though it is often extended to cover the period <i>c.</i>1750&ndash;<i>c.</i>1840 and is thereby loosely synonymous with French <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a>. The artistic vocabulary of the Empire style had been set down in Percier and Fontaine's <i>Recueil de décorations intérieures comprenant tout ce qui a rapport à l'ameublement</i> (1801) which basically established a repertoire of antique forms that would be incorporated into furniture, <a href=""entry://ceramic""><span class=""links"">ceramics</span></a>, metalwork, <a href=""entry://textile""><span class=""links"">textiles</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://wallpaper""><span class=""links"">wallpaper</span></a>. This new and powerfully assertive decorative language was seen, for example, at Napoleon's château at Malmaison or in Ingres's preposterously grandiose portrait of <i>Napoleon on the Imperial Throne</i> 1806 (Musée de l'Armée, Paris). Essentially the Roman imperial style, as it was then perceived, was appropriated and adapted by the artists and architects working for Napoleon to promote the hegemony of his regime. Its motifs included imperial eagles, swans, cornucopias, winged torches, and fasces of arms. It was saved from a Cecil B. de Mille-like vulgarity by the superb quality of its practitioners, men such as Jacob-Desmalter, Molitor, Thomire, Odiot, and Biennais."
"Empiricism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Empiricism</b><div class=""context"">A process of analysis based on the proposition that all knowledge derives from experiment and comparative analysis. In the context of <a href=""entry://art history""><span class=""links"">art history</span></a> empiricism has encouraged <a href=""entry://connoisseurship""><span class=""links"">connoisseurship</span></a> and in particular the study of individual works of art. This approach dominated 19th-century art history and found perhaps its most enthusiastic exponent in the Italian Giovanni Morelli who devised a system of artist recognition&mdash;codified in illustrations of the individual treatment of eyes, hands, etc.&mdash;which negated the very intuition on which it was originally based. By the early 20th century a more philosophical and theoretical school of criticism prevailed and came to dominate the discipline."
"emulsion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>emulsion</b><div class=""context"">A suspension of one liquid in another, each of which is normally antithetical to the other, for example oil and water. This is achieved by the addition of an emulsifier such as albumen. Milk and egg yolk are naturally occurring emulsions. The latter is used as the <a href=""entry://medium""><span class=""links"">medium</span></a> in <a href=""entry://tempera""><span class=""links"">tempera</span></a> painting. All emulsions are naturally opaque or milky in their liquid state but become transparent when they dry. Like <a href=""entry://casein""><span class=""links"">casein</span></a>, another emulsion used in painting, egg yolk has the advantage that once set it is not soluble in water."
"enamel","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>enamel</b><div class=""context"">A vitreous substance (usually mixed with colourants) that is fused under heat to a metal surface for decorative purposes. It is normally applied ground up as a paste. The colours in enamels are obtained from metal oxides; for example, <a href=""entry://copper""><span class=""links"">copper</span></a> (green), <a href=""entry://iron""><span class=""links"">iron</span></a> or <a href=""entry://silver""><span class=""links"">silver</span></a> (yellow), <a href=""entry://cobalt blue""><span class=""links"">cobalt (blue)</span></a>, <a href=""entry://gold""><span class=""links"">gold</span></a> (red), manganese (purple). The technique was used by the Romans, Celts, and in medieval times. In the 18th century a method of painting in enamels (mixed in powdered form with oil) was widely employed for portrait <a href=""entry://miniature""><span class=""links"">miniatures</span></a> and for the decoration of objects such as snuff boxes. Enamel colours were also employed for decorating of <a href=""entry://porcelain""><span class=""links"">porcelain</span></a>.

"encarnado","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>encarnado</b><div class=""context"">[Spanish, ‘flesh-coloured’] a term applied in Spanish art to the painting of the flesh parts of wooden sculptures in more or less naturalistic colours. The term <i>estofado</i> (literally ‘quilted’) is applied to the painting of draperies. In the 16th century most of this painting was done with a gloss finish, but in the following century a matt effect came to be preferred. Specialist <i>encarnadores</i> and <i>estofadores</i> undertook much of this work, but it was also sometimes done by distinguished painters such as Velázquez's father-in-law Francisco Pacheco (1564&ndash;1644), who frequently collaborated with the greatest of the Spanish wood sculptors, Juan Martínez Montañés (1568&ndash;1649)."
"encaustic","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>encaustic</b><div class=""context"">[From the Greek <i>enkaustikos</i>, ‘burning in’] a technique of painting with hot wax colours, invented by the ancient Greeks. The colours are made by mixing <a href=""entry://pigment""><span class=""links"">pigments</span></a> with molten beeswax and a little <a href=""entry://resin""><span class=""links"">resin</span></a>. After being painted on to their support they are fused to it by passing a heat source over them, though not so closely that the colours are made to run. The technique was widely used in the ancient world and was said to have been perfected by the Greek painter Pausias in the 4th century BC, who employed it for painting small figures on ceiling panels. Perhaps the most famous surviving examples of encaustic painting are the mummy portraits from Faiyoum, dating from the 1st century BC to around the 3rd century AD. These paintings show traces of brushwork which superseded the earlier use of spatulate instruments. Roman writers praised the durability of encaustic and its ability to withstand the elements: Pliny recorded that it had been used to paint designs on ships. It remained the most common technique of painting in the <a href=""entry://Early Christian""><span class=""links"">Early Christian</span></a> era but fell into disuse around the 8th or 9th century. It was revived, partly through historical curiosity, in the 18th century and was used, for example, by the <a href=""entry://Nazarenes""><span class=""links"">Nazarene</span></a> painter Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld for the murals he painted in the Munich Residenz in 1831, in the mistaken belief that the encaustic paint would be able to withstand harsh conditions. Unfortunately, in unsympathetic conditions such as those of a Bavarian winter, encaustic is susceptible to damage from moisture seeping in from behind. In the later 20th century Jasper Johns used encaustic for his <i>Target</i> and <i>Flag</i> paintings, but the technique attracts few exponents on account of its cumbersome procedures."
"enfilade","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>enfilade</b><div class=""context"">The French system of aligning internal doors so that a vista through a series of rooms is obtained when all the doors are open.

"engraving","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>engraving</b><div class=""context"">The main and oldest <a href=""entry://intaglio""><span class=""links"">intaglio</span></a> technique of printmaking. The design is made on the <a href=""entry://copper""><span class=""links"">copper</span></a> plate with the aid of a <a href=""entry://graver""><span class=""links"">graver</span></a> or <a href=""entry://burin""><span class=""links"">burin</span></a>. Held in the palm of the hand, it is pushed against the copper and cuts a V-shaped groove. The plate is then inked up and printed from, the ink retained in the grooves being forced out under the pressure of the printing process on to the paper. The technique was first developed in the early 15th century in Germany, probably by goldsmiths who wished to keep records of the designs they had engraved on their wares (designs had been engraved into metal as decorations since ancient times). From Germany the technique spread to the Netherlands. Slightly later it developed independently in Italy. The heyday of engraving was probably reached in the late 15th and early 16th centuries with the achievements of Albrecht Dürer in Germany and, in Italy, of the reproductive engravers such as Marcantonio Raimondi. Engraving continued to be used in the succeeding centuries, particularly for reproducing paintings in print form (for example prints after Rubens). Copper being a relatively soft metal and subject to wear, the plates often had to be reworked (see <a href=""entry://state""><span class=""links"">STATES</span></a>). In the early 19th century steel plates were developed which could produce an unlimited number of <a href=""entry://impression""><span class=""links"">impressions</span></a>, and in 1857 the <a href=""entry://steel-facing""><span class=""links"">steel-facing</span></a> of copper plates was introduced.

<b>etching</b><div class=""context"">After <a href=""entry://engraving""><span class=""links"">engraving</span></a>, the most important of the <a href=""entry://intaglio""><span class=""links"">intaglio</span></a> printmaking processes. In etching the design is bitten by acid on to the printing plate. The technique was first adapted in Germany in the early 16th century from the practice of etching decorative designs on to metal, for example suits of armour. In the printmaking process the printing plate is first covered with a layer of acid-resistant <a href=""entry://ground""><span class=""links"">ground</span></a> made of various <a href=""entry://wax""><span class=""links"">waxes</span></a>, <a href=""entry://gum""><span class=""links"">gums</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://resin""><span class=""links"">resins</span></a>. The ground is often darkened, usually with the smoke of lighted tapers; this aids the visibility of the process of drawing the design, which is done with an etching needle into the ground, thus clearing a path through to the printing plate, which is immersed in a bath of acid. The depth of the lines is determined by the strength of the acid and the length of time the plate is left therein. Plates can be wholly or partially ‘rebitten’ by further immersions. Parts of the design can be selected for further ‘bitings’ by covering over or ‘stopping-out’ those sections of the design considered to have been sufficiently bitten already. Once ‘biting’ has been completed, the acid-resistant ground is cleaned off and the plate is inked up and printed from. The more deeply bitten the lines the more distinctly they print. Some of the earliest etchings, such as those by Burgkmair and Dürer, were on <a href=""entry://iron""><span class=""links"">iron</span></a> plates which rapidly rusted; thereafter <a href=""entry://copper""><span class=""links"">copper</span></a> was used (though zinc has also been employed in the 20th century). Etching is often perceived as a more fluid technique than engraving, allowing the artist a greater range of expression. Its greatest masters have included Rembrandt and Piranesi. In the mid-19th century there was a revived interest in etching in France (see <a href=""entry://peintre-graveur""><span class=""links"">PEINTRE-GRAVEUR</span></a>) and England, where its most famous exponent was the American artist Whistler (See <a href=""entry://Etching Revival""><span class=""links"">ETCHING REVIVAL</span></a>)."
"Etching Revival","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Etching Revival</b><div class=""context"">A revival of interest in, at times almost a mania for, <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etching</span></a> in Britain, which lasted from the 1860s to the outbreak of the First World War. Its origins are generally traced to the American artist J. M. Whistler, who settled in England in 1859 and profoundly influenced his brother-in-law, Sir Francis Seymour Haden (a surgeon by profession), his friend Alphonse Legros (who became a celebrated teacher of etching at the Slade School), and his most talented pupil, W. R. Sickert. Other important adherents of the revival included Muirhead Bone, Sir D. Y. Cameron, Frank Short, and William Strang. The type of etching which was promoted was of the open, <a href=""entry://painterly""><span class=""links"">painterly</span></a> variety, as exemplified by the etchings and <a href=""entry://drypoint""><span class=""links"">drypoints</span></a> of Rembrandt. Etching was considered the artistic antidote to the highly worked reproductive (i.e. after paintings) engravings which were so typical of and popular in the Victorian era."

<b>Etruscan School</b><div class=""context"">A group of Italian and British landscape painters working in Italy from the 1860s and formally associated in Rome in 1883&ndash;4. The moving spirit was Giovanni Costa and its members included George Heming Mason and Frederic, Lord Leighton. Their preferences were for a subdued tonality and broad panoramas evocative of the landscape tradition that stretched back through P. H. de Valenciennes to Claude Lorrain. Costa also stressed the importance of sentiment in landscape painting. The work of the group was relatively well known in London, being first exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery until allegiances were switched to the New Gallery."

<b>Etruscan style</b><div class=""context"">A style of delicate <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical decoration</span></a>, the main features of which were the use of contrasting colours of black, white, and terracotta, based on the murals and vase paintings found at Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Rome in the 18th century.

It is now known that these works were either provincial Greek or Roman. The Etruscan style was found in French furniture design and elsewhere on the Continent.

Developed by artists such as Watteau and Chardin in the 18th century, it crossed the Channel, most notably in the art of the French Huguenot émigré Philip Mercier, to become one of the staples of British art in the hands of a succession of artists from Hogarth to Reynolds and Gainsborough. The genre allowed artists to exercise their imaginations with light and attractive vignettes of what Hazlitt was to call ‘subjects of common life’, providing a more palatable alternative to the grand subjects of <a href=""entry://history painting""><span class=""links"">history painting</span></a>.

<b>Fauvism</b><div class=""context"">The first of the major European avant-garde movements to have emerged between the turn of the 20th century and the outbreak of the First World War, it was distinguished by its concentration on a use of colour freed from a purely descriptive role and employed, instead, for expressive and emotional effect. The leading figure of Fauvism was Henri Matisse (1869&ndash;1954), who had come to realize the expressive power of colour when painting with Signac at St Tropez and then with Derain at Collioure in the summers of 1904 and 1905 respectively. The name Fauvism derives from a remark of the critic Louis Vauxcelles at the 1905 <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon d'Automne</span></a> where Matisse and his associates first exhibited as a discernible group. Pointing to a <a href=""entry://Quattrocento""><span class=""links"">Quattrocento</span></a>-like sculpture in the middle of one of the galleries he exclaimed: ‘Donatello [the great early <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> sculptor] entre les fauves’ (Donatello among the wild beasts). In addition to Matisse, other members of the group included Derain, Marquet, Rouault, Vlaminck, Braque, and Dufy. Their work was again prominently in evidence at the 1906 <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon des Indépendants</span></a>. However, Fauvism can best be described as a phase and many of these artists rapidly moved in different directions. Fauvism had drawn on a variety of sources for its inspiration including Gauguin, Van Gogh, the <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionists</span></a>, and Cézanne. It would, in turn, itself prove highly influential, notably on both major German Expressionist movements, Die <a href=""entry://Brücke, Die""><span class=""links"">Brücke</span></a> and <i>Der <a href=""entry://Blaue Reiter, Der""><span class=""links"">Blaue Reiter</i></a></span>."

<b>Fontainebleau School</b><div class=""context"">The art produced for Francis I's palace of Fontainebleau from the 1530s to the first decade of the 17th century. In painting it was characterized by elegant, elongated figures, often in mythological settings. The description Fontainebleau School was first coined by Adam Bartsch in his <i>Le Peintre-Graveur</i> (21 vols. Vienna 1803&ndash;21) to refer to a group of <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etchings</span></a>, some of which were undoubtedly made at Fontainebleau, which is situated some 40 miles south-east of Paris. In fact, printmaking played only a brief role in the history of the Fontainebleau School, mainly in the 1540s. There were also important achievements in <a href=""entry://stucco""><span class=""links"">stuccowork</span></a>, <a href=""entry://grotesque""><span class=""links"">grotesque</span></a> ornament and prints, and sculpture. The development of the palace at Fontainebleau was instigated by Francis I in 1528 after his release from two years of captivity under Charles V. His intention was to rival the greatest art produced for the Italian humanist princes. As France had no great indigenous tradition of mural painting, Francis imported Italian artists, the two most important for Fontainebleau being Rosso Fiorentino and Primaticcio, both of whom engaged French and Flemish assistants. Rosso's main work (he committed suicide in 1540) was in the Great Gallery of the King, Primaticcio's in the Ballroom and the Chamber of the Duchesse d'Étampes. Other major artists who worked at Fontainebleau included Benvenuto Cellini and Niccolò dell'Abbate. Activity at Fontainebleau was severely disrupted by the Wars of Religion (1562&ndash;98), but at the end of the 16th century a programme of decoration was resumed under Henri IV. This phase is now generally referred to as the ‘Second School of Fontainebleau’ which included artists such as Ambroise Dubois, Toussaint Dubreuil, and Martin Fréminet."

"Formalism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Formalism</b><div class=""context"">An artistic and critical approach which stresses form over content in a work of art. According to the formalist doctrine, the qualities of line, colour, and shape are sufficient, and other considerations&mdash;be they representational, moral, or social&mdash;are deemed redundant or secondary. Such a concept played a crucial role in the development of abstract art, that is art freed from any representational functions. In the early 20th century two of the leading formalist critics in Britain were Clive Bell and Roger Fry, while in the 1950s and 1960s the American critic Clement Greenberg was highly influential, urging a ‘purity’ in modern art."

"Futurism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Futurism</b><div class=""context"">An artistic movement of the early 20th century with political implications, Futurism embraced not only the visual arts but also architecture, music, cinema, and photography. Italian in origin, it expressed the disappointment felt there in advanced artistic and political circles at the apparent lack of progress the country had made since its unification in the mid-19th century. Accordingly, stress was laid on modernity, and the virtues of technology, machinery, and speed were promoted by the Futurists, whose founder was the wealthy poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. He published the first Futurist manifesto in the French newspaper <i>Le Figaro</i> in 1909 and was soon joined by the painters Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Luigi Russolo, Giacomo Balla, and Gino Severini, who all publicly proclaimed their allegiance to the movement in March 1910. This was followed by a technical manifesto a month later and further publications included Boccioni's manifesto of Futurist sculpture in 1912. That year also saw the first proper exhibition of Futurist art, which was widely shown around Europe in Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, Zurich, Vienna, and Budapest. The Futurist style drew on a number of sources, including <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionism</span></a> and <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>, and favoured faceted forms and multiple viewpoints allied to a sense of movement and speed. Although the movement lingered on in Italy until the 1930s, it was already moribund there by the end of the First World War. It had considerable influence abroad, however, most notably in Russia, where a vigorous Futurist movement sprang up which numbered Larionov, Goncharova, and Malevich among its principal adherents. In Germany the <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dadaists</span></a> learnt from the noisy publicity techniques of the Futurists, as did the <a href=""entry://Vorticism""><span class=""links"">Vorticists</span></a> in England, while in France both Duchamp and Delaunay were sympathetic to the Futurists' promotion of a modern spirit in art."

This embraced a wide range of styles including <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a>, <a href=""entry://gothick""><span class=""links"">gothick</span></a>, <a href=""entry://chinoiserie""><span class=""links""><i>chinoiserie</i></span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Adam style""><span class=""links"">Adam</span></a>. Georgian as a term retains a more specific connotation with regard to architecture, however, implying an underlying classicism manifested in the large number of well-proportioned domestic buildings erected throughout the period. Urban town planning also developed schemes of great elegance, such as John Wood the Elder and Younger's Circus and Royal Crescent at Bath, and James Craig's New Town in Edinburgh. The Georgian style, if such it can be called, was also exported with great success to the townships of the eastern United States, where countless brick and timber buildings of great charm were erected. Today, on both sides of the Atlantic, the architectural achievements of the period are vigorously promoted and protected by the Georgian Society.

<b>Glasgow Boys</b><div class=""context"">The nickname given by critics to a loosely associated group of predominantly Glasgow-based artists on the occasion of their work being shown at the Grosvenor Gallery, London in 1890. Their art represented a reaction against the Edinburgh establishment's (in particular the Royal Scottish Academy's) control of artistic matters in Scotland at that time. It was also an affirmation of Glasgow's industrially-based rise to a commercial prominence whereby it could justly claim to be the second city of the British Empire after London. The sources for the ‘Boys’ (their own preferred label) work were various and embraced J. F. Millet and the <a href=""entry://Barbizon School""><span class=""links"">Barbizon School</span></a>, French <a href=""entry://Realism""><span class=""links"">Realism</span></a> (above all the paintings of Jules Bastien-Lepage with their peasant subject-matter and earthy palette), and the tonal harmonies of J. M. Whistler. Their own subject-matter was predominantly rural, drawing heavily on the Scottish landscape and the country way of life. Members of the Boys included W. Y. Macgregor, James Paterson, James Guthrie, Joseph Crawhall, George Henry, E. A. Walton, and John Lavery. Their work was first seen together at the annual exhibition of the Glasgow Institute in 1885. The success of the 1890 London exhibiton led to many invitations to exhibit abroad and by 1900 the group had dispersed and very few of its members were still Glasgow-based."

"glass","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>glass</b><div class=""context"">A hard, transparent material, made from silica (sand, quartz, or flint), an alkaline <a href=""entry://flux""><span class=""links"">flux</span></a> (such as potash or soda), and other ingredients such as <a href=""entry://limestone""><span class=""links"">limestone</span></a> or potash of lead, which fuse when heated to a high temperature. In its hot, molten state, the glass, or ‘metal’ as it is known, can be drawn into long threads, blown into bubbles and shaped with tongs, and blown into a <a href=""entry://mould""><span class=""links"">mould</span></a> or press-moulded. Glass can be decorated in many different ways: clear glass can be ornamented with molten threads, painted with enamel colours, engraved with a <a href=""entry://diamond""><span class=""links"">diamond</span></a> point or lapidary wheel, acid-etched, or the surface can be cut to reflect light. The glass can also be coloured with the addition of metal oxide to the raw ingredients or <a href=""entry://frit""><span class=""links"">frit</span></a>.

Glass blowing originated in the first century the first century BC in Syria, leading to the production of a full range of functional domestic objects, particularly drinking vessels. During the Roman Empire techniques spread across Europe and the Near East. By the Middle Ages in northern Europe much glass production was devoted to the creation of coloured pieces for <a href=""entry://stained glass""><span class=""links"">stained glass</span></a>. A major industry developed in Venice from the 10th century and the area is still important for glass making today. In England George Ravenscroft invented a type of <a href=""entry://lead crystal""><span class=""links"">lead crystal</span></a> glass in 1677, the basis of most glass produced today. The 19th century saw great technical advances, particularly in moulding, leading to mass production of both useful items, such as bottles, and decorative objects. The <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a> period saw a reaction against this and the elevation of glass to an art form, as can be seen in <a href=""entry://Tiffany glass""><span class=""links"">Tiffany glass</span></a>, the work of Réné Lalique and Émil Gallé, and continued in the 20th century in the work of Scandinavian glass artists."
"glass painting","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>glass painting</b><div class=""context"">This can refer to two techniques, both of which involve painting on glass.

In the second, oil or glass colours are painted onto glass and viewed from the unpainted side of the glass with the aid of illumination from behind. The English painter Thomas Gainsborough (1727&ndash;88) executed a number of landscapes in this manner (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London)."
"glass prints","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>glass prints</b><div class=""context"">A technique in fashion in the late 17th and early 18th centuries whereby <a href=""entry://mezzotint""><span class=""links"">mezzotints</span></a> were pasted face down on to sheets of glass. They were then rubbed from behind until the paper was worn away but the inked design of the original mezzotint was left adhering to the glass. It was then hand-coloured and the resulting ‘glass prints’ were framed for display."
"glaze","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>glaze</b><div class=""context"">In painting, a glaze denotes a thin layer of transparent or semi-transparent colour laid over another underlying colour. The transparent colours, used in glazes have low refractive indices (e.g. <a href=""entry://lake""><span class=""links"">lake</span></a>, ultramarine, <a href=""entry://copper""><span class=""links"">copper</span></a> resinate, <a href=""entry://Prussian blue""><span class=""links"">Prussian blue</span></a>). The careful building up of final colours by using layers of glazes was common from the 15th to the 19th centuries until the more widespread availability of stronger, industrially produced paints. A glaze is also a glassy coating on a <a href=""entry://ceramic""><span class=""links"">ceramic</span></a>
<a href=""entry://body""><span class=""links"">body</span></a> which provides a waterproof covering and a surface for decoration. The ingredients used are similar to those in <a href=""entry://glass""><span class=""links"">glass</span></a>, with a <a href=""entry://flux""><span class=""links"">flux</span></a> added and then ground to produce an insoluble powder. This can then be sprayed or dusted on to a ceramic body. Alternatively, the powder can be mixed with water and the body dipped into this solution. The water is absorbed by the porous body, leaving a coating of glaze, ready to be fired. The glaze is fused to the body after a <a href=""entry://glost""><span class=""links"">glost</span></a> firing, which follows an initial <a href=""entry://biscuit""><span class=""links"">biscuit</span></a> firing. <a href=""entry://earthenware""><span class=""links"">Earthenware</span></a> was commonly covered with <a href=""entry://lead glaze""><span class=""links"">lead glaze</span></a> or <a href=""entry://tin glaze""><span class=""links"">tin glaze</span></a>, <a href=""entry://stoneware""><span class=""links"">stoneware</span></a> with <a href=""entry://salt glaze""><span class=""links"">salt glaze</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://hard-paste""><span class=""links"">hard-paste</span></a> porcelain with feldspathic glaze.

<b>Gobelins</b><div class=""context"">The most famous of all <a href=""entry://tapestry""><span class=""links"">tapestry</span></a> factories, the name derives from Jean and Philibert Gobelin who set up a scarlet dyeing shop on the outskirts of Paris <i>c.</i>1440. These premises were converted into a tapestry factory before 1607. It was taken over in 1662 on behalf of the Crown under the directorship of Charles Le Brun. Its official title was the <i>Manufacture royale des meubles de la Couronne</i>. It was intended to provide furnishings of magnificence for the royal residences and employed tapestry weavers, painters, bronze workers, furniture makers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. The factory was closed in 1694 on account of the king's financial difficulties, reopened in 1699 and thereafter was devoted solely to the manufacture of tapestries. In the first half of the 18th century the rather grand style of Le Brun was gradually succeeded in the designs for tapestries by the more decorative <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> of Boucher and Oudry. The factory continues in production today. The term is sometimes used generically to denote tapestry, especially imitations of the old Gobelins style."

"Golden Age painting","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Golden Age painting</b><div class=""context"">A term which has gained currency in recent years and is used to describe the flowering of a distinctive Danish school of painting following the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815. The father of the school was Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg who, after training in Paris and Rome, returned to Copenhagen in 1816. Among his pupils was Christen Købke, now acknowledged to be the greatest of the Golden Age painters. Their work is small in scale, fine in detail, and wonderfully conveys a sense of fresh observation of the Danish town- and landscape and of bourgeois life. See <a href=""entry://Biedermeier""><span class=""links"">BIEDERMEIER</span></a>."
"Golden Section","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Golden Section</b><div class=""context"">A harmonic proportional ratio thought to have originated in the circle of Pythagoras (6th century BC) and which was discussed by both Euclid and Vitruvius in their writings. A straight line or rectangle is divided into two unequal parts in such a way that the ratio of the smaller to the greater is the same as that of the greater to the whole. It cannot be expressed as a finite number but an approximation is 8:13 or 0.616:1. With the invention of algebra it became possible to express the ratio as φ (phi, the initial letter of Phidias's name): φ = 1 plus the square root of 5, divided by 2. The Golden Section was thought to have great inherent aesthetic value and was much studied during the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, especially by the mathematician Luca Pacioli, a close friend of Leonardo da Vinci and Piero della Francesca. In Pacioli's book <i>Divina Proportione</i> (1509), illustrated with drawings by Leonardo, the Golden Section is described as this ‘divine proportion’ and Pacioli endeavours, in true Renaissance fashion, to combine the knowledge of antiquity with the Christian faith by claiming that the ratio of the Golden Section is beyond definition and in this respect is like God."

<b>gospel book</b><div class=""context"">A book containing the canonical texts of the four Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

"Gothic","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gothic</b><div class=""context"">The style of art and architecture in Europe which came between the <a href=""entry://Romanesque""><span class=""links"">Romanesque</span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. It was prevalent in Italy from the mid-12th to the early 15th centuries and continued until the early 16th century in northern Europe and the Iberian peninsula. ‘Gothic’ was a term originally coined in a pejorative sense by Italian <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> architects such as Alberti to describe the preceding medieval style of architecture, which they condemned as barbaric and mistakenly attributed to the Gothic tribes who had sacked Rome in the 5th century and were perceived to have swept away the ideals of <a href=""entry://classical""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> art. Gothic architecture, as exemplified in the great cathedrals of northern France and England, was characterized by its qualities of lightness, verticality, and, especially in later Gothic, increasing intricacy. It is generally agreed to have made its first appearance at the abbey church of St Denis, just to the north of Paris, in the 1140s. Common features of Gothic architecture as it developed were the pointed <a href=""entry://arch""><span class=""links"">arch</span></a> (though this also occurs in some Romanesque architecture), <a href=""entry://flying buttress""><span class=""links"">flying buttress</span></a>, and elaborate <a href=""entry://tracery""><span class=""links"">tracery</span></a>."
"Gothic Revival","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Gothic Revival</b><div class=""context"">A term used to describe the architecture and decorative arts produced as a result of a revival of interest in the medieval Gothic style. From hesitant beginnings in England and Scotland in the 18th century, it became in the 19th century one of the principal building styles employed throughout the world. In post-Napoleonic Europe (Napoleon had very much favoured the <a href=""entry://classical""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a> style) Gothic was seen as a valid alternative and a reaffirmation of the cultural traditions and independence of many countries after the traumas of war. The rapid expansion of many industrial cities also created a huge demand for the building of churches, most of them executed in the Gothic style. Prominent architects and designers of the Gothic Revival included A. W. N. Pugin, Viollet-Le-Duc, and George Gilbert Scott. The recognition in print of the movement was established by the publication of Charles Locke Eastlake's <i>A History of the Gothic Revival</i> (1872), later reinforced by Kenneth Clark's youthful masterpiece <i>The Gothic Revival</i>: <i>An Essay in the History of Taste</i> (1928)."

<b>Graffiti art</b><div class=""context"">A phenomenon of the mid-1970s to 1980s and mainly based in New York, Graffiti art was inspired by the colourful graffiti sprayed with aerosol paint onto New York subway trains by the streetwise teenagers of the Bronx and Brooklyn.

The move of Graffiti art from the street to the gallery was heralded in its first major museum exhibition at the Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam in 1983.

"Grand Tour","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Grand Tour</b><div class=""context"">The almost obligatory tour to Italy, usually via Paris, undertaken by the nobility of northern Europe, especially from Britain. It is associated particularly with the 18th century. The participants were normally young aristocrats, dispatched before they had succeeded to the family title and accompanied by their tutors. Rome was the principal destination, though Venice, Florence, and Naples were also extremely popular. The tour actually originated as early as the late 16th century and the term ‘Grand Tour’ was first used in print by Richard Lassels in his <i>Voyage of Italy</i> (1670), in which he claimed no one could understand Livy and Caesar if they had not undertaken the ‘Grand Tour of France and the Giro of Italy’. By the second half of the 18th century such an experience had become almost de rigueur and possible itineraries expanded to include southern Italy and Greece. Apart from the perceived educational benefits, both cultural and sexual, of such tours, they also played a crucial part in the collecting activities of the wealthy. Many of the <a href=""entry://Classical""><span class=""links"">classical</span></a>, <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, and <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> masterpieces in British country house collections were acquired on these Grand Tours or as a result of interests which they awakened. The Napoleonic Wars (1793&ndash;1815) greatly restricted the possibilities of travel in Europe, but when peace was finally re-established travellers flocked again to Italy. By mid-century, however, the coming of the railways and cheaper travel and the development of tour companies such as Thomas Cook changed the nature of foreign travel fundamentally, opening it up to the middle classes."

<b>Greek art</b><div class=""context"">A term used to describe the art and architecture of ancient Greece, which consisted of many independent city states around the Aegean Sea bound together only by a shared language and religion.

Nevertheless, the artistic achievements of the Greeks were enormously innovative and formed the basis for much of the later art and architecture of the Romans, by whom they were conquered in the middle of the 2nd century BC. Ancient Greek art is divided into three main periods: <a href=""entry://Archaic""><span class=""links"">Archaic</span></a> (<i>c.</i>700&ndash;<i>c.</i>480 BC), <a href=""entry://Classical""><span class=""links"">Classical</span></a> (<i>c.</i>480&ndash;323 BC), and <a href=""entry://Hellenistic""><span class=""links"">Hellenistic</span></a> (323&ndash;27 BC).

It began in Europe, stimulated by the archaeological rediscovery of Greek architecture which gathered momentum from the early 18th century onwards. The style first manifested itself in mid-18th-century England in the Scottish architect James Stuart's garden buildings at Hagley Hall and Shugborough. By the turn of the century it was being widely adopted for urban planning schemes and new public buildings in both Europe and the United States. The Scottish capital city of Edinburgh took to the style so enthusiastically that it came to be known as the ‘Athens of the North’, exemplified by W. H. Playfair and C. R. Cockerell's unfinished National Monument astride Calton Hill, a conscious evocation of the Parthenon. It was Cockerell who is credited with the first use of the phrase ‘Greek Revival’ in a lecture he delivered in 1842 to the Royal Academy in his capacity as Professor of Architecture there."

These revealed a hitherto unknown side of Roman art in the playful decorations found in the underground rooms (<i>grotte</i>) of these buildings. They were soon copied by Italian artists and their designs were disseminated in the form of prints. The use of grotesque decoration spread throughout Europe in the 16th century.

The silver mark indicates that it is 92.5 per cent pure&mdash;from 1300 a leopard's head was used for this, which changed to a lion in 1544. The leopard's head became the town mark of London and, as assay offices opened in the provinces, each adopted their own mark, such as the town coat of arms in Chester, an X in Exeter, a castle in Edinburgh, and an anchor in Birmingham. The date letter was used in London from 1478 and then in other parts of the country. It usually followed an alphabetical sequence but was unique from year to year and to each assay office. From 1363 the maker's mark was added, at first a device, but by the 18th century initials were used. A variation to these marks occurred between 1697 and 1720 when a higher standard of silver was established and the sterling and town marks were replaced by Britannia and a lion's head in profile. From 1784 until 1890 the sovereign's head was added to the marks, to indicate that duty had been paid.

Happenings implied a rejection of the traditional concepts of both craftsmanship and permanence, furthermore they were not restricted to the confines of an art gallery.

<b>ideal landscape</b><div class=""context"">A type of landscape painting, developed at the beginning of the 17th century in Italy, in which nature is depicted as it ought to be, rather than as it is.

The compositions of such pictures, populated by small-scale figures, are formally balanced, with a carefully staged recession into the far distance. Annibale Carracci (1560&ndash;1609) is generally credited with the invention of ideal landscape, which found its greatest exponents in Claude Lorrain (1600/5&ndash;82) and Nicolas Poussin (1594&ndash;1665).

"Impressionism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Impressionism</b><div class=""context"">A movement in French painting, associated particularly with Monet, Pissarro, Sisley, Degas, and Renoir, characterized by the use of a bright palette, broken brushwork, and an emphasis on depictions of contemporary life and landscape. The term was originally coined as a form of satire by the critic Louis Leroy reviewing the first exhibition of the <i>Société Anonyme des artistes, peintres, sculpteurs, graveurs…</i>which opened on 15 April 1874, at the Parisian studio of the photographer Nadar on the boulevard des Capucines, and is nowadays referred to as the first Impressionist exhibition. Monet's painting <i>Impression: Sunrise</i> 1873 (Musée Marmottan, Paris) was singled out for particular attack, Leroy maintaining that the term ‘impression’ was too personal and should not have been used in a picture title (<i>effet</i>, i.e. an effect of nature, would have been preferable). In fact, ‘impression’ had a complex duality in 19th-century artistic theory, implying on the one hand the reception by the artist of the scene presented to him, on the other the subjective trace of the artist's own nature or temperament in the resulting work of art. The term ‘Impressionist’ rapidly went into widespread usage as a result of the 1874 exhibition and a further seven shows were staged, the last in 1886. There were a number of important contributory factors to the evolution of Impressionism: a growing interest in colour theory and the laws of complementary contrasts; an increasing liking, among landscape painters, for working <i>en</i>
<a href=""entry://plein-air""><span class=""links""><i>plein air</i></span></a>; and a growing dissatisfaction with the official <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salon</span></a> exhibitions where many of the young Impressionists experienced frequent rejection. By the time of the final 1886 Impressionist exhibition, many of the participants had begun to experience considerable success, lauded by avant-garde critics and increasingly patronized by enlightened collectors. It was in the 1890s, however, that Impressionism really began to find its international market, especially in America (Britain by contrast was curiously slow to appreciate its merits). Paradoxically, it was also around this time that Impressionism began to be perceived, in certain right-wing religious circles in France, as the art of materialism, concerned only with the everyday. As a style it had become widespread, attracting a plethora of minor and repetitive adherents. Nevertheless, in the course of the 20th century Impressionism can fairly claim to have become the most widely popular of all movements with art lovers and collectors.

Kandinsky's ideals soon proved uncongenial to the more widespread desire to create an art suitable for a Communist utopia. After Kandinsky was voted out of office, two different programmes emerged. ‘Laboratory art’ involved a rationalizing, analytical approach often using traditional artistic materials (such as paint and canvas); ‘production art’, as its name implies, placed the emphasis more on designers and craftsmen working for machine production.

The term came into common use in the 1970s but it was only in the 1980s that artists regularly specialized in this particular art form. Whereas early Installations were viewed as temporary, many are now intended to be permanent and are viewed as collectable. One well-known example is <i>20:50</i>, a piece by the British sculptor Richard Wilson (<i>b.</i>1953) which consists of a room filled with used sump oil (now in the Saatchi Collection, London)."

"Insular","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Insular</b><div class=""context"">A term applied to the art produced in northern Britain and Ireland between the 6th and 9th centuries.

International Gothic was distinguished by its elegance and fascination with delicate, naturalistic detail. Its origins lay in the courtly style developed in France in the middle of the 13th century with its predilection for elongated and supple form and a new appreciation of sensuous qualities. This style was fused to the Italian interest in naturalism by the Sienese painter Simone Martini (<i>c.</i>1285&ndash;1344) who went to Avignon <i>c.</i>1340&ndash;41 to work for the papal court there. International Gothic first fully established itself in Franco-Flemish Burgundy with artists such as André de Beauneveu, Melchior Broederlam, and the Limburg brothers. From there it spread to northern Italy where it attracted artists such as Gentile de Fabriano and reached its most ornate achievement in the art of Pisanello."

"iron-gall ink","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>iron-gall ink</b><div class=""context"">An ink, first used for writing, made from a suspension of iron-salts in gallic acid obtained from the nutgall, a growth on certain oak trees caused by disease. Originally black, iron-gall ink turns brown with time as the acid eats into the paper with damaging results. Many drawings and manuscripts executed with this ink are, as a result, often extremely fragile. Iron-gall ink was originally used for writing, the first extant examples dating from around AD 200. The earliest iron-gall drawings are from the beginning of the 13th century. Most artists of the early Italian <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> employed it for drawing. Many artists of the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a> era also employed it, such as Rembrandt and his pupils, the Italians Guercino and Pier Francesco Mola, and the Frenchmen Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin.

Islamic visual arts are decorative, colourful, and, in the case of religious art, non-representational. The Koran regulated every detail of the lives of the Faithful but gave few precise rules for the arts apart from banning the production of cult images.

"Japanese prints","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Japanese prints</b><div class=""context""><a href=""entry://woodcut""><span class=""links"">Woodcut</span></a> prints produced in Japan from the 17th century. They were made by transferring the artist's original design on to a wood block, inking it, and printing it on to paper, with a different block being used for each colour, so building up the picture. The prints were created entirely by hand by a team of craftsmen, overseen and employed by a publisher. Artists such as Shunsho (1726&ndash;92) and Utamaro (1754&ndash;1806) were centred in Edo (modern Tokyo), and depicted images of beautiful women, courtesans, actors, and scenes from the Kabuki theatre, all known as <a href=""entry://Ukiyo-e""><span class=""links"">‘Ukiyo-e’</span></a>, or ‘Pictures of the Floating World’. During the 19th century artists including Hokusai (1760&ndash;1849) and Hiroshige (1797&ndash;1858) depicted landscapes and country life. After Japan opened up to trade with the West in the 1850s, artists could not compete with western technical innovations such as photography, and the art began to die out. When the prints themselves arrived in Europe, with their fluent outlines, large areas of flat colour, and unusual compositions, they influenced a whole generation of artists including the <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>."

<b>japonaiserie</b><div class=""context"">A 19th-century European decorative style based on Japanese works of art. The opening up of Japan to western trade in the 1850s led to an enormous export of Japanese objects to Europe and their exhibition for the first time in London in 1858 and 1862.

Unglazed pieces were stacked up in the kiln for the <a href=""entry://biscuit""><span class=""links"">biscuit</span></a> firing, but once the <a href=""entry://glaze""><span class=""links"">glaze</span></a> was applied the wares needed to be separated to avoid the melting glaze sticking them together.

"Kinetic art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Kinetic art</b><div class=""context"">The word ‘kinetics’ comes from the vocabulary of science and was first used in the middle of the 19th century to denote the branch of dynamics concerned with the motions of bodies and the forces acting upon them, as opposed to ‘statics’. ‘Kinetic’ entered the artistic lexicon in 1920 and refers to all forms of art in which movement appears to take place or actually does so. Movement can be in the object itself or in the eye of the viewer and is often induced by the effect of light. Kinetic art could take many forms including <a href=""entry://automata""><span class=""links"">automata</span></a>, mechanical marionettes, and motion pictures. The widely differing pioneers of Kinetic art included Boccioni, Duchamp, the brothers Gabo and Pevsner, and Moholy-Nagy (for whom the painter was a co-ordinator of ‘light-relations’ and the sculptor one of ‘voluminal and kinetic relations’). Later manifestations of Kinetic art have included structures concerned with light and electrically driven sculptures.

<b>lithograph</b><div class=""context"">A <a href=""entry://planography""><span class=""links"">planographic</span></a> method of printmaking based on the antipathy of grease and water. Invented in Munich in 1798 by Aloys Senefelder, lithography involves drawing or brushing the design with a greasy, lithographic ink on to a specially prepared and smoothed limestone which is kept moist. The stone (lithography means ‘drawing on stone’) is then inked with lithographic ink which only adheres to those areas of the stone previously fixed with lithographic ink, the rest of the ink is repelled by the water. The stone is then printed from in a flat-bed lithographic press. Lithography was particularly popular in Germany, France, and England in the early to mid-nineteenth century for reproducing topographical drawings and watercolours in publications devoted to landscape. It also attracted some of the great masters of <a href=""entry://Romanticism""><span class=""links"">Romanticism</span></a> such as Delacroix and Géricault. Later in the century it was taken up by a number of the most distinguished French artists including Manet, Redon, and, above all, Toulouse-Lautrec. Lithography was used throughout the 20th century by some of the most distinguished artists including Braque, Picasso, and Miró. It should be remembered, however, that the actual production and supervision of printing lithographs is normally undertaken by specialist printers and not the artists themselves. Original drawings could be made by the artists in lithographic chalk or ink on a sheet of transfer paper which could be laid down by the printer on to the printing surface and the design transferred. Alternatives to limestone as a printing surface included zinc (from about 1830) and aluminium (from about 1890). A recent development, offset lithography, involves the picking up of the design by a rubber roller from the original lithographic stone or plate. Large print-runs can then be easily and rapidly made from the roller and, because the original image has been ‘reversed’ twice, it prints the right way round. Offset lithography has all but replaced the traditional technique of <a href=""entry://letterpress""><span class=""links"">letterpress</span></a> for book printing. Lithographs printed in a combination of different colours are known as <a href=""entry://chromolithograph""><span class=""links"">chromolithographs</span></a>."

"lost-wax casting","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>lost-wax casting</b><div class=""context"">[French, <i>cire perdue</i>] the most common method of making cast metal sculpture, it has been known since ancient times and had been brought to a high level of technical sophistication by the ancient Greeks as early as the 5th century BC. The original model is made in wax and is then encased in a clay <a href=""entry://mould""><span class=""links"">mould</span></a> known as the <a href=""entry://investment""><span class=""links"">investment</span></a>. This is then heated up and the wax poured away leaving a hollow interior, the inside surface of which carries a negative impression of the original wax model. Molten alloy, such as <a href=""entry://bronze""><span class=""links"">bronze</span></a>, is then poured into the mould and allowed to cool. The clay mould is then broken and removed, leaving an alloy replica of the original wax model. This is the lost-wax process in its simplest form, used to produce a solid metal sculpture. However, most lost-wax casting is more sophisticated and produces a hollow sculpture, the advantages of which are that less metal is used, the sculpture is lighter, and the problem is avoided whereby solid metal sculpture can be prone to cracking in the casting process. The necessary extra element in hollow lost-wax casting is a <a href=""entry://core""><span class=""links"">core</span></a>, usually made of clay or plaster with <a href=""entry://grog""><span class=""links"">grog</span></a>, placed inside the original wax model. When the core, wax, and outer mould are heated up and the wax runs out a hollow sandwich is created into which the molten alloy is then poured. After cooling the outer mould and core are removed leaving a hollow metal sculpture. In the process metal pins called <a href=""entry://chaplet""><span class=""links"">chaplet</span></a> pins are used to keep the core in place. The original wax model would also have been fitted with wax ‘branches’ extending out through the clay mould. These create channels into which the molten alloy is poured during the casting process. These channels are also cast, of course, and have to be removed from the surface of the sculpture once it has cooled down after the casting process."
"Louis XIV style","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Louis XIV style</b><div class=""context"">The term used to cover the arts in France in the period associated with the reign of Louis XIV (1643&ndash;1715), especially after he assumed direct personal control in 1661. The prototype for Louis's allembracing unity of architecture, painting, interior decoration, and landscape gardening could be found at the <a href=""entry://château""><span class=""links"">château</span></a> of Vaux-le-vicomte, created in the 1650s for Nicolas Fouquet, <i>Surintendant des Finances</i>. The three major figures who had worked there&mdash;architect Louis Le Vau, garden designer André Le Nôtre, and painter and designer Charles Le Brun&mdash;were engaged by Louis to transform the King's hunting-lodge at Versailles, just to the west of Paris. The massive complex developed at Versailles became a major statement and display of monarchical power and magnificence. It was characterized by sumptuous materials, exquisite craftsmanship, a profusion of classical motifs, and strict formality of organization. A desire for symmetry and axial planning determined the layout of the gardens and interiors. Ceilings were painted with allegorical or mythological scenes glorifying the Sun King (as Louis became known). Furnishings were on a grand scale and tapestries were extensively displayed, sometimes hung above a marble <a href=""entry://dado""><span class=""links"">dado</span></a>.

"Mannerism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Mannerism</b><div class=""context"">A confusing term, subject to radically different interpretations but generally used to describe the art in Italy which directly succeeded that of the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> and preceded the <a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a>. Its first widespread use, in the 17th century, was pejorative, implying an over-elaborate distortion, an imbalance, and a neurosis first discerned in the later work of Michelangelo and in the followers of Raphael. ‘Typical’ Mannerist painters were artists such as Parmigianino, with his elegant elongation of the human form, and Pontormo, whose compositions exhibit a disturbing psychological tension. This essentially negative view held sway until the mid-20th century when John Shearman propounded an alternative theory whereby <i>maniera</i> (‘style’ in English, originating in French <i>manière</i> and borrowed from the French courtly literature of manners) should be equated with skill and the overcoming of difficulty. He cited impressive historical proof of the positive connotations of the term: a sonnet of 1442 listing <i>maniera</i> among the heaven-sent gifts of Pisanello, Vasari (1552) including it as one of the five qualities which made his century, the 16th, superior to the preceding one. Although ‘Mannerism’ is mainly applied to Italian art, there was also ‘Northern Mannerism’, used to describe the work of north European artists such as Goltzius, Uytewael, and Spranger active in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, whose twisting, intricate compositions reached a large audience through the highly accomplished prints made after them by printmakers such as Müller and Sadeler. Many of these artists worked from the 1580s onwards for the Emperor Rudolf II at his court in Prague."

<b>Marxist art theory</b><div class=""context"">Derives from the writings on social theory of Karl Marx (1818&ndash;83) and his associate Friedrich Engels (1820&ndash;95). Elaborating on his fundamental critique of capitalism (<i>Das Kapital</i>) and his belief in the value, both social and economic, of labour, Marx set down in his scattered writings on the subject the proposition that art should not, by circumstances of demand, be concentrated in certain individuals (such as Raphael), but should be democratized. ‘In a communist society, there are no painters, but at most men who, among other things, also paint’ (<i>Die Deutsche Ideologie</i>). This view, with considerable and varying modifications, has exerted considerable influence in the 20th century, most particularly in the development of the study of the social history of art and, more recently, of the <a href=""entry://New Art History""><span class=""links"">New Art History</span></a>."

Medals are not unique works of art and, like <a href=""entry://print""><span class=""links"">prints</span></a>, are produced in numbers. The medal's original function was to honour, satirize, or criticize the subject of the portrait. The production of medals originated in early <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> Italy, inspired by an interest in the art of antiquity and its coinage and small-scale sculpture. The first true Renaissance medal was that produced <i>c.</i>1438 by Pisanello, perhaps with the assistance of Leon Battista Alberti, and depicted John VIII <i>Palaeologus</i>. Enthusiasm for the medal spread throughout western Europe, fuelled by an interest in Renaissance culture, and has continued to this day. Medals are manufactured in one of two different techniques. Until the second half of the 16th century most medals were produced by the <a href=""entry://casting""><span class=""links"">casting</span></a> method.

It was founded in 1710 by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, in the Albrechtsburg Fortress in Meissen, near Dresden. Early experiments into porcelain production were conducted by Johann Friedrich Böttger (1682&ndash;1719) who had been working as an alchemist. He first made an extremely hard, dense, red <a href=""entry://stoneware""><span class=""links"">stoneware</span></a>, which could be polished and engraved. After further experimentation he created a hard-paste, white porcelain in 1709, with <a href=""entry://clay""><span class=""links"">clay</span></a> from Colditz in Saxony. In 1720, the factory's management was taken over by Johann Gregor Herold, who perfected the process of decorating on porcelain with coloured <a href=""entry://enamel""><span class=""links"">enamels</span></a>. Many early pieces were inspired by Chinese and Japanese examples from Augustus the Strong's personal collection. In 1733 Johann Joachim Kändler was appointed chief modeller and produced a large number of figures for which the factory became famous. At the height of the <a href=""entry://Rococo""><span class=""links"">Rococo</span></a> period, these delicate porcelain objects were popular and much imitated throughout Europe. During the Seven Years War (1756&ndash;63) the factory came under Prussian control, production slowed down, and tastes changed. The era of dominance and prosperity came to an end and the <a href=""entry://Sèvres""><span class=""links"">Sèvres</span></a> factory took the lead. Attempts were made to adapt its style but the factory was never again to regain its supremacy in Europe. Meissen continued to produce porcelain throughout the 19th century and is still in operation today.

The word <i>Merz</i> was chosen by chance, being extracted from a business letterhead for the <i>Commerzbank</i> that Schwitters was cutting up for his collages, which he called <i>Merzbilder</i> (Merz pictures). Around 1923 he built his first Merzbau in his house in Hanover and in the same year began publication of his magazine <i>Merz</i> which appeared until 1932."
"metal cut","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />

"mezzotint","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>mezzotint</b><div class=""context"">(‘Half-tone’), a tonal technique of printmaking working from dark to light. The printing plate (usually <a href=""entry://copper""><span class=""links"">copper</span></a>) is first roughened overall with a spiked tool known as a <a href=""entry://rocker""><span class=""links"">rocker</span></a>. Inked and printed from, this would just print black. However, graduated highlights are scraped out with a ‘scraper’ or <a href=""entry://burnisher""><span class=""links"">burnisher</span></a>. These areas hold correspondingly less ink and print lighter. The finest and most richly inked mezzotint impressions are the earliest, produced before the rich copper <a href=""entry://burr""><span class=""links"">burr</span></a> thrown up by the rocker has worn away. Such impressions were highly prized in 18th- and 19th-century England, where the mezzotint (known abroad as ‘<i>la manière anglaise</i>’) enjoyed its greatest popularity. The technique had been ‘invented’ by <i>c.</i>1642 by a German soldier, Ludwig von Siegen, who used a <a href=""entry://roulette""><span class=""links"">roulette</span></a>, however, to roughen his printing plate. The invention of the rocker is credited to Prince Rupert of the Rhine <i>c.</i>1661. He instructed a number of professional printmakers, mainly Dutch, in the technique and they brought it over to England in the late 17th century. There it was rapidly adopted as the preferred manner for reproducing painted images during the great age of portraiture from Kneller to Reynolds. In the early 19th century mezzotint was also employed to reproduce the landscape designs of Turner's <i>Liber Studiorum</i> (1807&ndash;19) and Constable's <i>Various Subjects of Landscape</i> (1830&ndash;3). Around 1820 steel plates began to be used. Harder than copper and producing less burr, they produced blander, less subtle impressions."

"miniature","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>miniature</b><div class=""context"">A term that originated in the early 18th century as an anglicization of the Italian <i>miniatura</i>, which in turn derived from the medieval Latin <i>miniare</i>, ‘to rubricate, illuminate’, adapted from the Latin <i>minium</i>, the ‘red lead’ used to mark or rubricate particular words in manuscripts. Due to a mistaken etymology, ‘miniature’ has now become associated with ‘minute’, and is used to describe small paintings, usually portraits, the vogue for which enjoyed wide popularity in Europe from the early 16th to early 19th centuries. Miniature likenesses could be carried or worn and often conveyed a more intimate interpretation of character than could be displayed in a large-scale oil painting. Most early portrait miniatures, such as those produced by Nicholas Hilliard (1547&ndash;1619), were painted in <a href=""entry://watercolour""><span class=""links"">watercolour</span></a> and <a href=""entry://gouache""><span class=""links"">gouache</span></a>, at first on <a href=""entry://vellum""><span class=""links"">vellum</span></a>, later on thin sheets of <a href=""entry://ivory""><span class=""links"">ivory</span></a> or card. From the 17th century <a href=""entry://enamel""><span class=""links"">enamel</span></a> was also used. Reflecting their jewel-like appearance, many miniatures were circular or oval in shape, though later miniatures were often larger in size and rectangular in imitation of their cousin, the portrait in oil.

Its aim is a concentration on the pure qualities of colour, form, space, and materials without the distractions of ‘composition’. The term was first used in print by the British philosopher Richard Wollheim in 1965, though some have credited its invention to the American critic Barbara Rose. It first emerged in the 1950s and flourished particularly in the 1960s and 70s. Minimal art was mainly an American, as opposed to a European, phenomenon and among its main practitioners were Carl Andre, Don Judd, and Tony Smith in sculpture, and in painting Frank Stella (early work), Elsworth Kelly, and Kenneth Noland."
"Minoan","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Minoan</b><div class=""context"">A term applied to the art produced in ancient Crete between <i>c.</i>2500 and <i>c.</i>1100 BC. It was first used in 1894 by the archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans and derived from the Palace of Minos (named after the legendary king of Crete), which was one of the buildings he uncovered during his lengthy excavations at Knossos. The Minoans were non-Greek speakers and their art shows many eastern influences. Minoan art embraced sculpture, pottery, and wall-painting in addition to architecture.

<b>Modernism</b><div class=""context"">A broadly used architectural term and movement, tracing its origins to Le Corbusier's (1887&ndash;1966) designs such as that for the ‘floating box’ (i.e. it was on stilts) Villa Savoye, Paris 1933, the five main points of which were a grid, free plan, free facade, strip windows, and a roof garden. These features were adapted by Mies van der Rohe (1886&ndash;1969) for his seamless glass pavilions. In Modernist architecture there are no projecting features such as <a href=""entry://cornice""><span class=""links"">cornices</span></a>, mouldings, <a href=""entry://architrave""><span class=""links"">architraves</span></a>, or skirting boards.

"monastery","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>monastery</b><div class=""context"">A complex of buildings of a religious community living apart from the world. Monasticism originated in Egypt with the hermits who chose to live alone. A more organized monastic existence was conceived in the 4th century AD by St Pachomius, whereby monks still lived on their own but shared certain buildings such as a church and a refectory. The monastic architecture of medieval times evolved from the 6th century onwards in response to the rules established by St Benedict at Monte Cassino, though other orders such as the Cistercians also later established monasteries. The earliest surviving complete plan for a monastery is that of <i>c.</i>820 AD for St Gall in Switzerland.

"museum","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>museum</b><div class=""context"">A building used for the storing and exhibition of objects including antiquities, natural history, and works of art. The etymological root is the Greek <i>mouseion</i>, originally meaning anything consecrated to the Muses: a hill, a shrine, a garden, a grotto, a festival, even a textbook. In time it came to be associated with ancient Greek temples dedicated to the Muses of the arts and sciences. They were originally used for funerary cult ceremonies, but by the 4th century BC Aristotle, in the school or Lyceum he founded, had a <i>mouseion</i> for the collection and classification of specimens in his pioneering zoological studies. Ptolemy I Soter established the pattern for the <i>mouseion</i> in the ancient world when he had one incorporated in his plans for the city of Alexandria (<i>c.</i>290&ndash;48 BC). Its primary functions included the recovery and preservation of texts and objects, the collection of samples, and the encouragement of study. Such institutions became widespread in the ancient world, with the Greek word <i>mouseion</i> slipping into Latin by transliteration (i.e. ‘museum’), though it denoted ‘Muses’ shrine' (a collection of objects) rather than a picture gallery (<a href=""entry://pinacoteca""><span class=""links"">pinacotheca</span></a>). In the Middle Ages inspirational collections of precious and semi-precious objects were kept in the <a href=""entry://sacristy""><span class=""links"">sacristies</span></a>, treasuries, and Schatzkammern of larger churches and <a href=""entry://monastery""><span class=""links"">monasteries</span></a> and consisted of bejewelled relics of saints and martyrs. Princes, and later merchants, formed analogous collections which included natural curiosities: narwhal (known as ‘unicorn’) horns, ostrich eggs, fossil bones, dried crocodiles, and so on. They also contained coins and gems as well as, increasingly, paintings and sculpture. With the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> revival of antiquity, fragments of sculpture were given higher status and arranged for artists to study from, for example the Medici garden near San Marco in Florence, and the Belvedere and Capitol in Rome. In the 17th century royal, aristocratic, and church collections were increasingly opened to public access. The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford University opened its doors in 1683, for the benefit of staff and students, and in the 18th century further major collections were opened to the public&mdash;the Uffizi, Florence (1743), the Capitoline Museum, Rome (1734), and the Belvedere, Vienna (<i>c.</i>1781). The British Museum, London opened in 1753 as a public collection. In 1793, as a result of the French Revolution, the Louvre in Paris was declared a public museum and a symbol of egalitarianism. In the 19th century many further national museums and galleries followed, statements of nationhood as much as institutes of collection and learning&mdash;among them the Altes Museum, Berlin (1830), the National Gallery, London (1824), the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne (1856), and the National Museum, Tokyo (1872). Many of the great American museums were also formed in this period&mdash;the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1870), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (1870), the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1876), and the Art Institute of Chicago (1879). The 20th century has seen the setting up of many museums devoted to modern works of art&mdash;the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1929), the Musée Nationale d'Art Moderne, Paris (1936). Furthermore, the museum building has itself come to be seen as a work of art in its own right with the standard classical temple-like structure abandoned in favour of striking avant-garde architecture, for example Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum at Bilbao, Spain."
"musée imaginaire","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>musée imaginaire</b><div class=""context"">A concept deriving from the writings of André Malraux (1901&ndash;76), author, war hero, and French Minister of Culture 1959&ndash;69. In the first volume of his major work <i>La Psychologie de l'art</i>, entitled <i>Le Musée imaginaire</i> (published in 1946 and translated in 1949 as <i>Museum without Walls</i>), he proposed that all works of art, widely available in the modern age to a mass audience through the means of photographic reproduction, should be appreciated for their formal qualities, whatever they originally signified."

They worked in a wide range of media embracing painting, book illustration, posters, <a href=""entry://stained glass""><span class=""links"">stained glass</span></a>, and theatre décor.

These showpieces of National Socialist art were enormous, each containing over 1,000 works from a total of more than 500 exhibitors, many of which were distributed to museums throughout the country. National Socialist art was typified by its chilling banality, a form of debased academic art. Militarism aside, it occupied itself with blonde, Nordic, Herculean males, their hardworking wives, and their children born seemingly of some ghastly genetic attempt at racial conformity, all of whom were placed in idealized urban and rural settings conceived to the glory of the German state and its people (<i>Volk</i>)."

"Nazarenes","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Nazarenes</b><div class=""context"">The name given to a group of early 19th-century Austro-German painters who wished to rediscover the purity and morality they perceived to have been inherent in the art of the late Middle Ages and in the early <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>. Among the artists they admired were Dürer, Perugino, and the young Raphael. The term was originally coined in derision of their affectation of wearing biblical dress and hairstyles. The nucleus of the group was established in 1809 by six students at the Vienna Academy, including Friedrich Overbeck and Franz Pforr, who formed an association, the Brotherhood of St Luke (<i>Lukasbrüder</i>), named after the patron saint of painting. In keeping with their ideals they lived together in quasi-monastic style, with Overbeck, Pforr, and two other members leaving for Rome where they occupied the disused monastery of S. Isidoro, and were joined by Peter von Cornelius and others. By the time they completed the second of their two major commissions for monumental <a href=""entry://fresco""><span class=""links"">frescoes</span></a>, those in the Casino Massimo, Rome 1817&ndash;29, the group had ceased to exist as a coherent entity. Cornelius moved to Munich where he attracted a large number of pupils and assistants who spread the Nazarene style to other German cities, notably Düsseldorf. Some of the Nazarene ideals were exported to Britain by the Scottish painter William Dyce and later exerted some influence on the <a href=""entry://Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood""><span class=""links"">Pre-Raphaelites</span></a>."

Although the first notable practitioner was perhaps Edward Hicks (1780&ndash;1849), an American Quaker preacher famous for his religious scenes, naïve art really gained widespread popularity only in the 20th century, particularly through the writings of the critic Wilhelm Uhde after the First World War, and through a series of exhibitions of naïve art. Henri Rousseau (1844&ndash;1910), ‘Le Douanier’ (‘the customs officer’), was the first well-known naïve painter. Other now famous names have included Alfred Wallis and Grandma Moses), and in the decades following the middle of the 20th century there was a particular concentration of naïve painters in what is now the former Yugoslavia, particularly Croatia."

It embraced the <a href=""entry://fine art""><span class=""links"">fine</span></a> and <a href=""entry://decorative art""><span class=""links"">decorative arts</span></a> and architecture, and its masters included the painter David (<i>The Oath of the Horatii</i>, Louvre, Paris), the sculptor Canova, and the architects Ledoux and Soane. The term was actually devised later, in the 1880s, and was originally pejorative, denoting ‘pseudo-classical’, and particularly directed at Jacques-Louis David and his school. Neoclassicism is now seen to have achieved a purity of expression, however, and would have been referred to by its practitioners as the ‘true’ or ‘correct’ style. It was based on the study of antique art, which was to be imitated but not slavishly copied, and thus embody what were perceived to be the general and permanent principles of the visual arts as formulated by the ancients. Its first great theorist was J. J. Winckelmann (1717&ndash;68), whose <i>Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks</i> was published in English translation in 1765."

The cord was looped over the obi (belt) of a kimono and the netsuke held it in place. The literal translation of netsuke is ‘root-fix’ and its origins may lie in a farmer or woodcutter using a piece of root wood to make a simple toggle. During the 17th and 18th centuries netsuke developed in popularity and sophistication and many woodcarvers and artists devoted their spare time to creating them. After Japan opened up to the West in 1868, many craftsmen specialized in netsuke, mainly for export. Demand for them in Japan declined as western dress became popular. <a href=""entry://ivory""><span class=""links"">Ivory</span></a>&gt; and wood were the most common materials used to create a wide variety of forms in miniature, such as animals, mythical creatures, figures, Noh masks, and plants."

Among the most important artists of the group were Fry, Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant, and, briefly until they left in the autumn of 1913 to form the Rebel Art Centre, Wyndham Lewis, Frederick Etchells, and Edward Wadsworth.

"opal","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>opal</b><div class=""context"">An iridescent gemstone, the name probably derives from the Sanskrit word <i>upala</i> meaning stone. The special characteristic of opal is its opalescence, the rainbow colours caused by the reflection and scattering of light from minute silica spheres within the mineral and changing with the angle of view. The body colour varies from clear or milky, as in white opal, to grey or black, as in the most precious form, black opal. The Romans used opals from Czechoslovakia in their jewellery. It was not until the late 19th century that opals were found in Australia, which is still the best area for opal mining today."

The simplest is the Tuscan, supposedly derived from the Etruscan-type temple. It has a base and capital and a plain column. The Doric is probably earlier, however, its Greek version having no base, as on the Parthenon. The Ionic Order, with its twin <a href=""entry://volute""><span class=""links"">volute</span></a> capitals, originated in Asia Minor in the mid-6th century BC.

"Orientalism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Orientalism</b><div class=""context"">The depiction of the Near East by western artists, primarily in the 19th century. The Orient became generally associated with the exotic in the popular imagination and provided a rich vein of subject-matter for much of the century. Interest in the area was initially stimulated by the French government's <i>Description de l'Egypte</i>, published in Paris in 24 volumes (1809&ndash;22) in the aftermath of Napoleon's Egyptian campaign. Travel opened up the whole region stretching from Egypt through to Turkey. Oriental costume, architecture, history, and customs excited the interest of artists as diverse as Eugène Delacroix, Horace Vernet, Sir David Wilkie, and William Holman Hunt. Biblical history could be reinterpreted in its original setting. Eroticism could be depicted in the harem or the slave market. Those with a penchant for scenes of violence were catered for in pictures of execution and massacre. A 20th-century counterpart could be found in films of biblical and historical epics such as those directed by the legendary Cecil B. de Mille. Nowadays there is an increasingly strong market for Orientalism, with the artists who specialized in this genre commanding high prices."
"original print","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>original print</b><div class=""context"">The problem of defining what constitutes an ‘original print’ has given rise to much debate, not least with regard to the art of the 19th and 20th centuries. The division of labour between the artist who creates the original design and the specialist printer who facilitates the production of the print lies at the heart of the matter. The industrialization of the reproduction of images and the invention of photomechanical techniques have also blurred the boundaries of definition. With techniques such as <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etching</span></a> it is normally the artist himself who carries out all stages of the printmaking process. However, <a href=""entry://lithograph""><span class=""links"">lithography</span></a> or <a href=""entry://screenprinting""><span class=""links"">screenprinting</span></a>, for example, usually involve a collaboration between artist and printer.

František Kupka (the most important figure omitted by Apollinaire) and Delaunay claimed an analogy between abstraction and music in their works.

"palette knife","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>palette knife</b><div class=""context"">A painter's tool consisting of a flexible, flat blade of tempered steel with a round end, set in a wooden handle. It serves a number of purposes: handling paint on the <a href=""entry://palette""><span class=""links"">palette</span></a>, scraping, mixing <a href=""entry://pigment""><span class=""links"">pigments</span></a> with oil or other vehicles. As early as the the 17th century artists used palette knives for spreading paint on to the canvas prior to achieving their painterly effects with the paint brush. In the 19th century, however, a number of painters, most famously Gustave Courbet (1819&ndash;1877), abandoned the traditional smooth finish achieved with the paint brush for a much more extensive use of the palette knife. Courbet's paintings had a crudity of finish allied to a strong, elemental power that offended reactionary critics but which attracted and influenced Cézanne and Pissarro."

<b>Palissy ware</b><div class=""context""><a href=""entry://earthenware""><span class=""links"">Earthenware</span></a> produced by the potter Bernard Palissy (1510&ndash;90) at Saintes and in Paris. Palissy was a scientist and a geologist and he created pieces in imitation of ponds and rivers, with naturalistically modelled snakes, lizards, snails, and foliage. He cast from life reptiles, crustaceans, and leaves and attached them to plates, dishes, and plaques, which were then covered with greenish-grey <a href=""entry://glaze""><span class=""links"">glazes</span></a> to give a slimy appearance.

"Palladian","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Palladian</b><div class=""context"">An architectural style derived from the buildings and publications of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio (1508&ndash;80) who was himself influenced equally by the architecture of antiquity and by that of his contemporaries. His particular contribution lay in his elegant town and country houses (<i>palazzi</i> and <i>ville</i>) set in and around Vicenza. Of particular importance to later generations was his blending of secular architecture and landscape, in effect the prototype of so much later classicizing park and country-house architecture. Palladio promulgated his theories in his <i>Quattro libri dell'architettura</i> (1570). His style was introduced to England by Inigo Jones in the following century, but then fell out of favour until it was consciously revived by Colen Campbell and Lord Burlington, as in the latter's Chiswick House, near London, begun <i>c.</i>1720. Palladianism later spread from England to Germany, Russia, and the United States."

"panel","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>panel</b><div class=""context"">Any flat, rigid support, such as wood or metal, prepared with a <a href=""entry://ground""><span class=""links"">ground</span></a> for painting upon. Until the adoption of <a href=""entry://canvas""><span class=""links"">canvas</span></a> in the 15th century, most movable paintings in Europe were painted on wood, which continued to be used as a painting surface in Holland and Flanders until well into the 17th century. Although many different woods were variously employed by artists, it is generally true to say that Italian artists worked on <a href=""entry://poplar""><span class=""links"">poplar</span></a> and those from northern Europe favoured <a href=""entry://oak""><span class=""links"">oak</span></a>. Painting directly onto wood is unsatisfactory as it tends to absorb too much of the paint and does not reflect enough light. Consequently wood is normally prepared prior to painting with several layers of white <a href=""entry://gesso""><span class=""links"">gesso</span></a> which serve as a <a href=""entry://ground""><span class=""links"">ground</span></a>. For large compositions several wooden panels may be joined up together to form the support. One of the prime disadvantages of wood is that it has a tendency to split if subjected to climate changes, particularly those of humidity. For this very reason many celebrated <a href=""entry://Old Master""><span class=""links"">Old Master</span></a> paintings originally painted on wood have in the past been transferred onto the suppler support of canvas, especially in the 18th century in France where a high degree of expertise in this skilled process was developed. Nowadays most public museums and galleries maintain proper air-conditioning which greatly reduces the risk of any splitting occurring. Nevertheless, paintings on panel are rarely lent to exhibitions elsewhere due to concern at possible damage occurring, especially in transit. Other panel supports which have been used for painting include <a href=""entry://copper""><span class=""links"">copper</span></a> (especially for small-scale works in the 16th and 17th centuries) and <a href=""entry://slate""><span class=""links"">slate</span></a>."
"panorama","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>panorama</b><div class=""context"">A term originally coined in the late 18th century from two Greek roots (<i>pan</i>, ‘all’, and <i>horama</i>, ‘view’) to describe a specific form of landscape painting, comprising a 360-degree view, invented independently by several European artists <i>c.</i>1787, perhaps most famously by the Irish painter Robert Barker with his panorama of Edinburgh from Calton Hill. Many panoramas, housed in either temporary or permanent circular structures, were produced in the course of the 19th century but hardly any survive, an exception being Hendrik Mesdag's panorama (1881) of the beach at Scheveningen on the outskirts of The Hague. The term panorama is more widely used today in its metaphorical sense of a survey or overview."

"paper","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>paper</b><div class=""context"">A drawing and printing surface, invented in China <i>c.</i>AD 100, in common use in Europe by the 16th century, superseding <a href=""entry://vellum""><span class=""links"">vellum</span></a> or <a href=""entry://parchment""><span class=""links"">parchment</span></a>.

The mould is pressed on to blankets or felts to which the paper adheres. After squeezing in a press to remove moisture, the sheets of paper are separated from the blankets or felts and hung up to dry. They are then coated with animal or gelatine size to prevent them being porous like blotting-paper. Woven wire, in place of the ‘laid’ and ‘chain’ wires crossing each other at right angles in the traditional mould, was introduced in 1750. <a href=""entry://wove paper""><span class=""links"">Wove paper</span></a> is smoother than <a href=""entry://laid paper""><span class=""links"">laid paper</span></a>.

"pastel","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pastel</b><div class=""context"">A drawing material consisting of a stick of colour made up of ground <a href=""entry://pigment""><span class=""links"">pigment</span></a> mixed with just enough <a href=""entry://gum""><span class=""links"">gum</span></a> or <a href=""entry://resin""><span class=""links"">resin</span></a> to bind them together. Pastels originated in the 16th century in Italy, developed from the technique of drawing in coloured chalks, and one of the earliest exponents was the Urbino artist Federico Barocci. Pastels produce bright, pure colours which, unlike paints for example, do not change colour as they dry out. Early pastels were restricted to black, white, and red or flesh-colour and the invention of a fuller range of colours is credited to the landscape painter and etcher Johann Alexander Thiele (1685&ndash;1752). The Venetian artist Rosalba Carriera, famed throughout the courts of Europe for her portraits, introduced pastel to France where, in the course of the 18th century, it enjoyed its heyday. Among the most prominent exponents were Chardin, Perronneau, and Maurice-Quentin de La Tour. The technique also found popularity elsewhere: for example in England it attracted portraitists such as John Russell and Francis Cotes. The most individual pastellist of the 18th century, however, was the Swiss painter Jean-Etienne Liotard who travelled widely in Europe and also visited Constantinople. Interest in pastel revived in the later 19th century, especially in the work of Degas and his followers. The Société des Pastellistes was founded in Paris in 1870 and in 1880 the Pastel Society held its first exhibition in London. Apart from Degas, other distinguished artists of this period who worked in pastel included Cassatt, Redon, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Whistler. A major conservation problem with pastel is caused by the weak adhesion of the crumbly drawing material to the paper surface, consequently pastels are relatively fragile and suffer from loss of pigment if subjected to movement. <a href=""entry://fixative""><span class=""links"">Fixatives</span></a> can be applied, usually in the form of a spray, to remedy this, but it is now generally accepted that the fixatives themselves can cause injurious effects of discoloration, etc."

"perspective","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>perspective</b><div class=""context"">The art of drawing solid objects on a two-dimensional or shallow surface so as to give the right impression of their height, width, depth, and position in relation to each other. Only certain cultures have embraced perspective, for example the art of the ancient <a href=""entry://Egyptian art""><span class=""links"">Egyptians</span></a> took no account of the effects of spatial recession. Mathematically-based perspective, ordered round a central vanishing point, was developed in early <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> Italy. It was invented by Filippo Brunelleschi (1377&ndash;1446), described by Leon Battista Alberti (1404&ndash;72) in his treatise <i>De Pictura</i>, and is often referred to as linear perspective. The Florentine obsession with perspective was ridiculed by Vasari in his <i>Life</i> of the painter Paolo Uccello (1397&ndash;1475), who would stay up all night in his study trying to work out the vanishing points of his perspective, and, when called to bed by his wife, would say ‘Oh, what a lovely thing this perspective is!’ The stage-like organization of pictorial space, in which the composition of a picture is conceived as though viewed through a window, remained a central feature of much western art until the later part of the 19th century.

"pewter","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pewter</b><div class=""context"">A cast <a href=""entry://alloy""><span class=""links"">alloy</span></a>, mostly made of <a href=""entry://tin""><span class=""links"">tin</span></a>, used mainly for the manufacture of useful wares such as plates, drinking vessels, bowls, spoons and ladles, candlesticks, etc. Pewter has been known in Europe since the earliest times but was not really developed until the Middle Ages. The best pewter (‘English pewter’) contains <a href=""entry://copper""><span class=""links"">copper</span></a>, occasionally bismuth, but no lead. When polished it can be as bright as silver. Ordinary pewter (‘test pewter’ and ‘low-grade pewter’) contains lead in varying quantities (the more lead the cheaper) and is relatively dull in tone with a blackish-grey colouring. Large quantities of lead increase the risk of lead poisoning when pewter wares are used as vessels for food and drink. In the 16th century more elaborate ‘display pewter’, with relief decoration and intended to be shown on dressers and sideboards, was manufactured, at first in France and then also in Germany. Much of the best pewter was made in France throughout the 17th century and pewter was also manufactured in North America from that date. Pewter became largely obsolete in the 19th century with the introduction of the cheap pewter substitute <a href=""entry://Britannia metal""><span class=""links"">Britannia metal</span></a> and the reproductive technique of <a href=""entry://electroplate""><span class=""links"">electroplating</span></a>.

"photogravure","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>photogravure</b><div class=""context"">A photomechanical process of reproducing an image or design, it is basically a combination of photography and <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etching</span></a>.

There are two types of photogravure. Hand photogravure, hardly used now but very popular in the later 19th century, involves the photographic transfer of the image to a copper plate, prepared with <a href=""entry://aquatint""><span class=""links"">aquatint</span></a> to give it tone, into which the design is <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etched</span></a>. The plate is then hand-inked and printed from in the same way as an ordinary <a href=""entry://intaglio""><span class=""links"">intaglio</span></a> plate. Machine photogravure, very much more commercial, is similar except that a cross-line screen, instead of aquatint, is used to provide the tone, and a cylinder is employed rather than a plate. Very fast printing in large editions, for example of magazines, is possible with this technique."

The canon for judging ‘picturesqueness’ was provided by the varieties of Italian landscape as found in the works of the 17th-century painters Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin, and above all Gaspard Dughet. The ‘Picturesque’ appeared as a distinct category in English aesthetic theory in the later 18th century, formulated by figures such as the country squire and landscape gardener Uvedale Price who, in his <i>Essays on the Picturesque</i> (1810), posited it midway between the Beautiful and the <a href=""entry://Sublime""><span class=""links"">Sublime</span></a>. A ‘beautiful’ landscape was serene, a ‘sublime’ one awe-inspiring, whereas a ‘picturesque’ view was full of variety, curious details, interesting textures, and roughness and irregularity.

"pointing machine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>pointing machine</b><div class=""context"">A device capable of three-dimensional measurement, used for making an exact copy of a statue. In its most elementary form, as used by Greek and Roman sculptors, it consisted of a cage constructed round the model corresponding in its dimensions to the stone block from which the new sculpture was to be carved. Measurements were then taken from the top and sides to various key points on the original and the block was cut down in accordance to the data thus obtained. The use of pointing machines was revived in <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> Italy, stimulated by its renewed interest in the art of antiquity and its own vigorous sculptural production. More sophisticated pointing machines were developed in the 18th and 19th centuries which were capable of taking measurements from a small sculptural model and scaling up, providing the measurements for the full-scale final sculpture. Perhaps the most celebrated of all sculptors to make extensive use of the pointing machine was the great <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> sculptor Antonio Canova (1757&ndash;1822). The procedure was directly analogous to the preliminary sketch and final composition in painting. These more sophisticated <a href=""entry://pantograph""><span class=""links"">pantographic</span></a> machines consisted of an upright stand carrying movable arms, each of which had attached to it an adjustable rod used to measure a particular point on the original. Measurements could be scaled up accordingly."

<b>Pompeian Revival</b><div class=""context"">A decorative style derived from the frescoed rooms unearthed at Herculaneum (from 1738) and Pompeii (from 1748). It is distinguished by rather flimsy and fantastical architectural features allied to a strong preference for a dull, dark terracotta red called ‘Pompeian red’. The Pompeian style first became popular in the late 18th century and continued into the middle of the 19th.

"Pont-Aven School","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pont-Aven School</b><div class=""context"">The group of painters associated with Paul Gauguin in Brittany. The name is taken from the little town of Pont-Aven in the south of Brittany in which Gauguin stayed on a number of occasions 1886&ndash;94 and where he painted some of his best-known works such as the <i>Vision after the Sermon</i> 1888 (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh) and the <i>Yellow Christ</i> 1889 (Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo). Although Gauguin's professed aim was to discover a primitive ‘ideal’ in Brittany, in reality Pont-Aven had already been extensively developed since the 1860s as an artists' colony, mainly by Americans. However, they are largely forgotten today and by Pont-Aven School is usually meant associates of Gauguin such as Paul Sérusier, Meyer de Haan, Emile Bernard, Armand Séguin, and Roderic O'Conor."

"Pop art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pop art</b><div class=""context"">A term coined by the English critic Lawrence Alloway to describe a movement in modern art which flourished, mainly in the United States and Britain, from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. Pop art drew its imagery from the world of consumerism and popular culture, claiming no distinction between good and bad taste. In a sense it gave validity to a new <a href=""entry://iconography""><span class=""links"">iconography</span></a> based on the culture of the everyday. In its desire to shock or reject the supposed higher ideals of more intellectual art it had some links with the earlier <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada</span></a> movement. However, any pretensions to iconoclasm on the part of most Pop artists were in part compromised by the monumental status and beauty they accorded much of their allegedly banal imagery: for example, in the United States, Jasper John's paintings of flags and targets and his sculptures of ale cans; Robert Rauschenberg's <a href=""entry://collage""><span class=""links"">collages</span></a> with Coke bottles, stuffed birds, and photographs from newspapers and magazines; Andy Warhol's <a href=""entry://screenprinting""><span class=""links"">screenprints</span></a> of Campbell's soup-tins, heads of Marilyn Monroe, etc. In Britain notable Pop artists included Allen Jones, Eduardo Paolozzi, Derek Boshier, and Richard Hamilton, who wittily described Pop art as ‘popular, transient, expendable, low-cost, mass-produced, young, witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, and Big Business’&mdash;a definition which could equally have been applied to the popular music of the age and its associated culture, so nostalgically celebrated in the paintings of the British Pop artist Peter Blake."

There were many attempts to reproduce this in Europe.

From 1700 soft-paste porcelain was produced in France. Kaolin was discovered in Europe in the early 18th century, in Saxony, and the first hard-paste porcelain was made in 1709 by Johann Friedrich Böttger at <a href=""entry://Meissen""><span class=""links"">Meissen</span></a>.

<b>Post-Impressionism</b><div class=""context"">As the name implies, a term used to describe developments after and arising from <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a>. It was first coined by the English painter and critic Roger Fry (1866&ndash;1934), who organized the exhibition <i>Manet and the Post-Impressionists</i> held at the Grafton Galleries, London in 1910&ndash;11. The imprecision of such an umbrella term, for all its undoubted usefulness, is demonstrated by the wide variety of developments from Impressionism: the quasi-scientific examination of colour by Seurat and the <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionists</span></a>; the structured examination of landscape by Cézanne in which lay the seeds of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>; the writhing, expressive brushwork of Van Gogh; the flat colour <a href=""entry://Symbolism""><span class=""links"">Symbolism</span></a> of Gauguin and his followers."
"Post-modernism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Post-modernism</b><div class=""context"">A term which describes the reactions to the dominance of <a href=""entry://Modernism""><span class=""links"">Modernism</span></a> in architecture and the visual arts. It came into use in the 1970s, at first mainly in connection with architecture, and then later with the visual and decorative arts. Post-modernist architecture is in fact an eclectic fusion of Modernism and selected classical elements. It is inventive, often playful, and frequently mannered. In contrast to the clean logicality of the best Modernism, Post-modernism proposes imbalance, disjunction, and spatial ambiguity. Its best-known exponent is the American architect Robert Venturi. As a definition, Post-modernism is harder to pin down in the visual arts, being a reaction against the formalism of Modernism, and embracing such disparate groups as the American and German <a href=""entry://Neo-Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Expressionists</span></a> and the Italian ‘Bad Boys’."

<b>Poussinisme</b><div class=""context"">One of two conflicting currents in French art, the one supporting the balanced, intellectually rigorous art of Poussin, the other the more colourful and sensual manner of Rubens (<a href=""entry://Rubénisme""><span class=""links""><i>Rubénisme</i></span></a>). This dichotomy was debated at length during the so-called <i>Querelle du coloris</i> (‘Dispute on colour’) which lasted 1672&ndash;8. It was instigated by the criticism voiced by the painter Philippe de Champagne at a lecture given at the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1671 in which he denigrated the painting of Titian, but praised the art of the recently deceased Nicolas Poussin (1594&ndash;1665). The <i>Poussinistes</i> took the mature work of Poussin as their point of departure and also admired classical sculpture and Raphael. Theirs was an essentially academic canon which valued design, decorum, and the correct expression of the passions, and they had a powerful supporter in the Director of the Academy, the painter Charles le Brun. Essentially, the Poussin/Rubens debate was a restatement of the design versus colour debate in Italian art which had surfaced during the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> and whose champions were Florence and Rome on the one hand, and Venice on the other. <i>Poussinisme</i> continued to be the inspiration of classically minded artists in France until the early 19th century."

"Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</b><div class=""context"">A group of English painters, founded in 1848, who took as their inspiration Italian art which predated the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a>, i.e. ‘before Raphael’. They admired the simplicity and sincerity of <a href=""entry://Quattrocento""><span class=""links"">Quattrocento</span></a> art, which they came to know through prints such as the line engravings made by Lasinio after the <a href=""entry://fresco""><span class=""links"">frescoes</span></a> in the Campo Santo at Pisa. Conversely, they detested much academic art, which they found heavy and debased, and despised contemporary <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> painting with its trivial anecdotage. The founding members of the group were John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and William Holman Hunt, later to be joined by the painter James Collinson, the sculptor Thomas Woolner, and the art critics W. M. Rossetti and F. G. Stephens. Though never a member, Ford Madox Brown came to be associated with the group. The initials ‘PRB’ were first seen in public on Millais's <i>Lorenzo and Isabella</i> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) exhibited in 1849. The three original members were only 21 when the group was founded and their humour was suitably high-spirited: thus suggested interpretations of the famous acronym included ‘Please Ring Bell’ and ‘Penis Rather Better’. The subject-matter of Pre-Raphaelite art was predominantly literary, drawing on a wide range of sources including the Bible, Shakespeare, Keats, and Tennyson. Technically, the Pre-Raphaelites brought about a revolution, banishing the heavy, dark colours of much academic painting and replacing them with bright, naturalistic detail painted on a wet, white <a href=""entry://ground""><span class=""links"">ground</span></a> to give added brilliancy. By 1853 the group had virtually dissolved, with only Hunt remaining true to Pre-Raphaelite doctrines. The name stuck to Rossetti and his followers William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, however, and the term Pre-Raphaelite is often associated, somewhat mistakenly, with the dreamy, yearning images of women they produced."

"prehistoric art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>prehistoric art</b><div class=""context"">Art created before the existence of written records, the period varying enormously between different cultures. Writing came into existence in various parts of the world between the 4th and 1st millennia BC. Much of our knowledge of prehistoric art and culture, therefore, has been derived from archaeological investigations. In Europe the ending of the prehistoric period is often associated with writings about European Iron Age societies by classical authors. The term ‘prehistoric’ was first coined by a Frenchman, Gustave d'Eichthal, in 1843. In the 20th century the term has been criticized in some quarters as patronizing and implying a western sense of superiority over ‘backward’ cultures."

The Prix de Rome enjoyed its greatest years in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when the winners included David and Ingres. The administration of the prize passed in the Revolution to the Institut de France and École des Beaux-Arts, which replaced the Académie. In 1817 a prize for Historical Landscape was set up, though this was contested only every four years as opposed to the usual annual main competition. The landscape prize was discontinued in 1863, whereas the main Prix de Rome lasted until 1968 when it fell victim to the changes wrought in French society by the student unrest of that period and was abolished by André Malraux, the Minister of Culture."

Its origins can be found in buildings such as William Morris's Red House (1858) at Bexleyheath, London, designed by Philip Webb and influenced by 17th-century Dutch architecture. Queen Anne Revival came to be associated with progressive social attitudes and a desire to make good design widely available, for example in the many Board School buildings, distinguished by their Flemish gables, constructed in England subsequent to the Elementary Education Act of 1870. The greatest contribution of the Queen Anne Revival style was in the realm of private houses, however, such as Norman Shaw's Cragside in Northumberland or, in London, the houses of the Cadogan estate in Cadogan Square and Pont Street."

"Realism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Realism</b><div class=""context"">A term used generally to refer to art in which subjects from real life are depicted. More specifically, it has been associated with a movement in French painting which lasted from <i>c.</i>1830 to the 1860s and deliberately eschewed the obscure subjects normally found in academic art in order to concentrate on portraying contemporary themes, including urban or rural life, landscapes of the various regions of France, still lifes, and portraits of the artists' families and friends. This democratization of art received considerable impetus from the 1830 Revolution and ensuing July Monarchy, the supporters of which were of a liberal political persuasion. By the 1850s the painter Gustave Courbet was generally perceived as the leader of the movement and his circle of artist and writer friends met at the Brasserie Andler in Paris where Courbet put forward his theories of Realism, which he published in a manifesto entitled Réalisme to accompany his purpose-built Pavillon du Réalisme in 1855. A number of influential critics also played important roles, including Courbet's major supporter Champfleury, and also Théophile Thoré and Jules Antoine Castagnary. In their writings they stressed that art should be made available to all the people and should record the visible world rather than obscure <a href=""entry://allegory""><span class=""links"">allegories</span></a> and histories. Certain artists of the past were greatly admired and cited as worthy of study, including Caravaggio, Velázquez, the Le Nain brothers, Chardin, Rembrandt, and Vermeer. Contemporary <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> painting was also promoted because it could emphasize the factual and at the same time include common customs and traditions. In the mid-1860s the novelist and critic Emile Zola proclaimed Realism and its practitioners such as François Bonvin to be outdated and too reliant on tradition. This was partly a ploy to promote the paintings of his friend Edouard Manet, but it was also symptomatic of aspects of avant-garde opinion which welcomed the technical advances and more brilliant colouring of the young <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionists</span></a>."

"Renaissance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Renaissance</b><div class=""context"">Originally a French term (<i>renaissance</i>, ‘rebirth’) pertaining to cultural history, it is now employed to describe the arts in Italy from the early 14th to the mid-16th centuries. By extension it is also more loosely applied to other European countries of that era. It was first sanctioned as descriptive of a particular period and all that happened in it by the French historian Jules Michelet in a section entitled <i>La Renaissance</i> (1855) of his history of France. The Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt specifically associated the term with Italy in his <i>Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy</i> (1864), in which he stressed, albeit in a somewhat discursive manner, the difference of the ‘Renaissance’ from what went before (the so-called ‘Dark Ages’) and after. For cultural historians such as Burckhardt the term is all-embracing and covers the arts and sciences and politics. Art historians have based their perception of the Renaissance on the <i>rinascita</i> in the arts proposed by the artist and writer Giorgio Vasari in his <i>Lives of the Artists</i> (1550). According to this tradition, Renaissance art was based on renewed study of the art of antiquity and of nature. Vasari saw himself as living in a ‘New Age’. Its ‘Infancy’ had been marked by Giotto and Cimabue in painting, Arnolfo di Cambio in architecture, and the Pisani in sculpture. ‘Adolescence’ had been reached through the art of Masaccio, Donatello, and Brunelleschi, and ‘Maturity’ had begun with Leonardo da Vinci and culminated with the model of the <i>uomo universale</i>, Michelangelo. Although the validity of the term ‘Renaissance’ has been frequently challenged (earlier ‘rebirths’ of interest in classical art and learning have been labelled ‘renascences’) it remains enormously useful, for all its imperfections. It is irrevocably associated in popular understanding with masterpieces such as Michelangelo's sculpture of <i>David</i> (Accademia, Florence), Leonardo's painting of the <i>Mona Lisa</i> (Louvre, Paris), and Bramante's building of the Tempietto of S. Pietro in Montorio, Rome."

"Rococo","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Rococo</b><div class=""context"">A term used to describe the light, elegant, and sensuous style in the visual arts which originated in France at the beginning of the 18th century, reached its apogee in the 1730s, and was eventually supplanted by the stern, moralizing qualities of <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a> in the 1760s. Like so many terms of stylistic or period definition it was originally pejorative: it was said to have been coined in the 1790s by one of the pupils of the great Neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David to refer disparagingly to the art produced during the reign of Louis XV. The word Rococo was apparently a combination of <a href=""entry://rocaille""><span class=""links"">rocaille</span></a> and <i>barocco</i> (<a href=""entry://Baroque""><span class=""links"">Baroque</span></a>). It was used formally as an art-historical term from the middle of the 19th century. It is now generally accepted, though its exact definition has been much debated. Purists might argue that Rococo, with its love of shell-like curves and S- and C-curves, was essentially a style of decoration and should be applied to art forms such as <a href=""entry://boiserie""><span class=""links"">boiserie</span></a>, metalwork, furniture, and <a href=""entry://porcelain""><span class=""links"">porcelain</span></a>. Today its wider use is generally countenanced, however, and it is also applied to painting, sculpture, and architecture. Watteau is widely considered to have been the first great Rococo painter and Boucher and Fragonard the masters of its mature style. In sculpture Falconet has often been thought the pre-eminent Rococo practitioner and many of his designs were reproduced in porcelain. In architecture its influence spread rapidly abroad, particularly to southern Germany and Austria where it is evident in churches such as Vierzehnheiligen and Die Wies. However, certain architectural historians would argue that this Germanic Rococo was in fact a manifestation of late Baroque rather than a new stylistic development."

Artists who rediscovered aspects of the Rococo, such as its frivolity and grace, ranged from Delacroix, R. P. Bonington, and Paul Huet to Franz Xaver Winterhalter. The Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, was an important patron of the Revival, both in the fields of furniture and sculpture. 19th-century taste for the Rococo was summed up in the Goncourt brothers' <i>L'Art du XVIIIe siècle</i> published in Paris in three volumes (1881&ndash;4)."
"Roman art","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Roman art</b><div class=""context"">The art and architecture of ancient Rome, the foundation of which is traditionally given as 753 BC. From then until 509 BC it was ruled by Latin and Etruscan kings, but a crisis of monarchy led to the establishment of a Republic, which lasted from 509 to 27 BC. After the successful Punic Wars against Carthage in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, Rome became a world power and its culture was rapidly hellenized after the conquest of Greece in 146 BC. Civil wars caused the Republic to collapse and it was replaced by the Empire, distinguished by the magnificent and ambitious building programmes instigated by many of its emperors. The spread of Christianity undermined the structure of the Empire, especially after it was recognized as the official religion of the Empire under the Edict of Milan in 313 AD during the reign of Constantine the Great. With the foundation of Constantinople in 324 AD the Empire was effectively split into eastern and western halves with Rome becoming the centre of the Roman church and Constantinople the capital of the Empire and centre of <a href=""entry://Byzantine""><span class=""links"">Byzantine</span></a> art."
"Romanesque","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Romanesque</b><div class=""context"">A term now used to describe the architecture of western Europe from the 10th to the 12th centuries. By extension it is also applied to the <a href=""entry://fine art""><span class=""links"">fine</span></a> and <a href=""entry://applied art""><span class=""links"">applied arts</span></a> of the period, but it is predominantly used in an architectural context. ‘Romanesque’ came into common usage in the early 19th century, originally to denote the architectural style (until then referred to by English writers as ‘Saxon’ or ‘Norman’) that was pre-<a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a>. The word was adapted from the vocabulary of linguistics, its original meaning being ‘to do with Romance languages’. Romanesque acquired its more precise definition in the first half of the 20th century when its application was restricted to the late 10th and to the 11th and 12th centuries. Its architecture was essentially produced for the increasingly affluent <a href=""entry://monastery""><span class=""links"">monasteries</span></a> of the period, allied to expanding urban communities. It is characterized by the clear articulation found in the great cathedrals and abbey churches whereby new features and functions were accommodated generally within the overall design of the building. Although Romanesque architecture is generally associated with the use of the round arch, this is something of an over-simplification, for the pointed arch (normally associated with <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a>) was also known at that period. What the Romanesque certainly established, with the aid of ever-improving standards in construction, was a major development of the <a href=""entry://basilica""><span class=""links"">basilica</span></a> pattern of earlier Christian and <a href=""entry://Carolingian""><span class=""links"">Carolingian</span></a> churches. This included a grand nave, with a vaulted stone roof, articulated by bays on either side and punctuated with alternating <a href=""entry://pier""><span class=""links"">piers</span></a> and <a href=""entry://column""><span class=""links"">columns</span></a>&mdash;the <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> cathedral would be basically a lightening and elaboration of this Romanesque pattern. By the first half of the 12th century the Romanesque style covered most of western Europe, from Scandinavia to Sicily and from Ireland to Hungary. Prominent buildings included Durham Cathedral and the abbey church at Cluny."

"Romanticism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Romanticism</b><div class=""context"">Inherently the most unstable of the major definitions of a particular period or style, Romanticism can at one level be seen simply as a late 18th- to early 19th-century reaction against the reason of the Enlightenment and the order of <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassicism</span></a>. Implicit to this process were beliefs in the primacy of individual experience and in the irrational as well as the rational. Romanticism was more an attitude of mind than a set of particular traits, hence in the visual arts it could embrace such apparently diverse artists as Goya, Blake and Turner, Delacroix and Géricault, Friedrich and Runge. Originally, however, it was a literary term, first defined by the German critic Friedrich Schlegel in an essay of 1798 on Romantic poetry which, he stated, was ‘in the state of becoming; that, in fact, is its real essence; that it should forever be becoming and never be completed’. The sketch-like quality (and indeed the growing importance of the sketch) characterized much Romantic visual art. The word itself was derived from the late medieval Romance, seen as a fruitful literary alternative to the traditions of Classicism. Romanticism was not essentially backward-looking, however, and was responsible for a general ‘freeing-up’ of content and form in art. Classical subject-matter was largely rejected in favour of that drawn from a wide variety of literary sources&mdash;the aforementioned medieval Romances, Dante, Shakespeare, and contemporary literature (especially Sir Walter Scott). Nature, hitherto viewed as an ordered part of man's environment, was seen as an elemental force inspiring an emotional reaction in man and a concomitant interest in landscape painting of all types. See <a href=""entry://picturesque""><span class=""links"">PICTURESQUE</span></a>; <a href=""entry://Sublime""><span class=""links"">SUBLIME</span></a>.

"Royal Academy of Arts","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Royal Academy of Arts</b><div class=""context"">Founded in London in 1768 with Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723&ndash;92) as its first President, the Academy was intended to be the national school of art in England. The members had to be professional artists and were entitled to use the initials RA (Royal Academician) after their name. In 1769 the category of Associate (ARA) was also established. The Academy's aims were to raise the professional status of artists and to encourage public awareness of the visual arts. Reynolds's fifteen <i>Discourses</i>, the most important text on the visual arts to have appeared in English to date, enshrined many of the Academy's ideals (a number of later Presidents also published their Lectures, but none would prove as influential as Reynolds). The Academy's first premises were in Pall Mall, in 1780 it transferred to Somerset House, and from 1837 to 1868 the Academy shared accommodation with the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square. Finally, in 1869, it moved to its present home in Burlington House. By the end of the 19th century the Academy's reputation had sunk to a low ebb, the art it promoted judged as too conservative, and rival exhibiting bodies such as the <a href=""entry://New English Art Club""><span class=""links"">New English Art Club</span></a> and the <a href=""entry://London Group""><span class=""links"">London Group</span></a> had been formed.

The state under Napoleon III was a major patron of the arts and supported the enormous Universal Exhibitions of 1855 and 1867, the annual <a href=""entry://Salon""><span class=""links"">Salons</span></a>, the 1863 <a href=""entry://Salon des Refusés""><span class=""links"">Salon des Refusés</span></a>, as well as Baron Haussmann's rebuilding of Paris. Two major architectural projects were the construction of the Paris Opéra and of the New Louvre (1853&ndash;69 by Visconti and Lefuel).

It has been described as structuralism applied to ‘signs’ (as opposed to language). The study of ‘sign systems’ is used to produce meanings. It is debatable, however, whether language (in which words are fixed signs) can be equated with the visual arts where individuality of touch or ‘marks’ are less suited to the structural classifications of semiotics. Equally, the application of semiotics necessitates so many qualifications that in practice it can seem intellectually maladroit. Linguistic semiotics does not, after all, involve the study of graphology."

<b>Seven and Five Society</b><div class=""context"">An association of progressive British artists, originally consisting of seven painters and five sculptors, which was established in 1919 and lasted until 1935. It played an important role in encouraging the development of abstract art in Britain.

The process was discovered in 1741 by Thomas Bolsover of Sheffield, who initially used it for making buttons. Matthew Boulton recognized its potential for useful wares, such as tea and coffee pots, and developed a method of applying solid silver wire to corners to stop the copper showing through. Although Sheffield plate did not have the value of silver, the workmanship was of a fine quality, which made it popular.

<b>Socialist Realism</b><div class=""context"">The name for the officially approved art of Soviet Russia and other Communist countries, particularly under the dictatorship of Stalin 1924&ndash;53. It was intended to depict real life and inspire the masses, but usually resulted in an uncritical glorification of the State in which stereotyped images were produced in a conventionally academic style. Typical subject-matter included domestic scenes, portraits, industrial and urban landscape, and scenes on collective farms. During the Second World War patriotic episodes from Russian history were also popular."

<b>Society of Independent Artists</b><div class=""context"">Formed in New York in 1916, it was an association which succeeded the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, which had been dissolved after its successful mounting of the 1913 Armory Show. The successor organization was intended to give progressive artists the opportunity to hold rival annual exhibitions to those staged by the National Academy of Art and Design. Its first exhibition was held in 1917. Known as ‘The Big Show’, it was probably the largest art exhibition held in America up to that time. It achieved public notice as much for the works which were excluded as for those which were shown. Most famously, Marcel Duchamp's <a href=""entry://ready-made""><span class=""links"">ready-made</span></a> in the form of a urinal was rejected.

<b>Société Anonyme, Inc.</b><div class=""context"">An association formed in 1920 by Katherine Dreier, Marcel Duchamp, and Man Ray for the promotion of contemporary art in America. The name, suggested by Man Ray, was a tautological <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada</span></a> jest, for in French <i>société anonyme</i> means ‘limited company’. The society opened a museum in New York and between 1920 and 1940 organized 84 exhibitions in which the emphasis was on the avant-garde and the abstract. Klee, Malevich, Miró, and Schwitters were among the artists introduced to the American public through these shows. In 1941 the Société presented the superb permanent collection it had built up over those years to Yale University."

The design is drawn onto a sheet of paper placed over an <a href=""entry://etching""><span class=""links"">etching</span></a> plate that has been prepared with a ‘soft’ ground including tallow so that it never hardens. The pressure of the <a href=""entry://crayon""><span class=""links"">crayon</span></a> or pencil clears a path through to the ground so that, when the plate is immersed in acid, the drawn design is etched and reproduces the texture of the original drawing when inked up and printed from. The technique was apparently first used by G. B. Castiglione in the 1640s and was revived in the middle of the 18th century. It was particularly popular in England and numbered among its practitioners Gainsborough, Rowlandson, and John Sell Cotman. In the early 19th century it was much used for the illustrations to <a href=""entry://drawing manual""><span class=""links"">drawing manuals</span></a>, but by around 1830 had been displaced by <a href=""entry://lithograph""><span class=""links"">lithography</span></a>."

The area had been favoured by artists since the 1880s. Its more widespread popularity dated from 1939, however, when Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth settled there, anxious to bring up their children far away from London and its attendant dangers with the outbreak of war. They were joined by the critic Adrian Stokes and the artist Naum Gabo. After the end of the Second World War in 1945 a number of abstract artists, including Terry Frost and Patrick Heron, also settled there. They were greatly attracted by the qualities of light and atmosphere and the distinctive landscape of the St Ives area. A branch of the London Tate Gallery was opened in St Ives in 1993 and holds changing exhibitions of the work of 20th-century artists associated with the town."

In the 19th century, huge quantities of ceramics were made and exported. A large industry also developed around the making of ‘Staffordshire figures’ between 1840 and 1900, popular moulded figures decorated in bright colours and representing social and political figures of the late 19th century. The British ceramics industry is still based around Stoke-on-Trent."
"stained glass","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stained glass</b><div class=""context""><a href=""entry://glass""><span class=""links"">Glass</span></a> given translucent colours and used particularly for church windows. The earliest and traditional method of achieving this consists of composing a design made up from various pieces of dyed or coloured glass set in a framework, usually of lead, to form a decorative or pictorial design. The technique was <a href=""entry://Byzantine""><span class=""links"">Byzantine</span></a> in origin, though the most splendid surviving examples are those associated with <a href=""entry://Gothic""><span class=""links"">Gothic</span></a> ecclesiastical architecture. Fragments of stained glass survive from as early as the late 7th century. The earliest extant complete windows are those from the cathedral at Augsburg dating from between 1050 and 1150. The introduction of enamel pigments in the 16th century made it possible to ‘paint’ a design on glass in a manner similar to painting a composition on canvas. An example of such pictorial windows are those designed by Sir Joshua Reynolds for the chapel of New College, Oxford (1778&ndash;85). In the 19th century <a href=""entry://Gothic Revival""><span class=""links"">Gothic Revival</span></a> artists such as William Morris sought to return to medieval principles and designed superb stained glass windows using separate coloured lights."
"stamp","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>stamp</b><div class=""context"">A small, distinctive mark, sometimes embossed and usually composed of initials, often found on prints and drawings. A ‘studio stamp’ was applied to materials sold from an artist's studio after his death. If the stamp is impressed on the sheet without ink it is known as a ‘blind stamp’. Prints and drawings in private collections have also often been given a stamp known as a <a href=""entry://collector's mark""><span class=""links"">collector's mark</span></a>.

"state","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>state</b><div class=""context"">A term used by cataloguers of artists' prints to distinguish between the alterations that are sometimes made to the <a href=""entry://plate""><span class=""links"">plate</span></a> resulting in different versions of the design being produced, albeit the alterations are often only very minor. Thus a print could be described as, for example, ‘iii/v’, i.e. the third state of five. Perhaps the most inventive of printmakers was Rembrandt, who frequently altered his etchings and drypoints many times. There has been considerable debate as to whether accidental (i.e. inadvertent damage caused to the plate) as opposed to deliberate alterations by the artist qualify for the appellation of ‘state’. Equally, <a href=""entry://proof""><span class=""links"">proofs</span></a> before letters of 18th- and 19th-century prints cause ‘stating’ problems and are usually discounted. In the later 19th century some artists deliberately produced small, rare <a href=""entry://limited edition""><span class=""links"">editions</span></a> of the early states of their prints in order to heighten their financial worth. Generally, but not always, earlier states of most prints command higher prices as they are considered to reflect more accurately the artist's original intentions and are often rarer. For a print collector a ‘first state’ is often the equivalent of the book collector's ‘first edition’."

<b>studio pottery</b><div class=""context"">A type of <a href=""entry://pottery""><span class=""links"">pottery</span></a> produced by traditional methods, usually on a limited scale. The name is usually given to pottery of the late 19th and 20th centuries, created by potters who reacted against industrialization and returned to early hand-crafted techniques. The earliest studio potters are generally thought to be the Martin brothers (see <a href=""entry://Martinware""><span class=""links"">MARTINWARE</span></a>). In the 20th century, the leading figure was Bernard Leach (1887&ndash;1979), who trained in Japan, and set up a studio in St Ives in 1920. As well as a prolific craftsman, he was also an inspired teacher. He trained Michael Cardew, who went on to open his own pottery in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, in 1926. Cardew was inspired by early English pottery, such as <a href=""entry://slipware""><span class=""links"">slipware</span></a>. Lucie Rie came from Austria in 1938 and set up her own studio in London, where she was joined by Hans Coper, another émigré.

"Sublime","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Sublime</b><div class=""context"">An aesthetic concept which entered mainstream European thought in the 18th century. As a category it was distinct from, though often discussed in conjunction with, the Beautiful and the <a href=""entry://picturesque""><span class=""links"">Picturesque</span></a>, both in relation to aesthetics and, in Britain, to landscape gardening. It originally derived from rhetoric and poetry and gained wider currency after the translation (1674) into French of the Greek treatise <i>On the Sublime</i>, attributed to Longinus (1st century AD). The major work in English on the subject was Edmund Burke's <i>Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful</i> (1757) in which the Sublime was differentiated from the Beautiful by virtue of its ability to evoke more intense emotions through vastness, a quality that inspires awe. Travellers came to visit wild and rugged mountainous regions such as the Alps, Snowdonia, and the Lake District in search of the emotional thrills provided by the Sublime, and artists such as J. M. W. Turner responded to the demand for such imagery. Subjects from Homer, Milton, and Ossian were also considered suitable subject-matter in this context. Whereas Burke had considered the Sublime as an external force inherent in the properties of certain objects and nature, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, most famously in his <i>Critique of Judgement</i> (1790), internalized it and focused on the individual's response, his contention being that the Sublime came from within the human psyche. A number of theorists and artists of the later 20th century have shown a revived interest in the Sublime."
"sugar aquatint","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>sugar aquatint</b><div class=""context"">A method of <a href=""entry://aquatint""><span class=""links"">aquatint</span></a> printmaking whereby the artist creates wash effects by brushing them on the printing plate with a fluid in which sugar has been dissolved. The plate is then covered with stopping-out varnish and immersed in water; the sugar swells and lifts the varnish off the plate, which is then bitten in acid. Those areas formerly covered by the sugar particles are exposed to the acid and produce a granular wash effect when inked up and printed from. Paul Sandby (1731&ndash;1809) was a particular exponent of the technique. Also known as ‘lift ground etching’."

"Suprematism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Suprematism</b><div class=""context"">A non-objective type of art, devised by Kasimir Malevich, in which ‘new symbols’ such as the square, triangle, and circle replaced the more traditional concern with the human face and natural objects. Malevich announced his new system at the exhibition <i>0.10</i> held in 1915 which included works such as <i>Black Square</i> (Russian Museum, St Petersburg), although his <i>Suprematist Composition</i> (Museum of Modern Art, New York) dated from a year earlier. After 1916 Malevich's compositions became more complex and, with the series <i>White on White</i>, more mystical. The graphic artist El Lissitzky exported Suprematism to Germany when he moved there in 1922 and the ideas of the movement were transmitted to the <a href=""entry://Bauhaus""><span class=""links"">Bauhaus</span></a> via Laszlo Moholy-Nagy."
"Surrealism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Surrealism</b><div class=""context"">One of the most important and subversive movements of the 20th century, it flourished particularly in the 1920s and 1930s and provided a radical alternative to the rational and formal qualities of <a href=""entry://Cubism""><span class=""links"">Cubism</span></a>. Unlike <a href=""entry://Dada""><span class=""links"">Dada</span></a>, from which in many ways it sprang, it emphasized the positive rather than the nihilistic. Surrealism sought access to the subconscious and to translate this flow of thought into terms of art. Originally a literary movement, it was famously defined by the poet André Breton in the <i>First Manifesto of Surrealism</i> (1924): ‘SURREALISM, noun, masc. Pure psychic automatism by which it is intended to express either verbally or in writing the true function of thought. Thought dictated in the absence of all control exerted by reason, and outside all aesthetic or moral preoccupations.’ A number of distinct strands can be discerned in the visual manifestation of Surrealism. Artists such as Max Ernst and André Masson favoured <a href=""entry://automatism""><span class=""links"">automatism</span></a> in which conscious control is suppressed and the subconscious is allowed to take over. Conversely, Salvador Dali and René Magritte pursued an hallucinatory sense of super-reality in which the scenes depicted make no real sense. A third variation was the juxtaposition of unrelated items, setting up a startling unreality outside the bounds of normal reality. Common to all Surrealistic enterprises was a post-Freudian desire to set free and explore the imaginative and creative powers of the mind. Surrealism was originally Paris based. Its influence spread through a number of journals and international exhibitions, the most important examples of the latter being the <i>International Surrealist Exhibition</i> at the New Burlington Galleries, London and the <i>Fantastic Art Dada, Surrealism</i> at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, both held in 1936. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the centre of Surrealist activity transferred to New York and by the end of the War the movement had lost its coherence. It has retained a potent influence, however, clearly evident in aspects of <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionism</span></a> and various other artistic manifestations of the second half of the 20th century."
"swagger portrait","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>swagger portrait</b><div class=""context"">A term, of recent origin, which was celebrated in the eponymous exhibition held at the Tate Gallery, London in 1992&ndash;3. It describes a perceived current in British portraiture from the 17th to 20th centuries in which the subject is portrayed in the ‘Grand Manner’, which emphasizes public display and the social aspirations of the sitter."
"Symbolism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>Symbolism</b><div class=""context"">A European cultural phenomenon of the late 19th century which originated in France and was first defined as a literary movement by Jean Moréas in the Symbolist manifesto of 1886, and then in relation to visual art by Albert Aurier (1892) as the ‘painting of ideas’. In painting, Symbolism was viewed as having developed from later <a href=""entry://Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Impressionism</span></a> and from <a href=""entry://Neo-Impressionism""><span class=""links"">Neo-Impressionism</span></a> which, in the 1880s, had increasingly concentrated on the suggestive rather than the descriptive. Significant predecessors of Symbolism included Gustave Moreau, Puvis de Chavannes, Edward Burne-Jones, and Arnold Böcklin. A basic feature of Symbolist art was the notion that another world lies beyond the world of appearances. The painter most often cited in this respect is Paul Gauguin and works such as his <i>Vision after the Sermon</i> of 1888 (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh). However, a very wide range of art came to be labelled Symbolist and exact definition of the term is probably foolhardy."

<b>Synchronism</b><div class=""context"">The first American movement to rise to prominence in modern art, Synchronism originated in Paris in 1912 with the painters Stanton Macdonald-Wright and Morgan Russell. It was based on the creation of shapes through colour and the juxtaposition of colours from different points of the spectrum.

Producing only <a href=""entry://soft-paste""><span class=""links"">soft-paste</span></a> porcelain initially, it moved to Sèvres, west of Paris, in 1756. Louis XV, a shareholder in the factory, assumed full ownership in 1760, and placed stringent restrictions on other <a href=""entry://ceramic""><span class=""links"">ceramic</span></a> producers in France. Sèvres employed the best artists and craftsmen, creating new shapes and designs of high quality. The factory developed a range of superb ground colours, such as <i>gros bleu</i> and <i>bleu celeste</i>, which were combined with tooled gilt decoration and painted panels in the style of François Boucher. Figures were made in <a href=""entry://biscuit""><span class=""links"">biscuit</span></a> porcelain, modelled by leading sculptors, such as Falconet. Sèvres soon became the leading porcelain factory in Europe, taking over from Meissen. Both Louis XV and Louis XVI took a personal interest in the factory and porcelain was frequently given as diplomatic gifts. With the discovery of <a href=""entry://kaolin""><span class=""links"">kaolin</span></a> near Limoges, <a href=""entry://hard-paste""><span class=""links"">hard-paste</span></a> porcelain began to be produced and soft-paste was phased out by 1804. The factory was nationalized during the French Revolution, but later Napoleon realized its importance. Again, it set the fashion with the creation of new designs and ambitious services, many based on antiquity. The tradition of using work by famous artists and architects continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Many designs embraced or set the fashion, such as those in the <a href=""entry://Art Nouveau""><span class=""links"">Art Nouveau</span></a> style, shown at the International Exhibition in Paris in 1900. Sèvres regularly marked its wares, initially with interlaced Ls, after Louis XV, together with each artist's personal mark."

Like their contemporaries, the American <a href=""entry://Abstract Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Abstract Expressionists</span></a>, the practitioners of Tachisme (such as Jean Fautrier, Georges Mathieu, and the German-born Wols) attempted to be spontaneous, gestural, and instinctive in their art.

<b>tempera</b><div class=""context"">[From the Latin <i>temperare</i>, ‘to mix’] a painting <a href=""entry://medium""><span class=""links"">medium</span></a> used to bind pigments, most commonly made from egg yolk. Although tempera was used since Roman times and remains the principal paint medium for the <a href=""entry://icon""><span class=""links"">icons</span></a> of the Greek and Russian Orthodox churches, it is normally associated with Italian <a href=""entry://panel""><span class=""links"">panel</span></a> painting of the 13th to 15th centuries. A reliable account of the technique is given by the Florentine painter Cennino Cennini in his <i>Il libro dell'arte</i> of around 1400: equal quantities of egg yolk were combined with pigment ground to a paste in water. After painting, the water evaporates and the protein of the egg yolk dries and forms a hard and waterproof film. There is some evidence, contrary to what was thought previously, that <a href=""entry://varnish""><span class=""links"">varnishes</span></a> were also occasionally applied. Unlike in oil painting, colours and tones in tempera have to be premixed before the paint is applied and can not be manipulated on the painting surface (which in Italy usually consisted of a white <a href=""entry://gesso""><span class=""links"">gesso</span></a>

<b>trompe-l'oeil</b><div class=""context"">[From the French, ‘trick of the eye’] used to describe pictures in which a deliberate visual illusion is intended by the artist. It is particularly associated with naturalistic painting where artists are concerned to demonstrate their exceptional skill. Such visual tricks were known since ancient times: Pliny the Elder tells how, in a public competition between artists, Zeuxis deceived the birds into mistaking the grapes he had painted for real ones, but the prize was won by Parrhasios for fooling Zeuxis into trying to lift away a drape that was only painted. Similarly, the <a href=""entry://Renaissance""><span class=""links"">Renaissance</span></a> artist and writer Giorgio Vasari related how Giotto deceived his master Cimabue into trying to brush away a painted fly. The genre of trompe-l'-oeil was particularly popular in 17th-century Dutch and Flemish art. It was also much practised in France in the 18th and early 19th century (for example by L.-L. Boilly); in Paris <a href=""entry://genre""><span class=""links"">genre</span></a> painters used to display their trompe-l'oeil pictures in open-air exhibitions near the Pont-Neuf as public evidence of their talent.

<b>troubadour</b><div class=""context"">A style of history painting that evolved mainly in France in the last years of the 18th century and early years of the 19th. It drew its inspiration from the art and history of the Middle Ages and the then current vogue for medieval literature and contemporary reworkings thereof. The wide range of subjects included, for example, scenes from Dante (<i>Paola and Francesca</i>), and from the medieval romances of Sir Walter Scott. Among its most famous practitioners were Ingres, Bonington, and Delacroix in certain of their paintings, but its most consistent adherents were minor masters such as Jean-Baptiste Mallet, Nicolas-Antoine Taunay, and Pierre Révoil, many of whom provided illustrations for publications of pseudo-medieval literature. Among the most important patrons of such art were the Empress Josephine and Caroline, Duchesse de Berry.

<b>Venetian glass</b><div class=""context""><a href=""entry://glass""><span class=""links"">Glass</span></a> produced in Venice and the surrounding area from the 10th century. In 1292 most Venetian glassmakers moved to the island of Murano in the Venetian lagoon. By the end of the 16th century 3,000 of the inhabitants were involved in the industry, forming a tight-knit, secretive community. During the 15th century they had developed <i>cristallo</i> glass, which was very clear and could be blown into fine and elegant shapes of fragile appearance. Other techniques which the Venetians developed were <a href=""entry://millefiori""><span class=""links"">millefiori</span></a> (a thousand flowers), an arrangement of coloured glass canes; <i>latticino</i>, lacy inclusions of coloured glass; and <i>reticello</i>, filigree glass.

<b>Victorian</b><div class=""context"">A general label applied to the art and architecture produced in Britain and its empire during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837&ndash;1901). The style most popularly associated with the period is that of the <a href=""entry://Gothic Revival""><span class=""links"">Gothic Revival</span></a>, with its love of rich, heavy colouring and historical use of motif. In the fine arts ‘Victorian’ has come to be associated with somewhat reactionary, academic art, technically of a very high standard, but turgidly regurgitating subjects from literary (especially medieval) and biblical history. The heavy-handed moralizing of much of this art has been seen as a further negative factor in the popular view of much Victorian painting. However, Victoria's reign was an exceptionally long one and in its later stages also encompassed such seemingly ‘anti-Victorian’ groupings as the <a href=""entry://Aesthetic Movement""><span class=""links"">Aesthetic Movement</span></a> and the <a href=""entry://Arts and Crafts Movement""><span class=""links"">Arts and Crafts Movement</span></a>.

<b>Vorticism</b><div class=""context"">A British artistic and literary movement (its members included Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot) founded in 1914 by Wyndham Lewis, editor of <i>Blast</i> magazine.

The term was defined by Pound, Lewis's co-contributor to <i>Blast</i>, as follows: ‘the vortex is the point of maximum energy. It represents, in mechanics, the greatest energy.’ The Vorticists lambasted much that had gone before, including practically everything associated with the <a href=""entry://Victorian""><span class=""links"">Victorian</span></a> era. Instead they advocated modernity, as reflected in the machine age, and clarity of definition. The movement held a show in 1915 at the Doré Gallery, London where exhibitors included Lewis, Gaudier-Brzeska, Jacob Epstein, Frederic Etchells, William Roberts, David Bomberg, and Edward Wadsworth. A second exhibition was held in New York in 1917, but by the end of the First World War in 1918 the destruction wrought by mechanization deterred further exploration of such imagery and the Vorticist movement had ceased by 1920."

By end of the following century it was in fairly widespread use. The earliest examples (of which none survive) were probably hand-painted, though simple block-printing soon came to be utilized for the printing of repeated patterns. Hand-painted wallpaper was also imported from China in the early 18th century. France took the lead in wallpaper manufacture in the later 18th century, partly in response to the Revolutionary government's belief in wallpaper as an essentially democratic form of domestic decoration, culminating in the great scenic wallpaper developed by Zuber and Dufour in the early 19th century. Around this time, also, various wallpaper-printing machines were first developed which led to the production of relatively cheap rolls of wallpaper which were widely available by the mid-19th century."

<b>water-glass painting</b><div class=""context"">A technique of mural painting, developed in the early 19th century, that was intended to prove resistant to the harmful effects of damp and pollution. It is essentially a variation of <a href=""entry://fresco""><span class=""links"">fresco</span></a> painting whereby, after the design has been painted (using a mixture of <a href=""entry://pigment""><span class=""links"">pigments</span></a> and water) on to the plaster, it is coated with a solution of water-glass (potassium or sodium silicate) which provides a protective film after it has dried.

It was known as ‘stereochromy’ by the Victorians."
"watercolour","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>watercolour</b><div class=""context"">A type of paint in which water is the dispersal agent. The particles of <a href=""entry://pigment""><span class=""links"">pigment</span></a> are bound together by a colloid, usually <a href=""entry://gum""><span class=""links"">gum</span></a> arabic, which is spread on to the painting surface, normally paper, by the action of a brush loaded with water. After the water has evaporated the pigments remain bound to the paper by the gum arabic. Most watercolour is transparent, allowing the white of the paper to shine through and giving a luminous effect determined by the degree of dilution of the watercolour. However, when mixed with <a href=""entry://Chinese white""><span class=""links"">Chinese</span></a> or <a href=""entry://lead white""><span class=""links"">lead white</span></a>, the watercolour becomes opaque and is known variously as <a href=""entry://gouache""><span class=""links"">gouache</span></a> or <a href=""entry://bodycolour""><span class=""links"">bodycolour</span></a>. Varieties of opaque watercolour were used in medieval manuscript illumination. Some of the earliest watercolours in the modern sense were the landscapes and nature studies produced by the German painter Albrecht Dürer at the end of the 15th century. The materials necessary for the production of watercolours were compact and light and rapidly became popular with travellers, both professional and <a href=""entry://amateur""><span class=""links"">amateur</span></a> artists, for the recording of their journeys. Originally these materials would have been purchased in unmixed form from the apothecary's shop, but by the later 18th century in Britain (where watercolour was particularly popular) they were manufactured in small cakes (as found in the watercolour box of today). In the 19th century they were also manufactured in tubes, similar to those used for oil paints. The early decades of the 19th century can justly be claimed as the great age of watercolour when its exponents included such masters as Cotman, Girtin, and Turner. They also saw the foundation of artists' societies specifically devoted to the promotion and exhibition of watercolours such as the Society of Painters in Watercolour (1804). During the Victorian era watercolours were avidly collected by the newly emerging industrial and middle classes and were particularly championed by the artist and critic John Ruskin. As a medium it has continued to be popular to the present day."

His earliest success was a <a href=""entry://creamware""><span class=""links"">creamware</span></a> in 1758, made into simple, elegant shapes, plain or painted with decorative borders. He renamed it Queensware, after Queen Charlotte. Its success led to a commission to produce a 925-piece service for Catherine the Great of Russia, known as the ‘Frog’ service, much of which still survives in the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg. From 1769 to 1780 Wedgwood went into partnership with Thomas Bentley, a Liverpool merchant. During this period the company began to copy vases of classical inspiration, initially in <a href=""entry://black basalt""><span class=""links"">black basalt</span></a>. He also developed <a href=""entry://jasperware""><span class=""links"">jasperware</span></a>, a fine-grained <a href=""entry://stoneware""><span class=""links"">stoneware</span></a>, coloured throughout the body, usually blue but sometimes green, lilac, or yellow. Classical-style decoration in white was applied to the surface and the vases and ornamental wares produced in this style were suited to the fashionable <a href=""entry://Neoclassicism""><span class=""links"">Neoclassical</span></a> interiors of the architect Robert Adam. Wedgwood set up a new and efficient factory, which he named ‘Etruria’, outside Burslem, regarded as a model of its kind. Products included large ornamental vases, plaques for decorating interiors, and small medallions for portraits, furniture, and buttons, all of which were widely exported to Europe and America. The Wedgwood factory continued to make wares in the Neoclassical style during the 19th and 20th centuries.

The wide range of shapes, including large pigs used as door stops, were painted with cabbage roses, daffodils, sweet peas, plums, dragonflies, mottoes, and other motifs. In 1930 production finally stopped in Scotland, but the rights and moulds were bought by the Bovey Tracey pottery in Devon and Nekola's son moved there and continued to produce Wemyss-style ware until 1942.

"wood-engraving","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>wood-engraving</b><div class=""context"">Something of a misnomer, it is a type of <a href=""entry://woodcut""><span class=""links"">woodcut</span></a>, but more durable and capable of finer detail and being printed in larger editions. The design is cut away not with a knife, as in woodcut, but with the engraver's tool, the <a href=""entry://graver""><span class=""links"">graver</span></a> or <a href=""entry://burin""><span class=""links"">burin</span></a>. A very hard wood, such as boxwood, is used and cut across the grain (‘end-grain’). As box has a small diameter, larger designs can only be achieved by combining a number of blocks, the relative heights of which can be varied when they are bolted together to give different qualities to the various parts of the design. The technique developed out of the European woodcut tradition and was used from the 17th century onwards for book illustration, particularly vignettes and tail-pieces. In England it is particularly associated with the <a href=""entry://vignette""><span class=""links"">vignettes</span></a> of animals and landscapes designed and engraved by Thomas Bewick (1753&ndash;1828), and with William Blake's illustrations to Thornton's <i>The Pastorals of Virgil</i> (1821). From around 1830 onwards wood-engraving was very widely used in the commercial sense in Europe and America for the illustrations of works published in very large editions. Technological advances meant that from about 1860 it was possible to transfer a design photographically on to a block without the need for drawing on it. Wood-engraving also enjoyed sporadic revivals as a ‘fine art’ technique, most notably in England between the two World Wars."
"woodcut","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"" />
<b>woodcut</b><div class=""context"">A printmaking technique of printing in relief from a wooden block usually made from the plank of a fairly soft wood. The artist draws the design either directly onto the block or onto a sheet of paper which is then glued onto the block. A specialist is usually employed to cut away, with <a href=""entry://gouge""><span class=""links"">gouges</span></a> and <a href=""entry://chisel""><span class=""links"">chisels</span></a>, the wood at the sides of the lines the artist has drawn. The block is then inked and printed from, using either a printing press or hand pressure. Printing from woodblocks was invented in China but did not reach the West until the 13th century when it was at first used for printing designs onto textiles. The earliest woodcuts on paper date from the late 14th century and the technique soon became widely used for the production of relatively crude playing cards and religious imagery. Only in the late 15th century was it taken up by artists of the first rank such as Albrecht Dürer in Nuremberg, stimulated by the need for illustrations for printed books: type and woodblock could be printed in combination from the same press. Dürer's own great series of the <i>Apocalypse</i> (1499) and the <i>Great Passion</i> and <i>Life of the Virgin</i> (1511) originally had facing texts. The technique spread to other Germanic centres, but by the mid-16th century its popularity began to decline. The Netherlands, France (Paris and Lyons), and Italy (Florence and Venice) also had significant woodcut traditions. After 1600 there were sporadic revivals of the woodcut in the Netherlands (Jegher's woodcuts after Rubens) and in England (Hogarth's <i>Four Stages of Cruelty</i>), but it was only seriously taken up again in the late 19th century by artists such as Gauguin and Munch. In the early 20th century it was the favoured printmaking technique of the Dresden-based group of <a href=""entry://Expressionism""><span class=""links"">Expressionists</span></a>, Die <a href=""entry://Brücke, Die""><span class=""links"">Brücke</span></a>."
