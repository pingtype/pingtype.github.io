<b>aberration</b><br><b>1</b>
<font class=""bir"">(in optics)</font> A defect in the image formed by a lens or curved mirror. In <i>chromatic aberration</i> the image formed by a lens (but not a mirror) has coloured fringes as a result of the different extent to which light of different colours is refracted by glass. It is corrected by using an <a href=""entry://achromatic lens"">achromatic lens</a>. In <i>spherical aberration</i> , the rays from the object come to a focus in slightly different positions as a result of the curvature of the lens or mirror. For a mirror receiving light strictly parallel with its axis, this can be corrected by using a parabolic surface rather than a spherical surface. Spherical aberration in lenses is minimized by making both surfaces contribute equally to the ray deviations, and can (though with reduced image brightness) be reduced by the use of diaphragms to let light pass only through the centre part of the lens.

"acoustics","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>acoustics</b><br><b>1</b> The study of sound and sound waves.
<br><b>2</b> The characteristics of a building, especially an auditorium, with regard to its ability to enable speech and music to be heard clearly within it. For this purpose there should be no obtrusive echoes or resonances and the reverberation time should be near the optimum for the hall. Echoes are reduced by avoiding sweeping curved surfaces that could focus the sound and by breaking up large plane surfaces or covering them with sound-absorbing materials. Resonance is avoided by avoiding simple ratios for the main dimensions of the room, so that no one wavelength of sound is a factor of more than one of them. If the reverberation time is too long, speech will sound indistinct and music will be badly articulated, with one note persisting during the next. However, if it is too short, music sounds dead. It is long in a bare room with hard walls, and can be deliberately reduced by carpets, soft furnishings and sound-absorbent (‘acoustic’) felt. Reverberation times tend to be reduced by the presence of an audience and this must be taken into account in the design of the building."

"alternating current","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>alternating current</b>(a.c.)
<br>An electric current that reverses its direction with a constant <a href=""entry://frequency"">frequency</a> (<i>f</i>). If a graph of the current against time has the form of a <a href=""entry://sine wave"">sine wave</a>, the current is said to be <i>sinusoidal</i> .

This r.m.s. value is more useful as it is comparable to a d.c. value in being a measure of the ability of the current to transmit power. The instantaneous value of a sinusoidal current (<i>I</i>) is given by <div class=""equ""><i>I</i> = <i>I</i><sub class=""ind"">o</sub>sin2π</img><i>ft</i>.</div>

"Ampère's rule","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Ampère's rule</b><br>A rule that relates the direction of the electric current passing through a conductor and the magnetic field associated with it.

An equivalent statement to Ampère's rule is known as the <i>corkscrew rule</i> . A corkscrew, or screwdriver, is said to be right-handed if turning the corkscrew in a clockwise direction drives the screw into the object (such as the cork of a bottle). The corkscrew rule states that a right-handed corkscrew is analogous to an electric current and its magnetic field with the direction of the screw being analogous to an electric current; the direction in which the corkscrew is being turned is analogous to the direction of lines of force of the field"

"aperture","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>aperture</b><br>The effective diameter of a lens or mirror. The ratio of the effective diameter to the focal length is called the <i>relative aperture</i> , which is commonly known as the aperture, especially in photographic usage. The reciprocal of the relative aperture is called the <i>focal ratio</i> . The numerical value of the focal ratio is known as the <i>f-number</i> of a lens. For example, a camera lens with a 40 mm focal length and a 10 mm aperture has a relative aperture of 0.25 and a focal ratio of 4. Its f-number would be f/4, often written f4.

"atom","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>atom</b><br>The smallest part of an element that can exist. Atoms consist of a small dense nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by moving electrons. The number of electrons equals the number of protons so the overall charge is zero. The electrons may be thought of as moving in circular or elliptical orbits (see <a href=""entry://Bohr theory"">Bohr theory</a>) or, more accurately, in regions of space around the nucleus (see <a href=""entry://orbital"">orbital</a>).
<br>The <i>electronic structure</i> of an atom refers to the way in which the electrons are arranged about the nucleus, and in particular the <a href=""entry://energy level"">energy levels</a> that they occupy. Each electron can be characterized by a set of four quantum numbers, as follows:
<blockquote class=""blk"">(1)&nbsp;The <i>principal quantum number <span class=""italic"">n</i></span> gives the main energy level and has values 1, 2, 3, etc. (the higher the number, the further the electron from the nucleus). Traditionally, these levels, or the orbits corresponding to them, are referred to as <i>shells</i> and given letters K, L, M, etc. The K-shell is the one nearest the nucleus.
<br> (2)&nbsp;The <i>orbital quantum number <span class=""italic"">l</i></span> , which governs the angular momentum of the electron. The possible values of <i>l</i> are (<i>n</i> - 1), (<i>n</i> - 2), …, 1, 0. Thus, in the first shell (<i>n</i> = 1) the electrons can only have angular momentum zero (<i>l</i> = 0). In the second shell (<i>n</i> = 2), the values of <i>l</i> can be 1 or 0, giving rise to two subshells of slightly different energy. In the third shell (<i>n</i> = 3) there are three subshells, with <i>l</i> = 2, 1, or 0. The subshells are denoted by letters <i>s</i> (<i>l</i> = 0), <i>p</i> (<i>l</i> = 1), <i>d</i> (<i>l</i> = 2), <i>f</i> (<i>l</i> = 3). The orbital quantum number is sometimes called the <i>azimuthal quantum number</i> .
<br>(3)&nbsp;The <i>magnetic quantum number <span class=""italic"">m</i></span> , which governs the energies of electrons in an external magnetic field. This can take values of +<i>l</i>, +(<i>l</i> - 1), …, 1, 0, -1, …, -(<i>l</i> - 1), -<i>l</i>. In an s-subshell (i.e. <i>l</i> = 0) the value of <i>m</i> = 0. In a <i>p</i>-subshell (<i>l</i> = 1), <i>m</i> can have values +1, 0, and -1; i.e. there are three <i>p</i>-orbitals in the <i>p</i>-subshell, usually designated <i>p</i><sub class=""ind""><i>x</i></sub>, <i>p</i><sub class=""ind""><i>y</i></sub>, and <i>p</i><sub class=""ind""><i>z</i></sub>. Under normal circumstances, these all have the same energy level.
<br> (4)&nbsp;The <i>spin quantum number <span class=""italic"">m</i><sub class=""ind"">s</sub></span> , which gives the spin of the individual electrons and can have the values +1/2 or -1/2.
<br></blockquote>
<br>According to the <a href=""entry://Pauli exclusion principle"">Pauli exclusion principle</a>, no two electrons in the atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. The numbers define the <i>quantum state</i> of the electron, and explain how the electronic structures of atoms occur.

"balance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>balance</b><br>An accurate weighing device. The simple <i>beam balance</i> consists of two pans suspended from a centrally pivoted beam. Known masses are placed on one pan and the substance or body to be weighed is placed in the other. When the beam is exactly horizontal the two masses are equal. An accurate laboratory balance weights to the nearest hundredth of a milligram. Specially designed balances can be accurate to a millionth of a milligram. More modern <i>substitution balances</i> use the substitution principle. In this calibrated weights are removed from the single lever arm to bring the single pan suspended from it into equilibrium with a fixed counter weight. The substitution balance is more accurate than the two-pan device and enables weighing to be carried out more rapidly. In automatic electronic balances, mass is determined not by mechanical deflection but by electronically controlled compensation of an electric force. A scanner monitors the displacement of the pan support generating a current proportional to the displacement. This current flows through a coil forcing the pan support to return to its original position by means of a magnetic force. The signal generated enables the mass to be read from a digital display. The mass of the empty container can be stored in the balance's computer memory and automatically deducted from the mass of the container plus its contents.

"band theory","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>band theory</b><br>The theory that, in crystals, electrons fall into allowed <a href=""entry://energy band"">energy bands</a>, between which lie forbidden bands. Although <a href=""entry://free-electron theory"">free-electron theory</a> can explain the electrical properties of materials, to understand fully the nature of electrical conduction, free-electron theory must be modified to include the effect of the crystal lattice in which the electrons move. Band theory modifies the free-electron treatment by including a regular periodic potential resulting from the positive ions in the lattice. Although the presence of the lattice alone does not give rise to electron scattering, except under special conditions, the periodic potential generated by the lattice does change the distribution of electron states given by the simple free-electron model.
<br>In principle the original particle-in-a-box problem is modified by the addition of an extra potential term V(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>x</i>), where <i>V</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>x</i>) has the same periodicity of the lattice it represents. The <a href=""entry://Schrödinger equation"">Schrödinger equation</a> (see also <a href=""entry://quantum mechanics"">quantum mechanics</a>) that must be satisfied by these electron matter waves, ψ, is then: <div class=""equ"">- (h/2<i>m</i>)<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>(∂<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>ψ/∂<i>x</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup> + ∂<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>ψ/∂<i>y</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup> + ∂<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>ψ/<i>z</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>) + V(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>)ψ = <i>E</i>ψ</div><center class=""pic""><img src=""000053.jpg"" ></img><br>Band theory</center>
<br>where <i>E</i> is the energy of the state associated with ψ. This equation is often called the <i>Block equation</i> ; it is difficult to solve even using approximate methods.
<br>As with the free-electron model, the Block equation leads to a relationship between the momenta that characterize an electron state, and the energy of that state. However, this relationship is no longer the simple parabolic function: <div class=""equ""><i>E</i> = <i>p</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/2<i>m</i></div>,
<br>where <i>p</i> is the electron momentum that characterizes the state, and <i>m</i> is the mass of the electron. Instead the function is multivalued and there are certain forbidden bands of energy, i.e. no permitted states exist for them. The relationship between <i>E</i> and <i>p</i> for a one-dimensional crystal is shown in diagram (1).
<br>The main feature is that all the curves repeat themselves over an interval in <i>p</i> of <i>h</i>/<i>a</i>, where <i>h</i> is the Planck constant and <i>a</i> is called the <i>lattice constant</i> . The electron states on the lower curve indicated by the points S, S', and S?, are identical states except for their momentum values. The upper curves show that for each momentum value there are several permitted energies; one within each <a href=""entry://energy band"">energy band</a> (e.g. P, P', P?). In order to avoid the confusion that would arise if the complete multivalued set of curves were used, it is conventional to choose certain sections of them in which as <i>p</i> increases so does energy <i>E</i>. The smallest values, starting from <i>p</i> = 0, are reserved for the lowest energy band &ndash; the lowest curve in diagram (1). The next set from <i>p</i> = <i>h/2a</i> to <i>h</i>/<i>a</i> and -<i>h/2a</i> to -<i>h</i>/<i>a</i> is reserved for the second energy band, (the middle curve in diagram (1), and so on. This zone structure is illustrated in diagram (2) and is called the <i>extended zone scheme</i> . It is merely a useful convention; any sets of <i>p</i> values that cover a range of <i>h</i>/<i>a</i> could be used to span all the available energy states.
<br>A comparison of the extended zone scheme and the results of the free-electron model may easily be made by considering the relationship between <i>E</i> and <i>p</i> in the two models. This is shown in diagram (2) with the broken line corresponding to the free-electron parabolic relationship, <i>E</i>˜<i>p</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>.
<br>The number of permitted values of <i>p</i> in each of the extended zones is equal to the number of ions in the crystal. As in the free-electron theory, each state corresponding to a value of <i>p</i> can take up two orientations of <a href=""entry://spin"">spin</a>. So the total number of states in each zone is twice the number of ions in the lattice. This means that if the metal has only one electron per atom contributing to conduction, the electrons in the metal will only occupy all the states in the lower half of the zone &mdash; the shaded area in figure (2). No more than one electron can occupy any single state. This restriction on state occupation arises because electrons are <i>fermions</i> and therefore obey <i>Fermi-Dirac statistics</i> . For such a monovalent metal the energy distribution is virtually the same on the basis of either the free electron or band theory models, because the electrons have not started filling states beyond the first forbidden zone.
<br>When the material has an even number of electrons per atom there would be an occupation of an integral number of zones. If an electric field were to be applied within the material, there would be a shift in the distribution of electron momenta that could only occur if and only if the zones are at close energy proximity. The electrons at the top of the uppermost filled zone can then obtain enough extra energy (e.g. from thermal excitations) to jump over the forbidden energy gap so that they can occupy permitted energy states at the bottom of the next zone. If this energy is very high compared with thermal energies, excitations to the next band cannot occur and there will be no current. The material would be classed as an <a href=""entry://insulator"">insulator</a>.
<br>If the energy gap is not too large, a few electrons can absorb enough thermal energy to cross the forbidden energy gap. At room temperature thermal excitations are sufficiently large to breach this gap and to enable a small current to flow. Because the amount of excitation will increase with temperature, the conductivity will also increase with temperature. This behaviour is typical of a <a href=""entry://semiconductor"">semiconductor</a>.
<br>Finally, elements with an odd number of electrons per atom are normally electrical conductors. This is because there are always unfilled states available within a given half-filled band. The electron momentum distribution within a band always looks like a small section of the free electron model for that particular extended zone"

"barometer","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>barometer</b><br>A device for measuring <a href=""entry://atmospheric pressure"">atmospheric pressure</a>. The <i>mercury barometer</i> in its simplest form consists of a glass tube about 80 cm long sealed at one end and filled with mercury. The tube is then inverted and the open end is submerged in a reservoir of mercury; the mercury column is held up by the pressure of the atmosphere acting on the surface of mercury in the reservoir. This type of device was invented by the Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli (1608&ndash;47), who first noticed the variation in height from day to day, and constructed a barometer in 1644.
<br>In such a device, the force exerted by the atmosphere balanced the weight of the mercury column. If the height of the column is <i>h</i> and the cross-sectional area of the tube is A, then the volume of the mercury in the column is <i>hA</i> and its weight is <i>hA</i>ρ, where ρ is the density of mercury. The force is thus <i>hA</i>ρ<i>g</i>, where <i>g</i> is the acceleration of free fall and the pressure exerted is this force divided by the area of the tube; i.e.<i> h</i>ρ<i>g</i>. Note that the height of the mercury is independent of the diameter of the tube. At standard atmospheric pressure the column is 760 mm high. The pressure is then expressed as 760 mmHg (101 325 pascals).
<br>Mercury barometers of this type, with a reservoir of mercury, are known as <i>cistern barometers</i> . A common type is the <i>Fortin barometer</i> , in which the mercury is held in a leather bag so that the level in the reservoir can be adjusted. The height is read from a scale along the side of the tube in conjunction with a vernier scale that can be moved up and down. Corrections are made for temperature.
<br>The second main type of barometer is the <i>aneroid barometer</i> , in which the cumbersome mercury column is replaced by a metal box with a thin corrugated lid. The air is removed from the box and the lid is supported by a spring. Variations in atmospheric pressure cause the lid to move against the spring. This movement is magnified by a system of delicate levers and made to move a needle around a scale. The aneroid barometer is less accurate than the mercury type but much more robust and convenient, hence its use in <a href=""entry://altimeter"">altimeters</a>. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000064.jpg"" ></img><br> Mercury barometer</center>"

The excess heat produced enables up to 30% of scrap to be incorporated into the charge. The process has largely replaced the Bessemer and open-hearth processes"

<b>big-bang</b><br>The cosmological theory that all the matter and energy in the universe originated from a state of enormous density and temperature that exploded at a finite moment in the past.
<br><b><span class=""uCase"">BIG-BANG THEORY</b></span> Newton's work gave a mathematical basis for the universe on a large scale. However, the data available at the time suggested a static unchanging universe. This could not easily be explained in the context of the law of gravitation, since all bodies in the universe attract all other bodies with the force of gravity. Newton realized that there was only one solution to this problem: in a static universe, matter had to be uniformly spread throughout an infinitely large space. In 1826, Heinrich Olbers published a paper containing what is known as <a href=""entry://Olbers' paradox"">Olbers' paradox</a>; the universe had to be infinite and uniform to avoid gravitational collapse, but such a universe would lead to a perpetually bright sky on earth. Space&ndash;time Cosmologists now believe that Newton's model was based on incorrect assumptions about the structure of space, time, and matter. Both Newton and Olbers imagined space to be infinite and to be independent of the matter it contained. Einstein in his general theory of <a href=""entry://relativity"">relativity</a> (1915) proposed that the universe exists in four-dimensional space-time. This space-time is curved by the presence of matter, and the matter moves by following the resulting curves. The expanding universe The discovery by Hubble in 1929 that the universe is expanding provided a starting point for the ideas on which our present understanding of the universe is based. Hubble made his discovery by analysing the spectra of light from distant galaxies and noting a persistent <a href=""entry://redshift"">redshift</a>, which he explained in terms of the <a href=""entry://Doppler effect"">Doppler effect</a>; an increase in observed wavelengths of light occurs because the light source is receding from the observer. The larger the speed of recession, the larger the red-shifts. Hubble discovered a pattern in his data: the further away the galaxy, the greater the speed of recession. Known as <i>Hubble's law</i> , this provided the evidence that the universe is expanding and a resolution to Olbers' paradox. If the galaxies and the earth are moving apart, the radiation falling on the earth from the galaxies is reduced and is also redshifted by an amount proportional to the distance. The further galaxies are away from the earth, the smaller their contribution to the radiation falling on the earth. The night sky is dark because the universe is expanding.
<br>This model might seem to place the earth at the centre of the universe again. However, it is space itself that is expanding and the galaxies are embedded in this space. The ring (space) in the diagram has dots (the galaxies). The expansion of the ring means that the view from any one dot is that the other dots are receding at a speed proportional to their distance away. No single dot is at the centre of the system but all dots see the same thing. Hubble's discovery satisfies the <i>cosmological principle</i> that the universe should appear the same no matter where one is in the universe. Age of the universe Hubble's law may be stated in the form: <i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub> = <i>v</i>/<i>d</i>, where <i>v</i> is the speed of recession of the galaxy, <i>d</i> is the earth-galaxy distance, and <i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub> is called the <i>Hubble constant</i> . Assuming that the galaxies have always been moving apart at the speeds observed at present, the age of the universe (<i>T</i>) can be estimated, i.e. <i>T</i> = 1/<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub>. On this basis the age of the universe would be 15&ndash;18 billion years. This implies that there must have been a time when space and time were minutely small, with all the matter and energy of the universe concentrated into this small volume. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000093.jpg"" ></img></center>
<br>The expansion leads to the recession of B from A along the ring. The speed of recession will be directly proportional to the distance of B from A along the ring. The origin of the universe This view of the origin of the universe is called the <i>big-bang theory</i> . The theory suggests that the universe originated as a minute but very hot body and that the temperature has been falling as the expansion has continued. In 1945 George Gamow predicted that there should be a <a href=""entry://microwave background"">microwave background</a> corresponding to a black-body temperature a few degrees above absolute zero. This microwave background was discovered 20 years later. Before the big-bang theory, cosmologists could only account for 2&ndash;3% of the helium in the universe by arguing that it had been formed by <a href=""entry://nuclear fusion"">nuclear fusion</a> of hydrogen in early stars. The big-bang theory actually required a period in the evolution of the universe when helium should have been produced to present levels (approximately 70% hydrogen and 27% helium).
<br>In 1992, the COBE satellite discovered that there were very small variations in the microwave background. This discovery helped to explain why the universe formed into galaxies and stars. Had the universe been uniform in all directions, there would be no reason for gravitational collapse at any one point. The non-uniformities that began the nucleation of galactic matter in the early universe now appear as the small variations in the microwave background. Fundamental forces It is thought that the four <a href=""entry://fundamental"">fundamental</a> interactions in the universe are all manifestations of the same force. This force existed when the big bang occurred at a temperature above 10<sup class=""expo"">15</sup> K. As the universe cooled the forces separated as the original symmetries were broken. Gravity was the first to separate, followed by the strong nuclear force, and the weak and electromagnetic forces (see table). <center class=""pic"">

</tr></table></center> The future Research into the future of the universe is clearly speculative. Whether the universe will continue to expand indefinitely depends on its mean density. Below a critical level (the critical density), gravitational attraction will not be enough to stop the expansion. However, if the mean density is above the critical density the universe is <i>bound</i> and an eventual contraction will occur, resulting in a <i>big crunch</i> . This may precede another big bang initiating the whole cycle again"

"black hole","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>black hole</b><br>An object in space that has collapsed under its own gravitational forces to such an extent that its <a href=""entry://escape velocity"">escape velocity</a> is equal to the speed of light. Black holes are believed to be formed in the gravitational collapse of massive stars at the ends of their lives (see <a href=""entry://death of a star"">death of a star</a>; <a href=""entry://stellar evolution"">stellar evolution</a>; <a href=""entry://supernova"">supernova</a>). If the mass of an evolved stellar core is greater than the <a href=""entry://Chandrasekhar limit"">Chandrasekhar limit</a> for neutron stars then neutron degeneracy pressure is unable to prevent contraction until the gravitational field is sufficiently strong to prevent the escape of electromagnetic radiation. The boundary of the black hole, which is known as the <i>event horizon</i> , is the surface in space at which the gravitational field reaches this critical value. Events occurring within this horizon (i.e. in the interior of the black hole) cannot be observed from outside
<br>.The theoretical study of black holes involves the use of general <a href=""entry://relativity"">relativity</a>. It has been shown that a black hole can be characterized uniquely by just three properties: its mass, angular momentum, and electrical charge (this is known as the no-hair theorem). Mathematical expressions have been derived for describing black holes; these are the <i>Schwarzschild solution</i> (uncharged nonrotating hole), the <i>Reissner&mdash;Nordstrøm solution</i> (charged nonrotating hole), the <i>Kerr solution</i> (uncharged rotating hole), and the <i>Kerr&mdash;Newman solution</i> (charged rotating hole).
<br>The ultimate fate of matter inside the black hole's event horizon is as yet unknown. General relativity predicts that at the centre of the hole there is a <i>singularity</i> , a point at which the density becomes infinite and the presently understood laws of physics break down. It is possible that a successful quantum theory of gravity could resolve this problem. However, since any singularity is hidden within the event horizon, it cannot influence the outside universe, so the normal laws of physics, including general relativity, can be used to describe processes outside the black hole.
<br>Observational evidence of objects thought to be black holes comes from their effect on surrounding matter. Thus, if a black hole is part of a binary system with another star it will attract and capture matter from this star. The material leaving the star first forms a rotating <i>accretion disc</i> around the black hole, in which the matter becomes compressed and heated to such an extent that it emits X-rays. In the constellation Cygnus there is an X-ray source, Cygnus X-1, which consists of a supergiant star revolving around a small invisible companion with a mass of about ten times that of the sun, and therefore well above the Chandrasekhar limit. The companion is thought to be a black hole. Black holes have also been postulated as the power sources of <a href=""entry://quasars"">quasars</a> and as possible generators of <a href=""entry://gravitational waves"">gravitational waves</a>.
<br>Theoreticians have also postulated the existence of ‘mini’ black holes (with masses of about 10<sup class=""expo"">12</sup> kilogram and radii about 10<sup class=""expo"">-15</sup> metre). Such entities might have been formed shortly after the big bang when the universe was created.

"blast furnace","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>blast furnace</b><br>A furnace for smelting iron ores, such as haematite (Fe<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>O<sub class=""ind"">3</sub>) or magnetite (Fe<sub class=""ind"">3</sub>O<sub class=""ind"">4</sub>), to make <a href=""entry://pig iron"">pig iron</a>. The furnace is a tall refractory-lined cylindrical structure that is charged at the top with the dressed ore, coke, and a flux, usually limestone. The conversion of the iron oxides to metallic iron is a reduction process in which carbon monoxide and hydrogen are the reducing agents. The overall reaction can be summarized thus:<div class=""equ"">Fe<sub class=""ind"">3</sub>O<sub class=""ind"">4</sub> + 2CO + 2H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>→ 3Fe + 2CO<sub class=""ind"">2</sub> + 2H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>O</div>The CO is obtained within the furnace by blasting the coke with hot air from a ring of tuyeres about two-thirds of the way down the furnace.

In the modern <i>direct-reduction process</i> the CO and H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub> may be produced separately so that the reduction process can proceed at a lower temperature. The pig iron produced by a blast furnace contains about 4% carbon and further refining is usually required to produce steel or cast iron"
"Bloch's theorem","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Bloch's theorem</b><br>A theorem relating to the quantum mechanics of crystals stating that the wave function ψ for an electron in a periodic potential has the form ψ(<b>r</b>) = exp(i<b>k</b>·<b>r</b>)U(<b>r</b>), where <b>k</b> is the <a href=""entry://wave vector"">wave vector</a>, <b>r</b> is a position vector, and U(<b>r</b>) is a periodic function that satisfies U(<b>r</b> + <b>R</b>) = U(<b>r</b>), for all vectors <b>R</b> of the Bravais lattice of the crystal.

"Bohr theory","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Bohr theory</b><br>The theory published in 1913 by Niels Bohr to explain the line spectrum of hydrogen. He assumed that a single electron of mass <i>m</i> travelled in a circular orbit of radius <i>r</i>, at a velocity <i>v</i>, around a positively charged nucleus. The <a href=""entry://angular momentum"">angular momentum</a> of the electron would then be <i>mvr</i>. Bohr proposed that electrons could only occupy orbits in which this angular momentum had certain fixed values, <i>h</i>/2π</img>, 2h/2π</img>, 3<i>h</i>/2π</img>,…n<i>h</i>/2π</img>, where <i>h</i> is the Planck constant. This means that the angular momentum is quantized, i.e. can only have certain values, each of which is a multiple of <i>n</i>. Each permitted value of <i>n</i> is associated with an orbit of different radius and Bohr assumed that when the atom emitted or absorbed radiation of frequency v, the electron jumped from one orbit to another; the energy emitted or absorbed by each jump is equal to <i>hv</i>. This theory gave good results in predicting the lines observed in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and simple ions such as He<sup class=""expo"">+</sup>, Li<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup>, etc. The idea of quantized values of angular momentum was later explained by the wave nature of the electron. Each orbit has to have a whole number of wavelengths around it; i.e. <i>nλ</i> = 2π</img>r, where λ is the wavelength and <i>n</i> a whole number. The wavelength of a particle is given by <i>h/mv</i>, so <i>nh</i>/<i>mv</i> = 2π</img>r, which leads to <i>mvr</i> = <i>nh</i>/2π</img>. Modern atomic theory does not allow subatomic particles to be treated in the same way as large objects, and Bohr's reasoning is somewhat discredited. However, the idea of quantized angular momentum has been retained"

"buckminsterfullerene","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>buckminsterfullerene</b><br>A form of carbon composed of clusters of 60 carbon atoms bonded together in a polyhedral structure composed of pentagons and hexagons (see illustration). Originally it was identified in 1985 in products obtained by firing a high-power laser at a graphite target. It can be made by an electric arc struck between graphite electrodes in an inert atmosphere. The molecule, C<sub class=""ind"">60</sub>, was named after the US architect Richard Buckminster Fuller (1895&ndash;1983) because of the resemblance of the structure to the geodesic dome, which Fuller invented. The molecules are informally called <i>buckyballs</i> ; more formally, the substance itself is also called <i>fullerene</i> . The substance is a yellow crystalline solid (<i>fullerite</i> ), soluble in benzene.
<br>Various fullerene derivatives are known in which organic groups are attached to carbon atoms on the sphere. In addition, it is possible to produce novel enclosure compounds by trapping metal ions within the C<sub class=""ind"">60</sub> cage. Some of these have semiconducting properties. The electric-arc method of producing C<sub class=""ind"">60</sub> also leads to a smaller number of fullerenes such as C<sub class=""ind"">70</sub>, which have less symmetrical molecular structures. It is also possible to produce forms of carbon in which the atoms are linked in a cylindrical, rather than spherical, framework with a diameter of a few nanometres.

For example, the velocity <i>V</i> of a body at a particular instant can be regarded as the infinitesimal distance, written ds, that it travels in the vanishingly small time interval, d<i>t</i>; the instantaneous velocity <i>v</i> is then d<i>s</i>/d<i>t</i>, which is called the <i>derivative</i> of <i>s</i> with respect to <i>t</i>.

<br>A method of estimating the ages of archaeological specimens of biological origin.

<br>Some of these radiocarbon atoms find their way into living trees and other plants in the form of carbon dioxide, as a result of photosynthesis. When the tree is cut down photosynthesis stops and the ratio of radiocarbon atoms to stable carbon atoms begins to fall as the radiocarbon decays. The ratio <sup class=""expo"">14</sup>C/<sup class=""expo"">12</sup>C in the specimen can be measured and enables the time that has elapsed since the tree was cut down to be calculated. The method has been shown to give consistent results for specimens up to some 40 000 years old, though its accuracy depends upon assumptions concerning the past intensity of the cosmic radiation. The technique was developed by Willard F. Libby (1908&ndash;80) and his coworkers in 1946&ndash;47"

<b>Carnot cycle</b>
<br>The most efficient cycle of operations for a reversible <a href=""entry://heat engine"">heat engine</a>. Published in 1824 by N. L. S. Carnot, it consists of four operations on the working substance in the engine (see illustration):
<br>➠<b>a</b> Isothermal expansion at thermodynamic temperature T<sub class=""ind"">1</sub> with heat q<sub class=""ind"">1</sub> taken in.
<br>➠<b>b</b> Adiabatic expansion with a fall of temperature to <i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>.

<br>➠<b>d</b> Adiabatic compression with a rise of temperature back to <i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>. According to the <i>Carnot principle</i> , the efficiency of any reversible heat engine depends only on the temperature range through which it works, rather than the properties of the working substances. In any reversible engine, the efficiency (η) is the ratio of the work done (<i>W</i>) to the heat input (<i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>), i.e. η = <i>W</i>/<i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>. As, according to the first law of <a href=""entry://thermodynamics"">thermodynamics</a>, <i>W</i> = <i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> - <i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>, it follows that η = (<i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> - <i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>)/<i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>.

"catalytic converter","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>catalytic converter</b><br>A device used in the exhaust systems of motor vehicles to reduce atmospheric pollution. The three main pollutants produced by petrol engines are: unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide produced by incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides produced by nitrogen in the air reacting with oxygen at high engine temperatures. Hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide can be controlled by a higher combustion temperature and a weaker mixture. However, the higher temperature and greater availability of oxygen arising from these measures encourage formation of nitrogen oxides. The use of three-way catalytic converters solves this problem by using platinum and palladium catalysts to oxidize the hydrocarbons and the CO and rhodium catalysts to reduce the nitrogen oxides back to nitrogen. These three-way catalysts require that the air-fuel ratio is strictly stochiometric. Some catalytic converters promote oxidation reactions only, leaving the nitrogen oxides unchanged. Three-way converters can reduce hydrocarbons and CO emissions by some 85%, at the same time reducing nitrogen oxides by 62%"

"cell","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>cell</b><b><i>(in physical chemistry)</i></b>
</div>
<br><b>1</b> A system in which two electrodes are in contact with an electrolyte. The electrodes are metal or carbon plates or rods or, in some cases, liquid metals (e.g. mercury). In an <a href=""entry://electrolytic cell"">electrolytic cell</a> a current from an outside source is passed through the electrolyte to produce chemical change (see <a href=""entry://electrolysis"">electrolysis</a>). In a <a href=""entry://voltaic cell"">voltaic cell</a>, spontaneous reactions between the electrodes and electrolyte(s) produce a potential difference between the two electrodes.
<br>Voltaic cells can be regarded as made up of two <a href=""entry://half cell"">half cells</a>, each composed of an electrode in contact with an electrolyte. For instance, a zinc rod dipped in zinc sulphate solution is a Zn Zn | Zn<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup> half cell. In such a system zinc atoms dissolve as zinc ions, leaving a negative charge on the electrode <div class=""equ"">Zn(s) → Zn<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup>(aq) + 2e</div>
<br>The solution of zinc continues until the charge build-up is sufficient to prevent further ionization. There is then a potential difference between the zinc rod and its solution. This cannot be measured directly, since measurement would involve making contact with the electrolyte, thereby introducing another half cell (see <a href=""entry://electrode potential"">electrode potential</a>). A rod of copper in copper sulphate solution comprises another half cell. In this case the spontaneous reaction is one in which copper ions in solution take electrons from the electrode and are deposited on the electrode as copper atoms. In this case, the copper acquires a positive charge.
<br>The two half cells can be connected by using a porous pot for the liquid junction (as in the Daniell cell) or by using a salt bridge. The resulting cell can then supply current if the electrodes are connected through an external circuit. The cell is written <div class=""equ"">Zn(s) | Zn<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup>(aq) | Cu<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup>(aq) | Cu</div>
<div class=""equ""><i>E</i> = 1.10 V</div> Here, <i>E</i> is the e.m.f. of the cell equal to the potential of the right-hand electrode minus that of the left-hand electrode for zero current. Note that ‘right’ and ‘left’ refer to the cell as written. Thus, the cell could be written <div class=""equ"">Cu(s) | Cu<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup>(aq) | Zn<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup>(aq) | Zn(s)</div>
<div class=""equ"">E = -1.10 V</div> The overall reaction for the cell is <div class=""equ"">Zn(s) + Cu<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup>(aq) | Cu(s) + Zn<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup>(aq)</div> This is the direction in which the cell reaction occurs for a positive e.m.f.
<br>The cell above is a simple example of a <i>chemical cell</i> ; i.e. one in which the e.m.f. is produced by a chemical difference. <i>Concentration cells</i> are cells in which the e.m.f. is caused by a difference of concentration. This may be a difference in concentration of the electrolyte in the two half cells. Alternatively, it may be an electrode concentration difference (e.g. different concentrations of metal in an amalgam, or different pressures of gas in two gas electrodes). Cells are also classified into cells <i>without transport</i> (having a single electrolyte) and <i>with transport</i> (having a liquid junction across which ions are transferred). Various types of voltaic cell exist, used as sources of current, standards of potential, and experimental set-ups for studying electrochemical reactions.

"centripetal force","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>centripetal force</b><br>A force acting on a body causing it to move in a circular path. If the mass of the body is <i>m</i>, its constant speed <i>v</i>, and the radius of the circle r, the magnitude of the force is <i>mv</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/<i>r</i> and it is directed towards the centre of the circle. Even though the body is moving with a constant speed <i>v</i>, its velocity is changing, because its direction is constantly changing. There is therefore an acceleration <i>v</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/<i>r</i> towards the centre of the circle. For example, when an object is tied to a string and swung in a horizontal circle there is a tension in the string equal to <i>mv</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/<i>r</i>. If the string breaks, this restraining force disappears and the object will move off in a straight line along the tangent to the circle in which it was previously moving.
<br>In the case of a satellite (mass <i>m</i>) orbiting the earth (mass <i>M</i>), the centripetal force holding the satellite in orbit is the gravitational force, <i>GmM</i>/<i>d</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>, where <i>G</i> is the gravitational constant and <i>d</i> is the height of the satellite above the centre of the earth. Therefore <i>GmM</i>/<i>d</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup> = <i>mv</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/<i>d</i>. This equation enables the height of the orbit to be calculated for a given orbital velocity.
<br>Another way of looking at this situation, which was once popular, is to assume that the centripetal force is balanced by an equal and opposite force, acting away from the centre of the circle, called the <i>centrifugal force</i> . One could then say that the satellite stays in orbit when the centrifugal force balances the gravitational force. This is, however, a confusing argument because the centrifugal force is fictitious &ndash; it does not exist. The gravitational force is not balanced by the centrifugal force: it <i>is</i> the centripetal force.
<br>Another example is that of a car rounding a bend. To an observer in the car, a tennis ball lying on the back shelf will roll across the shelf as if it was acted on by an outward centrifugal force. However, to an observer outside the car it can be seen that the ball, because of its almost frictionless contact with the car, is continuing in its straight line motion, uninfluenced by the centripetal force. Occasionally the concept of a centrifugal force can be useful, as long as it is recognized as a fictitious force. A true centrifugal force is exerted, as a <a href=""entry://reaction"">reaction</a>, by the rotating object on whatever is providing its centripetal force"

"chaos","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>chaos</b><br>Unpredictable and seemingly random behaviour occurring in a system that should be governed by deterministic laws. In such systems, the equations that describe the way the system changes with time are nonlinear and involve several variables. Consequently, they are very sensitive to the initial conditions, and a very small initial difference may make an enormous change to the future state of the system. Originally, the theory was introduced to describe unpredictability in meteorology, as exemplified by the <i>butterfly effect</i> . It has been suggested that the dynamical equations governing the weather are so sensitive to the initial data that whether or not a butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world may make the difference between a tornado occurring or not occuring in some other part of the world. Chaos theory has subsequently been extended to other branches of science; for example to turbulent flow, planetary dynamics, and electrical oscillations in physics, and to combustion processes and oscillating reactions in chemistry.

For any <a href=""entry://ideal gas"">ideal gas</a> the fraction is approximately 1/273. This can be expressed by the equation <i>V</i> = <i>V</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub>(1 + <i>t</i>/273), where <i>V</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub> is the volume at 0°C and V is its volume at <i>t</i>°<i>C</i>. This is equivalent to the statement that the volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure is proportional to its thermodynamic temperature, <i>V</i> = <i>kT</i>, where <i>k</i> is a constant. The law resulted from experiments begun around 1787 by J. A. C. Charles but was properly established only by the more accurate results published in 1802 by Joseph Gay-Lussac.

"coagulation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>coagulation</b><br>The process in which colloidal particles come together irreversibly to form larger masses. Coagulation can be brought about by adding ions to change the ionic strength of the solution and thus destabilize the colloid. Ions with a high charge are particularly effective (e.g. alum, containing Al<sup class=""expo"">3+</sup>, is used in styptics to coagulate blood). Another example of ionic coagulation is in the formation of river deltas, which occurs when colloidal silt particles in rivers are coagulated by ions in sea water. Alum and iron(III) sulphate are also used for coagulation in sewage treatment. Heating is another way of coagulating certain colloids (e.g. boiling an egg coagulates the albumin)"
"coal","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>coal</b><br>A brown or black carbonaceous deposit derived from the accumulation and alteration of ancient vegetation, which originated largely in swamps or other moist environments. As the vegetation decomposed it formed layers of peat, which were subsequently buried (for example, by marine sediments following a rise in sea level or subsidence of the land). Under the increased pressure and resulting higher temperatures the peat was transformed into coal. Two types of coal are recognized: <i>humic </i> (or <i>woody) coals</i> , derived from plant remains; and <i>sapropelic coals</i> , which are derived from algae, spores, and finely divided plant material.
<br>As the processes of coalification (i.e. the transformation resulting from the high temperatures and pressures) continue, there is a progressive transformation of the deposit: the proportion of carbon relative to oxygen rises and volatile substances and water are driven out. The various stages in this process are referred to as the <i>ranks</i> of the coal. In ascending order, the main ranks of coal are: <i>lignite</i> (or <i>brown coal</i> ), which is soft, brown, and has a high moisture content; <i>subbituminous coal</i> , which is used chiefly by generating stations; <i>bituminous coal</i> , which is the most abundant rank of coal; <i>semibituminous coal</i> ; <i>semianthracite coal</i> , which has a fixed carbon content of between 86% and 92%; and <i>anthracite coal</i> , which is hard and black with a fixed carbon content of between 92% and 98%.
<br>Most deposits of coal were formed during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. More recent periods of coal formation occurred during the early Jurassic and Tertiary periods. Coal deposits occur in all the major continents; the leading producers include the USA, China, Ukraine, Poland, UK, South Africa, India, Australia, and Germany. Coal is used as a fuel and in the chemical industry; by-products include coke and coal tar"

"colloids","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>colloids</b><br>Colloids were originally defined by Thomas Graham in 1861 as substances, such as starch or gelatin, which will not diffuse through a membrane. He distinguished them from <i>crystalloids</i> (e.g. inorganic salts), which would pass through membranes. Later it was recognized that colloids were distinguished from true solutions by the presence of particles that were too small to be observed with a normal microscope yet were much larger than normal molecules. Colloids are now regarded as systems in which there are two or more phases, with one (the <i>dispersed phase</i> ) distributed in the other (the <i>continous phase</i> ). Moreover, at least one of the phases has small dimensions (in the range 10<sup class=""expo"">-9</sup>-10<sup class=""expo"">-6</sup> m). Colloids are classified in various ways.
<br><i>Sols</i> are dispersions of small solid particles in a liquid. The particles may be macromolecules or may be clusters of small molecules. <i>Lyophobic sols</i> are those in which there is no affinity between the dispersed phase and the liquid. An example is silver chloride dispersed in water. In such colloids the solid particles have a surface charge, which tends to stop them coming together. Lyophobic sols are inherently unstable and in time the particles aggregate and form a precipitate. <i>Lyophilic sols</i> , on the other hand, are more like true solutions in which the solute molecules are large and have an affinity for the solvent. Starch in water is an example of such a system. <i>Association colloids</i> are systems in which the dispersed phase consists of clusters of molecules that have lyophobic and lyophilic parts. Soap in water is an association colloid.
<br><i>Emulsions</i> are colloidal systems in which the dispersed and continous phases are both liquids, e.g. oil-in-water or water-in-oil. Such systems require an emulsifying agent to stabilize the dispersed particles.
<br><i>Gels</i> are colloids in which both dispersed and continuous phases have a three-dimensional network throughout the material, so that it forms a jelly-like mass. Gelatin is a common example. One component may sometimes be removed (e.g. by heating) to leave a rigid gel (e.g. silica gel).
<br>Other types of colloid include <a href=""entry://aerosol"">aerosols</a> (dispersions of liquid or solid particles in a gas, as in a mist or smoke) and foams (dispersions of gases in liquids or solids)"

Trichromatic colorimeters use a mixture of three <a href=""entry://primary colour"">primary colours</a>"
"colour","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>colour</b><br>The sensation produced when light of different wavelengths falls on the human eye. Although the visible spectrum covers a continously varying range of colours from red to violet it is usually split into seven colours (the <i>visible spectrum</i> ) with the following approximate wavelength ranges:
<blockquote class=""blk"">&nbsp;red 740&ndash;620 nm
<br> &nbsp;orange 620&ndash;585 nm
<br> &nbsp;yellow 585&ndash;575 nm
<br> &nbsp;green 575&ndash;500 nm
<br> &nbsp;blue 500&ndash;445 nm
<br> &nbsp;indigo 445&ndash;425 nm
<br> &nbsp;violet 425&ndash;390 nm
<br></blockquote> A mixture of all these colours in the proportions encountered in daylight gives white light; other colours are produced by varying the proportions or omitting components.
<br> A coloured light has three attributes: its <i>hue</i> , depending on its wavelength; its <i>saturation</i> , depending on the degree to which it departs from white light; and its <a href=""entry://luminosity"">luminosity</a>. Coloured objects that owe their colour to pigments or dyes absorb some components of white light and reflect the rest. For example, a red book seen in white light absorbs all the components except the red, which it reflects. This is called a <i>subtractive process</i> as the final colour is that remaining after absorption of the rest. This is the basis of the process used in <a href=""entry://colour photography"">colour photography</a>. Combining coloured lights, on the other hand, is an <i>additive process</i> and this is the method used in <a href=""entry://colour television"">colour television</a>.

When white light shines through the three dye layers the cyan dye subtracts red where it does not occur in the scene, the magenta subtracts green, and the yellow subtracts blue. The light projected by the negative therefore reconstructs the original scene either as a transparency or for use with printing paper"

The complex number therefore has the form <i>x</i> + i<i>y</i>, which can also be written in the polar form <i>r</i>cosθ</img> + i<i>r</i>sinθ</img>, where <i>r</i> is the <i>modulus</i> and θ</img> is the <i>argument</i> (or <i>amplitude</i> ). A complex number can be represented on an <i>Argand diagram</i> , devised by J. R. Argand (1768&ndash;1822), in which the horizontal axis represents the real part of the number and the vertical axis the imaginary part (see illustration). In the polar form the modulus is the line joining the origin to the point representing the complex number and the argument is the angle between the modulus and the <i>x</i>-axis"

<b>Compton effect</b><br>The reduction in the energy of high-energy (X-ray or gamma-ray) photons when they are scattered by free electrons, which thereby gain energy. The phenomenon, first observed in 1923 by the US physicist A. H.

"conservation law","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>conservation law</b><br>A law stating that the total magnitude of a certain physical property of a system, such as its mass, energy, or charge, remains unchanged even though there may be exchanges of that property between components of the system. For example, imagine a table with a bottle of salt solution (NaCl), a bottle of silver nitrate solution (AgNO<sub class=""ind"">3</sub>), and a beaker standing on it. The mass of this table and its contents will not change even when some of the contents of the bottles are poured into the beaker. As a result of the reaction between the chemicals two new substances (silver chloride and sodium nitrate) will appear in the beaker: <div class=""equ"">NaCl + AgNO<sub class=""ind"">3</sub>→ AgCl + NaNO<sub class=""ind"">3</sub></div>, but the total mass of the table and its contents will not change. This <i>conservation of mass</i> is a law of wide and general applicability, which is true for the universe as a whole, provided that the universe can be considered a closed system (nothing escaping from it, nothing being added to it). According to Einstein's mass-energy relationship, every quantity of energy (<i>E</i>) has a mass (<i>m</i>), which is given by <i>E</i>/<i>c</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>, where <i>c</i> is the speed of light. Therefore if mass is conserved, the law of <i>conservation of energy</i> must be of equally wide application. The laws of <i>conservation of linear momentum</i> and <i>angular momentum</i> also are believed to be universally true.
<br>Because no way is known of either creating or destroying electric charge, the law of <i>conservation of charge</i> is also a law of universal application. Other quantities are also conserved in reactions between elementary particles"

"convection","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>convection</b><br>A process by which heat is transferred from one part of a fluid to another by movement of the fluid itself. In <i>natural convection</i> the movement occurs as a result of gravity; the hot part of the fluid expands, becomes less dense, and is displaced by the colder denser part of the fluid as this drops below it. This is the process that occurs in most domestic hot-water systems between the boiler and the hot-water cylinder. A natural convection current is set up transferring the hot water from the boiler up to the cylinder (always placed above the boiler) so that the cold water from the cylinder can move down into the boiler to be heated. In some modern systems, where small-bore pipes are used or it is inconvenient to place the cylinder above the boiler, the circulation between boiler and hot-water cylinder relies upon a pump. This is an example of <i>forced convection</i> , where hot fluid is transferred from one region to another by a pump or fan"

It used some elements of <a href=""entry://Ptolemaic astronomy"">Ptolemaic astronomy</a>, but rejected the notion, then current, that the earth was a stationary body at the centre of the universe. Instead, Copernicus proposed the apparently unlikely concept that the sun was at the centre of the universe and that the earth was hurtling through space in a circular orbit about it. Galileo's attempts, some 70 years later, to convince the Catholic church that in spite of scriptural authority to the contrary, the Copernican system was correct, resulted in <i>De revolutionibus</i> being placed on the Index of forbidden books, where it remained until 1835"

"Coriolis force","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Coriolis force</b><br>A fictitious force sometimes used to simplify calculations involving rotating systems, such as the movement of air, water, and projectiles over the surface of the rotating earth. The concept was first used in 1835 by Gaspard de Coriolis (1792&ndash;1843), a French physicist. The daily rotation of the earth means that in 24 hours a point on its equator moves a distance of some 40 000 kilometres, giving it a tangential velocity of about 1670 kilometres per hour. A point at the latitude of, say, Rome, travels a shorter distance in the same time and therefore has a lower tangential velocity &ndash; about 1340 km/hr. Air over the equator has the full tangential velocity of 1670 km/hr and as it travels north, say, it will retain this velocity; to an observer outside the earth this would be clear. However, to an observer in Rome it appears to be moving eastwards, because the earth at that point is moving eastwards more slowly than the air. The Coriolis force (which is quite fictitious) is the force that a naive observer thinks is needed to push the air eastwards"

<b>crystal defect</b><br>An imperfection in the regular lattice pattern of a crystal.
<br><b><span class=""uCase"">CRYSTALS DEFECTS</b></span>
<br>A <a href=""entry://crystal lattice"">crystal lattice</a> is formed by a repeated arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules. Within one cubic centimetre of material one can expect to find up to 10<sup class=""expo"">22</sup> atoms and it is extremely unlikely that all of these will be arranged in perfect order. Some atoms will not be exactly in the right place, with the result that the lattice will contain defects. The presence of defects within the crystal structure has profound consequences for certain bulk properties of the solid, such as the electrical resistance and the mechanical strength. It can also affect the chemical behaviour. Point defects
<br>Local crystal defects, called <i>point defects</i> , appear as either impurity atoms or gaps in the lattice. Impurity atoms can occur in the lattice either at <i>interstitial sites</i> (between atoms in a non-lattice site) or at <i>substitutional sites</i> (replacing an atom in the host lattice). Lattice gaps are called <i>vacancies</i> and arise when an atom is missing from its site in the lattice. Vacancies are sometimes called <i>Schottky defects</i> . A vacancy in which the missing atom has moved to an interstitial position is known as a <i>Frenkel defect</i> . Colour centres
<br>In ionic crystals, the ions and vacancies always arrange themselves so that there is no build-up of one type of charge in any small volume of the crystal. If ions or charges are introduced into or removed from the lattice, there will, in general, be an accompanying rearrangement of the ions and their outer valence electrons. This rearrangement is called <i>charge compensation</i> and is most dramatically observed in <i>colour centres</i> . If certain crystals are irradiated with X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, or electrons a colour change is observed. For example, diamond may be coloured blue by electron bombardment and quartz may be coloured brown by irradiation with neutrons. The high-energy radiation produces defects in the lattice and, in an attempt to maintain charge neutrality, the crystal undergoes some measure of charge compensation, causing either extra electrons or positive charges to reside at the defects. Just as electrons around an atom have a series of discrete permitted energy levels, so charges residing at point defects exhibit sets of discrete levels, which are separated from one another by energies corresponding to photons in the visible region of the spectrum. Thus light of certain wavelengths can be absorbed at the defect sites, and the material appears to be coloured. Heating the irradiated crystal can, in many cases, repair the irradiation damage and the crystal loses its coloration. Dislocations
<br>Non-local defects may involve entire planes of atoms. The most important of these is called a <i>dislocation</i> . Dislocations are essentially <i>line-defects</i> ; that is, there is an incomplete plane of atoms in the crystal lattice. In 1934, Taylor, Orowan, and Polanyi independently proposed the concept of the dislocation to account for the mechanical strength of metal crystals. Their microscopic studies revealed that when a metal crystal is plastically deformed, the deformation does not occur by a separation of individual atoms but rather by a slip of one plane of atoms over another plane. Dislocations provide a mechanism for this slipping of planes that does not require the bulk movement of crystal material. The passage of a dislocation in a crystal is similar to the movement of a ruck in a carpet. A relatively large force is required to slide the carpet as a whole. However, moving a ruck over the carpet can inch it forward without needing such large forces. This movement of dislocations is called <i>plastic flow</i> . <center class=""pic""><img src=""000052.jpg"" ></img><br>Point defects in a two-dimensional crystal</center>Strength of materials
<br>In practice most metal samples are <i>polycrystalline</i> ; that is, they consist of many small crystals or grains at different angles to each other. The boundary between two such grains is called a <i>grain boundary</i> . The plastic flow of dislocations may be hindered by the presence of grain boundaries, impurity atoms, and other dislocations. Pure metals produced commercially are generally too weak to be of much mechanical use. A rod of pure copper the thickness of a pencil is easily bent in the hand. The weakness of these samples can be attributed to the ease with which the dislocations are able to move within the sample. Slip, and therefore deformation, can then occur under relatively low stresses. Impurity atoms, other dislocations, and grain boundaries can all act as obstructions to the slip of atomic planes. Traditionally, methods of making metals stronger involved introducing defects that provide regions of disorder in the material. For example, in an alloy, such as steel, impurity atoms (e.g. carbon) are introduced into the lattice during the forging process. The perfection of the iron lattice structure is disturbed and the impurities oppose the dislocation motion. This makes for greater strength and stiffness.
<br>The complete elimination of dislocations may seem an obvious way to strengthen materials. However, this has only proved possible for hairlike single crystal specimens called <i>whiskers</i> . These whiskers are only a few micrometres thick and are seldom more than a few millimetres long; nevertheless their strength approaches the theoretical value.Thermal vibrations
<br>However carefully one may prepare a specimen, using extremely high purity materials and specially controlled methods of crystal growth, defects will occur due to the random thermal vibrations of atoms. Atoms are always vibrating about their fixed lattice sites. At room temperature they are vibrating at a frequency of about 10<sub class=""ind"">13</sub> Hz. Even at very low temperatures the <a href=""entry://zero-point"">zero-point</a> motions of the atoms occurs. As the temperature rises, the amplitude of these atomic vibrations increases; as a result, virtually every property of a material determined by the positions of the atoms within it, or by its thermal energy, changes with temperature.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000057.jpg"" ></img><br>Dislocation in a two-dimensional crystal: the extra plane of atoms AB causes strain at bond CD. On breaking, the bond flips across to form CB. This incremental movement shifts the dislocation across so that the overall effect is to slide the two planes BDG and CF over each other</center>"

The mechanical vibrations in turn create an alternating electric field across the crystal that does not suffer from frequency drift. The device can be used to replace the tuned circuit in an oscillator by providing the resonant frequency or it can be coupled to the oscillator circuit, which is tuned approximately to the crystal frequency.

If it is <i>underdamped</i> it will oscillate repeatedly before coming to rest; if it is <i>overdamped</i> it will not oscillate but it will take longer to come to rest than it would if it was critically damped. An instrument, such as a galvanometer, that is critically damped is often called a <i>deadbeat</i> instrument"

"death of a star","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>death of a star</b><br>The final collapse of a star, which according to current theory results in the formation of a <a href=""entry://black hole"">black hole</a>. The process begins when <a href=""entry://red giant"">red giants</a> with masses less than or equal to about three solar masses do not have internal temperatures that are sufficiently high to ignite any further nuclear fusion reactions after the completion of the helium burning stage. For these relatively small stars, shedding of the outer layers begins and the mass is reduced by some 50%.
<br>The material that was once the outer layers of the star surrounds a small collapsing core. The radiation from this core can be very intense and the resulting glow, caused by the ionization of the surrounding material, is known as a planetary <a href=""entry://nebula"">nebula</a>. The core continues to undergo gravitational collapse until equilibrium is reached with the <i>Fermi pressure</i> . This Fermi pressure is generated by the electrons being confined to smaller and smaller spaces as a result of the gravitational collapse. Electrons, which are responsible for most of the volume in ordinary matter, when confined in this way generate a pressure because as <a href=""entry://fermion"">fermions</a> they are subject to the <a href=""entry://Pauli exclusion principle"">Pauli exclusion principle</a> and therefore have an appreciable mutual repulsion. The equilibrium between gravitational collapse and the Fermi pressure is reached when the core has a diameter of about 1% of the sun. This implies a very high density of about 1000 kg/cm<sup class=""expo"">3</sup>. At this stage the star is classed as a <a href=""entry://white dwarf"">white dwarf</a> and appears on the bottom-left quarter of the <a href=""entry://Hertzsprung-Russell diagram"">Hertzsprung-Russell diagram</a>. White dwarfs gradually become dimmer as they cool and eventually reach a temperature equilibrium with the surrounding vacuum.
<br>If at the white dwarf stage a star has a mass exceeding 1.4 solar masses, it is said to have exceeded the <a href=""entry://Chandrasekhar limit"">Chandrasekhar limit</a>. For stars of this mass, the electron Fermi pressure is not large enough to counter the continued gravitational contraction. Electrons and protons in the resulting dense matter then combine in an interaction similar to the radioactive transformation known as <a href=""entry://electron capture"">electron capture</a>. Neutrons are formed in this electron-proton fusion and further collapse may be halted (if the star's mass is not so large) by a Fermi pressure generated by the tightly packed neutrons (as neutrons are also fermions). The core is then said to consist of <i>neutronium</i> , since it is exclusively made of neutrons.
<br>The final collapse to the neutronium stage is very rapid and accompanied by an extreme rise in temperature. This rapid contraction is stopped as suddenly as it began by the neutron Fermi pressure, which generates an intense radiation pressure causing the star to explode. The resulting explosion is called a <a href=""entry://supernova"">supernova</a>. Supernovae can be so intense that over a short period (typically a few days) they have been known to emit as much radiation as an entire galaxy of stable stars. The extreme pressure and temperatures within a supernova explosion are sufficient for thermonuclear fusion of nuclei to form heavier nuclei of elements higher than iron. The debris from supernova explosions is therefore the source of all the elements with which we are familiar on earth. As a result of density fluctuations in clouds of debris of this type, gravitational collapse can begin once again and form a new generation of stars. At the centre of some supernovae there may be a residual highly dense core. This remnant, composed of neutrons, is called a <a href=""entry://neutron star"">neutron star</a>. Theoretically, neutron stars can rotate at a very high rate and in doing so emit very regular radio-frequency pulses. Before the theoretical work that led to the idea of neutron stars, <a href=""entry://pulsar"">pulsars</a> - pulsating sources of radio waves - had already been observed. The current explanation of pulsar radiation is that it originates from a rotating neutron star.
<br>The Fermi pressure generated by the tightly packed neutrons within a neutron star is the only influence preventing further gravitational contraction. However, if the mass of the neutron star is above about three solar masses, then the neutron Fermi pressure is not sufficient to prevent a further collapse. As the radius of the star reduces, the gravitational field becomes increasingly strong until eventually the radius of the star falls to lower than a limit, called its <i>Schwarzschild radius</i> (τ<sub class=""ind"">s</sub>). At this point the equations of general relativity are only valid for an observer outside the Schwarzschild radius. The boundary that delimits this region of validity is called the <i>event horizon</i> .
<br>The gravitational fields within the event horizon are so large that not even electromagnetic radiation (including light) can escape. The star is then said to have collapsed to a <a href=""entry://black hole"">black hole</a>. Black holes are still only theoretical constructs although many observations suggest that they do exist. For example, the intense radiation emitted from <a href=""entry://quasars"">quasars</a> may be produced as a consequence of matter falling into black holes. Other examples that support the existence of black holes include the detection of very massive but invisible partners in binary systems and the rapidly orbiting gases around galactic centres. Both phenomena could be explained by the presence of centrally directed forces resulting from a black hole. Cygnus X-1 is believed to be an example of a binary system in which one member is a <a href=""entry://main sequence star"">main sequence star</a> and the other a black hole. As charged gases from the main sequence star spiral in towards the black hole, they reach very high speeds and can emit X-rays"

"decay","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>decay</b><br>The spontaneous transformation of one radioactive nuclide into a daughter nuclide, which may be radioactive or may not, with the emission of one or more particles or photons. The decay of <i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">o</sub> nuclides to give <i>N</i> nuclides after time <i>t</i> is given by <div class=""equ""><i>N</i> = <i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub>exp(-γ<i>t</i>)</div>, where γ is called the <i>decay constant</i> or the <i>disintegration constant</i> . The reciprocal of the decay constant is the <i>mean life</i> . The time required for half the original nuclides to decay (i.e. <div class=""equ""><i>N</i> =½<i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub></div>) is called the <i>half-life</i> of the nuclide. The same terms are applied to elementary particles that spontaneously transform into other particles. For example, a free neutron decays into a proton and an electron (see <a href=""entry://beta decay"">beta decay</a>). See also <a href=""entry://alpha particle"">alpha particle</a>; <a href=""entry://Q-value"">Q-value</a>"
"decay sequence","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>decay sequence</b><br>A plot of neutron number (<i>N</i>) against proton number (<i>Z</i>) for nuclides belonging to a particular <a href=""entry://radioactive series"">radioactive series</a>. Each point marked on the plot represents a member of the series. The lines joining these points represent the nuclear transformations that have occurred in transmuting the original nucleus to the new one.
<br>Four types of radioactive decay can be conveniently represented as shifts along a decay sequence:
<blockquote class=""blk"">&nbsp;<i>Alpha decay</i> : The emission of an <a href=""entry://alpha particle"">alpha particle</a> corresponds to the loss of a helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons) by the parent nucleus. An alpha decay is easily represented as a diagonal arrow made up of two steps down the <i>N</i> axis and two steps towards the left on the <i>Z</i> axis.
<br>&nbsp;<i>Beta (negative) decay</i> : A neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton and an electron; the electron is emitted as a beta particle. This transformation is therefore represented on a decay sequence as the loss of a neutron and the gain of a proton; that is, a diagonal arrow made up of one step down the <i>N</i> axis and one step to the right on the <i>Z</i> axis. See also <a href=""entry://beta decay"">beta decay</a>.
<br>&nbsp;<i>Beta (positive) decay</i> : In this decay a proton transforms into a neutron with the emission of an antimatter electron (positron). Unlike the beta (negative) decay, which can also occur outside the nucleus, the beta (positive) decay does not occur spontaneously with free protons. This transformation is represented on a decay sequence as a diagonal arrow made up of one step up the <i>N</i> axis and one step to the left on the <i>Z</i> axis.
<br> &nbsp;<i>Electron capture</i> : A nuclear proton captures an electron from the atomic environment. This transformation is represented in the same way as beta (positive) decay. The diagram shows a portion of the decay sequence for the <i>uranium series</i> .

If <i>P</i> is the level of sound intensity to be measured, <i>P</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub> is a reference level, usually the intensity of a note of the same frequency at the threshold of audibility.
<br>The logarithmic scale is convenient as human audibility has a range of 1 (just audible) to 10<sup class=""expo"">12</sup> (just causing pain) and one decibel, representing an increase of some 26%, is about the smallest change the ear can detect"

For example, ferromagnetic components of TV sets may become magnetized and misdirect the electron beams. A degaussing coil is often provided and fed with a diminishing alternating current each time the set is switched on. Ships can be degaussed by surrounding them with current-carrying cables that set up an equal and opposite field. This prevents the ships from detonating magnetic mines. Degaussing is used to protect scientific and other electronic devices from strong magnetic fields; usually a system of coils is designed to neutralize such fields over the important region or the equipment is surrounded by a shield of suitable alloy (e.g. Mumetal)"
"degeneracy pressure","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>degeneracy pressure</b><br>The pressure in a <a href=""entry://degenerate gas"">degenerate gas</a> of fermions caused by the Pauli exclusion principle and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Because of the exclusion principle, fermions at a high density, with small interparticle spacing, must have different momenta; from the uncertainty principle, the momentum difference must be inversely proportional to the spacing. Consequently, in a high-density gas (small spacing) the particles have high relative momenta, which leads to a degeneracy pressure much greater than the thermal pressure. <a href=""entry://White dwarf"">White dwarfs</a> and <a href=""entry://neutron"">neutron</a> stars are supported against collapse under their own gravitational fields by the degeneracy pressure of electrons and neutrons, respectively"
"degenerate gas","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>

<b>degree</b><br><b>1</b> A unit of plane angle equal to 1/360th of a complete revolution.
<br><b>2</b> A division on a <a href=""entry://temperature scale"">temperature scale</a>.
<br><b>3</b> The power to which a variable is raised. If one expression contains several variables the overall degree of the expression is the sum of the powers. For example, the expression <i>p</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup><i>q</i><sup class=""expo"">3</sup><i>r</i><sup class=""expo"">4</sup> has a degree of 9 overall (it is a second-degree expression in <i>p</i>). The degree of a polynomial is the degree of the variable with the highest power, e.g. <i>ax</i><sup class=""expo"">5</sup> + <i>bx</i><sup class=""expo"">4</sup> + <i>c</i> has a degree of 5.
<br><b>4</b> The highest power to which the derivative of the highest order is raised in a <a href=""entry://differential equation"">differential equation</a>. For example, (d<sup class=""expo"">2</sup><i>y</i>/dx<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>)<sup class=""expo"">3</sup> + d<i>y</i>/d<i>x</i> = <i>c</i> is a differential equation of the third degree (but second order)."
"degrees of freedom","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>degrees of freedom</b><br><b>1</b> The number of independent parameters required to specify the configuration of a system. This concept is applied in the <a href=""entry://kinetic theory"">kinetic theory</a> to specify the number of independent ways in which an atom or molecule can take up energy. There are however various sets of parameters that may be chosen, and the details of the consequent theory vary with the choice. For example, in a monatomic gas each atom may be allotted three degrees of degrees of freedom, corresponding to the three coordinates in space required to specify its position. The mean energy per atom for each degree of freedom is the same, according to the principle of the <a href=""entry://equipartition of energy"">equipartition of energy</a>, and is equal to <i>kT</i>/2 for each degree of freedom (where <i>k</i> is the <a href=""entry://Boltzmann constant"">Boltzmann constant</a> and <i>T</i> is the thermodynamic temperature). Thus for a monatomic gas the total molar energy is 3<i>LkT</i>/2, where <i>L</i> is the Avogadro constant (the number of atoms per mole). As <i>k</i> = <i>R</i>/<i>L</i>, where <i>R</i> is the molar gas constant, the total molar energy is 3<i>RT</i>/2.
<br>In a diatomic gas the two atoms require six coordinates between them, giving six degrees of freedom. Commonly these are interpreted as six independent ways of storing energy: on this basis the molecule has three degrees of freedom for different directions of translational motion (see <a href=""entry://translation"">translation</a>), and in addition there are two degrees of freedom for rotation of the molecular axis and one vibrational degree of freedom along the bond between the atoms. The rotational degrees of freedom each contribute <i>kT</i>/2, to the total energy; similarly the vibrational degree of freedom has an equal share of kinetic energy and must on average have as much potential energy (see <a href=""entry://simple harmonic motion"">simple harmonic motion</a>). The total energy per molecule for a diatomic gas is therefore 3<i>kT</i>/2 (for translational energy of the whole molecule) plus 2<i>kT</i>/2 (for rotational energy of each atom) plus 2<i>kT</i>/2 (for vibrational energy), i.e. a total of 7<i>kT</i>/2.

<br>Symbol D. The isotope of hydrogen that has a mass number 2 (r.a.m. 2.0144). Its nucleus contains one proton and one neutron. The abundance of deuterium in natural hydrogen is about 0.015%. It is present in water as the oxide HDO (see also <a href=""entry://heavy water"">heavy water</a>), from which it is usually obtained by electrolysis or fractional distillation. Its chemical behaviour is almost identical to hydrogen although deuterium compounds tend to react rather more slowly than the corresponding hydrogen compounds. Its physical properties are slightly different from those of hydrogen, e.g. b.p. 23.6 K (hydrogen 20.4 K)"

"dimensions","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>dimensions</b><br>The product or quotient of the basic physical quantities, raised to the appropriate powers, in a derived physical quantity. The basic physical quantities of a mechanical system are usually taken to be mass (<i>M</i>), length (<i>L</i>), and time (<i>T</i>). Using these dimensions, the derived physical quantity velocity will have the dimensions L/T and acceleration will have the dimensions <i>L</i>/<i>T</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>. As force is the product of a mass and an acceleration (see <a href=""entry://Newton's law of motion"">Newton's law of motion</a>), force has the dimensions MLT-<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>. In electrical work in <a href=""entry://SI units"">SI units</a>, current, I, can be regarded as dimensionally independent and the dimensions of other electrical units can be found from standard relationships.

"diode","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>diode</b><br>An electronic device with two electrodes. In the obsolescent <i>thermionic diode</i> a heated cathode emits electrons, which flow across the intervening vacuum to the anode when a positive potential is applied to it. The device permits flow of current in one direction only as a negative potential applied to the anode repels the electrons. This property of diodes was made use of in the first thermionic radios, in which the diode was used to demodulate the transmitted signal (see <a href=""entry://modulation"">modulation</a>). In the <i>semiconductor diode</i> , a <i>p-n</i> junction performs a similar function.

"Doppler effect","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Doppler effect</b><br>The apparent change in the observed frequency of a wave as a result of relative motion between the source and the observer. For example, the sound made by a low-flying aircraft as it approaches appears to fall in pitch as it passes and flies away. In fact, the frequency of the aircraft engine remains constant but as it is approaching more sound waves per second impinge on the ear and as it recedes fewer sound waves per second impinge on the ear. The apparent frequency, <i>F</i>, is given by <div class=""equ""><i>F</i> = <i>f</i>(<i>c</i> &ndash; <i>u</i><sub class=""ind"">o</sub>)/(<i>c</i> &ndash; <i>u</i><sub class=""ind"">s</sub>)</div>, where <i>f</i> is the true frequency, <i>c</i> is the speed of sound, and <i>u</i><sub class=""ind"">o</sub> and <i>u</i><sub class=""ind"">s</sub> are the speeds of the observer and the source, respectively.
<br>Although the example of sound is most commonly experienced, the effect was suggested by Christian Johann Doppler (1803&ndash;53), an Austrian physicist, as an attempt to explain the coloration of stars. In fact the Doppler effect cannot be observed visually in relation to the stars, although the effect does occur with electromagnetic radiation and the <a href=""entry://redshift"">redshift</a> of light from receding stars can be observed spectroscopically. The Doppler effect is also used in radar to distinguish between stationary and moving targets and to provide information regarding the speed of moving targets by measuring the frequency shift between the emitted and reflected radiation.
<br>For electromagnetic radiation, the speed of light, <i>c</i>, features in the calculation and as there is no fixed medium to provide a frame of reference, relativity has to be taken into account, so that <div class=""equ""><i>F</i> = <i>f</i>v[(1 &ndash; <i>v</i>/<i>c</i>)/(1 + <i>v</i>/<i>c</i>)]</div>, where <i>v</i> is the speed at which source and observer are moving apart. If <i>v</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/<i>c</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup> is small compared to 1, i.e. if the speed of separation is small compared to the speed of light, this equation simplifies to <div class=""equ""><i>F</i> = <i>f</i>(1 &ndash; <i>v</i>/<i>c</i>)</div>"

"earth","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>earth</b><br>The planet that orbits the sun between the planets Venus and Mars at a mean distance from the sun of 149 600 000 km. It has a mass of about 5.976 × 10<sup class=""expo"">24</sup> kg and an equatorial diameter of 12 756 km. The earth consists of three layers: the gaseous atmosphere (see <a href=""entry://earth's atmosphere"">earth's atmosphere</a>), the liquid hydrosphere, and the solid lithosphere. The solid part of the earth also consists of three layers: the <i>crust</i> with a mean thickness of about 32 km under the land and 10 km under the seas; the <i>mantle</i> , which extends some 2900 km below the crust; and the <i>core</i> , part of which is believed to be liquid. The crust has a relative density of about 3 and consists largely of sedimentary rocks overlaying igneous rocks. The composition of the crust is: oxygen 47%, silicon 28%, aluminium 8%, iron 4.5%, calcium 3.5%, sodium and potassium 2.5% each, and magnesium 2.2%. Hydrogen, carbon, phosphorus, and sulphur are all present to an extent of less than 1%. The mantle reaches a relative density of about 5.5 at its maximum depth and is believed to consist mainly of silicate rocks. The core is believed to have a maximum relative density of 13 and a maximum temperature of 6400 K. See also <a href=""entry://geomagnetism"">geomagnetism</a>"
"earth's atmosphere","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>earth's atmosphere</b><br>The gas that surrounds the earth. The composition of dry air at sea level is: nitrogen 78.08%, oxygen 20.95%, argon 0.93%, carbon dioxide 0.03%, neon 0.0018%, helium 0.0005%, krypton 0.0001%, and xenon 0.00001%. In addition to water vapour, air in some localities contains sulphur compounds, hydrogen peroxide, hydrocarbons, and dust particles.
<br>The lowest level of the atmosphere, in which most of the weather occurs, is called the <i>troposphere</i> . Its thickness varies from about 7 km at the poles to 28 km at the equator and in this layer temperature falls with increasing height. The next layer is the <i>stratosphere</i> , which goes up to about 50 km. Here the temperature remains approximately constant. Above this is the <i>ionosphere</i> , which extends to about 1000 km, with the temperature rising and the composition changing substantially. At about 100 km and above most of the oxygen has dissociated into atoms; at above 150 km the percentage of nitrogen has dropped to nil. In the ionosphere the gases are ionized by the absorption of solar radiation. This enables radio transmissions to be made round the curved surface of the earth as the ionized gas acts as a reflector for certain wavelengths. The ionosphere is divided into three layers. The D-layer (50&ndash;90 km) contains a low concentration of free electrons and reflects low-frequency radio waves. The E-layer (90&ndash;150 km) is also called the <i>Heaviside layer</i> or <i>Heaviside-Kennelly layer</i> as its existence was predicted independently by Oliver Heaviside (1850&ndash;1925) and Arthur E. Kennelly (1861&ndash;1939). This layer reflects medium-frequency waves. The F-layer (150&ndash;1000 km) is also called the <i>Appleton layer</i> after its discoverer Sir Edward Appleton (1892&ndash;1965). It has the highest concentration of free electrons and is the most useful for radio transmission. Wavelengths between 8 mm and 20 m are not reflected by the ionosphere but escape into space. Therefore television transmissions, which utilize this range, require artificial <a href=""entry://satellite"">satellites</a> for reflection (or reception, amplification, and retransmission). From about 400 km, the outermost region of the atmosphere is also called the <i>exosphere</i> . See illustration.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000092.jpg"" ></img><br>Earth's atmosphere</center>"

See <a href=""entry://seismic waves"">seismic waves</a>. Earthquakes result from a build-up of stresses within the rocks until they are strained to the point beyond which they will fracture. They occur in narrow continuous belts of activity, which correspond with the junction of lithospheric plates, including the circum-Pacific belt, the Alpine-Himalayan belt, and mid-ocean ridges.

"eddy current","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>eddy current</b><br>A current induced in a conductor situated in a changing magnetic field or moving in a fixed one. Any imagined circuit within the conductor will change its magnetic flux linkage, and the consequent induced e.m.f. will drive current around the circuit. In a substantial block of metal the resistance will be small and the current therefore large. Eddy currents occur in the cores of transformers and other electrical machines and represent a loss of useful energy (the <i>eddy-current loss</i> ). To reduce this loss to a minimum metal cores are made of insulated sheets of metal, the resistance between these laminations reducing the current. In high-frequency circuits <a href=""entry://ferrite"">ferrite</a> cores can be used. Eddy currents in a moving conductor interact with the magnetic field producing them to retard the motion of the conductor. This enables some electrical instruments (moving-coil type) to utilize eddy currents to create damping. Eddy currents are also used in <a href=""entry://induction heating"">induction heating</a>"

"elasticity","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>

<b>electric lighting</b><br>Illumination provided by electric currents. The devices used are the <i>arc lamp</i> , the <i>light bulb</i> (incandescent filament lamp), and the <i>fluorescent tube</i> . In the arc lamp, which is no longer used as a general means of illumination, an electric current flows through a gap between two carbon electrodes, between which a high potential difference is maintained. The current is carried by electrons and ions in the vapour produced by the electrodes and a mechanism is required to bring the electrodes closer together as they are vaporized. The device produces a strong white light but has many practical disadvantages. However, arcs enclosed in an inert gas (usually xenon) are increasingly used for such purposes as cinema projectors. The common light bulb is a glass bulb containing a tungsten filament and usually an inert gas. The passage of an electric current through the filament heats it to a white heat. Inert gas is used in the bulb to minimize blackening of the glass by evaporation of tungsten. In the fluorescent tube a glass tube containing mercury vapour (or some other gas) at a low pressure has its inner surface coated with a fluorescent substance. A discharge is created within the tube between two electrodes. Electrons emitted by the cathode collide with gas atoms or molecules and raise them to an excited state (see <a href=""entry://excitation"">excitation</a>). When they fall back to the <a href=""entry://ground state"">ground state</a> they emit photons of ultraviolet radiation, which is converted to visible light by the coating of phosphor on the inner walls of the tube. In some lamps, such as the <a href=""entry://sodium-vapour lamp"">sodium-vapour lamp</a> and <a href=""entry://mercury-vapour lamp"">mercury-vapour lamp</a> used in street lighting, no fluorescent substance is used, the light being emitted directly by the excited atoms of sodium or mercury. Vapour lights are more efficient than filament lights as less of the energy is converted into heat"
"electric motor","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>electric motor</b><br>A machine for converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. They are quiet, clean, and have a high efficiency (75&ndash;95%). They work on the principle that a current passing through a coil within a magnetic field will experience forces that can be used to rotate the coil. In the <i>induction motor</i> , alternating current is fed to a stationary coil (the <i>stator</i> ), which both creates the magnetic field and induces a current in the rotating coil (<i>rotor</i> ), which it surrounds. The advantage of this kind of motor is that current does not have to be fed through a commutator to a moving part. In the <i>synchronous motor</i> , alternating current fed to the stator produces a magnetic field that rotates and locks with the field of the rotor, in this case an independent magnet, causing the rotor to rotate at the same speed as the stator field rotates. The rotor is either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet fed by a direct current through slip rings. In the <i>universal motor</i> , current is fed to the stator and, through a commutator, to the rotor. In the series-wound motor the two are in series; in the shunt-wound motor they are in parallel. These motors can be used with either a.c. or d.c. but some small motors use a permanent magnet as the stator and require d.c. for the rotor (via the commutator).

"electrical conductivity in metals","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>electrical conductivity in metals</b><br>Elementary conductivity theory is an extension of <a href=""entry://free electron theory"">free electron theory</a>, in which the electrons in a metal are treated as a gas of negatively charged free particles. In a metallic crystal, the average kinetic energy of electrons is very large compared to the energy associated with thermal vibrations in the lattice. Therefore the thermal vibrations have little or no effect on the <a href=""entry://Fermi level"">Fermi level</a>, which represents the maximum energy that these electrons can have. The possible energy states that the electrons can occupy are derived from a <i>particle-in-a-box</i> analysis of the metal crystal. In this the electron is described as a matter wave confined within the crystal lattice of the metal, which is identified as the box.
<br>In the absence of an electric field, the electrons are distributed amongst the possible energy states, up to a maximum energy <i>E</i><sub class=""ind"">max</sub> (or <i>e<sub class=""ind"">F</sub></i>, the Fermi level). Each of these energy states corresponds to a free electron state of motion at a particular speed and direction. There will therefore be as many electrons moving in one direction as in any other. The average velocity of the electrons in the metal will be zero and hence no current will flow.
<br>In an electric field, each electron will experience a force that will accelerate it in the direction of the field. A convenient way of illustrating the electric field is to use <i>momentum space</i> diagrams. Each electron state calculated in the particle-in-the-box problem corresponds to a certain amount of momentum possessed by an electron. Imagine a three-dimensional space equipped with a Cartesian coordinate system corresponding to momentum values rather than spatial positions. Each point in this space represents a state of momentum. See diagram (1).
<br>The energy associated with free electrons is restricted to their kinetic energy; therefore the Fermi surface may be represented by the surface of a sphere in the momentum coordinate system, the maximum magnitude of momentum (corresponding to the maximum kinetic energy) being the radius of this sphere.
<br>The momentum space diagram for zero field is therefore a sphere centred at the origin, with a radius <i>P<sub class=""ind"">F</sub></i>, which is the magnitude of the maximum momentum at the Fermi surface. See diagram (2). In an electric field applied in the <i>x</i>-direction, the Fermi surface would be shifted in the direction of the field. However, one might expect that maintaining the field would progressively shift the Fermi surface further along the <i>x</i>-direction, as electrons would be accelerated. This does not happen; after a short time a constant current is established whose value depends on the field. The Fermi surface is shifted on application of the field, but only by an amount proportional to the size of the field. See diagram (3).
<br>This stabilization of the current occurs because electrons in states near the Fermi surface are scattered by two main mechanisms:
<blockquote class=""blk""> (1)&nbsp;the thermal vibration of the lattice; and
<br> (2)&nbsp;the presence of impurity atoms and other point <a href=""entry://defect"">defects</a>. The scattered electrons have their momentum changed by the scattering event and take up states on the other side of the Fermi sphere.
<br></blockquote>
<br>A dynamic equilibrium is therefore established between the electrons being accelerated to the right-hand side of the sphere and those scattered back to the left. On average, the electrons travel the <i>mean free path</i> (λ) between each scattering event. The velocity <i>V</i><sub class=""ind"">F</sub> at the Fermi surface is very high, ~ 10<sup class=""expo"">6</sup> m/s, compared with any change in velocity produced by the applied field. Therefore, the time between collisions may be considered constant at λ/V<sub class=""ind"">F</sub>. This means that the shift in the Fermi surface will be greater for a stronger field; i.e. a greater change in velocity can be achieved for a larger field in the same time λ/v<sub class=""ind"">F</sub>. The current will therefore be higher, which is of the basis of <a href=""entry://Ohm's law"">Ohm's law</a>.
<br>An expression for the <i>resistivity</i> of the conductor can be obtained from kinetic theory, which neglects scattering by imperfections and lattice vibrations. Such an expression relates the macroscopic to the microscopic and leads to an estimate of the mean free path. For copper at room temperature this expression gives a value for λ ~ 3.0 × 10<sup class=""expo"">-8</sup> m. This suggests that electrons in copper can travel up to 100 atomic spacings between collisions. This value of λ is quite surprising as one might expect that a perfect lattice would itself scatter the electrons. However if the lattice is regular, an electron is attracted to the ions as much in one direction as any other. The result is that the electrons are undeviated, except under special conditions. It is only if the lattice is not perfect that the electrons will be scattered.
<br>As lattice vibrations fall with thermodynamic temperature (<i>T</i>), one would expect that their contribution to resistivity (ρ<sub class=""ind"">i</sub>) would decrease at low temperatures, eventually becoming zero at OK. A more detailed calculation shows that at low temperatures ρ<sub class=""ind"">i</sub> ? <i>T<sup class=""expo"">5</sup></i> and changes to a linear dependence on <i>T</i> at higher temperatures.

<br>The electron was discovered in 1897 by Joseph John <a href=""entry://Thomson"">Thomson</a>. The problem of the structure (if any) of the electron is unsolved.

"electron diffraction","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>electron diffraction</b><br><a href=""entry://Diffraction"">Diffraction</a> of a beam of electrons by atoms or molecules. The fact that electrons can be diffracted in a similar way to light and X-rays shows that particles can act as waves (see <a href=""entry://de Broglie wavelength"">de Broglie wavelength</a>). An electron (mass <i>m</i>, charge <i>e</i>) accelerated through a potential difference <i>V</i> acquires a kinetic energy <i>mv</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/2 =<i> eV</i>, where <i>v</i> is the velocity of the electron. The (nonrelativistic) momentum (<i>p</i>) of the electron is v(2<i>eVm</i>). The de Broglie wavelength (λ) of an electron is given by <i>h</i>/<i>p</i>, where <i>h</i> is the Planck constant, thus λ = h/v(2<i>eVm</i>). For an accelerating voltage of 3600 V, the wavelength of the electron beam is 0.02 nanometre, some 3 × 10<sup class=""expo"">4</sup> times shorter than visible radiation.
<br>Electrons then, like X-rays, show diffraction effects with molecules and crystals in which the interatomic spacing is comparable to the wavelength of the beam. They have the advantage that their wavelength can be set by adjusting the voltage. Unlike X-rays they have very low penetrating power. The first observation of electron diffraction was by George Thomson (1892&ndash;1975) in 1927, in an experiment in which he passed a beam of electrons in a vacuum through a very thin gold foil onto a photographic plate. Concentric circles were produced by diffraction of electrons by the lattice. The same year Clinton J. Davisson (1881&ndash;1958) and Lester Germer (1896&ndash;1971) performed a classic experiment in which they obtained diffraction patterns by glancing an electron beam off the surface of a nickel crystal. Both experiments were important verifications of de Broglie's theory and the new quantum theory.
<br>Electron diffraction, because of the low penetration, cannot easily be used to investigate crystal structure. It is, however, employed to measure bond lengths and angles of molecules in gases. Moreover, it is extensively used in the study of solid surfaces and absorption. The main techniques are low-energy electron diffraction (<i>LEED</i>) in which the electron beam is reflected onto a fluorescent screen, and high-energy electron diffraction (<i>HEED</i>) used either with reflection or transmission in investigating thin films"

<b>electron gun</b><br>A device used in <a href=""entry://cathode-ray tube"">cathode-ray tubes</a> (including television tubes), electron microscopes, etc., to produce a steady narrow beam of electrons. It usually consists of a heated cathode, control grid, and two or more annular anodes inserted in an evacuated tube.

The intensity of the beam is regulated by the control grid and potential differences between the anodes create electric fields that focus the diverging electrons into a narrow beam"
"electron lens","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>electron lens</b>

"electron microscope","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>electron microscope</b><br>A form of microscope that uses a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light (as in the optical microscope) to form a large image of a very small object. In optical microscopes the resolution is limited by the wavelength of the light. High-energy electrons, however, can be associated with a considerably shorter wavelength than light; for example, electrons accelerated to an energy of 10<sup class=""expo"">5</sup> electronvolts have a wavelength of 0.004 nanometre (see <a href=""entry://de Broglie wavelength"">de Broglie wavelength</a>) enabling a resolution of 0.2&ndash;0.5 nm to be achieved. The <i>transmission electron microscope</i> (see illustration) has an electron beam, sharply focused by <a href=""entry://electron lens"">electron lenses</a>, passing through a very thin metallized specimen (less than 50 nanometres thick) onto a fluorescent screen, where a visual image is formed. This image can be photographed. The <i>scanning electron microscope</i> can be used with thicker specimens and forms a perspective image, although the resolution and magnification are lower. In this type of instrument a beam of primary electrons scans the specimen and those that are reflected, together with any secondary electrons emitted, are collected. This current is used to modulate a separate electron beam in a TV monitor, which scans the screen at the same frequency, consequently building up a picture of the specimen. The resolution is limited to about 10&ndash;20 nm. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000181.jpg"" ></img><br>Principle of transmission electron microscope</center>"

<b>electron-spin resonance</b>(ESR)

<b>electrophoresis</b><i>(cataphoresis)</i>
<br>A technique for the analysis and separation of colloids, based on the movement of charged colloidal particles in an electric field. There are various experimental methods. In one the sample is placed in a U-tube and a buffer solution added to each arm, so that there are sharp boundaries between buffer and sample. An electrode is placed in each arm, a voltage applied, and the motion of the boundaries under the influence of the field is observed. The rate of migration of the particles depends on the field, the charge on the particles, and on other factors, such as the size and shape of the particles. More simply, electrophoresis can be carried out using an adsorbent, such as a strip of filter paper, soaked in a buffer with two electrodes making contact. The sample is placed between the electrodes and a voltage applied. Different components of the mixture migrate at different rates, so the sample separates into zones. The components can be identified by the rate at which they move. This technique has also been known as <i>electrochromatography</i> .

A successful electroweak theory was proposed in 1967 by Steven Weinberg (1933&ndash; ) and Abdul Salam (1926&ndash;1996), known as the <i>Weinberg&ndash;Salam model</i> or <i>WS model</i> . Because similar ideas were put forward by Sheldon Glashow (1926&ndash; ), it is sometimes known as the <i>Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model</i> or <i>GWS model</i> .

"elementary particles","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>elementary particles</b><br>The fundamental constituents of all the matter in the universe. By the beginning of the 20th century, the electron and the proton had been discovered, but it was not until 1932 that the existence of the neutron was definitely established. Since 1932, it had been known that atomic nuclei consist of both protons and neutrons (except hydrogen, whose nucleus consists of a lone proton). Between 1900 and 1930, <a href=""entry://quantum mechanics"">quantum mechanics</a> was also making progress in the understanding of physics on the atomic scale. Non-relativistic quantum theory was completed in an astonishingly brief period (1923&ndash;26), but it was the relativistic version that made the greatest impact on our understanding of elementary particles. Dirac's discovery in 1927 of the equation that bears his name led to the discovery of the positive electron or <a href=""entry://positron"">positron</a>. The mass of the positron is equal to that of the negative electron while its charge is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Pairs of particles related to each other in this way are said to be antiparticles of each other. Positrons have only a transitory existence; that is, they do not form part of ordinary matter. Positrons and electrons are produced simultaneously in high-energy collisions of charged particles or gamma rays with matter in a process called <a href=""entry://pair production"">pair production</a>.
<br>The union of <a href=""entry://relativity"">relativity</a> and quantum mechanics therefore led to speculation as early as 1932 that there might also be antiprotons and antineutrons, bearing a similar relationship to their respective ordinary particles as the positron does to the electron. However, it was not until 1955 that particle beams were made sufficiently energetic to enable these antimatter particles to be observed. It is now understood that all known particles have antimatter equivalents, which are predicted by relativistic quantum equations.
<br>By the mid-1930s the list of known and theoretically postulated particles was still small but steadily growing. At this time the Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa (1907&ndash;81) was studying the possible <a href=""entry://fundamental interactions"">fundamental interactions</a> that could hold the nucleus together. Since the nucleus is a closely packed collection of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, clearly it could not be held together by an electromagnetic force; there had to be a different and very large force capable of holding proton charges together at such close proximity. This force would necessarily be restricted to the short range of nuclear dimensions, because evidence of its existence only arose after the discovery of the constituents of the atomic nucleus. Guided by the properties required of this new force, Yukawa proposed the existence of a particle called the <a href=""entry://meson"">meson</a>, which was responsible for transmitting nuclear forces. He suggested that protons and neutrons in the nucleus could interact by emitting and absorbing mesons. For this reason this new type of force was called an <a href=""entry://exchange force"">exchange force</a>. Yukawa was even able to predict the mass of his meson (meaning ‘middle weight’), which turned out to be intermediate between the proton and the electron.
<br>Only a year after Yukawa had made this suggestion, a particle of intermediate mass was discovered in <a href=""entry://cosmic radiation"">cosmic radiation</a>. This particle was named the µ-<i>meson</i> or <i>muon</i> . The µ<sup class=""expo"">-</sup> has a charge equal to the electron, and its antiparticle µ<sup class=""expo"">+</sup> has a positive charge of equal magnitude. However, physicists soon discovered that muons do not interact with nuclear particles sufficiently strongly to be Yukawa's meson. It was not until 1947 that a family of mesons with the appropriate properties was discovered. These were the π</img>-<i>mesons</i> or <i>pions</i> , which occur in three types: positive, negative, and neutral. Pions, which interact strongly with nuclei, have in fact turned out to be the particles predicted by Yukawa in the 1930s. The nuclear force between protons and neutrons was given the name ‘strong interaction’ (see <a href=""entry://fundamental interactions"">fundamental interactions</a>) and until the 1960s it was thought to be an exchange force as proposed by Yukawa.
<br>A theory of the weak interaction was also in its infancy in the 1930s. The weak interaction is responsible for <a href=""entry://beta decay"">beta decay</a>, in which a radioactive nucleus is transformed into a slightly lighter nucleus with the emission of an electron. However, beta decays posed a problem because they appeared not to conserve energy and momentum. In 1931 <a href=""entry://Pauli"">Pauli</a> proposed the existence of a neutral particle that might be able to carry off the missing energy and momentum in a beta decay and escape undetected. Three years later, <a href=""entry://Fermi"">Fermi</a> included Pauli's particle in a comprehensive theory of beta decay, which seemed to explain many experimentally observed results. Fermi called this new particle the <a href=""entry://neutrino"">neutrino</a>, the existence of which was finally established in 1959.
<br>A plethora of experiments involving the neutrino revealed some remarkable properties for this new particle. The neutrino was found to have an intimate connection with the electron and muon, and indeed never appeared without the simultaneous appearance of one or other of these particles. A conservation law was postulated to explain this observation. Numbers were assigned to the electron, muon, and neutrino, so that during interactions these numbers were conserved; i.e. their algebraic sums before and after these interactions were equal. Since these particles were among the lightest known at the time, these assigned numbers became known as <i>lepton numbers</i> (lepton: ‘light ones’). In order to make the assignments of lepton number agree with experiment, it is necessary to postulate the existence of two types of neutrino. Each of these types is associated with either the electron or muon; there are thus muon neutrinos and electron neutrinos. In 1978 the <i>tau particle</i> or <i>tauon</i> was discovered and was added to the list of particles with assigned lepton numbers. The conservation of lepton number in the various interactions involving the tau requires the existence of an equivalent tau neutrino. The six particles with assigned lepton numbers are now known as <a href=""entry://lepton"">leptons</a>.
<br>Neutrinos have zero charge and were originally thought to have zero rest mass, but recently there has been some indirect experimental evidence to the contrary. In 1985 a Soviet team reported a measurement, for the first time, of a non-zero neutrino mass. The mass measured was extremely small (10 000 times less than the mass of the electron), but subsequent attempts independently to reproduce these results did not succeed. More recently (1998&ndash;99), Japanese and US groups have put forward theories and corroborating experimental evidence to suggest, indirectly, that neutrinos do have mass. In these experiments neutrinos are found to apparently ‘disappear’. Since it is unlikely that momentum and energy are actually vanishing from the universe, a more plausible explanation is that the types of neutrinos detected are changing into types that cannot be detected. Present theoretical considerations imply that the masses of neutrinos involved cannot be equal to one another, and therefore they cannot all be zero. This speculative work has not yet yielded estimates of the neutrino masses, which is indicated by the use of asterisks in the <i>Table of leptons</i> .
<br>In the 1960s, the development of high-energy accelerators and more sophisticated detection systems led to the discovery of many new and exotic particles. They were all unstable and existed for only small fractions of a second; nevertheless they set into motion a search for a theoretical description that could account for them all. The large number of these apparently fundamental particles suggested strongly that they do not, in fact, represent the most fundamental level of the structure of matter. Physicists found themselves in a position similar to Mendeleev when the periodic table was being developed. Mendeleev realized that there had to be a level of structure below the elements themselves, which explained the chemical properties and the interrelations between elements.
<br>Murray Gell-Mann and his collaborators proposed the particle-physics equivalent of the periodic table in 1961. In this structure, leptons were indeed regarded as fundamental particles, but the short-lived particles discovered in the 1960s were not. These particles were found to undergo strong interactions, which did not seem to affect the leptons. Gell-Mann called these strongly interacting particles the <a href=""entry://hadron"">hadrons</a> and proposed that they occurred in two different types: baryons and mesons. These two different types corresponded to the two different ways of constructing hadrons from constituent particles, which Gell-Mann called <i>quarks</i> . These quarks came in three <i>flavours</i> , up (u), down (d), and strange (s). These three quarks were thought to be the fundamental constituents of hadrons, i.e. matter that undergoes strong interactions:baryons are composed of three quarks (u, d, or s) or three antiquarks (ū, <img src=""000099.jpg"" ></img>, or <img src=""000102.jpg"" ></img>);mesons are composed of (u, d, or s) quark-antiquark pairs.
<br>No other combinations seemed to be necessary to describe the full variation of the observed hadrons. This scheme even led to the prediction of other particles that were not known to exist in 1961. For example, in 1961 Gell-Mann not only predicted the ω</img><sup class=""expo"">-</sup> (omega-minus) particle, but more importantly told experimentalists exactly how to produce it. The ω</img><sup class=""expo"">-</sup> particle was finally discovered in 1964.
<br>Gell-Mann called his scheme ‘the eight-fold way’, after the similarly named Buddhist principle. The scheme requires that quarks have properties not previously allowed for fundamental particles. For example, quarks have fractional electric charges, i.e. charges of 1/3 and 2/3 of the electron charge. Quarks also have a strong affinity for each other through a new kind of charge known as <i>colour charge</i> . Thus colour charge is responsible for strong interactions, and the force is known as the colour force. This is a revision of Yukawa's proposal in 1930. Yukawa's strong force was mediated by π</img>-mesons. The strong force is now thought to be mediated by exchange of particles carrying colour charge called <i>gluons</i> . The theory governing these colour charge combinations is modelled on <a href=""entry://quantum electrodynamics"">quantum electrodynamics</a> and is known as <a href=""entry://quantum chromodynamics"">quantum chromodynamics</a>.
<br>In November 1974 the discovery of the ψ (psi) particle initiated what later came to be known as ‘the November revolution’. At the time, any known hadron could be described as some combination of u, d, or s quarks. These hadrons were very short-lived with lifetimes of about 10<sup class=""expo"">-23</sup> s. The ψ particle, however, had a lifetime of 10<sup class=""expo"">-20</sup> s; i.e. a thousand times longer. This suggested a completely different species of particle. It is now universally accepted that the ψ represents a meson-bound state of a new fourth quark, the <i>charm</i> (c) quark and its antiquark. In 1977 the list of quarks once again increased with the discovery of a new even heavier meson, called the Y (<i>upsilon</i> ) meson. This meson was found to have an even longer lifetime than the ψ, and was quickly identified as the carrier of a fifth quark, <i>bottom</i> (b).
<br>Thus, by the end of 1977, five flavours of quark (u, d, s, c, b) were known to exist together with six flavours of lepton (e, µ, τ, υ<sub class=""ind"">e</sub>, τ<sub class=""ind"">µ</sub>, υ<sub class=""ind"">τ</sub>). Assuming that quarks and leptons are the fundamental constituents of matter, many of the strong and weak interactions of hadrons and the weak interactions of leptons can be explained. However, anticipating a symmetry in nature's building blocks, it was expected that a sixth quark would eventually reveal itself. This quark, labelled <i>top</i> (t), would be the 2/3 electronic charge partner to the b quark (see <a href=""entry://elementary particles"">Table of quarks</a>). In 1998 the top quark was found at CERN in Geneva and the symmetry of six quarks with six leptons was finally verified.
<br>In 1978 the <i>standard model</i> was proposed as the definitive theory of the fundamental constituents of matter. In the current view, all matter consists of three kinds of particles: leptons, quarks, and mediators (see <a href=""entry://elementary particles"">Table of mediators</a>). The mediators are the particles by which the four fundamental interactions are mediated. In the standard model, each of these interactions has a particle mediator. For the electromagnetic reaction it is the <a href=""entry://photon"">photon</a>.
<br>For weak interactions the force is mediated by three particles called W<sup class=""expo"">+</sup>, W<sup class=""expo"">-</sup>, and Z<sup class=""expo"">°</sup><a href=""entry://boson"">bosons</a>; for the strong force it is the gluon. Current theories of quantum gravity propose the <a href=""entry://graviton"">graviton</a> as the mediator for the gravitational interaction, but this work is highly speculative and the graviton has never been detected. <center class=""pic"">

<b>ellipse</b><br>A <a href=""entry://conic"">conic</a> formed by the intersection of a plane with a right circular cone, so that the plane is inclined to the axis of the cone at an angle in excess of half the apex angle of the cone. The ellipse has two vertices, which are joined by a line called the <i>major axis</i> . The centre of the ellipse falls on this line, midway between the vertices. The <i>minor axis</i> is the line perpendicular to the major axis that passes through the centre and joins two points on the ellipse. The <i>foci</i> of an ellipse are two points on the major axis so placed that for any point on the ellipse the sum of the distances from that point to each focus is constant. (See illustration.) The area of an ellipse is π</img><i>ab</i>, where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are half the major and minor axes, respectively.

<b>energy</b><br>A measure of a system's ability to do work. Like work itself, it is measured in joules. Energy is conveniently classified into two forms: <i>potential energy</i> is the energy stored in a body or system as a consequence of its position, shape, or state (this includes gravitational energy, electrical energy, nuclear energy, and chemical energy); <i>kinetic energy</i> is energy of motion and is usually defined as the work that will be done by the body possessing the energy when it is brought to rest. For a body of mass <i>m</i> having a speed <i>v</i>, the kinetic energy is <i>mv<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/2</i> (classical) or (<i>m</i> - <i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub>)<i>c</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup> (relativistic).

"energy band","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>energy band</b><br>A range of energies that electrons can have in a solid. In a single atom, electrons exist in discrete <a href=""entry://energy level"">energy levels</a>. In a crystal, in which large numbers of atoms are held closely together in a lattice, electrons are influenced by a number of adjacent nuclei and the sharply defined levels of the atoms become bands of allowed energy (see illustration); this approach to energy levels in solids is often known as the <a href=""entry://band theory"">band theory</a>. Each band represents a large number of allowed quantum states. Between the bands are <i>forbidden bands</i> . The outermost electrons of the atoms (i.e. the ones responsible for chemical bonding) form the <i>valence band</i> of the solid. This is the band, of those occupied, that has the highest energy.
<br>The band structure of solids accounts for their electrical properties. In order to move through the solid, the electrons have to change from one quantum state to another. This can only occur if there are empty quantum states with the same energy. In general, if the valence band is full, electrons cannot change to new quantum states in the same band. For conduction to occur, the electrons have to be in an unfilled band &mdash; the <i>conduction band</i> . Metals are good conductors either because the valence band and the conduction band are only half-filled or because the conduction band overlaps with the valence band; in either case vacant states are available. In insulators the conduction band and valence band are separated by a wide forbidden band and electrons do not have enough energy to ‘jump’ from one to the other.
<br>In intrinsic <a href=""entry://semiconductor"">semiconductors</a> the forbidden gap is narrow and, at normal temperatures, electrons at the top of the valence band can move by thermal agitation into the conduction band (at absolute zero, a semiconductor would act as an insulator). Doped semiconductors have extra bands in the forbidden gap.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000111.jpg"" ></img><br>Energy bands</center>"
"energy level","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>energy level</b>
<br>A definite fixed energy that a system described by <a href=""entry://quantum mechanics"">quantum mechanics</a>, such as a molecule, atom, electron, or nucleus, can have. In an atom, for example, the atom has a fixed energy corresponding to the <a href=""entry://orbital"">orbitals</a> in which its electrons move around the nucleus. The atom can accept a quantum of energy to become an excited atom (see <a href=""entry://excitation"">excitation</a>) if that extra energy will raise an electron to a permitted orbital. Between the <i>ground state</i> , which is the lowest possible energy level for a particular system, and the first excited state there are no permissible energy levels.

"entropy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>entropy</b><br>Symbol <i>S</i>. <i>A</i> measure of the unavailability of a system's energy to do work; in a closed system an increase in entropy is accompanied by a decrease in energy availability. When a system undergoes a reversible change the entropy (<i>S</i>) changes by an amount equal to the energy (<i>Q</i>) transferred to the system by heat divided by the thermodynamic temperature (<i>T</i>) at which this occurs, i.e. Δ<i>S</i> = Δ<i>Q</i>/<i>T</i>. However, all real processes are to a certain extent irreversible changes and in any closed system an irreversible change is always accompanied by an increase in entropy.
<br>In a wider sense entropy can be interpreted as a measure of disorder; the higher the entropy the greater the disorder. As any real change to a closed system tends towards higher entropy, and therefore higher disorder, it follows that the entropy of the universe (if it can be considered a closed system) is increasing and its available energy is decreasing (see <a href=""entry://heat death of the universe"">heat death of the universe</a>).

"escape velocity","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>escape velocity</b><br>The minimum speed needed by a space vehicle, rocket, etc., to escape from the gravitational field of the earth, moon, or other celestial body. The gravitational force between a rocket of mass <i>m</i> and a celestial body of mass <i>M</i> and radius <i>r</i> is <i>MmG</i>/<i>r</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup> (see <a href=""entry://Newton's law of gravitation"">Newton's law of gravitation</a>). Therefore the gravitational potential energy of the rocket with respect to its possible position very far from the celestial body on which it is resting can be shown to be -<i>GmM</i>/<i>r</i>, assuming (by convention) that the potential energy is zero at an infinite distance from the celestial body. If the rocket is to escape from the gravitational field it must have a kinetic energy that exceeds this potential energy, i.e. the kinetic energy <i>mv</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/2 must be greater than <i>MmG</i>/<i>r</i>, or <i>v</i> &gt; v(2<i>MG</i>/<i>r</i>).

"free electron theory","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>free electron theory</b><br>The theory that treats <a href=""entry://electron"">electrons</a> as freely moving within the body of a metal crystal or fluid.
<br><b><span class=""uCase"">FREE-ELECTRON THEORY</b></span> To a first approximation any <a href=""entry://electron"">electron</a> within the body of a metal crystal or fluid may be treated as freely moving.
<br>A single electron within the ionic lattice can be analysed as a particle-in-a-box problem from <a href=""entry://quantum mechanics"">quantum mechanics</a>. The possible <a href=""entry://quantum state"">quantum states</a> (ψ) and corresponding energies (<i>E</i>) are obtained on solving the <a href=""entry://Schrödinger equation"">Schrödinger equation</a> for the <a href=""entry://wave function"">wave function</a> (ψ). The electron is assumed to be a free particle within the box; outside the box, however, the wave describing the properties of the electron is assumed to have zero amplitude. The Schrödinger equation for this problem is: <div class=""equ"">-(<i>h</i>/2π</img>)<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>(1/2m<sub class=""ind"">e</sub>)∇<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>ψ = <i>E</i>ψ (1)</div> where <i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">e</sub> is the mass of the electron and ∇ is the vector operator del. The solution of this particle-in-a-box problem leads to an expression for the quantum states of the form: <div class=""equ"">ψ(<i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>,<i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>,<i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">3</sub>) = <i>A</i>.sin(π</img>…<i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>.<i>x</i>/<i>L</i>).sin (π</img>.<i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>.<i>y</i>/<i>L</i>).sin(π</img>.<i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">3</sub>.<i>z</i>/<i>L</i>) (2)</div> where <i>A</i> is a constant, <i>L</i> is the linear dimension of the crystal, and <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>, <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>, <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">3</sub> are integers acting as labels for the different allowed quantum states of the electron in the crystal. The relationship between the energy of the system and the integers <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>, <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>, <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">3</sub> is obtained by substituting (2) into (1): <div class=""equ"">(<i>h</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/8<i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">3</sub><i>L</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>)(<i>n</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> + <i>n</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup><sub class=""ind"">2</sub> + <i>n</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup><sub class=""ind"">3</sub>)ψ = <i>E</i>ψ (3)</div> therefore, <div class=""equ""><i>E</i> = (<i>h</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/8<i>m</i><sub class=""ind""><i>e</i></sub><i>L</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>)<i>n</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup> (4)</div> where <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub> = (<i>n</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> + <i>n</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup><sub class=""ind"">2</sub> + <i>n</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup><sub class=""ind"">3</sub>).
<br>The wave function ψ(<i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>, <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>, <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">3</sub>) gives the possible ways of fitting the electron wave into the crystal box. However, for each of these ways, the electron also has two orientations of spin. Therefore, when a summation of the total number of states up to a particular <i>n</i> value is calculated, these two degenerate states of spin must be accounted for. The total number of electron states up to a particular <i>n</i> is: <div class=""equ""><i>G</i>(<i>n</i>) = π</img><i>n</i><sup class=""expo"">3</sup>/3 (5)</div> In terms of energy <i>E</i>, <i>G</i> becomes: <div class=""equ""><i>G</i>(<i>E</i>) = 8π</img><i>V</i>(2<i>m</i><sub class=""ind""><i>e</i></sub><i>E</i>)<sup class=""expo"">3/2</sup>/3<i>h</i><sup class=""expo"">3</sup> (6)</div> where <i>V</i> (<i>=L</i><sup class=""expo"">3</sup>) is the volume of the crystal. The density of states A useful quantity <i>g</i>(<i>E</i>) is derived from <i>G</i>(<i>E</i>) by considering how <i>G</i>(<i>E</i>) varies with respect to the variable <i>E</i>. <i>g</i>(<i>E</i>) is called the <i>density of states per unit energy interval</i> and is a measure of the number of states within a given arbitrarily narrow interval of energy that the electron may possess: <div class=""equ""><i>g</i>(<i>E</i>) = 3<i>G</i>(<i>E</i>)/2<i>E</i> (7)</div>
<br>It is obvious from (6) that the greater the volume the more states can be accommodated up to an energy <i>E</i>. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg <a href=""entry://uncertainty principle"">uncertainty principle</a> &ndash; the greater the uncertainty in position, the less the uncertainty will be in the momentum and therefore the kinetic energy.
<br>The density of states <i>g</i>(<i>E</i>) is a useful quantity for analysing the behaviour of electrons in a metal at different temperatures. For example, at absolute zero (O<i>K</i>), the first electron will be in the lowest energy state, and subsequent electrons will occupy the next higher states. Electrons cannot occupy already filled states because as <a href=""entry://fermion"">fermions</a> they obey Fermi&ndash;Dirac statistics (see <a href=""entry://quantum statistics"">quantum statistics</a>). If there are <i>N</i> electrons to be accommodated within the metal, the lowest <i>N</i> energy states will be filled up to an energy <i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>max</i></sub> given by: <div class=""equ""><i>N</i> = 8π</img><i>V</i>(2<i>m</i><sub class=""ind""><i>e</i></sub><i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>max</i></sub>)<sup class=""expo"">3/2</sup>/3<i>h</i><sup class=""expo"">3</sup> (8)</div> and <div class=""equ""><i>g</i>(<i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>max</i></sub> = 3<i>G</i>(<i>E</i><sub class=""ind"">max</sub>)/2<i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>max</i></sub> (9)</div>
<br>For a monovalent metal, such as sodium or copper, the electrons in the atom are arranged in closed shells with one extra electron in the outside shell. It is this single electron in each atom that is considered free. For a mole of the monovalent metal there will be 6 × 10<sup class=""expo"">23</sup> of these free electrons, i.e. <div class=""equ""><i>N</i> = 6 × 10<sup class=""expo"">23</sup></div>. For a molar volume of about 10 cm<sup class=""expo"">3</sup>, (8) gives a value of <i>E<sub class=""ind"">max</sub></i> at about 10<sup class=""expo"">-18</sup> joules. An application of the theory of <a href=""entry://equipartition of energy"">equipartition of energy</a> leads to an estimate of electron speeds of the order of 10<sup class=""expo"">6</sup> m s<sup class=""expo"">-1</sup>. The free electron theory therefore predicts a very rapid random motion for conduction electrons inside a metal. Indeed, in this model free electrons are sometimes given the name ‘free electron gas’, because they behave like the atoms or molecules in an ideal gas.
<br>At OK the occupation of the lowest 6 × 10<sup class=""expo"">23</sup> states in the mole of metal can be represented in a graph of <i>g</i>(<i>E</i>) (see <i>diagram</i> 1). For temperatures above absolute zero, any variation of the electron energy is provided by the thermal energy of the crystal. The kinetic energies of the electrons are very large compared to these thermal excitations so the energy distribution is only changed very slightly to the form shown in diagram (2). <center class=""pic""><img src=""000130.jpg"" ></img><br></center>
<center class=""pic""><img src=""000089.jpg"" ></img><br></center> The Fermi level The line that delimits the occupied states at a given temperature is called the <a href=""entry://Fermi level"">Fermi level</a> for that temperature and is given the symbol <i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>F</i></sub>. At OK, <div class=""equ""><i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>F</i></sub> = <i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>max</i></sub></div>, but it is obvious that this is not the case at all other temperatures. In metals, however, it is sufficient to assume that <i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>F</i></sub> is equal to <i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>max</i></sub> as the temperature dependence is negligible (see diagram 2). In <a href=""entry://semiconductor"">semiconductors</a>, in general, <i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>F</i></sub> ? <i>E</i><sub class=""ind""><i>max</i></sub>"
"free energy","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>free energy</b><br>A measure of a system's ability to do work.

"friction","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>friction</b><br>The force that resists the motion of one surface relative to another with which it is in contact. For a body resting on a horizontal surface there is a normal contact force, <i>R</i>, between the body and surface, acting perpendicularly to the surface. If a horizontal force <i>B</i> is applied to the body with the intention of moving it to the right, there will be an equal horizontal friction force, <i>F</i>, to the left, resisting the motion (see illustration). If <i>B</i> is increased until the body just moves, the value of <i>F</i> will also increase until it reaches the <i>limiting frictional force</i> (<i>F</i><sub class=""ind""><i>L</i></sub>), which is the maximum value of <i>F</i>. <i>F</i><sub class=""ind""><i>L</i></sub> is then equal to µ<sub class=""ind"">s</sub><i>R</i>, where µ<sub class=""ind"">s</sub> is the <i>coefficient of static friction</i> , the value of which depends on the nature of the surfaces. Once the body is moving with constant velocity, the value of <i>F</i> falls to a value <i>F</i><sub class=""ind"">k</sub>, which is equal to µ<sub class=""ind"">k</sub><i>R</i>, where µ<sub class=""ind"">k</sub> is the <i>coefficient of kinetic friction</i> . Both µ<sub class=""ind"">s</sub> and µ<sub class=""ind"">k</sub> are independent of the surface area of the body unless this is very small and µ<sub class=""ind"">k</sub> is almost independent of the relative velocity of the body and surface.
<br>The cause of friction is that surfaces, however smooth they may look to the eye, on the microscopic scale have many humps and crests. Therefore the actual area of contact is very small indeed, and the consequent very high pressure leads to local pressure welding of the surfaces. In motion the welds are broken and remade continually. See also <a href=""entry://rolling friction"">rolling friction</a>. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000138.jpg"" ></img><br>Friction</center>"

<b>fuel cell</b><br>A cell in which the chemical energy of a fuel is converted directly into electrical energy.

A supply of gaseous hydrogen is fed to a compartment containing the porous cathode and a supply of oxygen is fed to a compartment containing the porous anode; the electrodes are separated by a third compartment containing a hot alkaline electrolyte, such as potassium hydroxide. The electrodes are porous to enable the gases to react with the electrolyte, with the nickel in the electrodes acting as a catalyst. At the cathode the hydrogen reacts with the hydroxide ions in the electrolyte to form water, with the release of two electrons per hydrogen molecule: <div class=""equ"">H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub> + 2OH<sup class=""expo"">-</sup>→ 2H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>O + 2e<sup class=""expo"">-</sup></div>At the anode, the oxygen reacts with the water, taking up electrons, to form hydroxide ions: <div class=""equ"">½O<sub class=""ind"">2</sub> + H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>O + 2e<sup class=""expo"">-</sup>→ 2OH<sup class=""expo"">-</sup></div> The electrons flow from the cathode to the anode through an external circuit as an electric current.

"fundamental interactions","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>fundamental interactions</b>
<br>The four different types of interaction that can occur between bodies. These interactions can take place even when the bodies are not in physical contact and together they account for all the observed forces that occur in the universe. While the unification of these four types of interaction into one model, theory, or set of equations has long been the aim of physicists, this has not yet been achieved, although progress has been made in the unification of the electromagnetic and weak interactions. See also <a href=""entry://elementary particles"">elementary particles</a>; <a href=""entry://gauge theory"">gauge theory</a>; <a href=""entry://unified-field theory"">unified-field theory</a>.
<br>The <i>gravitational interaction</i> , some 10<sup class=""expo"">40</sup> times weaker than the electromagnetic interaction, is the weakest of all. The force that it generates acts between all bodies that have mass and the force is always attractive. The interaction can be visualized in terms of a classical <a href=""entry://field"">field</a> of force in which the strength of the force falls off with the square of the distance between the interacting bodies (see <a href=""entry://Newton's law of gravitation"">Newton's law of gravitation</a>). The hypothetical gravitational quantum, the <i>graviton</i> , is also a useful concept in some contexts. On the atomic scale the gravitational force is negligibly weak, but on the cosmological scale, where masses are enormous, it is immensely important in holding the components of the universe together. Because gravitational interactions are long-ranged, there is a well-defined macroscopic theory in general relativity. At present, there is no satisfactory quantum theory of gravitational interaction. It is possible that <a href=""entry://superstring theory"">superstring theory</a> may give a consistent quantum theory of gravity as well as unifying gravity with the other fundamental interactions.
<br>The <i>weak interaction</i> , some 10<sup class=""expo"">10</sup> times weaker than the electromagnetic interaction, occurs between <a href=""entry://lepton"">leptons</a> and in the decay of hadrons. It is responsible for the <a href=""entry://beta decay"">beta decay</a> of particles and nuclei. In the current model, the weak interaction is visualized as a force mediated by the exchange of virtual particles, called intermediate vector bosons. The weak interactions are described by <a href=""entry://electroweak theory"">electroweak theory</a>, which unifies them with the electromagnetic interactions.
<br>The <i>electromagnetic interaction</i> is responsible for the forces that control atomic structure, chemical reactions, and all electromagnetic phenomena. It accounts for the forces between charged particles, but unlike the gravitational interaction, can be either attractive or repulsive. Some neutral particles decay by electromagnetic interaction. The interaction is either visualized as a classical field of force (see <a href=""entry://Coulomb's law"">Coulomb's law</a>) or as an exchange of virtual <a href=""entry://photon"">photons</a>. As with gravitational interactions, the fact that electromagnetic interactions are long-ranged means that they have a well-defined classical theory given by <a href=""entry://Maxwell's equations"">Maxwell's equations</a>. The quantum theory of electromagnetic interactions is described by <a href=""entry://quantum electrodynamics"">quantum electrodynamics</a>, which is a simple form of gauge theory.
<br>The <i>strong interaction</i> , some 10<sup class=""expo"">2</sup> times stronger than the electromagnetic interaction, functions only between <a href=""entry://hadron"">hadrons</a> and is responsible for the force between nucleons that gives the atomic nucleus its great stability. It operates at very short range inside the nucleus (as little as 10<sup class=""expo"">-15</sup> metre) and is visualized as an exchange of virtual mesons. The strong interactions are described by a gauge theory called <a href=""entry://quantum chromodynamics"">quantum chromodynamics</a>"

"geomagnetism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>geomagnetism</b><br>The science concerned with the earth's magnetic field. If a bar magnet is suspended at any point on the earth's surface so that it can move freely in all planes, the north-seeking end of the magnet (N-pole) will point in a broadly northerly direction. The angle (<i>D</i>) between the horizontal direction in which it points and the geographic meridian at that point is called the <i>magnetic declination</i> . This is taken to be positive to the east of geographic north and negative to the west. The needle will not, however, be horizontal except on the <i>magnetic equator</i> . In all other positions it will make an angle (<i>I</i>) with the horizontal, called the <i>inclination</i> (or <i>magnetic dip</i> ). At the <i>magnetic poles</i>
<i>I</i> = 90° (+90° at the N-pole, -90° at the S-pole) and the needle will be vertical. The positions of the poles, which vary with time, were in the 1970s approximately 76.1°N, 100°W (N) and 65.8°S, 139°E (S). The vector intensity <i>F</i> of the geomagnetic field is specified by <i>I</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>F</i>, where <i>F</i> is the local magnetic intensity of the field measured in gauss or tesla (1 gauss = 10<sup class=""expo"">-4</sup> tesla). <i>F</i>, <i>I</i>, and <i>D</i>, together with the horizontal and vertical components of <i>F</i>, and its north and east components, are called the <i>magnetic elements</i> . The value of <i>F</i> varies from about 0.2 gauss to 0.6 gauss, in general being higher in the region of the poles than at the equator, but values vary irregularly over the earth's surface with no correlation with surface features. There is also a slow unpredictable change in the local values of the magnetic elements called the <i>secular magnetic variation</i> . For example, in London between 1576 and 1800 <i>D</i> changed from +11° to -24° and <i>I</i> varied between 74° and 67°. The study of <a href=""entry://palaeomagnetism"">palaeomagnetism</a> has extended knowledge of the secular magnetic variation into the geological past and it is clear that the direction of the geomagnetic field has reversed several times.

"group theory","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>group theory</b><br>The study of the symmetries that define the properties of a system. Invariance under symmetry operations enables much about a system to be deduced without knowing explicitly the solutions to the equations of motion. <a href=""entry://Newton's law of gravitation"">Newton's law of gravitation</a>, for instance, exhibits spherical symmetry. The force of gravity due to the attraction of a planet to a star is the same for all positions that are equidistant from the centre of mass of the star. However, the possible trajectories of the planet include non-symmetric elliptical orbits. These elliptical orbits are solutions to the Newtonian equations. However, one discovers on solving them that the planet does not move at a constant speed around the ellipse: it speeds up when it approaches perihelion and slows down approaching aphelion, which is consistent with what one might expect from a spherically symmetric force law. This behaviour, first formulated as one of <a href=""entry://Kepler's laws"">Kepler's laws</a> of planetary motion, is now accepted as a result of the conservation of angular momentum.
<br>This association of a dynamical symmetry with a conservation law was first suggested by A. E. Noether in 1918 (see <a href=""entry://Noether's theorem"">Noether's theorem</a>). For example, the laws of physics are invariant under translations in time; they are the same today as they were yesterday. Noether's theorem relates this invariance to the conservation of energy. If a system is invariant under translations in space, linear momentum is conserved.
<br>The symmetry operations on any physical system must possess the following properties:
<blockquote class=""blk"">1.&nbsp;<i>Closure</i> . If <i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i> and <i>R<sub class=""ind"">j</sub></i> are in the set of all symmetry operations, then the combination, <i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i>
<i>R<sub class=""ind"">j</sub></i> - meaning: first perform <i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i>, then perform <i>R<sub class=""ind"">j</sub></i> - is also a member of the set; that is, there exists an <i>R<sub class=""ind"">k</sub></i>, which is a member of the set such that <i>R<sub class=""ind"">k</sub></i> = <i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i>
<i>R<sub class=""ind"">j</sub></i>.
<br>2.&nbsp;<i>Identity</i> .There is an element <i>I</i>, which is also a member of the set of symmetry operations, such that <i>I</i>
<i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i> = <i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i>
<i>I</i> = <i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i>, for all elements <i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i> in the set.
<br>3.&nbsp;<i>Inverse</i> . For every element <i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i> there is an inverse, <i>R<sub class=""ind"">I</sub><sup class=""expo"">-1</sup></i>, such that <i>R<sub class=""ind"">I</sub></i><i>R<sub class=""ind"">I</sub></i><sup class=""expo"">-1</sup> = <i>R<sub class=""ind"">I</sub></i><sup class=""expo"">-1</sup><i>R<sub class=""ind"">I</sub></i> = <i>I</i>.
<br>4.&nbsp;<i>Associativity</i> . <i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i> (<i>R<sub class=""ind"">j</sub></i>
<i>R<sub class=""ind"">k</sub></i>) = (<i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i>
<i>R<sub class=""ind"">j</sub></i>) <i>R<sub class=""ind"">k</sub></i>.
<br></blockquote>These are the defining properties of a group in group theory. Group elements need not commute; i.e., <div class=""equ""><i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i>
<i>R<sub class=""ind"">j</sub></i> ? <i>R<sub class=""ind"">j</sub></i>
<i>R<sub class=""ind"">i</sub></i></div>, in general; if all the elements do commute then the group is said to be <i>Abelian</i> . Though translations in space and time are Abelian, it is easily verified that rotations about axes in 3D space are not. Groups can be <i>finite</i> (as the group of rotations of an equilateral triangle) or <i>infinite</i> (for example, the set of all integers, with addition used to combine the members). Groups can also be classed as <i>continuous</i> or <i>discrete</i> . An example of a continuous group is the group of all continuous translations of a point on a spherical surface. The symmetries of the star-planet system are the elements of this spherical group. Discrete groups have elements that may be labelled by an index that takes on only integer values. All finite groups and some infinite groups, such as the group of integers described above, are discrete.
<br>Group elements are conveniently represented in <a href=""entry://matrix"">matrix</a> form. The <a href=""entry://Lorentz group"">Lorentz group</a> (transformations between inertial frames of reference in special relativity), for instance, consists of a set of 4 × 4 matrices, which act on space-time coordinates. In elementary particle physics, the most common groups are called <i>U</i>(<i>n</i>): the set of all <i>n</i> × <i>n</i> matrices that describe <a href=""entry://unitary transformations"">unitary transformations</a>. If the unitary matrices are further restricted to have a determinant of 1, the group is called a ‘special unitary group’ or <i>SU</i>(<i>n</i>). When the elements of the unitary matrices are real numbers the group is called <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>). When the elements of the unitary matrices are real numbers the group is called <i>O</i>(<i>o</i>) or the group of <i>orthogonal</i> matrices in <i>n</i> dimensions. Finally, the group of real, orthogonal, <i>n</i> × <i>n</i> matrices of determinant 1 is <i>SO</i>(<i>n</i>). <i>SO</i>(<i>n</i>) may be thought of as the group of all rotations in <i>n</i>-dimensional space. Thus <i>SO</i>(3) is the name of the group of symmetries of the aforementioned star-planet system, and the symmetry that is related to the conservation of angular momentum by Noether's theorem.
<br>In discussing the particles of high-energy physics and the special unitary groups <i>SU</i>(2) and <i>SU</i>(3), it is helpful to consider an analogous example with <i>SO</i>(3) symmetry, such as the hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atom is composed of an electron trapped within the spherically symmetric potential of the atomic nucleus (a proton). The quantum mechanical treatment of this problem leads to a description of the electron states in terms of standing waves on a spherical surface. These standing waves themselves are in general less than spherically symmetric and are labelled by three integers or quantum numbers <i>n</i>, <i>l</i>, and <i>m</i> (see <a href=""entry://atom"">atom</a>). The quantum numbers <i>l</i> and <i>m</i> essentially describe the <a href=""entry://node"">nodes</a> and <a href=""entry://antinode"">antinodes</a> on the spherical surface undergoing standing wave oscillations. The energy associated with these standing waves, however, is (2<i>l</i> + 1)-fold degenerate; that is, for a given standing wave characterized by the quantum numbers <i>n</i> and <i>l</i>, there are (2<i>l</i> + 1) values of <i>m</i> characterizing states of the same energy. The reason for this degeneracy lies in the fact that the potential is spherically symmetric and independent of the angular position of the electron with respect to the nucleus. As a consequence of the spherical symmetry of the potential, the angular momentum <i>L</i> is conserved.
<br>The degeneracy of the hydrogen atom may be eliminated by the application of a magnetic field. The directional nature of this field destroys the spherical symmetry of the problem and leads to the <a href=""entry://Zeeman effect"">Zeeman effect</a>. The degeneracy is lifted by this symmetry-breaking term.
<br>In the 1930s, Heisenberg proposed a model for nuclear forces that was analogous to the group theory of the hydrogen atom. The only known nuclear particles at the time were the proton and the neutron, which were very similar in mass. Heisenberg proposed that nuclear interactions were independent of electric charge and that the proton and neutron were the same particle in the absence of electromagnetic interactions. This meant that the proton and neutron were members of a degenerate state and that the electromagnetic interaction broke the symmetry of nuclear interactions lifting this degeneracy. Just as <i>L</i> is the conserved quantity for the hydrogen atom analogy, the conserved quantity for nuclear interactions between protons and neutrons is a quantity labelled <i>I</i> that was later called isospin (see <a href=""entry://isotopic spin"">isotopic spin</a>).
<br>In the absence of the electromagnetic interaction, isospin is conserved (the proton and neutron have the same mass) and there is a two-fold degeneracy. Equivalently, the nuclear interaction (strong interaction) must be invariant under the group that has matrices that are described by isospin matrices. This group is <i>SU</i>(2).
<br>By the 1960s many more particles had been discovered and the ideas of isospin were applied to them. It turns out that it is convenient to describe these particles by characteristic quantum numbers, <i>I</i> for isospin, and <i>Y</i> for <a href=""entry://hypercharge"">hypercharge</a>. The particles may be grouped into charge or isospin degenerate multiplets. The hypercharge <i>Y</i> may be taken as twice the average charge of the multiplet. For example, the proton-neutron multiplet has a hypercharge given by: <div class=""equ""><i>Y</i> = 2·½ (0+1) = 1</div>. The hypercharge and isospin values of different particles are tabulated below:<center class=""pic"">

<br>The value of <i>I<sub class=""ind"">3</sub></i> given in the last column is similar to the quantum number <i>m</i> in the hydrogen atom analogy. It labels the degenerate states in the absence of the electromagnetic interaction. Experiments involving these particles show that hypercharge <i>Y</i> and isospin <i>I</i> are conserved under strong interactions.
<br>In 1961 <a href=""entry://Gell-Mann, Murray"">Gell-Mann</a>, and independently Ne'eman, suggested that the strong interaction should be invariant under <i>SU</i>(3); that is, should have <i>SU</i>(3) symmetry. Matrices for <i>Y</i> and <i>I</i> may be associated with matrices which define transformations of <i>SU</i>(3).
<br>Gell-Mann called this scheme the <i>eight-fold way</i> . In the absence of any other interaction, the strong interaction sees all eight particles in the table above as the same particle; i.e., the same state. It is the effect of the weak and electromagnetic interactions that break the <i>SU</i>(3) symmetry and lead to the lifting of the degeneracy and the splitting of the masses of these particles"

<b>Hawking process</b><br>Emission of particles by a <a href=""entry://black hole"">black hole</a> as a result of quantum-mechanical effects. It was discovered by Stephen Hawking. The gravitational field of the black hole causes production of particle-antiparticle pairs in the vicinity of the event horizon (the process is analogous to that of pair production). One member of each pair (either the particle or the antiparticle) falls into the black hole, while the other escapes. To an external observer, it appears that the black hole is emitting radiation (<i>Hawking radiation</i> ). Furthermore, it turns out that the energy of the particles that fall in is negative and exactly balances the (positive) energy of the escaping particles. This negative energy reduces the mass of the black hole and the net result of the process is that the emitted particle flux appears to carry off the black-hole mass. It can be shown that the black hole radiates like a <a href=""entry://black body"">black body</a>, with the energy distribution of the particles obeying <a href=""entry://Planck's radiation law"">Planck's radiation law</a> for a temperature that is inversely proportional to the mass of the hole. For a black hole of the mass of the sun, this temperature turns out to be only about 10<sup class=""expo"">-7</sup> K, so the process is negligible. However, for a ‘mini’ black hole, such as might be formed in the early universe, with a mass of order 10<sup class=""expo"">12</sup> kg (and a radius of order 10<sup class=""expo"">-15</sup> m), the temperature would be of order 10<sup class=""expo"">11</sup> K and the hole would radiate copiously (at a rate of about 6 × 10<sup class=""expo"">9</sup>W) a flux of gamma rays, neutrinos, and electron-positron pairs. (The observed levels of cosmic gamma rays put strong constraints on the number of such ‘mini’ black holes, suggesting that there are too few of them to solve the <a href=""entry://missing-mass"">missing-mass</a> problem.)"

"Hess's law","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Hess's law</b>
<br>If reactants can be converted into products by a series of reactions, the sum of the heats of these reactions (with due regard to their sign) is equal to the heat of reaction for direct conversion from reactants to products. More generally, the overall energy change in going from reactants to products does not depend on the route taken. The law can be used to obtain thermodynamic data that cannot be measured directly. For example, the heat of formation of ethane can be found by considering the reaction: <div class=""equ"">2C(s) + 3H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>(g) + 3½O<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>(g) → 2CO<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>O(1)</div> The heat of this reaction is <div class=""equ"">2Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">C</sub> + 3Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">H</sub></div>, where Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">C</sub> and Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">H</sub> are the heats of combustion of carbon and hydrogen respectively, which can be measured. By Hess's law, this is equal to the sum of the energies for two stages: <div class=""equ"">2C(s) + 3H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>(g) → C<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>H<sub class=""ind"">6</sub>(g)</div> (the heat of formation of ethane, Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">f</sub>) and <div class=""equ"">C<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>H<sub class=""ind"">6</sub>(g) + 3½O<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>(g) → 2CO<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>O(1)</div> (the heat of combustion of ethane, <div class=""equ"">Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">E</sub>)</div>. As Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">E</sub> can be measured and as <div class=""equ"">Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">f</sub> + Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">E</sub> = 2Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">c</sub> + 3Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">H</sub>Δ<i>H</i><sub class=""ind"">f</sub></div> can be found. Another example is the use of the <a href=""entry://Born-Haber cycle"">Born-Haber cycle</a> to obtain lattice energies. The law was first put forward in 1840 by the Russian chemist Germain Henri Hess (1802&ndash;50).

"hydraulic press","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>hydraulic press</b><br>A device in which a force (<i>F</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>) applied to a small piston (<i>A</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>) creates a pressure (<i>p</i>), which is transmitted through a fluid to a larger piston (<i>A</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>), where it gives rise to a larger force (<i>F</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>): see illustration. This depends on Pascal's principle that the pressure applied anywhere in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally in all directions.

In <i>dew-point hygrometers</i> a polished surface is reduced in temperature until water vapour from the atmosphere forms on it. The temperature of this dew point enables the relative humidity of the atmosphere to be calculated. In the <i>wet-and-dry bulb hygrometer</i> , two thermometers are mounted side by side, the bulb of one being surrounded by moistened muslin. The thermometer with the wet bulb will register a lower temperature than that with a dry bulb owing to the cooling effect of the evaporating water. The temperature difference enables the relative humidity to be calculated.

"hysteresis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>hysteresis</b><br>A phenomenon in which two physical quantities are related in a manner that depends on whether one is increasing or decreasing in relation to the other.
<br>The repeated measurement of <a href=""entry://stress"">stress</a> against <a href=""entry://strain"">strain</a>, with the stress first increasing and then decreasing, will produce for some specimens a graph that has the shape of a closed loop. This is known as a <i>hysteresis cycle</i> . The most familiar hysteresis cycle, however, is produced by plotting the magnetic flux density (<i>B</i>) within a ferromagnetic material against the applied magnetic field strength (<i>H</i>).
<br>If the material is initially unmagnetized at O it will reach saturation at P as <i>H</i> is increased. As the field is reduced and again increased the loop PQRSTP is formed (see graph). The area of this loop is proportional to the energy loss (<i>hysteresis loss</i> ) occurring during the cycle. The value of <i>B</i> equal to OQ is called the <i>remanance</i> (or retentivity) and is the magnetic flux density remaining in the material after the saturating field has been reduced to zero. This is a measure of the tendency of the magnetic domain patterns (see <a href=""entry://magnetism"">magnetism</a>) to remain distorted even after the distorting field has been removed. The value of <i>H</i> equal to OR is called the <i>coercive force</i> (or coercivity) and is the field strength required to reduce the remaining flux density to zero.

"inelastic collision","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>inelastic collision</b><br>A collision in which some of the kinetic energy of the colliding bodies is converted into internal energy in one body so that kinetic energy is not conserved. In collisions of macroscopic bodies some kinetic energy is turned into vibrational energy of the atoms, causing a heating effect. Collisions between molecules of a gas or liquid may also be inelastic as they cause changes in vibrational and rotational <a href=""entry://energy"">energy</a> levels. In nuclear physics, an inelastic collision is one in which the incoming particle causes the nucleus it strikes to become excited or to break up. <i>Deep inelastic scattering</i> is a method of probing the structure of sub-atomic particles in much the same way as Rutherford probed the inside of the atom (see <a href=""entry://Rutherford scattering"">Rutherford scattering</a>). Such experiments were performed on protons in the late 1960s using high-energy electrons at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). As in Rutherford scattering, deep inelastic scattering of electrons by proton targets revealed that most of the incident electrons interacted very little because they pass straight through the target; only a small number bounced back very sharply. This means that the charge in the proton must be concentrated in small lumps, reminiscent of Rutherford's discovery that charge in an atom is concentrated at the nucleus. However, in the case of the proton the evidence suggested that three distinct concentrations of charge existed rather than one (see <a href=""entry://elementary particles"">elementary particles</a>; <a href=""entry://parton"">parton</a>; <a href=""entry://quantum chromodynamics"">quantum chromodynamics</a>)"

"intercalation cell","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>intercalation cell</b><br>A type of secondary cell in which layered electrodes, usually made of metal oxides or graphite, store positive ions between the crystal layers of an electrode. In one type, lithium ions form an intercalation compound with a graphite electrode when the cell is charged. During discharge, the ions move through an electrolyte to the other electrode, made of manganese oxide, where they are more tightly bound. When the cell is being charged, the ions move back to their positions in the graphite. This backwards and forwards motion of the ions has led to the name <i>rocking-chair cell</i> for this type of system. Such cells have the advantage that only minor physical changes occur to the electrodes during the charging and discharging processes and the electrolyte is not decomposed but simply serves as a conductor of ions. Consequently, such cells can be recharged many more times than, say, a lead-acid accumulator, which eventually suffers from degeneration of the electrodes. <i>Lithium cells</i> , based on this principle, have been used in portable electronic equipment, such as camcorders. They have also been considered for use in electric vehicles"
"interference","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>interference</b><br>The interaction of two or more wave motions affecting the same part of a medium so that the instantaneous disturbances in the resultant wave are the vector sum of the instantaneous disturbances in the interfering waves.
<br>The phenomenon was first described by Thomas <a href=""entry://Young"">Young</a> in 1801 in light waves; it provided strong evidence for the wave theory of light. In the apparatus known as <i>Young's slits</i> , light is passed from a small source through a slit in a screen and the light emerging from this slit is used to illuminate two adjacent slits on a second screen. By allowing the light from these two slits to fall on a third screen, a series of parallel interference fringes is formed. Where the maximum values of the two waves from the slits coincide a bright fringe occurs (<i>constructive interference</i> ) and where the maxima of one wave coincide with the minima of the other dark fringes are produced (<i>destructive interference</i> ). <a href=""entry://Newton's rings"">Newton's rings</a> are also an interference effect.

"internal-combustion engine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>internal-combustion engine</b><br>A <a href=""entry://heat engine"">heat engine</a> in which fuel is burned in combustion chambers within the engine rather than in a separate furnace (as with the steam engine). The first working engine was the four-stroke <i>Otto engine</i> produced in 1876 by Nikolaus Otto (1832&ndash;91). In this type of engine a piston descends in a cylinder, drawing in a charge of fuel and air through an inlet valve; after reaching the bottom of its stroke the piston rises in the cylinder with the valves closed and compresses the charge; at or near the top of its stroke the charge is ignited by a spark and the resulting increase in pressure from the explosion forces the piston down again; on the subsequent upstroke the exhaust valve opens and the burnt gases are pushed out of the combustion chamber. The cycle is then repeated. Otto's engine used gas as a fuel; however, the invention of the carburettor and the development of the oil industry at the end of the 19th century enabled the Otto engine to become the source of power for the emerging motor car. A variation of the Otto four-stroke engine is the two-stroke engine that has no complicated valve system, the explosive charge entering and leaving the cylinder through ports in the cylinder that are covered and uncovered by the moving piston.
<br>An alternative to the Otto engine, especially for heavy vehicles where weight is not a problem, is the compression-ignition <i>Diesel engine</i> invented by Rudolf Diesel (1858&ndash;1913) in about 1896. In this type of engine there are no sparking plugs; instead air is compressed in the cylinder, causing its temperature to rise to about 550°C. Oil is then sprayed into the combustion chamber and ignites on contact with the hot air. While the spark-ignition petrol engine typically works on a <a href=""entry://compression ratio"">compression ratio</a> of 8 or 9 to 1, the Diesel engine has to have a compression ratio of between 15 and 25 to 1. This requires a much heavier, and therefore more expensive, engine.

"ion engine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>ion engine</b><br>A type of jet-propulsion engine that may become important for propelling or controlling spacecraft. It consists of a unit producing a beam of ions, which are accelerated by an electric or electromagnetic field. Reaction forces from the high-speed ions causes propulsion in much the same way as that caused by exhaust gas of a rocket. However, a separate beam of electrons or ions of opposite polarity to the propelling beam must also be ejected from the engine to enable recombination to take place behind the vehicle (to avoid the vehicle becoming charged). Ion engines provide high <a href=""entry://specific"">specific</a> impulse and therefore low propellant consumption. The three main components of an ion engine are the power generator, the propellant feed, and the thruster. The power generator may be a nuclear reactor or a solar-energy collector. If it is the former, a gas turbine is coupled to the reactor and the turbine drives an electric generator. A solar-energy unit provides electricity direct. The propellant chosen needs to have an ion of medium mass (low mass for high specific impulse, high mass for high thrust) and a low first <a href=""entry://ionization"">ionization</a> potential. Caesium and mercury are materials currently envisaged as suitable propellants. The thruster consists of an ionizer to produce the ions, an accelerator to provide and shape the accelerating field, and a neutralizer (usually an electron emitter) to neutralize the fast-moving ion beam after ejection"
"ion exchange","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>ion exchange</b><br>The exchange of ions of the same charge between a solution (usually aqueous) and a solid in contact with it. The process occurs widely in nature, especially in the absorption and retention of water-soluble fertilizers by soil. For example, if a potassium salt is dissolved in water and applied to soil, potassium ions are absorbed by the soil and sodium and calcium ions are released from it.
<br>The soil, in this case, is acting as an ion exchanger. Synthetic <i>ion-exchange resins</i> consist of various copolymers having a cross-linked three-dimensional structure to which ionic groups have been attached. An <i>anionic resin</i> has negative ions built into its structure and therefore exchanges positive ions. A <i>cationic resin</i> has positive ions built in and exchanges negative ions. Ion-exchange resins, which are used in sugar refining to remove salts, are synthetic organic polymers containing side groups that can be ionized. In anion exchange, the side groups are ionized basic groups, such as -NH<sub class=""ind"">3</sub><sup class=""expo"">+</sup> to which anions X<sup class=""expo"">-</sup> are attached. The exchange reaction is one in which different anions in the solution displace the X<sup class=""expo"">-</sup> from the solid. Similarly, cation exchange occurs with resins that have ionized acidic side groups such as -COO<sup class=""expo"">-</sup> or -SO<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>O<sup class=""expo"">-</sup>, with positive ions M<sup class=""expo"">+</sup> attached.
<br>Ion exchange also occurs with inorganic polymers such as zeolites, in which positive ions are held at sites in the silicate lattice. These are used for water-softening, in which Ca<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup> ions in solution displace Na<sup class=""expo"">+</sup> ions in the zeolite. The zeolite can be regenerated with sodium chloride solution. <i>Ion-exchange membranes</i> are used as separators in electrolytic cells to remove salts from sea water and in producing deionized water. Ion-exchange resins are also used as the stationary phase in <i>ion-exchange chromatography</i>"

<b>ion pump</b>
<br>A type of <a href=""entry://vacuum pump"">vacuum pump</a> that can reduce the pressure in a container to about 1 nanopascal by passing a beam of electrons through the residual gas. The gas is ionized and the positive ions formed are attracted to a cathode within the container where they remain trapped. The pump is only useful at very low pressures, i.e. below about 1 micropascal. The pump has a limited capacity because the absorbed ions eventually saturate the surface of the cathode.

"ionic radius","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>ionic radius</b><br>A value assigned to the radius of an ion in a crystalline solid, based on the assumption that the ions are spherical with a definite size. X-ray diffraction can be used to measure the internuclear distance in crystalline solids. For example, in NaF the Na - F distance is 23.1 nm, and this is assumed to be the sum of the Na<sup class=""expo"">+</sup> and F<sup class=""expo"">-</sup> radii. By making certain assumptions about the shielding effect that the inner electrons have on the outer electrons, it is possible to assign individual values to the ionic radii - Na<sup class=""expo"">+</sup> 9.6 nm; F<sup class=""expo"">-</sup> 13.5 nm. In general, negative ions have larger ionic radii than positive ions. The larger the negative charge, the larger the ion; the larger the positive charge, the smaller the ion"

"ionization chamber","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>ionization chamber</b>
<br>An instrument for detecting <a href=""entry://ionizing radiation"">ionizing radiation</a>. It consists of two electrodes contained in a gas-filled chamber with a potential difference maintained between them. Ionizing radiation entering the chamber ionizes gas atoms, creating electrons and positive ions. The electric field between the electrodes drives the electrons to the anode and the positive ions to the cathode. This current is, in suitable conditions, proportional to the intensity of the radiation. See also <a href=""entry://Geiger counter"">Geiger counter</a>"
"ionization gauge","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>ionization gauge</b><br>A vacuum gauge consisting of a three-electrode system inserted into the container in which the pressure is to be measured. Electrons from the cathode are attracted to the grid, which is positively biased. Some pass through the grid but do not reach the anode, as it is maintained at a negative potential. Some of these electrons do, however, collide with gas molecules, ionizing them and converting them to positive ions. These ions are attracted to the anode; the resulting anode current can be used as a measure of the number of gas molecules present. Pressure as low as 10<sup class=""expo"">-6</sup> pascal can be measured in this way"
"ionization potential","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>ionization potential</b>(IP)
<br>Symbol <i>I</i>. The minimum energy required to remove an electron from a specified atom or molecule to such a distance that there is no electrostatic interaction between ion and electron. Originally defined as the minimum potential through which an electron would have to fall to ionize an atom, the ionization potential was measured in volts. It is now, however, defined as the energy to effect an ionization and is conveniently measured in electronvolts (although this is not an SI unit).
<br>The energy to remove the least strongly bound electrons is the <i>first ionization potential</i> . Second, third, and higher ionization potentials can also be measured, although there is some ambiguity in terminology. Thus, in chemistry the second ionization potential is often taken to be the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the singly charged ion; the second IP of lithium would be the energy for the process <div class=""equ"">Li<sup class=""expo"">+</sup>→ Li<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup> + e</div>In physics, the second ionization potential is the energy required to remove an electron from the next to highest energy level in the neutral atom or molecule; e.g.<div class=""equ"">Li → Li<sup class=""expo"">+</sup> + e</div>,where Li<sup class=""expo"">+</sup> is an excited singly charged ion produced by removing an electron from the K-shell"
"ionizing radiation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>

"jet propulsion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>jet propulsion</b><i>(reaction propulsion)</i>
<br>The propulsion of a body by means of a force produced by discharging a fluid in the form of a jet. The backward-moving jet of fluid reacts on the body in which it was produced, in accordance with Newton's third law of motion, to create a reactive force that drives the body forward. Jet propulsion occurs in nature, the squid using a form of it to propel itself through water. Although jet-propelled boats and cars have been developed, the main use of jet propulsion is in aircraft and spacecraft. Jet propulsion is the only known method of propulsion in space. In the atmosphere, jet propulsion becomes more efficient at higher altitudes, as efficiency is inversely proportional to the density of the medium through which a body is flying. The three principal means of providing jet propulsion are the turbojet, the ramjet, and the rocket. The <i>turbojet</i> is an air-breathing <a href=""entry://heat engine"">heat engine</a> based on the <a href=""entry://gas turbine"">gas turbine</a>, used to power jet aircraft. The <i>ramjet</i> is also an air-breathing engine, but compression of the oxidant is achieved by the forward motion of the device through the atmosphere. This enables the compressor and turbine of the gas turbine to be dispensed with and the remaining system consists simply of an inlet diffuser, a combustion chamber in which fuel is burnt, and a jet nozzle through which the products of combustion are discharged.

"Josephson effects","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Josephson effects</b><br>Electrical effects observed when two superconducting materials (at low temperature) are separated by a thin layer of insulating material (typically a layer of oxide less than 10<sup class=""expo"">-8</sup>m thick). If normal metallic conductors are separated by such a barrier it is possible for a small current to flow between the conductors by the <a href=""entry://tunnel effect"">tunnel effect</a>. If the materials are superconductors (see <a href=""entry://superconductivity"">superconductivity</a>), several unusual phenomena occur:
<blockquote class=""blk"">(1)&nbsp;A supercurrent can flow through the barrier; i.e. it has zero resistance.
<br>(2)&nbsp;If this current exceeds a critical value, this conductivity is lost; the barrier then only passes the ‘normal’ low tunnelling current and a voltage develops across the junction.
<br>(3)&nbsp;If a magnetic field is applied below the critical current value, the current density changes regularly with distance across the junction. The net current through the barrier depends on the magnetic field applied. As the field is increased the net current increases from zero to a maximum, decreases to zero, increases again to a (lower) maximum, decreases, and so on. If the field exceeds a critical value the superconductivity in the barrier vanishes and a potential difference develops across the junction.
<br> (4)&nbsp;If a potential difference is applied across the junction, a high-frequency alternating current flows through the junction. The frequency of this current depends on the size of the potential difference.
<br></blockquote>
<br>A junction of this type is called a <i>Josephson junction</i> ; two or more junctions joined by superconducting paths form a <i>Josephson interferometer</i> . Such junctions can be used in measuring fundamental constants, in defining a voltage standard, and in the highly accurate measurement of magnetic fields. An important potential use is in logic components in high-speed computers. Josephson junctions can switch states very quickly (as low as 6 picoseconds). Moreover they have very low power consumption and can be packed closely without generating too much heat. The effects are named after B. D. Josephson (1940&ndash;95), who predicted them theoretically in 1962"

<b>Joule&mdash;Thomson effect</b><i>(Joule&mdash;Kelvin effect)</i>
<br>The change in temperature that occurs when a gas expands through a porous plug into a region of lower pressure. For most real gases the temperature falls under these circumstances as the gas has to do internal work in overcoming the intermolecular forces to enable the expansion to take place. This is a deviation from <a href=""entry://Joule's law"">Joule's law</a>. There is usually also a deviation from <a href=""entry://Boyle's law"">Boyle's law</a>, which can cause either a rise or a fall in temperature since any increase in the product of pressure and volume is a measure of external work done. At a given pressure, there is a particular temperature, called the <i>inversion temperature</i> of the gas, at which the rise in temperature from the Boyle's law deviation is balanced by the fall from the Joule's law deviation. There is then no temperature change. Above the inversion temperature the gas is heated by expansion, below it, it is cooled.

"Kerr effect","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Kerr effect</b>
<br>The ability of certain substances to refract differently light waves whose vibrations are in two directions (see <a href=""entry://double refraction"">double refraction</a>) when the substance is placed in an electric field. The effect, discovered in 1875 by John Kerr (1824&ndash;1907), is caused by the fact that certain molecules have electric <a href=""entry://dipole"">dipoles</a>, which tend to be orientated by the applied field; the normal random motions of the molecules tends to destroy this orientation and the balance is struck by the relative magnitudes of the field strength, the temperature, and the magnitudes of the dipole moments.
<br>The Kerr effect is observed in a <i>Kerr cell</i> , which consists of a glass cell containing the liquid or gaseous substance; two capacitor plates are inserted into the cell and light is passed through it at right angles to the electric field. There are two principal indexes of refraction: <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">o</sub> (the ordinary index) and <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">e</sub> (the extraordinary index). The difference in the velocity of propagation in the cell causes a phase difference, δ, between the two waves formed from a beam of monochromatic light, wavelength λ, such that <div class=""equ"">δ = (<i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">o</sub> - <i>n</i><sub class=""ind"">e</sub>)x/λ</div>, where <i>x</i> is the length of the light path in the cell.

<br>The <i>Kerr shutter</i> consists of a Kerr cell filled with a liquid, such as nitrobenzene, placed between two crossed polarizers; the electric field is arranged to be perpendicular to the axis of the light beam and at 45° to the axis of the polarizers. In the absence of a field there is no optical path through the device. When the field is switched on the nitrobenzene becomes doubly refracting and a path opens between the crossed polarizers"

<b>kinetic theory</b><br>A theory, largely the work of Count <a href=""entry://Rumford"">Rumford</a>, James <a href=""entry://Joule"">Joule</a>, and James Clerk <a href=""entry://Maxwell"">Maxwell</a>, that explains the physical properties of matter in terms of the motions of its constituent particles. In a gas, for example, the pressure is due to the incessant impacts of the gas molecules on the walls of the container. If it is assumed that the molecules occupy negligible space, exert negligible forces on each other except during collisions, are perfectly elastic, and make only brief collisions with each other, it can be shown that the pressure <i>p</i> exerted by one mole of gas containing <i>n</i> molecules each of mass <i>m</i> in a container of volume <i>V</i>, will be given by: <div class=""equ""><i>p</i> = <i>nmc̄</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/3<i>V</i></div>, where <i>c</i><sup class=""expo"">c̄2</sup> is the mean square speed of the molecules. As according to the <a href=""entry://gas"">gas</a> laws for one mole of gas: <div class=""equ""><i>pV</i> = <i>RT</i></div>, where <i>T</i> is the thermodynamic temperature, and <i>R</i> is the molar <a href=""entry://gas"">gas</a> constant, it follows that: <div class=""equ""><i>RT</i> = <i>nmc̄</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/3</div> Thus, the thermodynamic temperature of a gas is proportional to the mean square speed of its molecules. As the average kinetic <a href=""entry://energy"">energy</a> of translation of the molecules is <i>mc̄</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/2, the temperature is given by: <div class=""equ""><i>T</i>= (<i>mc̄</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/2)(2<i>n</i>/3<i>R</i>)</div>
<br>The number of molecules in one mole of any gas is the <a href=""entry://Avogadro constant"">Avogadro constant</a>, <i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">A</sub>; therefore in this equation <div class=""equ""><i>n</i> = <i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">A</sub></div>. The ratio <i>R</i>/<i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">A</sub> is a constant called the <a href=""entry://Boltzmann constant"">Boltzmann constant</a> (<i>k</i>). The average kinetic energy of translation of the molecules of one mole of any gas is therefore 3<i>kT</i>/2. For monatomic gases this is proportional to the <a href=""entry://internal energy"">internal energy</a> (<i>U</i>) of the gas, i.e. <div class=""equ""><i>U</i> = <i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">A</sub>3<i>kT</i>/2 and as <i>k</i> = <i>R</i>/<i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">A</sub><i>U</i>= 3<i>RT</i>/2</div> For diatomic and polyatomic gases the rotational and vibrational energies also have to be taken into account (see <a href=""entry://degrees of freedom"">degrees of freedom</a>).
<br>In liquids, according to the kinetic theory, the atoms and molecules still move around at random, the temperature being proportional to their average kinetic energy. However, they are sufficiently close to each other for the attractive forces between molecules to be important. A molecule that approaches the surface will experience a resultant force tending to keep it within the liquid. It is, therefore, only some of the fastest moving molecules that escape; as a result the average kinetic energy of those that fail to escape is reduced. In this way evaporation from the surface of a liquid causes its temperature to fall.
<br>In a crystalline solid the atoms, ions, and molecules are able only to vibrate about the fixed positions of a <a href=""entry://crystal"">crystal</a> lattice; the attractive forces are so strong at this range that no free movement is possible"

"knocking","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>knocking</b><br>The metallic sound produced by a spark-ignition petrol engine under certain conditions. It is caused by rapid combustion of the unburnt explosive mixture in the combustion chambers ahead of the flame front. As the flame travels from the sparking plug towards the piston it compresses and heats the unburnt gases ahead of it. If the flame front moves fast enough, normal combustion occurs and the explosive mixture is ignited progressively by the flame. If it moves too slowly, ignition of the last part of the unburnt gas can occur very rapidly before the flame reaches it, producing a shock wave that travels back and forth across the combustion chamber. The result is overheating, possible damage to the plugs, an undesirable noise, and loss of power (probably due to preignition caused by overheated plugs). Knocking can be avoided by an engine design that increases turbulence in the combustion chamber and thereby increases flame speed. It also can be avoided by reducing the compression ratio, but this involves loss of efficiency. The most effective method is to use high-octane fuel (see <a href=""entry://octane number"">octane number</a>), which has a longer self-ignition delay than low-octane fuels. This can be achieved by the addition of an <i>antiknock agent</i> , such as lead(IV) tetraethyl, to the fuel, which retards the combustion chain reactions. However, lead-free petrol is now preferred to petrol containing lead tetraethyl owing to environmental dangers arising from lead in the atmosphere. In the USA the addition of lead compounds is now forbidden. New formulae for petrol are designed to raise the octane number without polluting the atmosphere.

<b>labelling</b>
<br>The process of replacing a stable atom in a compound with a radioisotope of the same element to enable its path through a biological or mechanical system to be traced by the radiation it emits. In some cases a different stable isotope is used and the path is detected by means of a mass spectrometer. A compound containing either a radioactive or stable isotope is called a <i>labelled compound</i> and the atom used is a <i>label</i> . If a hydrogen atom in each molecule of the compound has been replaced by a tritium atom, the compound is called a <i>tritiated compound</i> . A radioactive labelled compound will behave chemically and physically in the same way as an otherwise identical stable compound, and its presence can easily be detected using a <a href=""entry://Geiger counter"">Geiger counter</a>. This process of <i>radioactive tracing</i> is widely used in chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering.

"laser","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>laser</b>(<i>light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation</i>)
<br>A light amplifier usually used to produce monochromatic coherent radiation in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the <a href=""entry://electromagnetic spectrum"">electromagnetic spectrum</a>.
<br>Nonlaser light sources emit radiation in all directions as a result of the spontaneous emission of photons by thermally excited solids (filament lamps) or electronically excited atoms, ions, or molecules (fluorescent lamps, etc.). The emission accompanies the spontaneous return of the excited species to the <a href=""entry://ground state"">ground state</a> and occurs randomly, i.e. the radiation is not coherent. In a laser, the atoms, ions, or molecules are first ‘pumped’ to an excited state and then stimulated to emit photons by collision of a photon of the same energy. This is called <i>stimulated emission</i> . In order to use it, it is first necessary to create a condition in the amplifying medium, called <i>population inversion</i> , in which the majority of the relevant entities are excited. Random emission from one entity can then trigger coherent emission from the others that it passes. In this way amplification is achieved.
<br>The laser amplifier is converted to an oscillator by enclosing the amplifying medium within a resonator. Radiation then introduced along the axis of the resonator is reflected back and forth along its path by a mirror at one end and by a partially transmitting mirror at the other end. Between the mirrors the waves are amplified by stimulated emission. The radiation emerges through the semitransparent mirror at one end as a powerful coherent monochromatic parallel beam of light. The emitted beam is uniquely parallel because waves that do not bounce back and forth between the mirrors quickly escape through the sides of the oscillating medium without amplification.
<br>Some lasers are solid, others are liquid or gas devices. Population inversion can be achieved by <i>optical pumping</i> with flashlights or with other lasers. It can also be achieved by such methods as chemical reactions, discharges in gases, and recombination emission in semiconducting materials (see <a href=""entry://recombination process"">recombination process</a>).
<br>Lasers have found many uses since their invention in 1960, including laser welding, surgery, <a href=""entry://holography"">holography</a>, printing, optical communications, and the reading of digital information. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000137.jpg"" ></img><br>A simple ruby laser</center>"

<b>latent heat</b><br>Symbol <i>L</i>. The quantity of heat absorbed or released when a substance changes its physical phase at constant temperature (e.g. from solid to liquid at the melting point or from liquid to gas at the boiling point). For example, the latent heat of vaporization is the energy a substance absorbs from its surroundings in order to overcome the attractive forces between its molecules as it changes from a liquid to a gas and in order to do work against the external atmosphere as it expands.

These parallels are specified by the angle subtended at the centre of the earth by the arc formed between a point on the parallel and the equator. All points on the equator therefore have a latitude of 0°, while the north pole has a latitude of 90°N and the south pole of 90°S.

"laws, theories, and hypotheses","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>laws, theories, and hypotheses</b><br>In science, a law is a descriptive principle of nature that holds in all circumstances covered by the wording of the law. There are no loopholes in the laws of nature and any exceptional event that did not comply with the law would require the existing law to be discarded or would have to be described as a miracle. Eponymous laws are named after their discoverers (e.g. <a href=""entry://Boyle's law"">Boyle's law</a>); some laws, however, are known by their subject matter (e.g. the law of conservation of mass), while other laws use both the name of the discoverer and the subject matter to describe them (e.g. <a href=""entry://Newton's law of gravitation"">Newton's law of gravitation</a>).
<br>A description of nature that encompasses more than one law but has not achieved the uncontrovertible status of a law is sometimes called a <i>theory</i> .

"Le Chatelier's principle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Le Chatelier's principle</b><br>If a system is in equilibrium, any change imposed on the system tends to shift the equilibrium to nullify the effect of the applied change. The principle, which is a consequence of the law of conservation of energy, was first stated in 1888 by Henri Le Chatelier (1850&ndash;1936). It is applied to chemical equilibria. For example, in the gas reaction <div class=""equ"">2SO<sub class=""ind"">2</sub> + O<sub class=""ind"">2</sub> ? 2SO<sub class=""ind"">3</sub></div> an increase in pressure on the reaction mixture displaces the equilibrium to the right, since this reduces the total number of molecules present and thus decreases the pressure. The standard enthalpy change for the forward reaction is negative (i.e. the reaction is exothermic). Thus, an increase in temperature displaces the equilibrium to the left since this tends to reduce the temperature. The equilibrium constant thus falls with increasing temperature"

"lead-acid accumulator","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>lead-acid accumulator</b><br>An accumulator in which the electrodes are made of lead and the electrolyte consists of dilute sulphuric acid. The electrodes are usually cast from a lead alloy containing 7&ndash;12% of antimony (to give increased hardness and corrosion resistance) and a small amount of tin (for better casting properties). The electrodes are coated with a paste of lead(II) oxide (PbO) and finely divided lead; after insertion into the electrolyte a ‘forming’ current is passed through the cell to convert the PbO on the negative plate into a sponge of finely divided lead. On the positive plate the PbO is converted to lead(IV) oxide (PbO<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>). The equation for the overall reaction during discharge is:<div class=""equ"">PbO<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>+ 2H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>SO<sub class=""ind"">4</sub> + Pb → 2PbSO<sub class=""ind"">4</sub> + 2H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>O</div> The reaction is reversed during charging. Each cell gives an e.m.f. of about 2 volts and in motor vehicles a 12-volt battery of six cells is usually used. The lead-acid battery produces 80&ndash;120 kJ per kilogram.

They include biconvex, planoconvex, and converging meniscus lenses. <i>Diverging lenses</i> cause the rays of a parallel beam to diverge as if from a virtual principal focus; these include the biconcave, planoconcave, and diverging meniscus lenses. See illustrations.
<br>The <i>centre of curvature</i> of a lens face is the centre of the sphere of which the surface of the lens is a part. The <i>optical axis</i> is the line joining the two centres of curvature of a lens or, in the case of a lens with one plane surface, the line through one centre of curvature that is normal to the plane surface. The <i>optical centre</i> of a lens is the point within a lens on the optical axis through which any rays entering the lens pass without deviation. The distance between the optical centre and the principal focus of a lens is called the <i>focal length</i> (ƒ).

<br>The finite velocity of light was suspected by many early experimenters in optics, but it was not established until 1676 when Ole Røemer (1644&ndash;1710) measured it. Sir Isaac <a href=""entry://Newton"">Newton</a> investigated the optical <a href=""entry://spectrum"">spectrum</a> and used existing knowledge to establish a primarily <i>corpuscular theory</i> of light, in which it was regarded as a stream of particles that set up disturbances in the ‘aether’ of space. His successors adopted the corpuscles but ignored the wavelike disturbances until Thomas <a href=""entry://Young"">Young</a> rediscovered the <a href=""entry://interference"">interference</a> of light in 1801 and showed that a <i>wave theory</i> was essential to interpret this type of phenomenon.

"lightning","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>lightning</b><br>A high-energy luminous electrical discharge that passes between a charged cloud and a point on the surface of the earth, between two charged clouds, or between oppositely charged layers of the same cloud. In general, the upper parts of clouds are positively charged and the lower parts are negatively charged; the reasons for this separation of charge are complex.
<br>Lightning usually occurs in the form of a downward step leader followed by an intensely luminous return stroke, which can produce instantaneous temperatures as high as 30 000°C. In the typical step leader a surge of electrons descends in approximately 50-metre steps with about 50-microsecond pauses between steps. When this leader reaches the earth a surge of charge returns up the preionized path taken by the leader. Cloud-to-cloud strokes also involve a leader and return stroke. The average current in a lightning stroke is about 10 000 amperes, but maximum currents in the return stroke can reach 20 000 A. See also <a href=""entry://ball lightning"">ball lightning</a>"

<b>linear accelerator</b><i>(linac)</i>
<br>A type of particle <a href=""entry://accelerator"">accelerator</a> in which charged particles are accelerated in a straight line, either by a steady electric field or by means of radio-frequency electric fields. There are three main types:
<br><b><span class=""uCase""><i>Van de Graaff accelerator</b>.</i></span>
<br>This device accelerates charged particles by applying a high electrical potential difference generated by a <a href=""entry://Van de Graaff generator"">Van de Graaff generator</a>. The potential difference can be kept steady to within one part in a thousand, enabling a very uniformly energetic beam of accelerated particles to be created. The maximum electrical potential attainable is about 10 MV and depends on the insulating properties of the gas around the Van de Graaff sphere. It is increased by enclosing the whole generator in a pressure vessel containing an inert gas at a pressure of about 20 atmospheres. A source, at the same potential as the sphere, produces charged particles that enter a column of cylindrical electrodes, each of which is at a lower potential than the one above it. The ions are accelerated as they pass through the gaps between the cylinders. The nonuniform electric fields between the gaps have the effect of focusing the beam of charged particles.
<br><b><span class=""uCase""><i>Drift-tube accelerator</b>.</i></span>
<br>In this device charged particles are accelerated along a line of hollow metal cylinders called <i>drift tubes</i> . The cylinders are connected alternately to opposite terminals of an alternating potential difference produced by either a <a href=""entry://magnetron"">magnetron</a> or a <a href=""entry://klystron"">klystron</a>. The arrangement ensures that adjacent cylinders are always at opposite electrical potentials. For example, a proton beam may be injected into the first of the line of drift tubes from a Van de Graaff accelerator. Protons reaching the gap between the first two tubes will be accelerated into the second tube, when the alternating potential makes the first tube positive and the second tube negative. This enables the protons emerging into the gap between two cylinders to be accelerated into the next cylinder. All parts of a particular tube are at the same potential, since the metal acts as an equipotential surface. Therefore within a cylinder the particles travel at a constant speed (hence <i>drift tube</i> ). It follows that the energy of the beam is increased every time the protons cross between drift tubes, and therefore a device with a large number of gaps can produce extremely high-energy beams using only moderate supply voltages. The Berkeley proton accelerator has a drift-tube arrangement of 47 cylinders, 19 km long. It accelerates protons up to 31.5 GeV.
<br><b><span class=""uCase""><i>Travelling-wave accelerator</b>.</i></span>
<br>This apparatus uses radio-frequency electromagnetic waves to accelerate charged particles. Charged particles are fed into the travelling-wave accelerator at close to the speed of light and are carried through a <a href=""entry://wave guide"">wave guide</a> by the electric field component of a radio wave. The very high initial speeds for charged particles are needed to match the phase velocity of radio signals propagating along the wave guide. However, this means that travelling-wave accelerators are suitable only for accelerating lighter particles, such as electrons. The electrons can be accelerated to initial speeds of 98% of the speed of light by a Van de Graaff accelerator. At such high initial speeds, there is little scope for further acceleration and any increase in electron energy provided by the accelerator results from the relativistic increase in mass. The <i>Stanford linear accelerator</i> (SLAC) uses the travelling-wave principle. SLAC is capable of accelerating electrons and positrons to 50 GeV in a tube 3 km long"
"linear energy transfer","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>linear energy transfer</b>(LET)
<br>The energy transferred per unit path length by a moving high-energy charged particle (such as an electron or a proton) to the atoms and molecules along its path.

<b>liquefied petroleum gas</b>(LPG)
<br>Various petroleum gases, principally propane and butane, stored as a liquid under pressure. It is used as an engine fuel and has the advantage of causing very little cylinder-head deposits.
<br>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a similar product and consists mainly of methane. However, it cannot be liquefied simply by pressure as it has a low critical temperature of 190 K and must therefore be cooled to below this temperature before it will liquefy. Once liquefied it has to be stored in well-insulated containers. It provides a convenient form in which to ship natural gas in bulk from oil wells or gas-only wells to users. It is also used as an engine fuel"
"liquid","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>liquid</b><br>A phase of matter between that of a crystalline solid and a <a href=""entry://gas"">gas</a>. In a liquid, the large-scale three-dimensional atomic (or ionic or molecular) regularity of the solid is absent but, on the other hand, so is the total disorganization of the gas. Although liquids have been studied for many years there is still no comprehensive theory of the liquid state. It is clear, however, from diffraction studies that there is a short-range structural regularity extending over several molecular diameters. These bundles of ordered atoms, molecules, or ions move about in relation to each other, enabling liquids to have almost fixed volumes, which adopt the shape of their containers"

"liquid-crystal display","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>liquid-crystal display</b><br>A display unit used in digital watches, calculators, miniature TV screens, etc. It provides a source of clearly displayed digits for a very low power consumption. In the display unit a thin film of <a href=""entry://liquid crystal"">liquid crystal</a> is sandwiched between two transparent electrodes (glass with a thin metal or oxide coating). In the commonly used field-effect display, twisted nematic crystals are used. The nematic liquid crystal cell is placed between two crossed polarizers. Polarized light entering the cell follows the twist of the nematic liquid crystal, is rotated through 90°, and can therefore pass through the second polarizer. When an electric field is applied the molecular alignment in the liquid crystal is altered, the polarization of the entering light is unchanged, and no light is therefore transmitted. In these circumstances, a mirror placed behind the second polarizer will cause the display to appear black. One of the electrodes, shaped in the form of a digit, will then provide a black digit when the voltage is applied"
"liquid-drop model","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>liquid-drop model</b><br>A model of the atomic nucleus that has been successful in accounting for <a href=""entry://nuclear fission"">nuclear fission</a> and the variation of <a href=""entry://nuclear stability"">nuclear stability</a> with mass number. The density of a nucleus is independent of its size, which suggests that nuclear matter can be modelled on a drop of an incompressible liquid, such as water. Different excitation states of a drop-like nucleus can then be described in terms of <a href=""entry://spherical harmonics"">spherical harmonics</a> (see also <a href=""entry://normal modes"">normal modes</a>). The success of the model has been associated with the fact that the binding forces in both the nucleus and the liquid drop are essentially short-ranged (see <a href=""entry://fundamental interactions"">fundamental interactions</a>). The liquid-drop model provides a subtle explanation for the variation of binding energy in different nuclei. Energy must be supplied to a drop of liquid in order to break it up into its component parts. For a drop of liquid, this energy is its latent heat of vaporization, which is proportional to the mass of liquid present. One would therefore expect a nucleus to have a binding energy proportional to its mass number. However, one needs also to offset this expectation by considering an effect analogous to the surface tension in the liquid drop. Nucleons (protons or neutrons) in the interior of a nucleus are attracted from all sides, whereas those at the surface are attracted only from within. The surface nucleons are therefore easier to remove and consequently have lower binding energies. In smaller nuclei, the surface nucleons form a greater proportion of the total volume than those in larger nuclei. It follows, therefore, that the binding energy is reduced by an amount proportional to the surface area of the nucleus. The binding energy may be further modified by the contribution of electrostatic repulsion between protons, which will be significant for the larger nuclei (in which there are more protons). The nuclear model becomes a drop of positively charged liquid whose stability is expected to be further modified by the internal motions of the protons and neutrons within it. Quantum mechanics can provide the form of this final contribution, which is often called a ‘symmetry term’ on account of its dependence on the difference of neutron and proton numbers (hence the tendency for the neutron number to equal the proton number)"

"loudness","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>loudness</b><br>The physiological perception of sound intensity. As the ear responds differently to different frequencies, for a given intensity loudness is dependent on frequency. Sounds with frequencies between 1000 hertz and 5000 Hz are louder than sounds of the same intensity at higher or lower frequencies. Duration is also a factor in loudness, long bursts of sound being louder than short bursts. Loudness increases up to a duration of about 0.2 second; above this limit loudness does not increase with duration.
<br>Relative loudness is usually measured on the assumption of proportionality to the logarithm of the intensity (for a given frequency), i.e. proportionality to the relative intensity on the <a href=""entry://decibel"">decibel</a> scale. A subjective judgment is made of the relative intensity above threshold that a note of 1000 Hz must have to match the specimen sound; the loudness of this, in <a href=""entry://phon"">phons</a>, is then equal to that relative intensity in decibels"

<b>lubrication</b><br>The use of a substance to prevent contact between solid surfaces in relative motion in order to reduce friction, wear, overheating, and rusting. Liquid hydrocarbons (oils), either derived from petroleum or made synthetically, are the most widely used lubricants as they are relatively inexpensive, are good coolants, provide the appropriate range of viscosities, and are thermally stable. Additives include polymeric substances that maintain the desired viscosity as the temperature increases, antioxidants that prevent the formation of a sludge, and alkaline-earth phenates that neutralize acids and reduce wear.
<br>At high temperatures, solid lubricants, such as graphite or molybdenum disulphide, are often used. Semifluid lubricants (greases) are used to provide a seal against moisture and dirt and to remain attached to vertical surfaces. They are made by adding gelling agents, such as metallic soaps, to liquid lubricants.

"magnetic moment","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>magnetic moment</b><br>The ratio between the maximum torque (<i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">max</sub>) exerted on a magnet, current-carrying coil, or moving charge situated in a <a href=""entry://magnetic field"">magnetic field</a> and the strength of that field. It is thus a measure of the strength of a magnet or current-carrying coil.

In audio-frequency recorders a high-frequency bias (in the range 75&ndash;100 kHz) is used to reduce distortion by facilitating the re-orientation.

"magnetism","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>magnetism</b><br>A group of phenomena associated with <a href=""entry://magnetic field"">magnetic fields</a>. Whenever an electric current flows a magnetic field is produced; as the orbital motion and the <a href=""entry://spin"">spin</a> of atomic electrons are equivalent to tiny current loops, individual atoms create magnetic fields around them, when their orbital electrons have a net <a href=""entry://magnetic moment"">magnetic moment</a> as a result of their angular momentum. The magnetic moment of an atom is the vector sum of the magnetic moments of the orbital motions and the spins of all the electrons in the atom. The macroscopic magnetic properties of a substance arise from the magnetic moments of its component atoms and molecules. Different materials have different characteristics in an applied magnetic field; there are four main types of magnetic behaviour:
<blockquote class=""blk"">(a)&nbsp;In <i>diamagnetism</i> the magnetization is in the opposite direction to that of the applied field, i.e. the <a href=""entry://susceptibility"">susceptibility</a> is negative. Although all substances are diamagnetic, it is a weak form of magnetism and may be masked by other, stronger, forms. It results from changes induced in the orbits of electrons in the atoms of a substance by the applied field, the direction of the change (in accordance with <a href=""entry://Lenz's law"">Lenz's law</a>) opposing the applied flux. There is thus a weak negative susceptibility (of the order of -10<sup class=""expo"">-8</sup> m<sup class=""expo"">3</sup> mol<sup class=""expo"">-1</sup>) and a relative permeability of slightly less than one.
<br>(b)&nbsp;In <i>paramagnetism</i> the atoms or molecules of the substance have net orbital or spin magnetic moments that are capable of being aligned in the direction of the applied field. They therefore have a positive (but small) susceptibility and a relative permeability slightly in excess of one. Paramagnetism occurs in all atoms and molecules with unpaired electrons; e.g. free atoms, free radicals, and compounds of transition metals containing ions with unfilled electron shells. It also occurs in metals as a result of the magnetic moments associated with the spins of the conducting electrons.
<br>(c)&nbsp;In <i>ferromagnetic</i> substances, within a certain temperature range, there are net atomic magnetic moments, which line up in such a way that magnetization persists after the removal of the applied field. Below a certain temperature, called the <a href=""entry://Curie"">Curie</a> point (or Curie temperature) an increasing magnetic field applied to a ferromagnetic substance will cause increasing magnetization to a high value, called the <i>saturation magnetization</i> . This is because a ferromagnetic substance consists of small (1&ndash;0.1 mm across) magnetized regions called <i>domains</i> . The total magnetic moment of a sample of the substance is the vector sum of the magnetic moments of the component domains. Within each domain the individual atomic magnetic moments are spontaneously aligned by <i>exchange forces</i> , related to whether or not the atomic electron spins are parallel or antiparallel. However, in an unmagnetized piece of ferromagnetic material the magnetic moments of the domains themselves are not aligned; when an external field is applied those domains that are aligned with the field increase in size at the expense of the others. In a very strong field all the domains are lined up in the direction of the field and provide the high observed magnetization. Iron, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys are ferromagnetic. Above the Curie point, ferromagnetic materials become paramagnetic.
<br>(d)&nbsp;Some metals, alloys, and transition-element salts exhibit another form of magnetism called <i>antiferromagnetism</i> . This occurs below a certain temperature, called the <a href=""entry://Néel temperature"">Néel temperature</a>, when an ordered array of atomic magnetic moments spontaneously forms in which alternate moments have opposite directions. There is therefore no net resultant magnetic moment in the absence of an applied field. In manganese fluoride; for example, this antiparallel arrangement occurs below a Néel temperature of 72 K. Below this temperature the spontaneous ordering opposes the normal tendency of the magnetic moments to align with the applied field. Above the Néel temperature the substance is paramagnetic.
<br>A special form of antiferromagnetism is <i>ferrimagnetism</i> , a type of magnetism exhibited by the <a href=""entry://ferrite"">ferrites</a>. In these materials the magnetic moments of adjacent ions are antiparallel and of unequal strength, or the number of magnetic moments in one direction is greater than those in the opposite direction. By suitable choice of rare-earth ions in the ferrite lattices it is possible to design ferrimagnetic substances with specific magnetizations for use in electronic components.

"maser","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>maser</b><br>(<i>m</i>icrowave <i>a</i>mplification by <i>s</i>timulated <i>e</i>mission of <i>r</i>adiation) A device for amplifying or generating <a href=""entry://microwaves"">microwaves</a> by means of stimulated emission (see <a href=""entry://laser"">laser</a>). As oscillators, masers are used in <a href=""entry://atomic clock"">atomic clocks</a>, while they are used as amplifiers in <a href=""entry://radio"">radio</a> astronomy, being especially suitable for amplifying feeble signals from space.
<br>In the <i>ammonia gas maser</i> (devised in 1954) a molecular beam of ammonia passes through a small orifice into a vacuum chamber, where it is subjected to a nonuniform electric field. This field deflects ground-state ammonia molecules, shaped like a pyramid with the three hydrogen atoms forming the plane of the base and the single nitrogen atom forming the apex. The ground-state molecule has a dipole moment on account of its lack of symmetry and it is for this reason that it suffers deflection. Excited molecules, in which the nitrogen atom vibrates back and forth through the plane of the hydrogen atoms, have no resultant dipole moment and are not deflected. The beam, now consisting predominately of excited molecules, is passed to a resonant cavity fed with the microwave radiation corresponding to the energy difference between the excited and the ground states. This causes stimulated emission as the excited molecules fall to the ground state and the input microwave radiation is amplified coherently. This arrangement can also be made to oscillate and in this form is the basis of the <a href=""entry://ammonia clock"">ammonia clock</a>.
<br>In the more versatile <i>solid-state maser</i> a magnetic field is applied to the electrons of paramagnetic (see <a href=""entry://magnetism"">magnetism</a>) atoms or molecules. The energy of these electrons is quantized into two levels, depending on whether or not their spins are parallel to the magnetic field. The situation in which there are more parallel magnetic moments than antiparallel can be reversed by sudden changes in the magnetic field. This electron-spin resonance in paramagnetic materials allows amplification over broader bandwidths than gas masers"
"mass","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>mass</b><br>A measure of a body's <a href=""entry://inertia"">inertia</a>, i.e. its resistance to acceleration. According to Newton's laws of motion, if two unequal masses, <i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> and <i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>, are allowed to collide, in the absence of any other forces both will experience the same force of collision. If the two bodies acquire accelerations <i>a</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> and <i>a</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub> as a result of the collision, then <div class=""equ""><i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub><i>a</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> = <i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub><i>a</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub></div>. This equation enables two masses to be compared. If one of the masses is regarded as a standard of mass, the mass of all other masses can be measured in terms of this standard. The body used for this purpose is a 1-kg cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy, called the international standard of mass. Mass defined in this way is called the <i>inertial mass</i> of the body.
<br>Mass can also be defined in terms of the gravitational force it produces. Thus, according to Newton's law of gravitation, <div class=""equ""><i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">g</sub> = <i>Fd</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/<i>MG</i></div>, where <i>M</i> is the mass of a standard body situated a distance <i>d</i> from the body of mass <i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">g</sub>; <i>F</i> is the gravitational force between them and <i>G</i> is the <a href=""entry://gravitational constant"">gravitational constant</a>. The mass defined in this way is the <i>gravitational mass</i> . In the 19th century Roland Eötvös (1848&ndash;1919) showed experimentally that gravitational and inertial mass are indistinguishable, i.e. <div class=""equ""><i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">i</sub> = <i>m</i><sub class=""ind"">g</sub></div>.
<br>Although mass is formally defined in terms of its inertia, it is usually measured by gravitation. The <i>weight</i> (<i>W</i>) of a body is the force by which a body is gravitationally attracted to the earth corrected for the effect of rotation and equals the product of the mass of the body and the <a href=""entry://acceleration"">acceleration</a> of free fall (<i>g</i>), i.e. <i>W</i> = <i>mg</i>. In the general language, weight and mass are often used synonymously; however, for scientific purposes they are different. Mass is measured in kilograms; weight, being a force, is measured in newtons. Weight, moreover, depends on where it is measured, because the value of <i>g</i> varies at different localities on the earth's surface. Mass, on the other hand, is constant wherever it is measured, subject to the special theory of <a href=""entry://relativity"">relativity</a>. According to this theory, announced by Albert Einstein in 1905, the mass of a body is a measure of its total energy content. Thus, if the energy of a body increases, for example by an increase in kinetic energy or temperature, then its mass will increase. According to this law an increase in energy Δ<i>E</i> is accompanied by an increase in mass Δ<i>m</i>, according to the <i>mass-energy equation</i>
<div class=""equ"">Δ<i>m</i> = Δ<i>E</i>/<i>c</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup></div>, where <i>c</i> is the speed of light. Thus, if 1 kg of water is raised in temperature by 100 K, its internal energy will increase by 4 × 10<sup class=""expo"">-12</sup> kg. This is, of course, a negligible increase and the mass-energy equation is only significant for extremely high energies. For example, the mass of an electron is increased sevenfold if it moves relative to the observer at 99% of the speed of light"
"mass action","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>mass action</b><br>The law of mass action states that the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place at a given temperature is proportional to the product of the <i>active masses</i> of the reactants. The active mass of a reactant is taken to be its molar concentration. For example, for a reaction <div class=""equ""><i>x</i>A + <i>y</i>B → products</div> the rate is given by <div class=""equ""><i>R</i> = <i>k</i>[A]<i><sup class=""expo"">x</sup></i>[B]<i><sup class=""expo"">y</sup></i></div> where <i>k</i> is the rate constant. The principle was introduced by C. M. Guldberg and P. Waage in 1863. It is strictly correct only for ideal gases. In real cases activities can be used"

<b>microphone</b><br>A <a href=""entry://transducer"">transducer</a> in which sound waves are converted into corresponding variations in an electrical signal for amplification, transmission to a distant point, or recording. Various types of device are used. In the <i>dynamic microphone</i> the sound waves impinge on a conductor of low mass supported in a magnetic field and cause it to oscillate at the frequency of the sound waves. These movements induce an e.m.f. in the conductor that is proportional to its velocity. The moving conductor consists of a metal ribbon, a wire, or a coil of wire. In the <i>moving-iron microphone</i> , sound waves cause a light armature to oscillate so that it varies the reluctance of a magnetic circuit. In a coil surrounding this path the varying reluctance is experienced as a variation in the magnetic flux within it, which induces a corresponding e.m.f. In the <i>carbon microphone</i> , widely used in telephones, a diaphragm constitutes a movable electrode in contact with carbon granules, which are also in contact with a fixed electrode. The movement of the diaphragm, in response to the sound waves, varies the resistance of the path through the granules to the fixed electrode.

Between two horizontal oppositely charged plates Millikan introduced a fine spray of oil droplets.

Then using X-rays to ionize the air he noted the changed rate of fall of droplets that were attracted to the lower plate after these droplets had acquired a charge from the ionized air. These figures enabled Millikan to conclude that the acquired charge was always a simple multiple of a basic unit. He found this basic unit to be 4.774 × 10<sup class=""expo"">-10</sup> esu, which was the value for the charge on an electron used until it was improved in 1928"

An <i>inferior mirage</i> occurs when the ground surface is strongly heated and the air near the ground is much warmer that the air above. Light rays from the sky are strongly refracted upwards near the surface giving the appearance of a pool of water. A <i>superior mirage</i> occurs if the air close to the ground surface is much colder than the air above. Light is bent downwards from the object towards the viewer so that it appears to be elevated or floating in the air"
"mirror","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>

"modulation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>modulation</b><br>The process of changing an electrical signal. In radio transmission, it is the process of superimposing the characteristics of a periodic signal onto a <a href=""entry://carrier"">carrier</a> wave so that the information contained in the signal can be transmitted by the wave. The simplest form of modulation is <i>amplitude modulation</i> (<i>AM</i> ), in which the amplitude of the carrier is increased or diminished as the signal amplitude increases and diminishes. The modulated wave is composed of the carrier wave plus upper and lower sidebands. In <i>single-sideband modulation</i> (<i>SSB</i> ) the carrier and one of the sidebands of an amplitude-modulated waveform are suppressed. This saves on bandwidth occupancy and signal power. In <i>frequency modulation</i> (<i>FM</i> ), the frequency of the carrier is increased or diminished as the signal amplitude increases and diminishes but the carrier amplitude remains constant. In <i>phase modulation</i> , the relative phase of the carrier is varied in accordance with the signal amplitude. (See illustrations.) Both frequency modulation and phase modulation are forms of <i>angle modulation</i> .
<br>In <i>pulse modulation</i> the information is transmitted by controlling the amplitude, duration, position, or presence of a series of pulses. Morse code is a simple form of a pulse modulation.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000119.jpg"" ></img><br>Modulation</center>"

In 1957 R. L. Mössbauer (1929&ndash; ) discovered that if the emitting nucleus is held by strong forces in the lattice of a solid, the recoil energy is shared by all the nuclei in the lattice. As there may typically be 10<sup class=""expo"">10</sup>&ndash;10<sup class=""expo"">20</sup> atoms in the lattice the recoil will be negligible and the gammaray photon has the energy <i>E</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub>. The same principle applies to the absorption of gamma rays and is used in <i>Mössbauer-effect spectroscopy</i> to elucidate problems in nuclear physics, solid-state physics, and chemistry"

"Newtonian fluid","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Newtonian fluid</b><br>A fluid in which the velocity gradient is directly proportional to the shear stress. If two flat plates of area <i>A</i> are separated by a layer of fluid of thickness <i>d</i> and move relative to each other at a velocity <i>v</i>, then the rate of shear is <i>v</i>/<i>d</i> and the shear stress is <i>F</i>/<i>A</i>, where <i>F</i> is the force applied to each (see illustration). For a Newtonian fluid <div class=""equ""><i>F</i>/<i>A</i> = µ<i>v</i>/<i>d</i></div>, where µ is the constant of proportionality and is called the Newtonian <a href=""entry://viscosity"">viscosity</a>. Many liquids are Newtonian fluids over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. However, some are not; these are called <i>non-Newtonian fluids</i> . In such fluids there is a departure from the simple Newtonian relationships. For example, in some liquids the viscosity increases as the velocity gradient increases, i.e. the faster the liquid moves the more viscous it becomes. Such liquids are said to be <i>dilatant</i> and the phenomenon they exhibit is called <i>dilatancy</i> . It occurs in some pastes and suspensions. More common, however, is the opposite effect in which the viscosity depends not only on the velocity gradient but also on the time for which it has been applied. These liquids are said to exhibit <i>thixotropy</i> . The faster a <i>thixotropic liquid</i> moves the less viscous it becomes. This property is used in nondrip paints (which are more viscous on the brush than on the wall) and in lubricating oils (which become thinner when the parts they are lubricating start to move). Another example is the non-Newtonian flow of macromolecules in solution or in polymer melts. In this case the shearing force <i>F</i> is not parallel to the shear planes and the linear relationship does not apply. In general, the many types of non-Newtonian fluid are somewhat complicated and no theory has been developed to accommodate them fully. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000142.jpg"" ></img><br>Newtonian fluid</center>"

A typical cell delivers some 160 picoamperes at a voltage proportional to the load resistance. It can be used to maintain the voltage of a charged capacitor. Of greater use, especially in space technology, are the various types of low-voltage nuclear batteries. Typical is the gas-ionization device in which a beta-emitter ionizes a gas in an electric field. Each beta-particle produces about 200 ions, thus multiplying the current. The electric field is obtained by the contact potential difference between two electrodes, such as lead dioxide and magnesium.

<b>nuclear fission</b><br>A nuclear reaction in which a heavy nucleus (such as uranium) splits into two parts (<i>fission products</i> ), which subsequently emit either two or three neutrons, releasing a quantity of energy equivalent to the difference between the rest mass of the neutrons and the fission products and that of the original nucleus.

"nuclear fusion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>nuclear fusion</b><br><b>1</b> A type of <a href=""entry://nuclear reaction"">nuclear reaction</a> in which atomic nuclei of low atomic number fuse to form a heavier nucleus with the release of large amounts of energy. In <a href=""entry://nuclear fission"">nuclear fission</a> reactions a neutron is used to break up a large nucleus, but in nuclear fusion the two reacting nuclei themselves have to be brought into collision. As both nuclei are positively charged there is a strong repulsive force between them, which can only be overcome if the reacting nuclei have very high kinetic energies. These high kinetic energies imply temperatures of the order of 10<sup class=""expo"">8</sup> K. As the kinetic energy required increases with the nuclear charge (i.e. atomic number), reactions involving low atomic-number nuclei are the easiest to produce. At these elevated temperatures, however, fusion reactions are self-sustaining; the reactants at these temperatures are in the form of a <a href=""entry://plasma"">plasma</a> (i.e. nuclei and free electrons) with the nuclei possessing sufficient energy to overcome electrostatic repulsion forces. The fusion bomb (see <a href=""entry://nuclear weapons"">nuclear weapons</a>) and the stars generate energy in this way. It is hoped that the method will be harnessed in the <a href=""entry://thermonuclear reactor"">thermonuclear reactor</a> as a source of energy for man's use.
<br>Typical fusion reactions with the energy release in joules are: <div class=""equ"">D + D = T + p + 6.4 × 10<sup class=""expo"">-13</sup> J</div>
<div class=""equ"">T + D = <sup class=""expo"">4</sup>He + n + 28.2 × 10<sup class=""expo"">-13</sup> J</div>

<br>A large amount of work is currently being done on <i>cold fusion</i> ; i.e. fusion that can occur at lower temperatures than those necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between nuclei. The most productive approach is <i>meson-catalysed fusion</i> , in which the deuterium atoms have their electrons replaced by negative muons to give ‘muonic atoms’ of deuterium. The muon is 207 times heavier than the electron, so the muonic deuterium atom is much smaller and is able to approach another deuterium atom more closely, allowing nuclear fusion to occur. The muon is released to form another muonic atom, and the process continues. The limiting factor is the short lifetime of the muon, which restricts the number of fusion reactions it can catalyse.

"nuclear magnetic resonance","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>nuclear magnetic resonance</b>(NMR)
<br>The absorption of electromagnetic radiation at a suitable precise frequency by a nucleus with a nonzero magnetic moment in an external magnetic field. The phenomenon occurs if the nucleus has nonzero <a href=""entry://spin"">spin</a>, in which case it behaves as a small magnet. In an external magnetic field, the nucleus's magnetic moment vector precesses about the field direction but only certain orientations are allowed by quantum rules. Thus, for hydrogen (spin of ½) there are two possible states in the presence of a field, each with a slightly different energy. Nuclear magnetic resonance is the absorption of radiation at a photon energy equal to the difference between these levels, causing a transition from a lower to a higher energy state. For practical purposes, the difference in energy levels is small and the radiation is in the radiofrequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It depends on the field strength.
<br>NMR can be used for the accurate determination of nuclear moments. It can also be used in a sensitive form of magnetometer to measure magnetic fields. In medicine, <i>magnetic resonance imaging</i> (<i>MRI</i> ) has been developed, in which images of tissue are produced by magnetic-resonance techniques.
<br>The main application of NMR is as a technique for chemical analysis and structure determination, known as <i>NMR spectroscopy</i> . It depends on the fact that the electrons in a molecule shield the nucleus to some extent from the field, causing different atoms to absorb at slightly different frequencies (or at slightly different fields for a fixed frequency). Such effects are known as <i>chemical shifts</i> . There are two methods of NMR spectroscopy. In <i>continuous wave</i> (<i>CW</i> ) NMR, the sample is subjected to a strong field, which can be varied in a controlled way over a small region. It is irradiated with radiation at a fixed frequency, and a detector monitors the field at the sample. As the field changes, absorption corresponding to transitions occurs at certain values, and this causes oscillations in the field, which induce a signal in the detector. <i>Fourier transform</i> (<i>FT</i> ) NMR uses a fixed magnetic field and the sample is subjected to a high-intensity pulse of radiation covering a range of frequencies. The signal produced is analysed mathematically to give the NMR spectrum. The most common nucleus studied is <sup class=""expo"">1</sup>H. For instance, an NMR spectrum of ethanol (CH<sub class=""ind"">3</sub>CH<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>OH) has three peaks in the ratio 3:2:1, corresponding to the three different hydrogen-atom environments. The peaks also have a fine structure caused by interaction between spins in the molecule. Other nuclei can also be used for NMR spectroscopy (e.g. <sup class=""expo"">13</sup>C, <sup class=""expo"">14</sup>N, <sup class=""expo"">19</sup>F) although these generally have lower magnetic moment and natural abundance than hydrogen. See also <a href=""entry://electron-spin resonance"">electron-spin resonance</a>.
<br><b><span class=""uCase"">MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING</b></span>
<br>This diagnostic imaging technique is based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), in which <a href=""entry://proton"">protons</a> interact with a strong magnetic field and with radio waves to generate electrical pulses that can be processed in a similar way to computerized <a href=""entry://tomography"">tomography</a>. The medical application of NMR began in the 1950s, but the first images of live patients were not produced until the late 1970s. Though expensive, the technique has become a very promising medical tool. Images produced by MRI are similar to those produced by computerized tomography using X-rays, but without the radiation hazard.
<br>A major factor in the high costs of MRI is the need for a superconducting magnet to produce the very strong magnetic fields (0.1&ndash;2 tesla). A niobium-titanium alloy, which becomes superconducting at -269°C, is used to construct the field coils. These need to be immersed in liquid helium backed up with liquid nitrogen. Superimposed on this large magnetic field are smaller fields, with known gradients in two directions. These gradient fields produce a unique value of the magnetic field strength at each point within the instrument (see illustration).
<br>Some nuclei in the atoms of a patient's tissues have a <a href=""entry://spin"">spin</a>, which makes them behave as tiny nuclear magnets. The purpose of the large magnetic field is to align these nuclear magnets. Having achieved this alignment, the area under examination is subjected to pulses of radio-frequency (RF) radiation. At a resonant frequency of RF pulses the nuclei under examination undergo <a href=""entry://Larmor precession"">Larmor precession</a>. This phenomenon may be thought of as a ‘tipping’ of the nuclear magnets away from the strong field alignment. The nuclear magnets then precess, or ‘wobble’, about the axis of the main field as the nuclei regain their alignment with that field.
<br>The speed at which the nuclei return to the steady state gives rise to two parameters, known as <i>relaxation times</i> . Because these relaxation times for nuclei depend on their atomic environment, they may be used to identify nuclei. Small changes in the magnetic field produced as the nuclei precess induce currents in a receiving coil. These signals are digitized before being stored in a computer.
<br>The resulting set of RF pulse sizes and sequences identify a variety of resonance situations. By analysing these sequences and knowing the unique value of magnetic field strength within the volume under investigation, the resonance signals may be decoded to give estimates of the composition of the patient's tissues. A three-dimensional map of the composition can then be produced, using colour to indicate contrast between differing tissue compositions.
<br>MRI has produced spectacular results in studies of the brain and central nervous system, providing excellent images of delicate structures without the risk of the damage associated with ionizing radiation. Systems using very strong fields, in the region of 2 tesla or above, produce images of extremely high quality. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000168.jpg"" ></img><br>MRI: the way unique field strengths are produced at different points in a specimen.</center>"

The fuels available for use in a fission reactor are uranium&ndash;235, uranium&ndash;233, and plutonium&ndash;239; only the first occurs in nature (as 1 part in 140 of natural uranium), the others have to be produced artificially (see <a href=""entry://nuclear fuel"">nuclear fuel</a>). When a uranium&ndash;235 nucleus is made to undergo fission by the impact of a neutron it breaks into two roughly equal fragments, which release either two or three very high-energy neutrons. These <a href=""entry://fast neutron"">fast neutrons</a> need to be slowed down to increase the probability that they will cause further fissions of <sup class=""expo"">235</sup>U nuclei and thus sustain the chain reaction. This slowing down process occurs naturally to a certain extent when the neutrons collide with other nuclei; unfortunately, however, the predominant uranium isotope, <sup class=""expo"">238</sup>U, absorbs fast neutrons to such an extent that in natural uranium the fission reaction is not self-sustaining. In order to create a controlled self-sustaining chain reaction it is necessary either to slow down the neutrons (using a <a href=""entry://moderator"">moderator</a> in a <i>thermal reactor</i> ) to greatly reduce the number absorbed by <sup class=""expo"">238</sup>U, or to reduce the predominance of <sup class=""expo"">238</sup>U in natural uranium by enriching it with more <sup class=""expo"">235</sup>U than it normally contains. In a <i>fast reactor</i> the fuel used is enriched uranium and no moderator is employed.
<br>In thermal reactors, neutrons are slowed down by collisions with light moderator atoms (such as graphite, deuterium, or beryllium); they are then in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding material and are known as <i>thermal neutrons</i> . In a <i>heterogeneous thermal reactor</i> the fuel and moderator are in separate solid and liquid phases (e.g. solid uranium fuel and a heavy water moderator). In the <i>homogeneous thermal reactor</i> the fuel and moderator are mixed together, for example in a solution, molten dispersion, slurry, or suspension.
<br>In the reactor <i>core</i> the <i>fuel elements</i> encase the fuel; in a heterogeneous reactor the fuel elements may fit into a lattice that also contains the moderator. The progress of the reaction is controlled by <a href=""entry://control rod"">control rods</a>, which when lowered into the core absorb neutrons and so slow down or stop the chain reaction. The heat produced by the nuclear reaction in the core is used to generate electricity by the same means as in a conventional power station, i.e. by raising steam to drive a steam turbine that turns a generator. The heat is transferred to the steam-raising boiler or heat-exchanger by the <a href=""entry://coolant"">coolant</a>. Water is frequently used as the coolant; in the case of the <i>boiling-water reactor</i> (<i>BWR</i> ) and the <i>pressurized-water reactor</i> (<i>PWR</i> ) water is both coolant and moderator. In the BWR the primary coolant drives the turbine; in the PWR the primary coolant raises steam in a secondary circuit for driving the turbine. In the <i>gas-cooled reactor</i> the coolant is a gas, usually carbon dioxide with an outlet temperature of about 350°C, or 600°C in the case of the <i>advanced gas-cooled reactor</i> (<i>AGR</i> ).
<br>In fast reactors, in which there is no moderator, the temperature is higher and a liquid-metal coolant is used, usually liquid sodium. Some fast reactors are used as converters or breeders. A <i>converter reactor</i> is one that converts <a href=""entry://fertile material"">fertile material</a> (such as <sup class=""expo"">238</sup>U) into <a href=""entry://fissile material"">fissile material</a> (such as <sup class=""expo"">239</sup>Pu). A <i>breeder reactor</i> produces the same fissile material as it uses. For example, a <i>fast breeder reactor</i> using uranium enriched with <sup class=""expo"">239</sup>Pu as the fuel can produce more <sup class=""expo"">239</sup>Pu than it uses by converting <sup class=""expo"">238</sup>U to <sup class=""expo"">239</sup>Pu.

"nuclear stability","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>nuclear stability</b><br>The stability of an atomic nucleus depends on its <a href=""entry://binding energy"">binding energy</a> per nucleon, <i>E</i>. This energy represents the average energy that needs to be supplied to liberate a nucleon from the nucleus. One may visualize this qualitatively by imagining a well of potential energy, the depth of which represents <i>E</i> for a particular nucleus. Nuclei with deeper binding energy wells are more stable and occur at intermediate mass numbers. In the graph of <i>E</i> against mass number shown, <sup class=""expo"">56</sup><sub class=""ind"">26</sub>Fe has a value of <i>E</i> of 8.8 MeV and is one of the most stable of nuclides. There are three other nuclides, <sup class=""expo"">4</sup><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>He, <sup class=""expo"">12</sup><sub class=""ind"">6</sub>C, and <sup class=""expo"">16</sup><sub class=""ind"">8</sub>O lying significantly above the main curve. Though these are not the most stable of all nuclides, they are considerably more stable than those of other nuclides of adjacent mass numbers. Nuclides of intermediate masses, such as iron, have the greatest values of <i>E</i>. Therefore if the conditions are right, there will be a tendency for nuclides of mass lower than iron to undergo fusion to enhance stability by acquiring a deeper <i>E</i> well. When nuclei heavier than iron undergo fission, energy is released which is equivalent to the difference in <i>E</i> of the parent and daughter nuclei (see also <a href=""entry://liquid-drop model"">liquid-drop model</a>; <a href=""entry://Q-value"">Q-value</a>). <center class=""pic""><img src=""000186.jpg"" ></img><br>Nuclear stability</center>"

The fusion bomb (<i>thermonuclear weapon</i> , <i>hydrogen bomb</i> , or <i>H-bomb</i> ) relies on a nuclear-fusion reaction, which becomes self-sustaining at a critical temperature of about 35 × 10<sup class=""expo"">6</sup> K. Hydrogen bombs consist of either two-phase fission-fusion devices in which an inner fission bomb is surrounded by a hydrogenous material, such as heavy hydrogen (deuterium) or lithium deuteride, or a three-phase fission-fusion-fission device, which is even more powerful. The megaton explosion produced by such a thermonuclear reaction has not yet been used in war. A special type of fission-fusion bomb is called a <i>neutron bomb</i> , in which most of the energy is released as high-energy neutrons.

<b>nucleon emission</b><br>A decay mechanism in which a particularly unstable nuclide regains some stability by the emission of a nucleon (i.e. a proton or neutron).

"nucleus","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>nucleus</b><b><i>(of atom)</i></b>
</div>
<br>The central core of an atom that contains most of its mass. Experiments performed in 1909 by Geiger and Marsden (under the direction of <a href=""entry://Rutherford"">Rutherford</a>) led to the discovery of a nuclear structure (see <a href=""entry://Rutherford scattering"">Rutherford scattering</a>). The nucleus is positively charged and contains one or more nucleons (protons or neutrons). The positive charge of the nucleus is determined by the number of protons it contains (see <a href=""entry://atomic number"">atomic number</a>); in the neutral atom this positive charge is balanced by an equal number of negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus in a comparatively large region outside it.
<br>The simplest nucleus is the hydrogen nucleus, consisting of a single proton. All other nuclei contain neutrons, which contribute to the atomic mass (see <a href=""entry://nucleon number"">nucleon number</a>) but not to the nuclear charge. Therefore nuclei with different numbers of neutrons but the same number of protons will possess the same number of electrons around the nuclei of their neutral atoms. Such atoms are called <a href=""entry://isotope"">isotopes</a>. Since it is the electron configuration around the nucleus that dictates chemical properties, isotopes are chemically indistinguishable and separation is achieved by nonchemical methods (see <a href=""entry://isotope separation"">isotope separation</a>). Nuclei do not seem to have clearly defined perimeters. However, an estimate of a nuclear radius may be achieved by investigating the scattering of very high-energy alpha particles by the nucleus. The deflections of alpha particles in Rutherford scattering experiments agree very well with predicted data, except when the alpha particles have very high kinetic energies. The theoretical predictions made by Rutherford assumed the nucleus to be a point of positive charge. The incident alpha particle would behave as though the nucleus were a point as long as it did not begin to penetrate the outer regions of the nucleus itself. Deviation of the alpha particle scattering data from the point nucleus predictions, indicates the onset of nucleus penetration. Experiments of this kind, using a wide variety of target nuclei, reveal that the radius <i>R</i> of any nucleus can be represented by: <div class=""equ"">R = r<sub class=""ind"">o</sub>A<sup class=""expo"">1/3</sup></div>, where r<sub class=""ind"">o</sub> is a constant (= 1.414 × 10<sup class=""expo"">-15</sup> m) and <i>A</i> is the nucleon number of the nucleus. Nuclear radii are commonly expressed in femtometres
<br>(1 fm = 10<sup class=""expo"">-15</sup> m), which is sometimes called a fermi. Experiments using projectiles other than alpha particles (such as electrons, neutrons, etc.) give slightly different values of r<sub class=""ind"">0</sub>.
<br>The relationship between <i>R</i> and <i>A</i> has an interesting implication for the density of nuclear material. Since both mass and volume of nuclear material are proportional to <i>A</i>, an expression for the density of nuclear material is constant and therefore the same for all nuclei; that is, all nuclei have the same density, estimated to be about, 2.3 × 10<sup class=""expo"">17</sup> kg/m<sup class=""expo"">3</sup>.

<b>Olbers' paradox</b><br>If the universe is infinite, uniform, and unchanging the sky at night would be bright, as in whatever direction one looked one would eventually see a star.

"optical activity","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>optical activity</b>
<br>The ability of certain substances to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light as it passes through a crystal, liquid, or solution. It occurs when the molecules of the substance are asymmetric, so that they can exist in two different structural forms each being a mirror image of the other. The two forms are <i>optical isomers</i> or <i>optical enantiomers</i> . The existence of such forms is also known as <i>enantiomorphism</i> (the mirror images being <i>enantiomorphs</i> ). One form will rotate the light in one direction and the other will rotate it by an equal amount in the other. The two possible forms are described as <a href=""entry://dextrorotatory"">dextrorotatory</a> or <a href=""entry://laevorotatory"">laevorotatory</a> according to the direction of rotation, and prefixes <i>d</i>- and <i>l</i>-, respectively, are used to designate the isomer, as in <i>d</i>-tartaric and <i>l</i>-tartaric acids (see <a href=""entry://formulae"">formulae</a>). An equimolar mixture of the two forms is not optically active. It is called a <i>racemic mixture</i> (or <i>racemate</i> ) and designated by <i>dl</i>-. Prefixes are used to designate the isomer: (+)- (dextrorotatory), (-)- (laevorotatory), and (±)- (racemic mixture) are now preferred to, and increasingly used for, the former <i>d</i>-, <i>l</i>-, and <i>dl</i>-, respectively. In addition, certain molecules can have a <i>meso form</i> in which one part of the molecule is a mirror image of the other. Such molecules are not optically active.
<br>Molecules that show optical activity have no plane of symmetry. The commonest case of this is in organic compounds in which a carbon atom is linked to four different groups. An atom of this type is said to be a <i>chiral centre</i>. Asymmetric molecules showing optical activity can also occur in inorganic compounds. For example, an octahedral complex in which the central ion coordinates to eight different ligands would be optically active. Many naturally occurring compounds show optical isomerism and usually only one isomer occurs naturally. For instance, glucose is found in the dextrorotatory form.

<b>orbit</b><br><b>1</b>
<font class=""bir"">(in astronomy)</font> The path through space of one celestial body about another. For one small body moving in the gravitational field of another the orbit is a <a href=""entry://conic"">conic</a> section. Most such orbits are elliptical and most planetary orbits in the solar system are nearly circular. The shape and size of an elliptical orbit is specified by its eccentricity, <i>e</i>, and the length of its semimajor axis, <i>a</i> (see <a href=""entry://ellipse"">ellipse</a>).

<font class=""bir"">(in physics)</font> The path of an electron as it travels round the nucleus of an atom. See <a href=""entry://orbital"">orbital</a>."
"orbital","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>orbital</b><br>A region in which an electron may be found in an atom or molecule. In the original <a href=""entry://Bohr theory"">Bohr theory</a> of the atom the electrons were assumed to move around the nucleus in circular orbits, but further advances in quantum mechanics led to the view that it is not possible to give a definite path for an electron. According to <a href=""entry://wave mechanics"">wave mechanics</a>, the electron has a certain probability of being in a given element of space. Thus for a hydrogen atom the electron can be anywhere from close to the nucleus to out in space but the maximum probability in spherical shells of equal thickness occurs in a spherical shell around the nucleus with a radius equal to the Bohr radius of the atom. The probabilities of finding an electron in different regions can be obtained by solving the Schrödinger wave equation to give the wave function ψ, and the probability of location per unit volume is then proportional to ψ<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>. Thus the idea of electrons in fixed orbits has been replaced by that of a probability distribution around the nucleus &mdash; an <i>atomic orbital</i> (see illustration). Alternatively, the orbital can be thought of as an electric charge distribution (averaged over time). In representing orbitals it is convenient to take a surface enclosing the space in which the electron is likely to be found with a high probability.
<br>The possible atomic orbitals correspond to subshells of the atom. Thus there is one <i>s</i>-orbital for each shell (orbital quantum number <div class=""equ""><i>l</i> = 0</div>). This is spherical. There are three <i>p</i>-orbitals (corresponding to the three values of <i>l</i>) and five <i>d</i>-orbitals. The shapes of orbitals depend on the value of <i>l</i>. For instance, <i>p</i>-orbitals each have two lobes; most <i>d</i>-orbitals have four lobes.
<br>In molecules, the valence electrons move under the influence of two nuclei (in a bond involving two atoms) and there are corresponding <i>molecular orbitals</i> for electrons (see illustration). It is convenient in considering these to regard them as formed by overlap of atomic orbitals. In a hydrogen molecule the <i>s</i>-orbitals on the two atoms overlap and form a molecular orbital between the two nuclei. This is an example of a <i>sigma orbital</i> . In a double bond, as in ethene, one bond is produced by overlap along the line of axes to form a sigma orbital. The other is produced by sideways overlap of the lobes of the <i>p</i>-orbitals (see illustration). The resulting molecular orbital has two parts, one on each side of the sigma orbital &mdash; this is a <i>pi orbital</i> . It is also possible for a <i>delta orbital</i> to form by lateral overlap of two <i>d</i>-orbitals. In fact, the combination of two atomic orbitals produces two molecular orbitals with different energies. The one of lower energy is the <i>bonding orbital</i> , holding the atoms together; the other is the <i>antibonding orbital</i> , which would tend to push the atoms apart. In the case of valence electrons, only the lower (bonding) orbital is filled.
<br>In considering the formation of molecular orbitals it is often useful to think in terms of <i>hybrid</i> atomic orbitals. For instance, carbon has in its outer shell one <i>s</i>-orbital and three <i>p</i>-orbitals. In forming methane (or other tetrahedral molecules) these can be regarded as combining to give four equivalent <i>sp</i><sup class=""expo"">3</sup> hybrid orbitals, each with a lobe directed to a corner of a tetrahedron. It is these that overlap with the <i>s</i>-orbitals on the hydrogen atoms. In ethene, two <i>p</i>-orbitals combine with the <i>s</i>-orbital to give three <i>sp</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup> hybrids with lobes in a plane pointing to the corners of an equilateral triangle. These form the sigma orbitals in the C-H and C-C bonds. The remaining <i>p</i>-orbitals (one on each carbon) form the pi orbital. In ethyne, <i>sp</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup> hybridization occurs to give two hybrid orbitals on each atom with lobes pointing along the axis. The two remaining <i>p</i>-orbitals on each carbon form two pi orbitals. Hybrid atomic orbitals can also involve <i>d</i>-orbitals. For instance, square-planar complexes use <i>sp<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>d</i> hybrids; octahedral complexes use <i>sp<sup class=""expo"">3</sup>d<sup class=""expo"">2</sup></i>. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000071.jpg"" ></img><br>Orbitals</center>"

"osmosis","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>osmosis</b><br>The passage of a solvent through a <i>semipermeable membrane</i> separating two solutions of different concentrations. A semipermeable membrane is one through which the molecules of a solvent can pass but the molecules of most solutes cannot. There is a thermodynamic tendency for solutions separated by such a membrane to become equal in concentration, the water (or other solvent) flowing from the weaker to the stronger solution. Osmosis will stop when the two solutions reach equal concentration, and can also be stopped by applying a pressure to the liquid on the stronger-solution side of the membrane. The pressure required to stop the flow from a pure solvent into a solution is a characteristic of the solution, and is called the <i>osmotic pressure</i> (symbol Π). Osmotic pressure depends only on the concentration of particles in the solution, not on their nature (i.e. it is a <a href=""entry://colligative property"">colligative property</a>). For a solution of <i>n</i> moles in volume <i>V</i> at thermodynamic temperature <i>T</i>, the osmotic pressure is given by ΠV = <i>nRT</i>, where <i>R</i> is the gas constant. Osmotic-pressure measurements are used in finding the relative molecular masses of compounds, particularly macromolecules. A device used to measure osmotic pressure is called an <i>osmometer</i> .
<br>The distribution of water in living organisms is dependent to a large extent on osmosis, water entering the cells through their membranes. A cell membrane is not truly semipermeable as it allows the passage of certain solute molecules; it is described as <i>partially permeable</i> . Animals have evolved various means to counteract the effects of osmosis; in plant cells, excessive osmosis is prevented by the pressure exerted by the cell wall, which opposes the osmotic pressure"

<b>overpotential</b><br>A potential that must be applied in an electrolytic cell in addition to the theoretical potential required to liberate a given substance at an electrode. The value depends on the electrode material and on the current density. It occurs because of the significant activation energy for electron transfer at the electrodes, and is particularly important for the liberation of such gases as hydrogen and oxygen. For example, in the electrolysis of a solution of zinc ions, hydrogen (<div class=""equ""><i>E</i><sup class=""expo""><img src=""000176.jpg"" ></img></sup> = 0.00 V</div>) would be expected to be liberated at the cathode in preference to zinc (<div class=""equ""><i>E</i><sup class=""expo""><img src=""000176.jpg"" ></img></sup> = -0.76 V</div>).

If parity was conserved there would therefore be no fundamental way of distinguishing between left and right. In electromagnetic and strong interactions, parity is, in fact, conserved. In 1956, however, it was shown that parity is not conserved in weak interactions. In the beta decay of cobalt&ndash;60, for example, the electrons from the decay are emitted preferentially in a direction opposite to that of the cobalt spin.

"particle-beam experiments","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>particle-beam experiments</b><br>There are essentially two arrangements for particle-beam experiments in <a href=""entry://elementary-particle"">elementary-particle</a> physics. Before the early 1970s, <i>fixed-target experiments</i> were the only means of probing the structures of subatomic particles. In a fixed-target experiment a beam of accelerated particles is directed at a stationary target. An example of such an experimental arrangement is the <a href=""entry://Bevatron"">Bevatron</a> at Berkeley, built to produce antiprotons by striking a proton at rest with a high-energy proton: <i>p</i> + <i>p</i>
→<i>p</i> + <i>p</i> + <i>p</i> + <i><img src=""000041.jpg"" ></img></i> According to the mass-energy equation (see <a href=""entry://mass"">mass</a>) some of the kinetic energy of the accelerated proton becomes the mass energy of the proton-antiproton pair. Since this newly formed mass has only the mass equivalence of two proton rest masses, it is remarkable that in practice this fixed target experiment requires an incident kinetic energy equivalent to six times the proton rest mass to create a single proton-antiproton pair. This example illustrates the inefficiency of scattering using a stationary target; conservation of momentum (see <a href=""entry://conservation law"">conservation law</a>) means that the products of a fixed target experiment must possess some residual kinetic energy which therefore cannot be involved in forming the mass-energy of collision products. This problem does not arise in <i>colliding-beam experiments</i> introduced in the early 1970s. In these, the beams of particles are caused to collide with their antiparticle counterparts moving in the opposite direction at the same speed. The total momentum of the colliding particles is therefore equal to zero, and their total energy is available to form the mass energy of the collision products. Colliding-beam experiments are known to have lower collision rates than their fixed target counterparts. However, the likelihood of collision is increased by using finely focused beams and by allowing particles to accumulate in storage rings before they are made to collide. New machines in high-energy physics are therefore based on a colliding-beam arrangement"

"perpetual motion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>perpetual motion</b><br><b>1</b> Perpetual motion of the first kind. Motion in which a mechanism, once started, would continue indefinitely to perform useful work without being supplied with energy from an outside source. Such a device would contravene the first law of <a href=""entry://thermodynamics"">thermodynamics</a> and is therefore not feasible. Many historical attempts, exercising great ingenuity, were constructed before the concept of energy and its conservation were understood. Some attempts have been made, since the first law of thermodynamics became generally accepted, by inventors seeking to establish loopholes in the laws of nature.
<br><b>2</b> Perpetual motion of the second kind. Motion in which a mechanism extracts heat from a source and converts all of it into some other form of energy. An example of such a mechanism would be a ship that utilized the internal energy of the oceans for propulsion. Such a device does not contravene the first law of thermodynamics but it does contravene the second law. In the case of the ship, the sea would have to be at a higher temperature than the ship to establish a useful flow of heat. This could not occur without an external energy source.
<br><b>3</b> Perpetual motion of the third kind. A form of motion that continues indefinitely but without doing any useful work. An example is the random molecular motion in a substance. This type postulates the complete elimination of friction. A mechanism consisting of frictionless bearings maintained in a vacuum could turn indefinitely, once started, without contravening the first or second laws of thermodynamics, provided it did no external work. Experience indicates that on the macroscopic scale such a condition cannot be achieved. On the microscopic scale, however, a superconducting ring of wire will apparently sustain a perpetual current flow without the application of an external force. This could be considered a form of perpetual motion of the third kind, if the energy required to cool the wire to superconducting temperatures is ignored."

"perturbation theory","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>perturbation theory</b><br>A method used in calculations in both classical physics (e.g. planetary orbits) and quantum mechanics (e.g. atomic structure), in which the system is divided into a part that is exactly calculable and a small term, which prevents the whole system from being exactly calculable. The technique of perturbation theory enables the effects of the small term to be calculated by an infinite series (which in general is an asymptotic series). Each term in the series is a ‘correction term’ to the solutions of the exactly calculable system. In classical physics, perturbation theory can be used for calculating planetary orbits. In quantum mechanics, it can be used to calculate the energy levels in molecules. In the many-body problem in quantum mechanics and in relativistic quantum field theory, the terms in perturbation theory may be represented pictorially by Feynman diagrams (see <a href=""entry://quantum electrodynamics"">quantum electrodynamics</a>)"

"pH scale","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>pH scale</b><br>A logarithmic scale for expressing the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. To a first approximation, the pH of a solution can be defined as -log<sub class=""ind"">10</sub><i>c</i>, where <i>c</i> is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per cubic decimetre. A neutral solution at 25°C has a hydrogen-ion concentration of 10<sup class=""expo"">-7</sup> mol dm<sup class=""expo"">-3</sup>, so the pH is 7. A pH below 7 indicates an acid solution; one above 7 indicates an alkaline solution. More accurately, the pH depends not on the concentration of hydrogen ions but on their <a href=""entry://activity"">activity</a>, which cannot be measured experimentally. For practical purposes, the pH scale is defined by using a hydrogen electrode in the solution of interest as one half of a cell, with a reference electrode (e.g. a calomel electrode) as the other half cell. The pH is then given by (<i>E</i> - <i>E</i><sub class=""ind"">R</sub>)<i>F</i>/2.303RT, where <i>E</i> is the e.m.f. of the cell, E<sub class=""ind"">R</sub> the standard electrode potential of the reference electrode, and <i>F</i> the Faraday constant. In practice, a glass electrode is more convenient than a hydrogen electrode.
<br>pH stands for ‘potential of hydrogen’. The scale was introduced by S. P. Sørensen in 1909"

"phlogiston theory","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>phlogiston theory</b><br>A former theory of combustion in which all flammable objects were supposed to contain a substance called <i>phlogiston</i> , which was released when the object burned. The existence of this hypothetical substance was proposed in 1669 by the German chemist Johann Becher (1635&ndash;81), who called it ‘combustible earth’ (<i>terra pinguis</i>: literally ‘fat earth’). For example, according to Becher, the conversion of wood to ashes by burning was explained on the assumption that the original wood consisted of ash and <i>terra pinguis</i>, which was released on burning. In the early 18th century Georg Stahl renamed the substance <i>phlogiston</i> (from the Greek for ‘burned’) and extended the theory to include the calcination (and corrosion) of metals. Thus, metals were thought to be composed of <i>calx</i> (a powdery residue) and phlogiston; when a metal was heated, phlogiston was set free and the calx remained. The process could be reversed by heating the metal over charcoal (a substance believed to be rich in phlogiston, because combustion almost totally consumed it). The calx would absorb the phlogiston released by the burning charcoal and become metallic again.
<br>The theory was finally demolished by Antoine <a href=""entry://Lavoisier"">Lavoisier</a>, who showed by careful experiments with reactions in closed containers that there was no <i>absolute</i> gain in mass &mdash; the gain in mass of the substance was matched by a corresponding loss in mass of the air used in combustion. After experiments with Priestley's dephlogisticated air, Lavoisier realized that this gas, which he named oxygen, was taken up to form a calx (now called an oxide). The role of oxygen in the new theory was almost exactly the opposite of phlogiston's role in the old. In combustion and corrosion phlogiston was released; in the modern theory, oxygen is taken up to form an oxide"
"phon","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>

<b>photoelectric cell</b><i>(photocell)</i>
<br>Any of several devices that produce an electric signal in response to exposure to electromagnetic radiation.

"photoelectric effect","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>photoelectric effect</b>
<br>The liberation of electrons (see <a href=""entry://photoelectron"">photoelectron</a>) from a substance exposed to electromagnetic radiation. The number of electrons emitted depends on the intensity of the radiation. The kinetic energy of the electrons emitted depends on the frequency of the radiation. The effect is a quantum process in which the radiation is regarded as a stream of <a href=""entry://photon"">photons</a>, each having an energy <i>hf</i>, where <i>h</i> is the Planck constant and <i>f</i> is the frequency of the radiation. A photon can only eject an electron if the photon energy exceeds the <a href=""entry://work function"">work function</a>, φ, of the solid, i.e. if <div class=""equ""><i>hf</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub> = φ</div> an electron will be ejected; <i>f</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub> is the minimum frequency (or <i>threshold frequency</i> ) at which ejection will occur. For many solids the photoelectric effect occurs at ultraviolet frequencies or above, but for some materials (having low work functions) it occurs with light. The maximum kinetic energy, <i>E</i><sub class=""ind"">m</sub>, of the photoelectron is given by <a href=""entry://Einstein, Albert"">Einstein's</a> equation: <div class=""equ""><i>E</i><sub class=""ind"">m</sub> = <i>hf</i> - φ</div> (see also <a href=""entry://photoionization"">photoionization</a>).
<br>Apart from the liberation of electrons from atoms, other phenomena are also referred to as photoelectric effects. These are the <i>photoconductive effect</i> and the <i>photovoltaic effect</i> . In the photoconductive effect, an increase in the electrical conductivity of a semiconductor is caused by radiation as a result of the excitation of additional free charge carriers by the incident photons. <i>Photoconductive cells</i> , using such photosensitive materials as cadmium sulphide, are widely used as radiation detectors and light switches (e.g. to switch on street lighting).
<br>In the photovoltaic effect, an e.m.f. is produced between two layers of different materials as a result of irradiation. The effect is made use of in <i>photovoltaic cells</i> , most of which consist of <i>p</i>&mdash;<i>n</i>
<a href=""entry://semiconductor"">semiconductor</a> junctions (see also <a href=""entry://photodiode"">photodiode</a>; <a href=""entry://phototransistor"">phototransistor</a>). When photons are absorbed near a <i>p</i>&mdash;<i>n</i> junction new free charge carriers are produced (as in photoconductivity); however, in the photovoltaic effect the electric field in the junction region causes the new charge carriers to move, creating a flow of current in an external circuit without the need for a battery.

<b>photoelectron spectroscopy</b><br>A technique for determining the <a href=""entry://ionization potential"">ionization potentials</a> of molecules.

The photoelectrons produced in accordance with <a href=""entry://Einstein, Albert"">Einstein's</a> equation are passed through a slit into a vacuum region, where they are deflected by magnetic or electrostatic fields to give an energy spectrum. The photoelectron spectrum obtained has peaks corresponding to the ionization potentials of the molecule (and hence the orbital energies). The technique also gives information on the vibrational energy levels of the ions formed. <i>ESCA</i> (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis) is a similar analytical technique in which a beam of X-rays is used. In this case, the electrons ejected are from the inner shells of the atoms. Peaks in the electron spectrum for a particular element show characteristic chemical shifts, which depend on the presence of other atoms in the molecule"

<b>photography</b><br>The process of forming a permanent record of an image on specially treated film or paper. In normal black-and-white photography a camera is used to expose a film or plate to a focused image of the scene for a specified time. The film or plate is coated with an emulsion containing silver salts and the exposure to light causes the silver salts to break down into silver atoms; where the light is bright dark areas of silver are formed on the film after development (by a mild reducing agent) and fixing. The negative so formed is printed, either by a contact process or by projection. In either case light passing through the negative film falls on a sheet of paper also coated with emulsion. Where the negative is dark, less light passes through and the resulting positive is light in this area, corresponding with a light area in the original scene.

"piezoelectric effect","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>piezoelectric effect</b><br>The generation of a potential difference across the opposite faces of certain nonconducting crystals (<i>piezoelectric crystals</i> ) as a result of the application of mechanical stress between these faces. The electric polarization (see <a href=""entry://dielectric"">dielectric</a>) produced is proportional to the stress and the direction of the polarization reverses if the stress changes from compression to tension. The <i>reverse piezoelectric effect</i> is the opposite phenomenon: if the opposite faces of a piezoelectric crystal are subjected to a potential difference, the crystal changes its shape. Rochelle salt and quartz are the most frequently used piezoelectric materials. While Rochelle salt produces the greater polarization for a given stress, quartz is more widely used as its crystals have greater strength and are stable at temperatures in excess of 100°C.
<br>If a quartz plate is subjected to an alternating electric field, the reverse piezoelectric effect causes it to expand and contract at the field frequency. If this field frequency is made to coincide with the natural elastic frequency of the crystal, the plate resonates; the direct piezoelectric effect then augments the applied electric field. This is the basis of the <a href=""entry://crystal"">crystal</a> oscillator and the <a href=""entry://quartz clock"">quartz clock</a>.

The filament is arranged to be part of a <a href=""entry://Wheatstone bridge"">Wheatstone bridge</a> circuit and the pressure is read from a microammeter calibrated in pressure units.

"pitch","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>pitch</b><b><i>(in physics)</i></b>
</div>
<br><b>1</b> The property of a sound that characterizes its highness or lowness to an observer. It is related to, but not identical with, frequency. Below about 1000 Hz the pitch is slightly higher than the frequency and above 1000 the position is reversed. The loudness of a sound also affects the pitch. Up to 1000 Hz an increase in loudness causes a decrease in pitch. From about 1000 to 3000 Hz the pitch is independent of loudness, while above 3000 Hz an increase in loudness seems to cause a raising of pitch. Pitch is usually measured in mels; a note of 1000 Hz frequency with a loudness of 40 decibels above the absolute threshold of hearing has a pitch of 1000 mels.

"Planck's radiation law","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Planck's radiation law</b><br>A law stated by Max Planck giving the distribution of energy radiated by a <a href=""entry://black body"">black body</a>. It introduced into physics the novel concept of energy as a quantity that is radiated by a body in small discrete packets rather than as a continuous emission. These small packets became known as quanta and the law formed the basis of <a href=""entry://quantum theory"">quantum theory</a>. The <i>Planck formula</i> gives the energy radiated per unit time at frequency <i>v</i> per unit frequency interval per unit solid angle into an infinitesimal cone from an element of the black-body surface that is of unit area in projection perpendicular to the cone's axis. The expression for this <i>monochromatic specific intensity</i>

For low frequencies <i>v</i> &lt;&lt; <i>kT</i>/<i>h</i> (equivalently, long wavelengths λ &gt;&gt; <i>hc</i>/<i>kT</i>) the <i>Rayleigh&mdash;Jeans formula</i> is valid: <div class=""equ"">I<sub class=""ind"">v</sub> = 2c<sup class=""expo"">-2</sup>v<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>kT</div>, or <div class=""equ"">Iλ = 2cλ<sup class=""expo"">-4</sup>kT.</div>Note that these expressions do not involve the Planck constant.

Sometimes described as the fourth state of matter, plasmas occur in interstellar space, in the atmospheres of stars (including the sun), in discharge tubes, and in experimental thermonuclear reactors.
<br>Because the particles in a plasma are charged, its behaviour differs in some respects from that of a gas.

<b>polarimeter</b><i>(polariscope)</i>
<br>An instrument used to determine the angle through which the plane of polarization of plane-polarized light is rotated on passing through an optically active substance. Essentially, a polarimeter consists of a light source, a <i>polarizer</i> (e.g. a sheet of Polaroid) for producing plane-polarized light, a transparent cell containing the sample, and an <i>analyser</i> . The analyser is a polarizing material that can be rotated. Light from the source is plane-polarized by the polarizer and passes through the sample, then through the analyser into the eye or onto a light-detector. The angle of polarization is determined by rotating the analyser until the maximum transmission of light occurs. The angle of rotation is read off a scale. Simple portable polarimeters are used for estimating the concentrations of sugar solutions in confectionary manufacture. See also <a href=""entry://photoelasticity"">photoelasticity</a>"

"polarization of light","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>polarization of light</b><br>The process of confining the vibrations of the electric vector of light waves to one direction. In unpolarized light the electric field vibrates in all directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. After reflection or transmission through certain substances (see <a href=""entry://Polaroid"">Polaroid</a>) the electric field is confined to one direction and the radiation is said to be <i>plane-polarized light</i> .

"Q-value","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Q-value</b><br>The total energy released in a <a href=""entry://decay"">decay</a> process. The <a href=""entry://binding energy"">binding energy</a> curve (see diagram 1) shows the fission of a nuclide A into its primary fission fragments B and C. B and C have greater binding energies per nucleon. The fragments gain stability (see <a href=""entry://nuclear stability"">nuclear stability</a>) because there is no change in the total number of nucleons. The effective increase in binding energy per nucleon corresponds to a release of stored potential energy, which subsequently appears as either the kinetic energy of the primary fragments or as gamma radiation. The Q-value of a decay process is therefore equal to the increase in binding energy of the decay products. For example, <sup class=""expo"">236</sup>U (uranium-236) undergoes a decay process in which two fission fragments are formed, <sup class=""expo"">146</sup>La (lanthanum-146) and <sup class=""expo"">87</sup>Br (bromine-87): <div class=""equ""><sup class=""expo"">236</sup>U →<sup class=""expo"">146</sup>La + <sup class=""expo"">87</sup>Br + 3 <sup class=""expo"">1</sup><sub class=""ind"">0</sub>n.</div> The total binding energy of the products is 1975.19 MeV, whereas the binding energy of the uranium nucleus is 1791.24 MeV. The increase in binding energy is therefore 183.95 MeV; the Q-value for this fission process is said to be 184 MeV. The possible existence of neutrino mass may lead to a modification of published Q-value tables of beta particle energies. As the energy spectrum for electrons emitted in beta decays is continous, the upper limit of the spectrum is the Q-value (see diagram 2). If an emitted electron were to carry away this maximum energy there would be no more energy to make up the mass of the neutrino, however small that may be. In 1985, a Russian team led by Lymbimov investigated the beta decay of tritium: <div class=""equ""><sup class=""expo"">3</sup>H →<sup class=""expo"">3</sup>He + e<sup class=""expo"">-</sup> + γ<sub class=""ind"">e</sub>.</div>They reported a nonzero neutrino mass calculated by measuring the shortfall in energy of the decay products. Lymbimov applied weak theory to obtain a relationship between a number of experimentally accessible variables. His team analysed their data by plotting these variables in a Curie plot, which according to theory should have yielded a straight line. The straight line predicted by theory would intersect the energy axis at the Q-value, suggesting a zero neutrino mass (see diagram 3). However, Lymbimov's data showed a small deviation from the expected line, and a value of the neutrino mass was calculated to be (26±5) eV/<i>c</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000114.jpg"" ></img><br></center><center class=""pic""><img src=""000136.jpg"" ></img><br></center><center class=""pic""><img src=""000090.jpg"" ></img><br>Q-value</center>"

"quantum mechanics","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>quantum mechanics</b><br>A system of mechanics based on <a href=""entry://quantum theory"">quantum theory</a>, which arose out of the failure of classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory to provide a consistent explanation of both <a href=""entry://electromagnetic wave"">electromagnetic waves</a> and atomic structure. Many phenomena at the atomic level puzzled physicists at the beginning of the 20th century because there seemed to be no way of explaining them without making use of incompatible concepts. One such phenomenon was the emission of <a href=""entry://electron"">electrons</a> from the surface of a metal illuminated by light. Einstein realized that the classical description of light as a wave on an electromagnetic field could not explain this <a href=""entry://photoelectric effect"">photoelectric effect</a>, as it is called. Experiments showed that electrons would be emitted only if the incident light was of a sufficiently short wavelength, while the intensity of the light appeared not to be relevant. It seemed not to make sense that small ripples of short wavelength could easily knock electrons out of the metal, but a huge tidal wave of long wavelength could not. In 1905 Einstein abandoned classical mechanics and sought an explanation of this photoelectric effect in Planck's work on thermal radiation (see <a href=""entry://Planck's radiation law"">Planck's radiation law</a>). In this work light energy is regarded as being imparted to matter in discrete packets rather than continuously, as one might expect from a wave. Einstein assumed that in the photoelectric effect, light behaves as a shower of particles, each with energy <i>E</i> given by Planck's expression:<div class=""equ""><i>E</i> = <i>hf</i></div>,where <i>f</i> is the light's frequency and <i>h</i> is the <a href=""entry://Planck constant"">Planck constant</a>. Each particle of light, which Einstein called a <a href=""entry://photon"">photon</a>, would impart its energy to a single electron in the metal. The electron would be liberated only if the photon could impart at least the required amount of energy. However many photons were falling on the surface of the metal, no electrons would be liberated unless individual photons had the required energy (<i>hf</i>) to break the attractive forces holding the electrons in the metal. This elegantly quantified reversion to Newton's corpuscular theory of light by Einstein was one of the milestones in the development of quantum mechanics.
<br>Further verification that light could indeed behave as a shower of particles came from the <a href=""entry://Compton effect"">Compton effect</a>. In Compton scattering, X-radiation is scattered off an electron in a manner that resembles a particle collision. The momentum imparted to the electron can be predicted by assuming that the X-ray possesses the momentum of a photon. An expression for photon momentum is suggested by the classical theory of radiation pressure. It is known that if energy is transported by an electromagnetic wave at a rate <i>W</i> joules per unit area per second, the wave exerts a radiation pressure <i>W</i>/<i>c</i>, where <i>c</i> is the speed of light. Planck's expression for the energy of photons therefore led to an equivalent expression for the momentum <i>p</i> of these photons:<div class=""equ""><i>p</i> = <i>h</i>/λ</div>, where λ is the wavelength of the light. Experimental studies of the Compton effect produce results in good agreement with this expression.
<br>Both the photoelectric effect and the Compton effect imply that light imparts energy and momentum to matter in the form of packets. It is as if energy and momentum are fundamental ‘currencies’ of physical interaction, and that these currencies exist in denominations that are all multiples of the Planck constant. These quantities are said to be ‘quantized’ and a packet of energy or momentum is called a <a href=""entry://quantum"">quantum</a>. Quantum mechanics is essentially concerned with the exchange of these quanta of energy and momentum. For more than a century before the birth of quantum mechanics, experiments had indicated that light behaves as a wave. The successful explanation of the photoelectric and Compton effects demonstrated that in some situations light interacts with matter as if it is a shower of particles. The principle that two models are required to explain the nature of light was called by Niels Bohr <a href=""entry://complementarity"">complementarity</a>. This principle was extended by the French aristocrat, Louis de Broglie, who suggested that particles of matter might also behave as waves in certain circumstances.
<br>Louis de Broglie received the Nobel Prize for this idea in 1929 after the successful measurement of the <a href=""entry://de Broglie wavelength"">de Broglie wavelength</a> of an electron in 1927 by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer, who had observed the <a href=""entry://diffraction"">diffraction</a> of electrons by single crystals of nickel. The behaviour of individual electrons seemed random and unpredictable, but when a large number had passed through the crystal a typical diffraction pattern emerged. This provided proof that the electron, which until then had been thought of simply as a particle of matter, could under the right circumstances exhibit wavelike properties. Classical mechanics and electromagnetism were based on two kinds of entity: matter and fields. In classical physics, matter consists of particles and waves are oscillations on a field. Quantum mechanics blurs the distinction between matter and field. Modern physicists are forced to concede that the universe is made up of entities that exhibit a <a href=""entry://wave-particle duality"">wave&mdash;particle duality</a>.
<br>A new representation of matter and field is needed to fully appreciate this wave&mdash;particle duality. In quantum mechanics, an electron is represented by a <a href=""entry://complex number"">complex number</a> called a <a href=""entry://wave"">wave</a> function that depends on time and space coordinates. The wave function behaves like a classical wave displacement on a medium (e.g. on a string), exhibiting wave behaviour, interference, diffraction, etc. However, unlike a classical wave displacement, the wave function is essentially a complex quantity. Since an electron's observable properties do not involve complex numbers, it follows that an electron's wave function cannot itself be identified with a single physical property of the electron. The diffraction of electrons observed by Davisson and Germer revealed that, although the behaviour of the individual electrons is random and unpredictable, when a large number have passed through the apparatus, a diffraction pattern is formed whose intensity distribution is proportional to the intensity of the associated wave function. The intensity of the wave function, Ψ, is the square of its <a href=""entry://absolute"">absolute</a> value |ψ|<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>. Therefore, although an electron's wave function itself has no physical significance, the square of its absolute value at a point turns out to be proportional to the probability of finding an electron at that point.
<br>The electron wave function must satisfy a wave equation based on the conservation of energy and momentum for the electron. There are two main ways of treating this wave equation: a classical or a relativistic treatment. The resulting wave equations are called <i>eigenvalue equations</i> because they have the same form as equations in a branch of mathematics called <i>eigenvalue problems</i> , i.e. <div class=""equ"">ω</img>Ψ= ω</img>Ψ</div>,where ω</img> is some mathematical operation (multiplication by some number, differentiation, etc.) on the wave function Ψ and ω</img>, called the <i>eigenvalue</i> in quantum mechanics, is always a real number. In such an equation the wave function is often called the <i>eigen function</i> . This form of treatment of quantum mechanics is known as <i>wave mechanics</i> (see also <a href=""entry://Schrödinger equation"">Schrödinger equation</a>).
<br>The energy <i>E</i> and momentum <i>p</i> of an electron are associated with the frequency <i>f</i> and wavelength λ of the electron's wave using the expressions <div class=""equ""><i>E</i> = <i>hf</i> and <i>p</i> = <i>h</i>/λ</div>. While the wave equation expresses the behaviour of the wavelike properties of a particle, it does not define the physical attributes it has as a particle. As a particle, the electron has an easily defined spatial and temporal position, not possessed by an oscillation of some kind of field, whose influence extends over a region of space and time. The incompatibility of these two views of the electron leads to the Heisenberg <a href=""entry://uncertainty principle"">uncertainty principle</a>. Heisenberg recognized that if matter had wavelike properties, the physical attributes normally associated with matter (position, momentum, kinetic energy, etc.) would have to be expressed in a statistical, rather than a deterministic, manner. This is illustrated by the electron diffraction patterns of Davisson and Germer. Individual electrons somehow fell onto the apparatus to form a pattern statistically consistent with the intensity of a wave function. It is as if the final wave function were made up of a superposition of all the possible positions that the electrons could fall onto, the waves of electrons constructively and destructively interfering to form the final diffraction pattern.
<br>It is known that a clever superposition of waves of different wavelengths can lead to a construction of a wave packet of finite extension (see <a href=""entry://Fourier analysis"">Fourier analysis</a>). However, to produce a packet that exists at a point of zero width requires an infinite number of waves to superimpose. Heisenberg realized that these packets of waves must account for the way in which matter particles, such as electrons, could retain some semblance of their particle-like qualities. However, this must also mean that there is an inherent uncertainty in position and momentum associated with electrons and indeed all particles of matter (see <a href=""entry://uncertainty principle"">uncertainty principle</a>). Since waves of different wavelength correspond to different possible momentum values of an electron, a superposition of such waves to form a particle at a point would correspond to an infinite uncertainty in the momentum of the electron. Therefore the more one knows about the position of an electron the less one will know about its momentum and vice versa. A similar uncertainty between the energy of the electron and its temporal position also exists. Quantities that are related by such an uncertainty principle are said to be <i>incompatible</i> .
<br>An alternative to the wave mechanical treatment of quantum mechanics is an equivalent formalism called <a href=""entry://matrix"">matrix</a> mechanics, which is based on mathematical operators.

This <i>cosmological redshift</i> is the explanation of the high observed redshifts of quasars favoured by most astronomers. (A few, however, maintain that the redshift could be a local Doppler effect, characteristic of movement relative to the earth and sun of nearby objects in the Galaxy, or a gravitational effect.) If the redshifts are cosmological, quasars are the most distant objects in the universe, some being up to 10<sup class=""expo"">10</sup> light-years away. The exact nature of quasars is unknown but it is believed that they are the nuclei of galaxies in which there is violent activity.

<br>A method of detecting the presence, position, and direction of motion of distant objects (such as ships and aircraft) by means of their ability to reflect a beam of electromagnetic radiation of centimetric wavelengths. It is also used for navigation and guidance. It consists of a transmitter producing radio-frequency radiation, often pulsed, which is fed to a movable aerial from which it is transmitted as a beam. If the beam is interrupted by a solid object, a part of the energy of the radiation is reflected back to the aerial. Signals received by the aerial are passed to the receiver, where they are amplified and detected. An echo from a reflection of a solid object is indicated by a sudden rise in the detector output.

<br>The becquerel (Bq), the SI unit of activity, is the activity of a radionuclide decaying at a rate, on average, of one spontaneous nuclear transition per second. Thus <div class=""equ"">1 Bq = 1 s<sup class=""expo"">-1</sup></div>. The former unit, the curie (Ci), is equal to 3.7 × 10<sup class=""expo"">10</sup> Bq. The curie was originally chosen to approximate the activity of 1 gram of radium-226.
<br>The gray (Gy), the SI unit of absorbed dose, is the absorbed dose when the energy per unit mass imparted to matter by ionizing radiation is 1 joule per kilogram. The former unit, the rad (rd), is equal to 10<sup class=""expo"">-2</sup> Gy.
<br>The sievert (Sv), the SI unit of dose equivalent, is the dose equivalent when the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation multiplied by the stipulated dimensionless factors is 1 J kg<sup class=""expo"">-1</sup>. As different types of radiation cause different effects in biological tissue a weighted absorbed dose, called the <i>dose equivalent</i> , is used in which the absorbed dose is modified by multiplying it by dimensionless factors stipulated by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. The former unit of dose equivalent, the rem (originally an acronym for roentgen equivalent <i>man</i> ), is equal to 10<sup class=""expo"">-2</sup> Sv.
<br>In SI units, exposure to ionizing radiation is expressed in coulombs per kilogram, the quantity of X- or gamma-radiation that produces ion pairs carrying 1 coulomb of charge of either sign in 1 kilogram of pure dry air. The former unit, the roentgen (R), is equal to 2.58 × 10<sup class=""expo"">-4</sup> C kg<sup class=""expo"">-1</sup>"

"radio telescope","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>radio telescope</b><br>An instrument for detecting and measuring electromagnetic radiation of radio frequencies that have passed through the <a href=""entry://radio window"">radio window</a> in the earth's atmosphere and reached the surface of the earth. There are a great diversity of <a href=""entry://radio source"">radio sources</a> within the universe and radio telescopes are required to detect both continuous emissions and specific spectral lines. They therefore require the highest possible angular resolution so that the details of radio sources can be studied and they should be able to pick up weak signals. The simplest radio telescope consists of a paraboloidal steerable-dish aerial together with ancillary amplifiers. The paraboloidal reflecting dish surface reflects the incoming signal to the principal focus of the reflector. At this point the radio-frequency signals are amplified up to 1000 times and converted to a lower, intermediate, frequency before transmission by cable to the control building. Here the intermediate frequency is amplified again and passed to the detector and display unit. As the radio waves arriving from the surface of the reflector at the focus must be in phase, the surface of the dish must be very accurately constructed; for example, a 100-metre-diameter dish must be accurate to the nearest millimetre, when receiving radiation of 1 cm wavelength. To overcome the problem of constructing large dishes to such a high accuracy, the technique of <i>radio inter ferometry</i> has been developed. In this technique an array of small aerials connected by cable is used to simulate a large dish aerial. In earth-rotation <i>aperture synthesis</i> , the individual positions and displacements of an array of only a few such small aerials can be made to simulate an enormous dish aerial as the earth rotates. All but the smallest steerable dishes are constructed from metal mesh so that wind can pass through them. A few very large fixed dishes have been built into the earth's surface"
"radio transmission","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>radio transmission</b><br>The transmission of radio waves from a transmitting aerial to a receiving aerial. The radiation may take several paths (see illustration). The sum of the line-of-sight ground wave, the reflected ground wave, and the surface wave is called the <i>ground wave</i> (or <i>tropospheric wave</i> ). <i>Sky waves</i> (or <i>ionospheric waves</i> ) are reflected by the ionosphere (see <a href=""entry://earth's atmosphere"">earth's atmosphere</a>) and enable long-distance transmissions to be made. The ionization of atoms and molecules in the ionosphere is caused largely by solar ultraviolet and X-radiation and therefore conditions differ between night and day. Ionization in the lower E-region of the ionosphere falls off at night in the absence of sunlight and ions and electrons tend to recombine. However, in the less dense (higher) F-region there are fewer collisions between ions and electrons and therefore fewer recombinations at night. The F-region is therefore a more effective reflector at night.
<br>The UHF and VHF waves used in television broadcasting penetrate the ionosphere with little reflection. Therefore TV broadcasts can only be made over long distances by means of artificial satellites.

"radioactive equilibrium","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>radioactive equilibrium</b><br>The equilibrium reached by a <a href=""entry://radioactive series"">radioactive series</a> in which the rate of decay of each nuclide is equal to its rate of production. It follows that all the rates of decay of the different nuclides within the sample are equal when radioactive equilibrium is achieved. For example, in the <i>uranium series</i> , uranium-238 decays to thorium-234. Initially the rate of production of thorium will exceed the rate at which it is decaying, and the thorium content of the sample will rise. As the amount of thorium increases, its activity increases; eventually a situation is reached in which the rate of production of thorium is equal to its rate of decay. The proportion of thorium in the sample will then remain constant. Thorium decays to produce protactinium-234; some time after the stabilization of the thorium content the protactinium content will also stabilize. When the whole radioactive series attains stabilization, the sample is said to be in radioactive equilibrium. There is a simple relationship between the numbers of nuclides of a specific type and their associated half-lives: <div class=""equ""><i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>/<i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> = <i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>/<i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub> = <i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">3</sub>/<i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">3</sub> = …</div>, where <i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>, <i>N</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>, … are the numbers of nuclides of type 1, 2, etc. <i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>, <i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>, … are their respective half-lives"

<b>radioactive waste</b><i>(nuclear waste)</i>
<br>Any solid, liquid, or gaseous waste material that contains <a href=""entry://radionuclide"">radionuclides</a>. These wastes are produced in the mining and processing of radioactive ores, the normal running of nuclear power stations and other reactors, the manufacture of nuclear weapons, and in hospitals and research laboratories. Because high-level radioactive wastes can be extremely dangerous to all living matter and because they may contain radionuclides having half-lives of many thousands of years, their disposal has to be controlled with great stringency.
<br>High-level waste (e.g. spent nuclear fuel) requires to be cooled artificially and is therefore stored for several decades by its producers before it can be disposed of. Intermediate-level waste (e.g. processing plant sludge and reactor components) is solidified, mixed with concrete, packed in steel drums, and stored in special sites at power stations before being buried in concrete chambers in deep mines or below the seabed. Low-level waste (e.g. solids or liquids lightly contaminated by radioactive substances) is disposed of in steel drums in special sites in concrete-lined trenches. In the UK, a company (Nirex Ltd) was set up by the nuclear industry and the government in 1988 to handle the disposal of nuclear waste. There are also nuclear reprocessing plants at Dounreay and Sellafield (Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant). Other countries have similar arrangements. Since 1983 no wastes have been disposed of in steel drums cast in concrete in the Atlantic deeps"

"radiography","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>radiography</b><br>The process or technique of producing images of an opaque object on photographic film or on a fluorescent screen by means of radiation (either particles or electromagnetic waves of short wavelength, such as X-rays and gamma-rays). The photograph produced is called a <i>radiograph</i> .
<br>In a medical radiograph part of a patient's body is exposed to X-rays so that a shadow image of that body part is produced on a film placed behind the body. The image is formed by the varying degrees of attenuation offered by the various media within the body. The degree of attenuation depends on three main factors:
<blockquote class=""blk"">1.&nbsp;The attenuating character of the medium. This is usually characterized by an <i>attenuation coefficient</i> .
<br> 2.&nbsp;The density of the medium.
<br> 3.&nbsp;The thickness of the structure.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Bone offers the greatest degree of attenuation, followed by soft tissue, and then pockets of air. Conventional radiography cannot easily distinguish between different types of soft tissue (e.g. liver and kidney tissues) owing to their similar attenuation characters and densities. Bone, however, is very easily distinguished from neighbouring soft tissue, such as muscle.
<br>If better contrast is required, a contrast medium, such as barium, can be used, which preferentially absorbs X-rays and enables otherwise difficult anatomical features to be observed. Kidney, arterial, and intestinal functions are examined by this method, using various contrast media.
<br>When an X-ray interacts with an atom in the medium, there are several possible mechanisms that may attenuate the X-ray. The attenuation mechanism that the X-ray undergoes depends on its energy. The main attenuation mechanisms are:
<br>Simple scattering: this occurs when the X-ray has insufficient energy to cause an ionization of the atom. The X-ray is simply deflected without significant change of energy.
<br>Photoelectric effect: the X-ray transfers all of its energy to an electron in the atom and therefore ionizes the atom (see <a href=""entry://photoelectric effect"">photoelectric effect</a>).
<br>Compton scattering: the high-energy X-ray collides with an electron, transferring both energy and momentum to it. The X-ray recoils with a loss of energy (see <a href=""entry://Compton effect"">Compton effect</a>).
<br>Pair production: this mechanism occurs at very high energies. Within the field of the interacting atomic nucleus, the X-ray spontaneously creates a positron&ndash;electron pair.
<br>The table below shows the thresholds for the various attenuation mechanisms and their variation with the atomic number <i>Z</i> of the medium material and the energy <i>E</i> of the X-ray.
<br>The optimum X-ray energy for diagnostic radiography is in the range of the photoelectric effect. At about 30 keV, the photoelectric effect dominates the attenuation of the X-radiation and leads to a better contrast between media of different atomic numbers. The Z<sup class=""expo"">3</sup> variation of the attenuation within the photoelectric-dominated regime means that the distinction between media of different <i>Z</i> is more pronounced.<center class=""pic"">
<table border=""1"" cellpadding=""2"" class=""tbl1"">
<tr><td>Mechanism</td><td>Variation of the attenuation with the energy (E) of the X-ray</td><td>Variation of the attenuation with the atomic number (Z) of the medium substance</td><td>Energy range in which this kind of attenuation is dominant</td></tr>
<tr><td>simple scattering</td><td>α 1/<i>E</i></td><td>α<i>Z</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup></td><td>1&ndash;20 keV</td></tr>

<tr><td>Compton scattering</td><td>falls gradually with <i>E</i></td><td>independent</td><td>30 keV &ndash; 20 MeV</td></tr>
<tr><td>pair production</td><td>rises slowly with <i>E</i></td><td>α<i>Z</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup></td><td>above 20 MeV</td></tr></table></center>
<br>Air has a higher average <i>Z</i> than soft tissue, which consists of mostly carbon (<sub class=""ind"">6</sub>C) and hydrogen (<sub class=""ind"">1</sub>H). However, the low average density of air means that it does not attenuate X-rays strongly. Barium, on the other hand, has an atomic number of 56, and thus attenuates very strongly, which is why it is used as a contrast medium in barium meals and barium enemas.
<br>Diagnostic radiography requires high-quality images of internal structures. This means that a high contrast and low blurring must be achieved. It is therefore important to prevent X-rays falling onto the film, which have scattered off many different parts of the body. This is made possible by the introduction of a grid between the patient and the film as shown in the diagram.
<br>The grid consists of narrow lead strips that allow passage of the main unabsorbed beam, but intercept randomly scattered X-rays. The entire grid is oscillated during the formation of the radiograph in order to prevent the formation of its own well-defined X-ray shadow. Before the X-ray beam interacts with the patient's body it is controlled by a diaphragm to limit the beam width. This gives a relatively well-defined beam that can be directed onto the desired area. Wide beams are undesirable because they generate unwanted scattering and deliver an unnecessarily high dose to the patient. Longer exposure at low beam intensity can, in principle, improve the contrast. However, blurring becomes more likely owing to the involuntary movements of the patient during the scan.
<br>A natural magnification of the subject structure occurs during an X-ray scan because the X-radiation source acts as a point source. The area of the X-ray shadow is greater than that occupied by the two-dimensional projection of the structure under examination. In practice the X-ray source is not a point and the image is surrounded by a penumbra, which constitutes a relatively blurred region. The more point-like the source, the smaller the penumbra on the image.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000018.jpg"" ></img><br>Radiography (medical)</center>"
"radioisotope","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>radioisotope</b><i>(radioactive isotope)</i>
<br>An isotope of an element that is radioactive. See <a href=""entry://labelling"">labelling</a>"
"radioisotope imaging","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>radioisotope imaging</b><br>The formation of images to provide information about the function of various organs in the body, using internally administered <a href=""entry://radioisotope"">radioisotopes</a> as a radiation source. The technique is widely used in medicine to locate tumours or cancers and to examine the flow patterns of body fluids.
<br>Alpha and beta radiation is not suitable for imaging procedures as they are both absorbed by tissue, subjecting healthy cells to an unnecessary dose of radiation. Gamma radiation, however, is not easily absorbed by tissue and can therefore be conveniently detected outside the body. The gamma radiation emitted from the area under examination is detected either by a <i>rectilinear scanner</i> or a <i>gamma camera</i> .
<br>In the rectilinear scanner, the radiation detector is mounted onto an armature that moves in straight lines as shown in the diagram. The intensity of the radiation from the radioisotope within the patient's body is picked up and transformed by electronics into a signal that controls the intensity of light produced by a light source. The light source mimics exactly the movement of the detector, enabling an image of the distribution of the radioisotope to be produced.
<br>In the gamma camera, the gamma radiation emitted from the radioisotope distributed in the patient's body is detected by a series of sodium iodide crystals set behind a collimator. The sodium iodide crystals produce a flash for each detected gamma ray. The light from the flash is amplified in photomultiplier tubes, which are arranged in an array to enable different tubes to correspond to different regions of the body under examination. Electronic circuits convert the output of the photomultiplier array into electrical potential differences, which are applied across the X and Y plates of a cathode-ray oscilloscope to form a two dimensional image of the distribution of the radioisotope.
<br>Nuclides are often injected into the patient in the form of a dissolved compound, or sometimes attached to antibodies. Pure gamma-emitters of energy 60&ndash;40 keV are usually chosen as radioisotopes for these procedures. The nuclide should also have a suitable half-life, typically a few hours, so that the overall radiation dose is kept to a minimum. However, the activity must remain high enough for a clinical examination to take place. It is also important that the nuclide and its carrier fluid are non-toxic and sterile. Two isotopes commonly used for this procedure are iodine-131 (<sup class=""expo"">131</sup>I) and technecium-99 (<sup class=""expo"">99</sup>Tc). <sup class=""expo"">131</sup>I is produced in a nuclear reactor, when neutrons are captured by tellurium (<sub class=""ind"">52</sub><sup class=""expo"">130</sup>Te). The isotope formed then decays by the emission of a beta particle into <sup class=""expo"">131</sup>I. The iodine is then separated chemically from the tellurium: <div class=""equ""><sub class=""ind"">52</sub><sup class=""expo"">130</sup>Te + <sub class=""ind"">0</sub><sup class=""expo"">1</sup>n →<sub class=""ind"">52</sub><sup class=""expo"">131</sup>Te →<sub class=""ind"">53</sub><sup class=""expo"">131</sup>I + <sub class=""ind"">-1</sub><sup class=""expo"">0</sup>ß.</div>
<br><sup class=""expo"">131</sup>I has a half-life of 8 days, and itself decays by beta emission, enabling it to be sometimes used to treat thyroid cancer (see <a href=""entry://radiology"">radiology</a>). However, it also emits a gamma ray of suitable energy for detection (360 keV): <div class=""equ""><sub class=""ind"">53</sub><sup class=""expo"">131</sup>I →<sub class=""ind"">54</sub><sup class=""expo"">131</sup>Xe + <sub class=""ind"">-1</sub><sup class=""expo"">0</sup>ß + <sub class=""ind"">0</sub><sup class=""expo"">0</sup>γ.</div>
<center class=""pic""><img src=""000029.jpg"" ></img><br>Radioisotope imaging</center>
<br>The 8-day half-life is ideal for clinical purposes. <sup class=""expo"">131</sup>I is commonly used for thyroid studies, since the thyroid gland readily takes up iodine from the bloodstream. <sup class=""expo"">99</sup>Tc used in the imaging procedure is a metastable state; that is, it is a nuclide remaining in an excited state over a long half-life. The metastable <sup class=""expo"">99</sup>Tc (usually labelled <sup class=""expo"">99</sup>Tc) decays to a ground state by gamma emission. The <sup class=""expo"">99</sup>Tc itself is a product of the beta decay of a molybdenum radionuclide: <div class=""equ""><sub class=""ind"">43</sub><sup class=""expo"">99</sup>Tc →<sub class=""ind"">43</sub><sup class=""expo"">99</sup>Te + <sub class=""ind"">0</sub><sup class=""expo"">0</sup>γ</div>
<br>The second process in this chain has a half-life of 6 hours, which is ideal for relatively short clinical studies. The gamma ray emission is also at an energy of 160 keV, which is easily detectable. No harmful beta particles are produced.
<br><sup class=""expo"">99</sup>Tc is obtained from a device, sometimes called a ‘Mo-cow’ or ‘molybdenum cow’, on account of the way in which the isotope is produced and tapped off the apparatus. The device operates by elution of a specially prepared column of ammonium molybdenate. The molybdenum in this column is originally obtained from the fission of uranium in a nuclear reactor. The metastable technetium occurs in the column in the form of a pertechnate ion, which can be exchanged with chloride ions when sodium chloride solution is passed through the column. In this way pertechnate ions are removed from the column, leaving behind the molybdate that has not yet decayed. The fluid that one ‘milks’ from this apparatus is sterile and compatible with blood. <sup class=""expo"">99</sup>Tc has many applications in imaging the brain or tumours, which have rich or poor blood supplies"

<br>Ionizing radiation kills cells indiscriminately. Therefore when a cancerous tumour is irradiated, the radiation will kill a number of normal tissue cells in the vicinity of the tumour. Since high doses are usually required to kill tumours, steps must be taken to limit the damage to normal tissue. This is achieved by a method called <i>fractionation</i> , in which the necessary radiation dose is divided into a number of small fractions administered over a period. This allows the normal tissue partially to recover between treatments. Since, in some cases, cancer cells are more vulnerable to radiation than normal cells, normal tissue recovery is more rapid, enabling fractionation to increase the ability of the patient to tolerate the therapy.
<br>A radiation dose may be administered to the patient either from outside the body or inside the body. <i>Teletherapy</i> is the use of radiation beams external to the body, and <i>brachytherapy</i> is the use of small-volume sealed radionuclide sources implanted near the tumour"

<b>refrigeration</b><br>The process of cooling a substance and of maintaining it at a temperature below that of its surroundings. In the domestic refrigerator a cycle of operations equivalent to those of a <a href=""entry://heat pump"">heat pump</a> is used.
<br><b><span class=""uCase""><i>The vapour-compression cycle</b></i></span>
<br>In this cycle (see illustration) a volatile liquid refrigerant, such as a fluorocarbon, is pumped through the cooling coils of the evaporator to the ice-making compartment of the refrigerator. Inside these coils the refrigerant evaporates, taking the latent heat required to effect the change of state from the inside of the ice-making compartment, causing the temperature in this compartment to fall. The vapour is then passed to an electrically driven compressor before entering the condenser, where the high-pressure gas is converted back to a liquid. The heat produced by this second change of state is given out, usually at the back of the refrigerator, to the room in which the refrigerator stands. The liquid refrigerant then enters a storage vessel before finally passing through an expansion valve to reduce its pressure prior to beginning the cycle again in the evaparator. This cycle is repeated over and over again until the temperature reaches the desired level (about 1&ndash;2°C in the food chamber of a domestic refrigerator and minus 15&ndash;18°C in the deep-freeze compartment). The compressor is then switched off, and on again later, by a thermostat to maintain a steady temperature. In order to transfer heat from the cold interior to the warm surroundings without contravening the second law of thermodynamics energy has to be supplied to the cycle by the electric current that drives the compressor. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000145.jpg"" ></img><br>Vapour-compression cycle</center>
<br><b><span class=""uCase""><i>The vapour-absorption cycle</b></i></span>
<br>In this cycle there are no moving parts and energy is supplied as heat either by an electric heater or a gas burner. The refrigerant is usually ammonia, which is liberated from a water solution and moved through the evaporator by a stream of hydrogen gas under pressure. Heat is applied to the generator, raising the ammonia and water vapour to the separator; the ammonia separates from the water and passes to the condenser, where it cools and liquefies, giving off its latent heat to the surroundings. The liquid ammonia is then mixed with hydrogen gas, which carries it through the evaporator and helps in the process of evaporation. Subsequently the hydrogen and ammonia vapour enter the absorber, where the water returned from the separator dissolves the ammonia before returning to the generator.

"relativity","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>relativity</b><br>Two widely accepted theories proposed by Albert <a href=""entry://Einstein"">Einstein</a> to account for departures from Newtonian mechanics. The <i>special theory</i> , of 1905, refers to non-accelerated frames of reference, while the <i>general theory</i> , of 1915, extends to accelerated systems.
<br><i>The special theory</i> . For Galileo and Newton, all uniformly moving frames of reference (Galilean frames) are equivalent for describing the dynamics of moving bodies. There is no experiment in dynamics that can distinguish between a stationary laboratory and a laboratory that is moving at uniform velocity. Einstein's special theory of relativity takes this notion of equivalent frames one step further: he required all physical phenomena, not only those of dynamics, to be independent of the uniform motion of the laboratory.
<br>When Einstein published his special theory, he realized that it could explain the apparent lack of experimental evidence for an ether, which was supposed to be the medium required for the propagation of electromagnetic waves (see <a href=""entry://Michelson-Morley experiment"">Michelson-Morley experiment</a>). Einstein recognized that the existence of an ether would render invalid any equivalent relativity principle for electromagnetic phenomena; i.e. uniform movement of the laboratory through the ether would lead to measurable differences in the propagation of electromagnetic waves <i>in vacuo</i>. Since no experimental evidence of the ether was forthcoming, Einstein was encouraged to continue his search for a relativity principle that encompassed all physical phenomena. Since light is a physical phenomenon, its propagation <i>in vacuo</i> could not be used to distinguish between uniformly moving frames of reference. Therefore in all such frames the measured speed of light <i>in vacuo</i> must be the same.
<br>This conclusion has some important consequences for the nature of space and time. In his popular exposition of 1916, Einstein illustrated these consequences with thought experiments. In one such experiment, he invites the reader to imagine a very long train travelling along an embankment with a constant velocity v in a given direction (see diagram). <center class=""pic""><img src=""000167.jpg"" ></img><br>Einstein's thought experiment</center>
<br>Observers on the train use it as a rigid reference body, regarding all events with reference to the train. Einstein posed a simple question: Are two events, which are simultaneous relative to the railway embankment, also simultaneous relative to the observer on the train? For example, two lightning strokes strike the embankment at points <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> simultaneously with respect to the embankment, so that an observer at <i>M</i> (the mid-point of the line <i>AB</i>) will record no time lapse between them. However, the events <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> also correspond to positions <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> on the train. <i>M'</i> is the mid-point of the distance <i>AB</i> on the moving train. When the flashes occur, from the point of view of the embankment, <i>M'</i> coincides with <i>M</i>. However, <i>M</i> moves with speed v towards the right and therefore hastens towards the beam of light coming from <i>B</i>, while moving on ahead of the beam from <i>A</i>. The observer at <i>M'</i> would not agree with the observer at <i>M</i> on the simultaneity of the events <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> because the beam of light from <i>B</i> will be seen to be emitted before the beam of light at <i>A</i>.
<br>At first sight there may seem to be a problem here. If the observer at <i>M</i>' is ‘hastening towards the beam of light from <i>B</i>’, is this not equivalent to saying that the beam of light is travelling towards <i>M</i>' at a combined speed of v + <i>c</i>, where <i>c</i> is the speed of light <i>in vacuo</i>?
<br>The resolution of this problem is the basis of special relativity. According to Einstein, the moving observer at <i>M'</i> must measure the speed of light <i>in vacuo</i> to be <i>c</i>, since there can be no experiment that distinguishes the train's moving frame from any other Galilean frame. It is therefore the concept of time measurement that requires revision; that is, the time required for a particular event to occur with respect to the train cannot have the same duration as the same event when judged from the embankment.
<br>This remarkable result also has implications for the measurement of spatial intervals. The measurement of a spatial interval requires the time coincidence of two points along a measuring rod. The relativity of simultaneity means that one cannot contend that an observer who traverses a distance <i>x</i> m per second in the train, traverses the same distance <i>x</i> m also with respect to the embankment in each second. In trying to include the law of propagation of light into a relativity principle, Einstein questioned the way in which measurements of space and time in different Galilean frames are compared. Place and time measurements in two different Galilean frames must be related by a transformation preserving the relativity principle that every ray of light has a velocity of transmission <i>c</i> relative to observers in both frames.
<br>Transformations that preserve the relativity principle are called <a href=""entry://Lorentz transformations"">Lorentz transformations</a>. The form of these transformations looks complicated at first (see diagram). However, they arise from the simple requirement that there can be no experiment in dynamics or electromagnetism that will distinguish between two different Galilean frames of reference.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000098.jpg"" ></img><br>Lorentz transformations</center>
<br>These transformations suggest that observers in the two frames will not agree on measurements of length made in the <i>y</i>-direction. Indeed, the duration of intervals of time cannot be agreed upon in the two frames. This is exactly what was suggested in Einstein's thought experiment on the train. Simple manipulations lead to the following formulae, which relate lengths and time intervals in the <i>x'</i>, <i>y'</i>, <i>z'</i> frame to their equivalent quantities in the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> frame: <div class=""equ"">Δl = Δl'(1-v<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/c<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>)<sup class=""expo"">½</sup></div>and <div class=""equ"">Δt = Δt'(1-v<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>/c<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>)<sup class=""expo"">½</sup></div>where Δl and Δt are respectively intervals in space and time. Motion therefore leads to a length contraction of the <i>x'</i>, <i>y'</i>, <i>z'</i> lengths with respect to the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> lengths. Similarly, the equation relating the time intervals in the two frames leads to a time dilation in the <i>x'</i>, <i>y'</i>, <i>z'</i> system compared to the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> system. From these expressions it is clear that the velocity <i>c</i> plays the part of a limiting velocity, which can neither be reached nor exceeded by any material body.
<br>The velocity <i>c</i> is often said to be the limiting velocity for the transfer of information in the universe. Faster-than-light signals violate <a href=""entry://causality"">causality</a> when taken to their logical conclusions. The universe, therefore, according to the special theory of relativity, updates itself at the maximum speed of light <i>c</i>; that is, any local changes in the properties within a region of space are not communicated to the rest of the universe instantaneously. Rather, the universe is updated through a wave of reality, which emanates at speed <i>c</i> from the region in which the change took place.
<br><i>The general theory</i> . In his special theory, Einstein updated the Galilean principle of relativity by including electromagnetic phenomena. Galileo, and later Newton, were well aware that no experiment in the dynamics of moving bodies could distinguish between frames of reference moving relative to each other at constant velocity (Galilean frames). If two Galilean frames move with respect to each other at uniform velocity, no experiment could determine which frame was in absolute motion and which frame was at absolute rest.
<br>This is the basic principle of Einstein's special theory of relativity. However, Einstein was not content with the apparent absolute status conferred to accelerating frames by the behaviour of bodies within them. Einstein sought a general principle of relativity that would require all frames of reference, whatever their relative state of motion, to be equivalent for the formulation of the general laws of nature. In his popular exposition of 1916, Einstein explains this by describing the experiences of an observer within a railway carriage that is decelerating. In his own words:
<br>“At all events it is clear that the Galilean law does not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of this, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the general principle of relativity.”
<br>Once again it was one of Galileo's observations that provided the starting point for the formulation of Einstein's ideas. Galileo observed that bodies moving under the sole influence of a <a href=""entry://gravitational field"">gravitational field</a> acquire an acceleration that does not depend upon the material or the physical state of the body. Einstein realized that this property of gravitational fields implied equivalence between gravity and accelerating frames of reference. This equivalence, which became the basis of his general theory of relativity, is well illustrated by one of Einstein's thought experiments. Imagine an elevator, so far removed from stars and other large masses that there is no appreciable gravitational field. An observer inside the elevator is equipped with the appropriate apparatus and uses the elevator as a reference frame. Initially, if the elevator is a Galilean frame, the observer would feel weightless with only inferences from decorations inside the elevator to distinguish between ‘up’ and ‘down’. However, if a rope attached to the top of the elevator were to be pulled with a constant acceleration of 9.81 ms<sup class=""expo"">-2</sup>, the observer would detect this acceleration as a force reaction on the floor of the elevator. The experiences of the observer in the elevator are equivalent to the experiences of an observer in an elevator in the earth's gravitational field of strength 9.81 N kg<sup class=""expo"">-1</sup>. Moreover, the force reaction at the feet of the observer in the accelerating frame is due to the observer's inertial <a href=""entry://mass"">mass</a> (the mass that represents the reluctance of the observer's body to accelerate under the influence of a force).
<br>An observer in the earth-bound elevator would feel the same force reaction at the floor of the elevator, but for this observer the force is due to the influence of the earth's gravitational field on the observer's gravitational mass. Guided by this example, Einstein realized that his extension of the principle of relativity to include accelerations implies the equality of inertial and gravitational mass, which had been established experimentally by Roland Eötvös (1848&ndash;1919) in 1888.
<br>These considerations have significant implications for the nature of space and time under the influence of a gravitational field. Another of Einstein's thought experiments illustrates these implications. Imagine a Galilean frame of reference <i>K</i> from which an observer <i>A</i> takes measurements of a non-Galilean frame <i>K</i>', which is a rotating disc inhabited by an observer <i>B</i>. <i>A</i> notes that <i>B</i> is in circular motion and experiences a centrifugal acceleration. This acceleration is produced by a force, which may be interpreted as an effect of <i>B</i>'s inertial mass. However, on the basis of the general principle of relativity, <i>B</i> may contend that he is actually at rest but under the influence of a radially directed gravitational field.
<br>A comparison of time-measuring devices placed at the centre and edge of the rotating disc would show a remarkable result. For although the devices would both be at rest with respect to <i>K</i>', the motion of the disc with respect to <i>K</i> would lead to a <a href=""entry://time"">time</a> dilation at the edge with respect to measured time at the centre. It follows that the clock at the disc's periphery runs at a permanently slower rate than that at the centre, i.e. as observed from <i>K</i>. The same effect would be noted by an observer who is sitting next to the clock at the centre of the disc. Thus, on the disc, or indeed in any gravitational field, a timing device will run at different rates depending on where it is situated.
<br>The measurement of spatial intervals on the rotating disc will also incur a similar lack of definition. Standard measuring rods placed tangentially around the circumference <i>C</i> of the disc will all be contracted in length due to relativistic length contraction with respect to <i>K</i>. However, measuring rods will not experience shortening in length, as judged from <i>K</i>, if they are applied across a diameter <i>D</i>. Dividing the circumference by the diameter would produce a surprising result from <i>K</i>'s point of view. Normally such a quotient would have the value <div class=""equ"">π</img> = 3.14159…</div>, but in this situation the quotient is larger. Euclidean geometry does not seem to hold in an accelerating frame, or indeed by the principle of relativity, within a gravitational field. Spaces in which the propositions of Euclid are not valid are sometimes called curved spaces. For example, the sum of the internal angles of a triangle drawn on a flat sheet of paper will be 180°; however, a triangle drawn on the curved surface of a sphere will not follow this Euclidean rule.
<br>Einstein fully expected to see this effect in gravitational fields, such was his belief in the general principle of relativity. In fact, it was the effect gravitational fields have on the propagation of light that was heralded as the major verification of his general relativity. Einstein realized that rays of light would be perceived as curving in an accelerating frame. This led him to conclude that, in general, rays of light are propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. By means of photographs taken of stars during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919, the existence of the deflection of starlight around the sun's mass was confirmed.
<br>The mathematics required to describe the curvature of space in the presence of gravitational fields existed before Einstein had need for it, but it was essentially rediscovered by Einstein to solve his general relativistic problems. In general relativity, material bodies follow lines of shortest distance, called <i>geodesics</i> . The line formed by stretching an elastic band over a curved surface would be a geodesic on the curved surface. Light follows geodesics called <i>null-geodesics</i> . The motions of material bodies are therefore determined by the curvature of the space in the region through which they pass. However, it is the mass of the bodies that causes the curvature of the space in the first place, which demonstrates the elegant selfconsistency of Einstein's general theory"

"resolving power","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>resolving power</b><br>A measure of the ability of an optical instrument to form separable images of close objects or to separate close wavelengths of radiation. The <i>chromatic resolving power</i> for any spectroscopic instrument is equal to λ/δλ, where δλ is the difference in wavelength of two equally strong spectral lines that can barely be separated by the instrument and λ is the average wavelength of these two lines. For a telescope forming images of stars the <i>angular resolving power</i> is the smallest angular separation of the images; the <i>linear resolving power</i> is the linear separation of the images in the focal plane. In a telescope forming images of two stars, as a result of diffraction by the lens aperture each image consists of a bright central blob surrounded by light and dark rings. According to the <i>Rayleigh criterion</i> for resolution, the central ring of one image should fall on the first dark ring of the other. The angular resolving power in radians is then 1.22λ/<i>d</i>, where <i>d</i> is the diameter of the objective lens in centimetres and λ is the wavelength of the light (usually taken as 560 nanometres). For microscopes, the resolving power is usually taken as the minimum distance between two points that can be separated. In both cases, the smaller the resolving power, the better the resolution; to avoid this apparent paradox the resolving power is now sometimes taken as the reciprocals of the quantities stated above"

The <a href=""entry://specific charge"">specific charge</a> of alpha particles was determined soon after their discovery. It was found to be the same as that of a doubly ionized helium atom (helium nucleus). Rutherford and Royd's apparatus (see diagram) was designed to allow alpha particles, which were products of a radon-gas decay, to pass a thin glass partition into a partially evacuated chamber X. Alpha particles trapped in X were then able to acquire electrons either by ionization of some traces of air or by collisions with glass. The apparatus was left for about a week before the gas trapped in X was analysed. Electrical discharge through the gas produced the characteristic spectrum of helium. Alpha particles were therefore confirmed to be helium nuclei. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000003.jpg"" ></img><br>Rutherford and Royd's apparatus</center>"
"Rutherford scattering","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Rutherford scattering</b><br>The scattering of <a href=""entry://alpha particle"">alpha particles</a> by thin films of heavy metals, notably gold. The experiments, performed in 1909 by Geiger and Marsden under Ernest Rutherford's direction, provided evidence for the hypothesis that atoms possessed a discrete nucleus. In Rutherford's apparatus, a narrow beam of alpha particles from a radon source (see diagram) fell upon a thin metal foil. A glass screen coated with zinc sulphide (which scintillates on absorbing alpha particles) was placed at the end of a travelling microscope and was used to detect scattered alpha particles. The travelling microscope could be rotated about the metal foil, and by counting the number of scintillations produced in various positions during equal intervals, the angular dependence of the scattering could be determined. Since the range of alpha particles in air is limited, the central chamber of the apparatus was evacuated. The majority of alpha particles suffered only small angles of deflection (θ</img>). However, a very small number, about 1 in 8000, were deviated by more than 90°.
<br>These findings led Rutherford to postulate that alpha particles deflected by angles greater than 90° had encountered a small intense positive charge of high inertia. Rutherford went on to propose in 1911 that an atom has a positively charged core or nucleus, which contains most of the mass of the atom and which is surrounded by orbiting electrons (see <a href=""entry://Bohr theory"">Bohr theory</a>). Since very few alpha particles were scattered through large angles, it follows that the probability of a head-on collision with the nucleus is small. The nucleus therefore occupies a very small proportion of the atom's total volume. The nucleus of an atom is of the order of 10<sup class=""expo"">-15</sup> m across, whereas the atomic radius is of the order of 10<sup class=""expo"">-10</sup> m, a factor of 100 000.

"Schrödinger's cat","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Schrödinger's cat</b><br>A thought experiment introduced by Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 to illustrate the paradox in <a href=""entry://quantum mechanics"">quantum mechanics</a> regarding the probability of finding, say, a subatomic particle at a specific point in space. According to Niels <a href=""entry://Bohr"">Bohr</a>, the position of such a particle remains indeterminate until it has been observed. Schrödinger postulated a sealed vessel containing a live cat and a device triggered by a quantum event, such as the radioactive decay of a nucleus. If the quantum event occurs, cyanide is released and the cat dies; if the event does not occur the cat lives. Schrödinger argued that Bohr's interpretation of events in quantum mechanics means that the cat could only be said to be alive or dead when the vessel has been opened and the situation inside it had been observed. This paradox has been extensively discussed since its introduction with many proposals made to resolve it.
<br><i>Wigner's friend</i> is a variation of the Schrödinger's cat paradox in which a friend of the physicist Eugene Wigner (1902&ndash;95) is the first to look inside the vessel. The friend will either find a live or dead cat. However, if Professor Wigner has both the vessel with the cat and the friend in a closed room, the state of mind of the friend (happy if there is a live cat but sad if there is a dead cat) cannot be determined in Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics until the professor has looked into the room although the friend has already looked at the cat. These paradoxes indicate the absurdity of the overstated roles of measurement and observation in Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics"

"Segrè plot","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Segrè plot</b><br>A plot of <a href=""entry://neutron number"">neutron number</a> (<i>N</i>) against <a href=""entry://atomic number"">atomic number</a> (<i>Z</i>) for all stable nuclides. The stability of nuclei can be understood qualitatively on the basis of the nature of the strong interaction (see <a href=""entry://fundamental interactions"">fundamental interactions</a>) and the competition between this attractive force and the repulsive electrical force. The strong interaction is independent of electric charge, i.e. at any given separation the strong force between two neutrons is the same as that between two protons or between a proton or a neutron. Therefore, in the absence of the electrical repulsion between protons, the most stable nuclei would be those having equal numbers of neutrons and protons. The electrical repulsion shifts the balance to favour a greater number of neutrons, but a nucleus with too many neutrons is unstable, because not enough of them are paired with protons.
<br>As the number of nucleons increases, the total energy of the electrical interaction increases faster than that of the nuclear interaction. The (positive, repulsive) electric potential energy of the nucleus increases approximately as <i>Z</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup>, while the (negative, attractive) nuclear potential energy increases approximately as <i>N</i> + <i>Z</i> with corrections for pairing effects. For large <i>N</i> + <i>Z</i> values, the electrical potential energy per nucleon grows much faster than the nuclear potential energy per nucleon, until a point is reached where the formation of a stable nucleus is impossible. The competition between the electric and nuclear forces therefore accounts for the increase with <i>Z</i> of the neutron&ndash;proton ratio in stable nuclei as well as the existence of maximum values for <i>N</i> + <i>Z</i> for stability. The plot is named after Emilio Segrè (1905&ndash;89).

<b>seismic waves</b>
<br>Vibrations propagated within the earth or along its surface as a result of an <a href=""entry://earthquake"">earthquake</a> or explosion. Earthquakes generate two types of body waves that travel within the earth and two types of surface wave. The body waves consist of primary (or longitudinal) waves that impart a back-and-forth motion to rock particles along their path. They travel at speeds between 6 km per second in surface rock and 10.4 km per second near the earth's core. Secondary (or transverse or shear) waves cause rock particles to move back and forth perpendicularly to their direction of propagation. They travel at between 3.4km per second in surface rock and 7.2km per second near the core.
<br>The surface waves consist of Rayleigh waves (after Lord <a href=""entry://Rayleigh"">Rayleigh</a>, who predicted them) and Love waves (after A. E. Love). The Love waves displace particles perpendicularly to the direction of propagation and have no longitudinal or vertical components.

In the photoconductive selenium cell an external e.m.f. must be applied; as the selenium changes its resistance on exposure to light, the current produced is a measure of the light energy falling on the selenium. In the photovoltaic selenium cell, the e.m.f. is generated within the cell. In this type of cell, a thin film of vitreous or metallic selenium is applied to a metal surface, a transparent film of another metal, usually gold or platinum, being placed over the selenium. Both types of cell are used as light meters in photography"

"semiclassical approximation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>semiclassical approximation</b><br>An approximation technique used to calculate quantities in quantum mechanics.

The semiclassical approximation is also known as the <i>Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation</i> (<i>WKB approximation</i> ), named after its inventors Gregor Wentzel (1898&ndash;1978), Hendrik Anton Kramers (1894&ndash;1952), and Léon Brillouin (1889&ndash;1969), who invented it independently in 1926.

"semiconductor","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>semiconductor</b><br>A crystalline solid, such as silicon or germanium, with an electrical conductivity (typically 10<sup class=""expo"">5</sup>&ndash;10<sup class=""expo"">-7</sup> siemens per metre) intermediate between that of a conductor (up to 10<sup class=""expo"">9</sup> S m<sup class=""expo"">-1</sup>) and an insulator (as low as 10<sup class=""expo"">-15</sup> S m<sup class=""expo"">-1</sup>). As the atoms in a crystalline solid are close together, the orbitals of their electrons overlap and their individual <a href=""entry://energy level"">energy levels</a> are spread out into <a href=""entry://energy band"">energy bands</a>. Conduction occurs in semiconductors as the result of a net movement, under the influence of an electric field, of electrons in the conduction band and empty states, called <i>holes</i> , in the valence band. A hole behaves as if it was an electron with a positive charge. Electrons and holes are known as the <i>charge carriers</i> in a semiconductor. The type of charge carrier that predominates in a particular region or material is called the <i>majority carrier</i> and that with the lower concentration is the <i>minority carrier</i> . An <i>intrinsic semiconductor</i> is one in which the concentration of charge carriers is a characteristic of the material itself; electrons jump to the conduction band from the valence band as a result of thermal excitation, each electron that makes the jump leaving behind a hole in the valence band. Therefore, in an intrinsic semiconductor the charge carriers are equally divided between electrons and holes. In <i>extrinsic semiconductors</i> the type of conduction that predominates depends on the number and valence of the impurity atoms present. Germanium and silicon atoms have a valence of four. If impurity atoms with a valence of five, such as arsenic, antimony, or phosphorus, are added to the lattice, there will be an extra electron per atom available for conduction, i.e. one that is not required to pair with the four valence electrons of the germanium or silicon. Thus extrinsic semiconductors doped with atoms of valence five give rise to crystals with electrons as majority carriers, the so-called <i><span class=""italic"">n</i>-type conductors</span> . Similarly, if the impurity atoms have a valence of three, such as boron, aluminium, indium, or gallium, one hole per atom is created by an unsatisfied bond. The majority carriers are therefore holes, i.e. <i><span class=""italic"">p</i>-type conductors</span> .
<br>Semiconductor devices have virtually replaced thermionic devices, because they are several orders of magnitude smaller, cheaper in energy consumption, and more reliable. The basic structure for electronic semiconductor devices is the <i>semiconductor diode</i> (see also <a href=""entry://transistor"">transistor</a>). This consists of a silicon crystal doped in such a way that half is <i>p</i>-type and half is <i>n</i>-type. At the junction between the two halves there is a depletion layer in which electrons from the <i>n</i>-type have filled holes from the <i>p</i>-type. This sets up a potential barrier, which tends to keep the remaining electrons in the n-region and the remaining holes in the <i>p</i>-region. However, if the <i>p</i>-region is biased with a positive potential, the height of the barrier is reduced; the diode is said to be forward biased, because the majority holes in the <i>p</i>-region can then flow to the <i>n</i>-region and majority electrons in the <i>n</i>-region flow to the <i>p</i>-region. When forward biased there is a good current flow across the barrier. On the other hand if the <i>p</i>-region is negatively biased, the height of the potential barrier is increased and there is only a small leakage current of minority electrons from the <i>p</i>-region able to flow to the <i>n</i>-region. Thus the <i>p</i>&ndash;<i>n</i> junction acts as an efficient rectifier, for which purpose it is widely used"

<b>sextant</b>
<br>An instrument used in navigation to measure the altitude of a celestial body. Originally it had an arc of 60° (one sixth of a circle, hence its name) but modern instruments have various angles. The sextant uses two mirrors: the horizon glass, in which only the lower half is silvered, and the index mirror, which can be rotated about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the instrument (see illustration). An arm attached to the index glass sweeps round the calibrated arc, from which angles are read. The instrument is aimed at the horizon and the index mirror rotated until the celestial object can also be seen through the telescope. After careful adjustment to make the image of the celestial body just touch the horizon, the angle is read off the graduated scale. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000026.jpg"" ></img><br>A sextant</center>"

<b>skip distance</b>
<br>The minimum distance from the transmitter of a radio wave at which reception is possible by means of a sky wave (see <a href=""entry://radio transmission"">radio transmission</a>). If a radio wave strikes the ionosphere at a small angle of incidence the wave passes through it and is not reflected. There is therefore a minimum angle of incidence at which reflection occurs for a given frequency. This leads to a region around a transmitter in which sky waves cannot be received. As the frequency of the transmission increases the minimum angle of incidence at which ionospheric reflection occurs becomes greater. Above about 4 megahertz there may be a region of several hundred kilometres around a transmitter, which is within the skip distance and in which ground waves are too attenuated to be effectively received. In this region no reception is possible"

<b>solar cell</b><br>An electric cell that uses the sun's radiation to produce usable electric current. Most solar cells consist of a single-crystal silicon <i>p</i>&ndash;<i>n</i> junction. When photons of light energy from the sun fall on or near the <a href=""entry://semiconductor"">semiconductor</a> junction the electron&ndash;hole pairs created are forced by the electric field at the junction to separate so that the holes pass to the <i>p</i>-region and the electrons pass to the <i>n</i>-region. This displacement of free charge creates an electric current when a load is connected across the terminals of the device (see illustration). Individual silicon solar cells cannot be made with a surface area much in excess of 4000 mm<sup class=""expo"">2</sup> and the maximum power delivered by such a cell is approximately 0.6 W at about 0.5 V in full sun. The efficiency of such devices is about 15%. For practical use, therefore, solar cells have to be assembled in arrays. Panels of solar cells have been the exclusive source of power for satellites and space capsules. Their use on earth has been largely limited by their high cost, a reduction in the cost by a factor of 10 being required to make them competitive with other energy sources at present. <center class=""pic""><img src=""000139.jpg"" ></img><br>Silicon p&ndash;n junction</center>"

"solar heating","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>solar heating</b><br>A form of domestic or industrial heating that relies on the direct use of solar energy. The basic form of <i>solar heater</i> is a thermal device in which a fluid is heated by the sun's rays in a collector (see illustration) and pumped or allowed to flow round a circuit that provides some form of heat storage and some form of auxiliary heat source for use when the sun is not shining. More complicated systems are combined heating-and-cooling devices, providing heat in the winter and air-conditioning in the summer. The simplest form of solar collector is the flat-plate collector, in which a blackened receiving surface is covered by one or more glass plates that acts like a greenhouse (see <a href=""entry://greenhouse effect"">greenhouse effect</a>) and traps the maximum amount of solar energy. Tubes attached to the receiving surface carry air, water, or some other fluid to which the absorbed heat is transferred. The whole panel is insulated at the back and can thus form part of the roof of a building. More sophisticated collectors focus the sun's rays using reflectors.

Over 99% of the mass of the system is concentrated in the sun. The solar system as a whole moves in an approximately circular orbit about the centre of the Galaxy, taking about 2.2 × 10<sup class=""expo"">8</sup> years to complete its orbit.
<br><b><span class=""uCase"">SOLAR SYSTEM</b></span>
<br>The solar system is dominated by a star, the <a href=""entry://sun"">sun</a>. The sun's mass makes up more than 99% of the solar system's mass, and it is the gravitational attraction of the sun that holds the planets, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids in their orbits around it. Only the planetary satellites (such as the earth's moon) owe more allegiance to their parent planets, although the satellites too have to accompany the planets in their endless journey around the sun. The solar system itself also moves, rotating about the centre of the Milky Way galaxy about once every 2.2 × 10<sup class=""expo"">8</sup> years.
<br>The solar system had its origin in a cloud of interstellar dust and gas that condensed around the proto-sun. The planets continued to grow by <a href=""entry://accretion"">accretion</a>, and by about 4.6 billion years ago the earth had formed. The inner, or terrestrial, planets &ndash; Mercury, Venus, earth, and Mars &ndash; are comparatively small. They are composed of rock and metal, with the metallic part forming a dense central core. Only the earth and Mars have natural satellites, and even these may be captured asteroids.
<br>The outer, or giant, planets &ndash; Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune &ndash; have a rock-metal core surrounded by layers of solid, liquid, and gaseous hydrogen and helium. They are much farther from the sun and therefore much cooler than the inner planets, and have been able to retain gases of low density. They have many satellites; Jupiter has at least 16, Saturn 18, Uranus 17, and Neptune 8. Pluto, the outermost planet, is small with one huge satellite. It is thought that the planet and its moon are captured asteroids or satellites, escaped from a giant planet.
<br>The space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter is occupied by thousands of <a href=""entry://asteroids"">asteroids</a>, or minor planets. Most of these are small, often irregularly shaped chunks of rock, with perhaps only 150 of them more than 100 km across. Even smaller are hundreds of thousands of meteoroids, some no larger than grains of dust. Those that enter the earth's atmosphere and burn up as trails of light (shooting stars) are termed <a href=""entry://meteor"">meteors</a>. The largest ones that reach the ground are called meteorites.
<br>The last important members of the solar system are <a href=""entry://comet"">comets</a>. Often described as ‘dirty snowballs’, they consist of a nucleus of dust and ice a kilometre or two across, surrounded by a gaseous coma and with a tail that appears as the comet nears the sun. A dusty tail behind the comet is the source of many meteoroids. <center class=""pic"">

Solvation of transition-metal ions can also occur by formation of coordinate bonds, as in the hexaquocopper(II) ion [Cu(H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>O)<sub class=""ind"">6</sub>]<sup class=""expo"">2+</sup>. Solvation is the process that causes ionic solids to dissolve, because the energy released compensates for the energy necessary to break down the crystal lattice. It occurs only with polar solvents. Solvation in which the solvent is water is called <i>hydration</i>"

<b>spectrometer</b><br>Any of various instruments for producing a spectrum and measuring the wavelengths, energies, etc., involved. A simple type, for visible radiation, is a spectroscope equipped with a calibrated scale allowing wavelengths to be read off or calculated. In the X-ray to infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the spectrum is produced by dispersing the radiation with a prism or diffraction grating (or crystal, in the case of hard X-rays). Some form of photoelectric detector is used, and the spectrum can be obtained as a graphical plot, which shows how the intensity of the radiation varies with wavelength. Such instruments are also called <i>spectrophotometers</i> . Spectrometers also exist for investigating the gamma-ray region and the microwave and radio-wave regions of the spectrum (see <a href=""entry://electron-spin resonance"">electron-spin resonance</a>; <a href=""entry://nuclear magnetic resonance"">nuclear magnetic resonance</a>).

"spectrum","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>spectrum</b><br><b>1</b> A distribution of entities or properties arrayed in order of increasing or decreasing magnitude. For example, a beam of ions passed through a mass spectrograph, in which they are deflected according to their charge-to-mass ratios, will have a range of masses called a <i>mass spectrum</i> . A <i>sound spectrum</i> is the distribution of energy over a range of frequencies of a particular source.
<br><b>2</b> A range of electromagnetic energies arrayed in order of increasing or decreasing wavelength or frequency (see <a href=""entry://electromagnetic spectrum"">electromagnetic spectrum</a>). The <i>emission spectrum</i> of a body or substance is the characteristic range of radiations it emits when it is heated, bombarded by electrons or ions, or absorbs photons. The <i>absorption spectrum</i> of a substance is produced by examining, through the substance and through a spectroscope, a continuous spectrum of radiation. The energies removed from the continous spectrum by the absorbing medium show up as black lines or bands. With a substance capable of emitting a spectrum, these are in exactly the same positions in the spectrum as some of the lines and bands in the emission spectrum.
<br>Emission and absorption spectra may show a <i>continuous spectrum</i> , a <i>line spectrum</i> , or a <i>band spectrum</i> . A continuous spectrum contains an unbroken sequence of frequencies over a relatively wide range; it is produced by incandescent solids, liquids, and compressed gases. Line spectra are discontinuous lines produced by excited atoms and ions as they fall back to a lower energy level. Band spectra (closely grouped bands of lines) are characteristic of molecular gases or chemical compounds.

<b>statistical mechanics</b><br>The branch of physics in which statistical methods are applied to the microscopic constituents of a system in order to predict its macroscopic properties. The earliest application of this method was Boltzmann's attempt to explain the thermodynamic properties of gases on the basis of the statistical properties of large assemblies of molecules.
<br>In classical statistical mechanics, each particle is regarded as occupying a point in <a href=""entry://phase space"">phase space</a>, i.e. to have an exact position and momentum at any particular instant. The probability that this point will occupy any small volume of the phase space is taken to be proportional to the volume.

<br>With the advent of quantum theory, the exactness of these premises was disturbed (by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle). In the <a href=""entry://quantum statistics"">quantum statistics</a> that evolved as a result, the phase space is divided into cells, each having a volume <i>h<sup class=""expo"">f</sup></i>, where <i>h</i> is the Planck constant and <i>f</i> is the number of degrees of freedom of the particles.

"stellar evolution","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>stellar evolution</b><br>The changes that occur to a <a href=""entry://star"">star</a> during its lifetime, from birth to final extinction. A star is believed to form from a condensation of interstellar matter, which collects either by chance or for unexplained reasons, and grows by attracting other matter towards itself as a result of its gravitational field. This initial cloud of cold contracting matter, called a <i>protostar</i> , builds up an internal pressure as a result of its gravitational contraction. The pressure raises the temperature until it reaches 5&ndash;10 × 10<sup class=""expo"">6</sup> K, at which temperature the thermonuclear conversion of hydrogen to helium begins. In our <a href=""entry://sun"">sun</a>, a typical star, hydrogen is converted at a rate of some 10<sup class=""expo"">11</sup> kg s<sup class=""expo"">-1</sup> with the evolution of some 6 × 10<sup class=""expo"">25</sup> J s<sup class=""expo"">-1</sup> of energy. It is estimated that the sun contains sufficient hydrogen to burn at this rate for 10<sup class=""expo"">10</sup> years and that it still has half its life to live as a main-sequence star (see <a href=""entry://Hertzsprung-Russell diagram"">Hertzsprung-Russell diagram</a>). Eventually, however, this period of stability comes to an end, because the thermonuclear energy generated in the interior is no longer sufficient to counterbalance the gravitational contraction. The core, which is now mostly helium, collapses until a sufficiently high temperature is reached in a shell of unburnt hydrogen round the core to start a new phase of thermonuclear reaction. This burning of the shell causes the star's outer envelope to expand and cool, the temperature drop changes the colour from white to red and the star becomes a <i>red giant</i> or a <i>supergiant</i> if the original star was very large. The core now contracts, reaching a temperature of 10<sup class=""expo"">8</sup> K, and the helium in the core acts as the thermonuclear energy source. This reaction produces carbon, but a star of low mass relatively soon runs out of helium and the core collapses into a <a href=""entry://white dwarf"">white dwarf</a>, while the outer regions drift away into space, possibly forming a <i>planetary nebula</i> . Larger stars (several times larger than the sun) have sufficient helium for the process to continue so that heavier elements, up to iron, are formed. But iron is the heaviest element that can be formed with the production of energy and when the helium has all been consumed there is a catastrophic collapse of the core, resulting in a <a href=""entry://supernova"">supernova</a> explosion, blowing the outer layers away.

It has a diameter of about 1 392 000 km and a mass of 1.9 × 10<sup class=""expo"">30</sup> kg. Hydrogen and helium are the primary constituents (about 75% hydrogen, 25% helium), with less than 1% of heavier elements. In the central core, some 400 000 km in diameter, hydrogen is converted into helium by thermonuclear reactions, which generate vast quantities of energy. This energy is radiated into space and provides the earth with all the light and heat necessary to have created and maintained life (see <a href=""entry://solar constant"">solar constant</a>).

"superconductivity","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>superconductivity</b><br>The absence of measurable electrical resistance in certain substances at temperatures close to 0 K. First discovered in 1911 in mercury, superconductivity is now known to occur in some 26 metallic elements and many compounds and alloys. The temperature below which a substance becomes superconducting is called the <i>transition temperature</i> (or <i>critical temperature</i> ). Compounds are now known that show superconductivity at liquid-nitrogen temperatures.
<br>The theoretical explanation of the phenomenon was given by John <a href=""entry://Bardeen"">Bardeen</a>, L. N. Cooper (1930&ndash; ), and J. R. Schrieffer (1931&ndash; ) in 1957 and is known as the <i>BCS theory</i> . According to this theory an electron moving through an elastic crystal lattice creates a slight distortion of the lattice as a result of Coulomb forces between the positively charged lattice and the negatively charged electron. If this distortion persists for a finite time it can affect a second passing electron. In 1956 Cooper showed that the effect of this phenomenon is for the current to be carried in superconductors not by individual electrons but by bound pairs of electrons, the <i>Cooper pairs</i> . The BCS theory is based on a <a href=""entry://wave"">wave</a> function in which all the electrons are paired. Because the total momentum of a Cooper pair is unchanged by the interaction between one of its electrons and the lattice, the flow of electrons continues indefinitely.
<br>Superconducting coils in which large currents can circulate indefinitely can be used to create powerful magnetic fields and are used for this purpose in some particle accelerators and in other devices.
<br>Superconductivity can also occur by a slightly more complicated mechanism than BCS theory in <a href=""entry://heavy-fermion system"">heavy-fermion systems</a>. In 1986, Georg Bednorz (1950&ndash; ) and Karl Müller (1927&ndash; ) found an apparently completely different type of superconductivity. This is called <i>high-temperature superconductivity</i> , since the critical temperature is very much higher than for BCS superconductors; some high-temperature superconductors have critical temperatures greater than 100 K. A typical high-temperature superconductor is YBa<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>Cu<sub class=""ind"">3</sub>O<sub class=""ind"">1&ndash;7</sub>.
<br>At the present time a theory of high-temperature superconductivity has not been established in spite of a great deal of effort, which is still going on. The BCS mechanism, and minor modifications of it, almost certainly do not apply. One model for high-temperature superconductivity uses the concept of anyons, but at present there is no evidence for this mechanism"
"supercooling","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>supercooling</b><br><b>1</b> The cooling of a liquid to below its freezing point without a change from the liquid to solid state taking place. In this metastable state the particles of the liquid lose energy but do not fall into place in the lattice of the solid crystal. If the liquid is seeded with a small crystal, crystallization usually takes place and the temperature returns to the freezing point. This is a common occurrence in the atmosphere where water droplets frequently remain unfrozen at temperatures well below 0°C until disturbed, following which they rapidly freeze. The supercooled droplets, for example, rapidly freeze on passing aircraft forming ‘icing’, which can be a hazard.
<br><b>2</b> The analogous cooling of a vapour to make it supersaturated until a disturbance causes condensation to occur, as in the Wilson <a href=""entry://cloud chamber"">cloud chamber</a>."

"superposition principle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>superposition principle</b><br>A general principle of linear systems that when applied to wave phenomena asserts that the combined effect of any number of interacting waves at a point may be obtained by the algebraic summation of the amplitudes of all the waves at the point. For example, the superposition of two oscillations <i>x<sub class=""ind"">1</sub></i> and <i>x<sub class=""ind"">2</sub></i>, both of frequency <i>v</i>, produces a disturbance of the same frequency. The amplitude and <a href=""entry://phase angle"">phase angle</a> of the resulting disturbance are functions of the component amplitudes and phases.

"superstring theory","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>superstring theory</b><br>A unified theory of the <a href=""entry://fundamental interactions"">fundamental interactions</a> involving supersymmetry, in which the basic objects are one-dimensional objects (<i>superstrings</i> ). Superstrings are thought to have a length scale of about 10<sup class=""expo"">-35</sup> m and, since very short distances are associated with very high energies, they should have energy scales of about 10<sup class=""expo"">19</sup> GeV, which is far beyond the energy of any accelerator that can be envisaged.
<br>Strings associated with bosons are only consistent as quantum theories in a 26-dimensional <a href=""entry://space-time"">space-time</a>; those associated with fermions are only consistent as quantum theories in 10-dimensional space&ndash;time. It is thought that four macroscopic dimensions arise according to <a href=""entry://Kaluza-Klein theory"">Kaluza&ndash;Klein theory</a>, with the remaining dimensions being ‘curled up’ to become very small.
<br>One of the most attractive features of the theory of superstrings is that it leads to spin 2 particles, which are identified as <a href=""entry://graviton"">gravitons</a>. Thus, a superstring theory automatically contains a quantum theory of the gravitational interaction. It is thought that superstrings are free of the infinities that cannot be removed by <a href=""entry://renormalization"">renormalization</a>, which plague attempts to construct a quantum field theory incorporating gravity. There is some evidence that superstring theory is free of infinities but not a complete proof yet.

Another attractive aspect of the theory is that it reveals the existence of particles that do not conserve parity, as in the weak interaction"
"supersymmetry","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>supersymmetry</b><br>A <a href=""entry://symmetry"">symmetry</a> that can be applied to elementary particles so as to include both bosons and fermions. In the simplest supersymmetry theories, every boson has a corresponding fermion partner and every fermion has a corresponding boson partner. The boson partners of existing fermions have names formed by adding ‘s’ to the beginning of the name of the fermion, e.g. <i>selectron</i>, <i>squark</i>, and <i>slepton</i>. The fermion partners of existing bosons have names formed by replacing ‘-on’ at the end of the boson's name by ‘-ino’ or by adding ‘-ino’, e.g. <i>gluino</i>, <i>photino</i>, <i>wino</i>, and <i>zino</i>.
<br>The infinities that cause problems in relativistic quantum field theories (see <a href=""entry://renormalization"">renormalization</a>) are less severe in supersymmetry theories because infinities of bosons and fermions can cancel one another out.
<br>If supersymmetry is relevant to observed elementary particles then it must be a <a href=""entry://broken symmetry"">broken symmetry</a>, although there is no convincing evidence at present to show at what energy it would be broken. There is, in fact, no experimental evidence for the theory, although it is thought that it may form part of a unified theory of interactions.

The particles are accelerated in closed orbits (often circular) by radio-frequency fields. Magnets are spaced round the orbit to bend the trajectory of the particles and separate focusing magnets are used to keep the particles in a narrow beam. The radio-frequency accelerating cavities are interspersed between the magnets.

"synchrotron radiation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>synchrotron radiation</b><i>(magnetobremsstrahlung)</i>
<br>Electromagnetic radiation that is emitted by charged particles moving at relativistic speeds in circular orbits in a magnetic field. The rate of emission is inversely proportional to the product of the radius of curvature of the orbit and the fourth power of the mass of the particles. For this reason, synchrotron radiation is not a problem in the design of proton <a href=""entry://synchrotron"">synchrotrons</a> but it is significant in electron synchrotrons. The greater the circumference of a synchrotron, the less important is the loss of energy by synchrotron radiation.

<br>However, since the 1950s it has been realized that synchrotron radiation is itself a very useful tool and many accelerator laboratories have research projects making use of the radiation on a secondary basis to the main high-energy research. The radiation used for these purposes is primarily in the ultraviolet and X-ray frequencies.
<br>Much of the microwave radiation from celestial radio sources outside the Galaxy is believed to originate from electrons moving in curved paths in celestial magnetic fields; it is also called synchrotron radiation as it is analogous to the radiation occurring in a synchrotron"

"telescope","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>telescope</b><br>An instrument that collects radiation from a distant object in order to produce an image of it or enable the radiation to be analysed.
<br><b><span class=""uCase"">ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES</b></span> Optical astronomical telescopes fall into two main classes: <i>refracting telescopes</i> (or <i>refractors)</i> , which use lenses to form the primary image, and <i>reflecting telescopes</i> (or <i>reflectors)</i> , which use mirrors.Refracting telescopes
<br>The refracting telescopes use a converging lens to collect the light, enabling the resulting image to be magnified by the eyepiece. This type of instrument was first constructed in 1608 by Hans Lippershey (1587&ndash;1619) in Holland and developed in the following year as an astronomical instrument by Galileo, who used a diverging lens as eyepiece. The <i>Galilean telescope</i> was later improved by Johannes Kepler, who substituted a converging eyepiece lens, and this form of the instrument is still in use for small astronomical telescopes (the <i>Keplerian telescope</i> ).Reflecting telescopes
<br>The first reflecting telescope was produced by Newton in 1668. This used a concave mirror to collect and focus the light and a small secondary mirror at an angle of 45° to the main beam to reflect the light into the magnifying eyepiece. This design is known as the <i>Newtonian telescope</i> . The <i>Gregorian telescope</i> , designed by James Gregory (1638&ndash;75), and the <i>Cassegrainian telescope</i> , designed by N. Cassegrain (<i>fl.</i> 1670s), use different secondary optical systems. The <i>coudé telescope</i> (French: angled) is sometimes used with larger instruments as it increases their focal lengths.Catadioptic telescopes
<br><i>Catadioptic telescopes</i> use both lenses and mirrors. The most widely used astronomical instruments in this class are the <i>Maksutov telescope</i> and the <i>Schmidt camera</i> . The Maksutov instrument has a thick spheroidal meniscus lens to introduce spherical aberration to the image, which is corrected by the spheroidal principal mirror. The Schmidt camera has a correcting plate of complicated aspherical shape close to the centre of curvature of the spheroidal principal mirror. This instrument is used primarily for photographic purposes.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000160.jpg"" ></img><br></center>"
"television","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>television</b>
<br>The transmission and reception of moving images by means of radio waves or cable. The scene to be transmitted is focused onto a photoelectric screen in the television <a href=""entry://camera"">camera</a>. This screen is scanned by an electron beam. The camera produces an electric current, the instantaneous magnitude of which is proportional to the brightness of the portion of the screen being scanned. In Europe the screen is scanned by 625 lines and 25 such frames are produced every second. In the USA 525 lines and 30 frames per second are used. The picture signal so produced is used to modulate a VHF or UHF carrier wave and is transmitted with an independent sound signal, but with colour information (if any) incorporated into the brief gaps between the picture lines. The signals received by the receiving aerial are demodulated in the receiver; the demodulated picture signal controls the electron beam in a cathode-ray tube, on the screen of which the picture is reconstructed.

"temperament","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>temperament</b><br>The way in which the intervals between notes on keyboard instruments are distributed throughout the scale to ensure that music in all keys sounds in tune. The problem can be illustrated by a piano keyboard. Taking a low C and a high C seven octaves above, the interval should be <div class=""equ"">2<sup class=""expo"">7</sup> = 128</div>. However, in passing through the cycle of 12 keys, each using as its fundamental the fifth of its predecessor, the interval between Cs becomes <div class=""equ"">(3/2)<sup class=""expo"">12</sup> = 129.75</div>. The difference between 129.75 and 128 is known as the <i>comma of Pythagoras</i> . The <i>equal-temperament scale</i> , which has been in use since the time of J. S. Bach, distributes the comma of Pythagoras equally between the 12 intervals of the scale over seven octaves. Thus each fifth becomes <div class=""equ"">(128)<sup class=""expo"">1/12</sup> = 1.4983</div>. All forms of temperament involve a measure of compromise; this system is now regarded as the best"
"temperature","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>temperature</b><br>The property of a body or region of space that determines whether or not there will be a net flow of heat into it or out of it from a neighbouring body or region and in which direction (if any) the heat will flow. If there is no heat flow the bodies or regions are said to be in <i>thermodynamic equilibrium</i> and at the same temperature. If there is a flow of heat, the direction of the flow is from the body or region of higher temperature. Broadly, there are two methods of quantifying this property. The empirical method is to take two or more reproducible temperature-dependent events and assign <i>fixed points</i> on a scale of values to these events. For example, the Celsius temperature scale uses the freezing point and boiling point of water as the two fixed points, assigns the values 0 and 100 to them, respectively, and divides the scale between them into 100 degrees. This method is serviceable for many practical purposes (see <a href=""entry://temperature scales"">temperature scales</a>), but lacking a theoretical basis it is awkward to use in many scientific contexts. In the 19th century, Lord <a href=""entry://Kelvin"">Kelvin</a> proposed a thermodynamic method to specify temperature, based on the measurement of the quantity of heat flowing between bodies at different temperatures. This concept relies on an absolute scale of temperature with an <a href=""entry://absolute zero"">absolute zero</a> of temperature, at which no body can give up heat. He also used Sadi Carnot's concept of an ideal frictionless perfectly efficient heat engine (see <a href=""entry://Carnot cycle"">Carnot cycle</a>). This Carnot engine takes in a quantity of heat <i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> at a temperature <i>T</i>, and exhausts heat <i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub> at <i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>, so that <div class=""equ""><i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>/<i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub> = <i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>/<i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub></div>. If <i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub> has a value fixed by definition, a Carnot engine can be run between this fixed temperature and any unknown temperature <i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub>, enabling <i>T</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> to be calculated by measuring the values of <i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">1</sub> and <i>q</i><sub class=""ind"">2</sub>. This concept remains the basis for defining <i>thermodynamic temperature</i> , quite independently of the nature of the working substance. The unit in which thermodynamic temperature is expressed is the <a href=""entry://kelvin"">kelvin</a>. In practice thermodynamic temperatures cannot be measured directly; they are usually inferred from measurements with a gas thermometer containing a nearly ideal gas. This is possible because another aspect of thermodynamic temperature is its relationship to the <a href=""entry://internal energy"">internal energy</a> of a given amount of substance. This can be shown most simply in the case of an ideal monatomic gas, in which the internal energy per mole (<i>U</i>) is equal to the total kinetic energy of translation of the atoms in one mole of the gas (a monatomic gas has no rotational or vibrational energy). According to <a href=""entry://kinetic theory"">kinetic theory</a>, the thermodynamic temperature of such a gas is given by <div class=""equ""><i>T</i> = 2<i>U</i>/3<i>R</i></div>, where <i>R</i> is the universal <a href=""entry://gas constant"">gas constant</a>"
"temperature coefficient","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>temperature coefficient</b><br>A coefficient that determines the rate of change of some physical property with change in temperature. For example, the dependence of the resistance (<i>R</i>) of a material on the Celsius temperature <i>t</i>, is given by <div class=""equ""><i>R</i> = R<sub class=""ind"">0</sub> + α<i>t</i> + ß<i>t</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup></div>, where <i>R</i><sub class=""ind"">0</sub> is the resistance at 0°C and α and ß are constants. If ß is negligible, then α is the <i>temperature coefficient of resistance</i>"
"temperature scales","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>temperature scales</b><br>A number of empirical scales of <a href=""entry://temperature"">temperature</a> have been in use: the <a href=""entry://Celsius scale"">Celsius scale</a> is widely used for many purposes and in certain countries the <a href=""entry://Fahrenheit scale"">Fahrenheit scale</a> is still used. These scales both rely on the use of <i>fixed points</i> , such as the freezing point and the boiling point of water, and the division of the <i>fundamental interval</i> between these two points into units of temperature (100 degrees in the case of the Celsius scale and 180 degrees in the Fahrenheit scale).
<br>However, for scientific purposes the scale in use is the <i>International Practical Temperature Scale</i> (<i>IPTS</i> ), which is designed to conform as closely as possible to thermodynamic temperature and is expressed in the unit of thermodynamic temperature, the <a href=""entry://kelvin"">kelvin</a>. The 1968 version of the table (known as IPTS-68) had 11 fixed points defined by both Celsius and thermodynamic temperatures. The most recent version (IPTS-90), introduced in 1990, has 16 fixed points with temperatures expressed in kelvins:Triple point of hydrogen: 13.8033
<br>Boiling point of hydrogen (33 321.3 Pa): 17.035

<br>Freezing point of silver: 1234.93
<br>Freezing point of gold: 1337.33
<br>Freezing point of copper: 1357.77
<br>Methods for measuring intermediate temperatures between these fixed points are specified; for example, at low temperatures (0&ndash;5 K) they are measured by means of vapour-pressure determinations of <sup class=""expo"">3</sup>He and <sup class=""expo"">4</sup>He; at high temperatures (above 1234.93 K) a radiation pyrometer is used"

"thermodynamics","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>thermodynamics</b><br>The study of the laws that govern the conversion of energy from one form to another, the direction in which heat will flow, and the availability of energy to do work. It is based on the concept that in an isolated system anywhere in the universe there is a measurable quantity of energy called the <a href=""entry://internal energy"">internal energy</a> (<i>U</i>) of the system. This is the total kinetic and potential energy of the atoms and molecules of the system of all kinds that can be transferred directly as heat; it therefore excludes chemical and nuclear energy. The value of <i>U</i> can only be changed if the system ceases to be isolated. In these circumstances <i>U</i> can change by the transfer of mass to or from the system, the transfer of heat (<i>Q</i>) to or from the system, or by the work (<i>W</i>) being done on or by the system. For an adiabatic <div class=""equ"">(<i>Q</i> = 0)</div> system of constant mass, <div class=""equ"">Δ<i>U</i> = <i>W</i></div>. By convention, <i>W</i> is taken to be positive if work is done on the system and negative if work is done by the system. For nonadiabatic systems of constant mass, <div class=""equ"">Δ<i>U</i> = <i>Q</i> + <i>W</i></div>. This statement, which is equivalent to the law of conservation of energy, is known as the <i>first law of thermodynamics</i> .
<br>All natural processes conform to this law, but not all processes conforming to it can occur in nature. Most natural processes are irreversible, i.e. they will only proceed in one direction (see <a href=""entry://reversible process"">reversible process</a>). The direction that a natural process can take is the subject of the <i>second law of thermodynamics</i> , which can be stated in a variety of ways. Rudolf <a href=""entry://Clausiu"">Clausius</a> stated the law in two ways: “heat cannot be transferred from one body to a second body at a higher temperature without producing some other effect” and “the entropy of a closed system increases with time”. These statements introduce the thermodynamic concepts of <a href=""entry://temperature"">temperature</a> (<i>T</i>) and <a href=""entry://entropy"">entropy</a> (<i>S</i>), both of which are parameters determining the direction in which an irreversible process can go. The temperature of a body or system determines whether heat will flow into it or out of it; its entropy is a measure of the unavailability of its energy to do work. Thus <i>T</i> and <i>S</i> determine the relationship between <i>Q</i> and <i>W</i> in the statement of the first law. This is usually presented by stating the second law in the form <div class=""equ"">Δ<i>U</i> = <i>T</i>Δ<i>S</i> - <i>W</i></div>.
<br>The second law is concerned with changes in entropy (Δ<i>S</i>). The <i>third law of thermodynamics</i> provides an absolute scale of values for entropy by stating that for changes involving only perfect crystalline solids at <a href=""entry://absolute zero"">absolute zero</a>, the change of the total entropy is zero. This law enables absolute values to be stated for entropies.
<br>One other law is used in thermodynamics. Because it is fundamental to, and assumed by, the other laws of thermodynamics it is usually known as the <i>zeroth law of thermodynamics</i> . This states that if two bodies are each in thermal equilibrium with a third body, then all three bodies are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

<b>thermography</b><br>A medical technique that makes use of the infrared radiation from the human skin to detect an area of elevated skin temperature that could be associated with an underlying cancer.

A tumour, on the other hand, has an abnormally increased blood supply and is revealed on the <i>thermogram</i> (or <i>thermograph</i> ) as a ‘hot spot’.

<b>thermometer</b><br>An instrument used for measuring the <a href=""entry://temperature"">temperature</a> of a substance. A number of techniques and forms are used in thermometers depending on such factors as the degree of accuracy required and the range of temperatures to be measured, but they all measure temperature by making use of some property of a substance that varies with temperature. For example, <i>liquid-in-glass thermometers</i> depend on the expansion of a liquid, usually mercury or alcohol coloured with dye. These consist of a liquid-filled glass bulb attached to a partially filled capillary tube. In the <i>bimetallic thermometer</i> the unequal expansion of two dissimilar metals that have been bonded together into a narrow strip and coiled is used to move a pointer round a dial. The <i>gas thermometer</i> , which is more accurate than the liquid-in-glass thermometer, measures the variation in the pressure of a gas kept at constant volume. The <i>resistance thermometer</i> is based on the change in resistance of conductors or semiconductors with temperature change. Platinum, nickel, and copper are the metals most commonly used in resistance thermometers.

<b>thermonuclear reactor</b><i>(fusion reactor)</i>
<br>A reactor in which <a href=""entry://nuclear fusion"">nuclear fusion</a> takes place with the controlled release of energy. Although thermonuclear reactors do not yet exist, intense research in many parts of the world is being carried out with a view to achieving such a machine. There are two central problems in the creation of a self-sustaining thermonuclear reactor: heating the reacting nuclides to the enormous <a href=""entry://ignition temperature"">ignition temperature</a> (about 40 × 10 <sup class=""expo"">6</sup> K for a deuterium&mdash;tritium reaction) and containing the reacting nuclides for long enough for the fusion energy released to exceed the energy required to achieve the ignition temperature (see <a href=""entry://Lawson criterion"">Lawson criterion</a>). The two methods being explored are <i>magnetic containment</i> and <i>pellet fusion</i> .
<br>In the closed magnetic-containment device the fusion <a href=""entry://plasma"">plasma</a> is contained in a toroidal-shaped reactor, called a <i>Tokamak</i> , in which strong magnetic fields guide the charged plasma particles round the toroid without allowing them to contact the container walls (see illustration). In open-ended magnetic systems the plasma is trapped between magnetic mirrors (strong magnetic fields) at the two ends of a straight containment vessel.
<br>In pellet fusion the fuel is a mixture of deuterium and tritium in pellet form (~ 1 mm). The fuel pellets are struck simultaneously by nanosecond pulses of high intensity radiation from several infrared lasers. The surface of the pellet vaporizes and a shock wave is generated, which increases the pellet's core density by up to 1000 times. The temperature of the core is raised to over 10<sup class=""expo""> 8</sup> K. The plasma formed in this way is essentially confined to the small region of heating by its own inertia; for this reason the method is sometimes called <i>inertial confinement</i> . The heating occurs over such a short time (typically 1&ndash;2 nanoseconds) that the plasma has no time to disperse. Results with this type of equipment have been comparable to those achieved by magnetic confinement.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000007.jpg"" ></img><br>Thermonuclear reactor: Tokamak principle</center>"

The forces involved are complex, but the moon is approximately twice as effective as the sun in causing tides. In illustration (a) the resultant gravitational forces between the moon and various points on the earth (solid lines) are shown as the vector sums of the tide-generating forces (broken lines) and a constant force (dotted lines) that is the same at all points on the earth and is equal to the moon's attraction on the earth's centre. The resultant force when the moon is in zenith (Z in the illustration) is greater than that at nadir (N) because Z is closer to the moon than N and the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance according to <a href=""entry://Newton, Sir Isaac"">Newton's</a> law of gravitation.

<b>time</b><br>A dimension that enables two otherwise identical events that occur at the same point in space to be distinguished (see <a href=""entry://space-time"">space&mdash;time</a>). The interval between two such events forms the basis of time measurement. For general purposes, the earth's rotation on its axis provides the units of the clock (see <a href=""entry://day"">day</a>) and the earth's orbit round the sun (see <a href=""entry://year"">year</a>) provides the units of the calendar. For scientific purposes, intervals of time are now defined in terms of the frequency of a specified electromagnetic radiation (see <a href=""entry://second"">second</a>). See also <a href=""entry://time dilation"">time dilation</a>; <a href=""entry://time reversal"">time reversal</a>.
<br>In physics, since the publication of the special theory of <a href=""entry://relativity"">relativity</a> in 1905, Einstein has frequently been said to have abandoned the concept of absolute time. In this context absolute time is taken to mean “time that flows equably and independently of the state of motion of the observer”. Time dilation effects and the collapse of absolute <a href=""entry://simultaneity"">simultaneity</a> mean that absolute time in this sense cannot be applied to the measurement of an interval of time.
<br>Although philosophers tend to describe Einstein's work on relativity as the beginning of a 20th century revolution in science, many of these ‘revolutionary’ concepts were not entirely original. In 1898, for example, Jules Poincaré (1854&ndash;1912), the French mathematician, questioned the concept of absolute simultaneity commenting that “we have no direct intuition about the equality of two time intervals”. Poincaré was also aware of the need to consider local time for a given observer. In 1904, he observed that clocks synchronized by light signals sent between observers in uniform relative motion “will not mark the true time”, but, rather, “what one might call the local time”.
<br>A frequent misconception is that the theory of relativity removes absolute time from mechanics. This is true for the measurement of time as discussed above, but not for time itself. Newton's definition of absolute time is essentially a philosophical concept. Indeed, challenges to this concept in Newton's lifetime were usually made on philosophical, rather than experimental, grounds. Newton never claimed that one could measure absolute time; this absolute quantity had to be distinguished from the “sensible measures” used in “ordinary affairs”.
<br>In Einstein's view of the universe, descriptions of a physical phenomenon need to be fully relativistic, requiring <a href=""entry://Lorentz transformations"">Lorentz transformations</a> between the coordinates of systems in uniform relative motion. Contrary to popular belief, Newtonian mechanics was not based on absolute space and time and was fully relativistic, but in the Galilean sense; that is, <a href=""entry://Galilean transformations"">Galilean transformations</a> were required between the coordinates of systems in uniform relative motion.
<br>In considering simultaneity Einstein made use of a thought experiment (see <a href=""entry://relativity"">relativity</a>). As a result of this experiment in Einstein's view, the concept of absolute simultaneity has to be abandoned. His universe is causal, and in a causal universe, there is no such thing as simultaneity as there are no simultaneous events. Events have a definite order based on their causal sequence, which cannot be changed. This is what Newton meant by absolute time. Without making a direct statement, Einstein effectively introduced a third postulate in his theory of relativity; that no information can be transmitted faster than the speed of light. For both Newton and Einstein absolute time is really the absolute order of events, determined by causality, and not the measurement of time, which is the subject of ordinary observation"
"time dilation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>time dilation</b><i>(time dilatation)</i>
<br>The principle, predicted by Einstein's special theory of <a href=""entry://relativity"">relativity</a>, that intervals of time are not absolute but are relative to the motion of the observers. If two identical clocks are synchronized and placed side by side in an inertial frame of reference they will read the same time for as long as they both remain side by side. However, if one of the clocks has a velocity relative to the other, which remains beside a stationary observer, the travelling clock will show, to that observer, that less time has elapsed than the stationary clock.

"transistor","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>transistor</b><br>A <a href=""entry://semiconductor"">semiconductor</a> device capable of amplification in addition to rectification. It is the basic unit in radio, television, and computer circuits, having almost completely replaced the <a href=""entry://thermionic valve"">thermionic valve</a>. The <i>point-contact transistor</i> , which is now obsolete, was invented in 1948. It consists of a small germanium crystal with two rectifying point contacts attached to it; a third contact, called the <i>base</i> , makes a low-resistance nonrectifying (ohmic) connection with the crystal. Current flowing through the device between the point contacts is modulated by the signal fed to the base. This type of transistor was replaced by the <i>junction transistor</i> , which was developed in 1949&ndash;50. The <i>field-effect transistor</i> (<i>FET</i> ) was a later invention. <i>Bipolar transistors</i> , such as the junction transistor, depend on the flow of both majority and minority carriers, whereas in <i>unipolar transistors</i> , such as the FET, the current is carried by majority carriers only.
<br>In the bipolar junction transistor, two <i>p</i>-type semiconductor regions are separated by a thin <i>n</i>-type region, making a <i>p</i>&mdash;<i>n</i>&mdash;<i>p</i> structure. Alternatively, an <i>n</i>&mdash;<i>p</i>&mdash;<i>n</i> structure can also be used. In both cases the thin central region is called the base and one outer region of the sandwich is called the <i>emitter</i> , the other the <i>collector</i> . The emitter&mdash;base junction is forward-biased and the collector&mdash;base junction is reverse-biased. In the <i>p</i>&mdash;<i>n</i>&mdash;<i>p</i> transistor, the forward bias causes holes in the emitter region to flow across the junction into the base; as the base is thin, the majority of holes are swept right across it (helped by the reverse bias), into the collector. The minority of holes that do not flow from the base to the collector combine with electrons in the <i>n</i>-type base. This recombination is balanced by a small electron flow in the base circuit. The diagram illustrates the (conventional) current flow using the <i>common-base</i> type of connection. If the emitter, base, and collector currents are <i>I</i><sub class=""ind"">e</sub>, <i>I</i><sub class=""ind"">b</sub>, and <i>I</i><sub class=""ind"">c</sub>, respectively, then <i>I</i><sub class=""ind"">e</sub> = <i>I</i><sub class=""ind"">b</sub> + <i>I</i><sub class=""ind"">c</sub> and the current gain is <i>I</i><sub class=""ind"">c</sub>/<i>I</i><sub class=""ind"">b</sub>.
<br>Field-effect transistors are of two kinds, the <i>junction FET</i> (<i>JFET</i> or <i>JUGFET</i> ) and the <i>insulated-gate FET</i> (<i>IGFET</i> ; also known as a <i>MOSFET</i> , i.e. metal-oxide-semiconductor FET). Both are unipolar devices and in both the current flows through a narrow <i>channel</i> between two electrodes (the <i>gate</i> ) from one region, called the <i>source</i> , to another, called the <i>drain</i> . The modulating signal is applied to the gate. In the JFET, the channel consists of a semiconductor material of relatively low conductivity sandwiched between two regions of high conductivity of the opposite polarity. When the junctions between these regions are reverse-biased, <a href=""entry://depletion layer"">depletion layers</a> form, which narrow the channel. At high bias the depletion layers meet and pinch-off the channel completely. Thus the voltage applied to the two gates controls the thickness of the channel and thus its conductivity. JFETs are made with both <i>n</i>-type and <i>p</i>-type channels.
<br>In the IGFET, a wafer of semiconductor material has two highly doped regions of opposite polarity diffused into it, to form the source and drain regions. An insulating layer of silicon dioxide is formed on the surface between these regions and a metal conductor is evaporated on to the top of this layer to form the gate. When a positive voltage is applied to the gate, electrons move along the surface of the <i>p</i>-type substrate below the gate, producing a thin surface of <i>n</i>-type material, which forms the channel between the source and drain. This surface layer is called an <i>inversion layer</i> , as it has opposite conductivity to that of the substrate. The number of induced electrons is directly proportional to the gate voltage, thus the conductivity of the channel increases with gate voltage. IGFETs are also made with both <i>p</i>-type and <i>n</i>-type channels. Because MOS devices cannot be formed on gallium arsenide (there are no stable native oxides of GaAs), metal semiconductor FETs (MESFET) devices are used. This makes use of Schottky barrier (see <a href=""entry://Schottky effect"">Schottky effect</a>) as the gate electrode rather than a semiconductor junction.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000156.jpg"" ></img><br>Transistors</center>"

<br>A semiconductor diode, discovered in 1957 by L. Esaki (1925&ndash; ), based on the <a href=""entry://tunnel effect"">tunnel effect</a>. It consists of a highly doped <i>p</i>&mdash;<i>n</i> semiconductor junction, which short circuits with negative bias and has negative resistance over part of its range when forward biased. Its fast speed of operation makes it a useful device in many electronic fields. In a tunnel diode the shape of the characteristic for current and voltage is affected sharply by the tunnel effect, with a large tunnelling current associated with tunnelling from the valence band to the conduction band (see <a href=""entry://energy band"">energy bands</a>). As the forward bias on the junction is increased the tunnel effect becomes less and less pronounced"

"turbine","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>turbine</b><br>A machine in which a fluid is used to produce rotational motion. The most widely used turbines are the <i>steam turbines</i> and <i>water turbines</i> that provide some 95% of the world's electric power (in the form of <a href=""entry://turbogenerator"">turbogenerators</a>) and the <i>gas turbines</i> that power all the world's jet-propelled aircraft. In the <i>impulse turbine</i> a high-pressure low-velocity fluid is expanded through stationary nozzles, producing low-pressure high-velocity jets, which are directed onto the blades of a rotor. The rotor blades reduce the speed of the jets and thus convert some of the fluid's kinetic energy into rotational kinetic energy of the rotor shaft. In the <i>reaction turbine</i> the discharge nozzles are themselves attached to the rotor. The acceleration of the fluid leaving the nozzles produces a force of reaction on the pipes, causing the rotor to move in the opposite direction to that of the fluid. (See illustrations.) Many turbines work on a combination of the impulse and reaction principles.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000084.jpg"" ></img><br>Principle of the turbine</center>"

"twin paradox","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>twin paradox</b><br>A paradox resulting from the special theory of <a href=""entry://relativity"">relativity</a>; if one of a pair of twins remains on earth while the other twin makes a journey to a distant star at close to the speed of light and subsequently returns to earth, the twins will have aged differently. The twin remaining on earth will have aged considerably more than the twin who travelled to a star. This paradox can be explained by the geometry of Minkowski (see <a href=""entry://space-time"">space&mdash;time</a>). The <a href=""entry://world line"">world line</a> of the twin who remained at home is denoted AB, while the world line of the other twin is the sum AC + CB, corresponding to the journeys to and from the star.

"Tyndall effect","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Tyndall effect</b><br>The scattering of light as it passes through a medium containing small particles. If a polychromatic beam of light is passed through a medium containing particles with diameters less than about one-twentieth of the wavelength of the light, the scattered light appears blue. This accounts for the blue appearance of tobacco smoke. At higher particle diameters, the scattered light remains polychromatic. It is named after John Tyndall (1820&ndash;93).

"ultrasonic imaging","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>ultrasonic imaging</b><br>The use of <a href=""entry://ultrasonics"">ultrasonics</a> to form an image or representation of an object (such as an internal part of the human body). Ultrasonic <a href=""entry://tomography"">tomography</a> is used for these purposes.
<br>In ultrasonic imaging, a probe containing a piezoelectric crystal acts both as the source and the detector of the ultrasonic waves, which are typically in a frequency range of 1&ndash;15 MHz. Pulses of ultrasound are transmitted into the body and are reflected at boundaries between different tissue types. By analysing the time lapse and absorption of the returning signals, positions and orientations of the underlying organs and tissues may be deduced.
<br>The diagrams overleaf describe the main features of three main types of ultrasound scan employed in modern medicine. In the M-scan, ultrasound is transmitted into the patient's body. The delay is used to calculate the depth of the structure under examination. Electronics converts the received signal into a potential difference, which is fed to the X plates of a <a href=""entry://cathode-ray oscilloscope"">cathode-ray oscilloscope</a>. The <a href=""entry://timebase"">timebase</a> of the oscilloscope becomes the time axis of the M-scan. Regular oscillations of the structure under the skin produces a wavy trace. The M-scan techniques are often used for monitoring heart movement. However, the viewing of the heart is limited by surrounding bone and air. Care has to be taken to avoid the ribs and lungs. These restrictions mean that ultrasound cardiography (UCG) requires considerable skill.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000095.jpg"" ></img><br>Ultrasonic imaging</center>
<br>In the A-scan, the surfaces in the patient's body produce echoes, which are picked up by the probe and analysed. A block diagram of the electronics that finally produces the A-scan is shown on the right. The A-scan is a range-finding scan. The surfaces a, b, c, and d produce echoes of the detected ultrasound. The depth of the surfaces are effectively shown by the time delay on the circular screen. The height of a spike which corresponds to a surface represents the size of the echo. The rate generator triggers the transmitter of ultrasound, the swept-gain amplifier, and the timebase simultaneously. The function of the swept-gain amplifier is to increase the return pulse amplification, since echoes returning from deeper structures will be more attenuated. The swept-gain amplifier therefore amplifies the received signals just enough to compensate for the attenuation. The output of the receiver is fed into the cathode-ray oscilloscope which displays the A-scan. A-scans are used when precise depth measurements are required, e.g. in echoencephalography, the determination of the midline of the brain.
<br>In the B-scan, the ultrasound probe is moved slowly over the patient's body and a cathode-ray oscilloscope is able to store the echoes of a succession of range-finding scans displays them as bright spots. The depth is calculated by the delay of the return signal and the brightness of the spots indicates the strength of the return signal. The two-dimensional images produced by B-scans are ideal for monitoring the progress of a foetus in a womb or locating tumours or other anomalies in the liver, kidneys, and ovaries. B-scans are also invaluable in the examination of aneurysms (swollen parts of arteries).
<br>Ultrasound can also be used to monitor the function of organs or blood flow. This application of ultrasound relies on the <a href=""entry://Doppler effect"">Doppler effect</a>. The transmitter is separate from the receiver. The ultrasound used in this technique is a continuous beam rather than the series of pulses used for imaging. The transmitted and received signals are electronically mixed and the output is filtered so that only the Doppler-shift frequency is amplified. Doppler-shift frequencies are often in the human hearing range so that the operators can ‘hear’ the moving structures on earphones.
<br>Ultrasound monitoring using the Doppler effect is also used in monitoring blood flow. The Doppler probe is placed on the skin directly above a blood vessel at an angle θ</img> to the horizontal. The blood, travelling in a direction parallel to the skin, reflects the transmitted waves and Doppler-shifts them by an amount Δ<i>f</i> given by the formula: <div class=""equ"">Δ<i>f</i> = (<sup class=""expo"">2</sup><i>f</i>v/<i>c</i>)cosθ</img></div>, where <i>f</i> is the frequency of the transmitted ultrasound, v is the speed of the blood flow, and <i>c</i> is the speed of sound in blood. A blockage due to a clot (thrombosis), or a constriction due to plaque build-up on the vessel walls (atheroma), is immediately apparent if there is a change in the Doppler shift frequency.
<br>Ultrasound may also be delivered at large intensities to localized regions of the body for therapeutic purposes. <i>Diathermy</i> is the application of ultrasound to cause localized heating of tissue to relieve pain in the joints of arthritis sufferers. Typical treatments use intensities of several W/cm<sup class=""expo"">2</sup> for periods of a few minutes several times a week. Actual destruction of tissue is also possible using sufficiently high intensities of ultrasound (intensities exceeding 1000 W/cm<sup class=""expo"">2</sup>). Ultrasound has been shown to destroy cancer cells, although some studies have also shown that it can in some cases stimulate growth of the tumour"

"ultraviolet radiation","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>ultraviolet radiation</b>(UV)
<br>Electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths between that of violet light and long X-rays, i.e. between 400 nanometres and 4 nm. In the range 400&ndash;300 nm the radiation is known as the <i>near ultraviolet</i> . In the range 300&ndash;200 nm it is known as the <i>far ultraviolet</i> . Below 200 nm it is known as the <i>extreme ultraviolet</i> or the <i>vacuum ultraviolet</i> , as absorption by the oxygen in the air makes the use of evacuated apparatus essential. The sun is a strong emitter of UV radiation but only the near UV reaches the surface of the earth as the ozone layer of the atmosphere absorbs all wavelengths below 290 nm. Ultraviolet radiation is classified in three ranges according to its effect on the skin. The ranges are:
<blockquote class=""blk"">&nbsp;UV-A (320&ndash;400 nm);
<br>&nbsp;UV-B (290&ndash;320 nm);
<br>&nbsp;UV-C (230&ndash;290 nm).
<br></blockquote>
<br>The longest-wavelength range, UV-A, is not harmful in normal doses and is used clinically in the treatment of certain skin complaints, such as psoriasis. It is also used to induce vitamin D formation in patients that are allergic to vitamin D preparations. UV-B causes reddening of the skin followed by pigmentation (tanning). Excessive exposure can cause severe blistering. UV-C, with the shortest wavelengths, is particularly damaging. It has been claimed that short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation causes skin cancer and that the risk of contracting this has been increased by the depletion of the ozone layer.
<br>Most UV radiation for practical use is produced by various types of <a href=""entry://mercury-vapour lamp"">mercury-vapour lamps</a>. Ordinary glass absorbs UV radiation and therefore lenses and prisms for use in the UV are made from quartz"

"uncertainty principle","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>uncertainty principle</b><i>(Heisenberg uncertainty principle; principle of indeterminism)</i>
<br>The principle that it is not possible to know with unlimited accuracy both the position and momentum of a particle. This principle, discovered in 1927 by Werner <a href=""entry://Heisenberg"">Heisenberg</a>, is usually stated in the form: <div class=""equ"">Δ<i>x</i>Δ<i>p</i><i><sub class=""ind"">x</sub></i> = <i>h</i>/4π</img>, where Δ<i>x</i></div> is the uncertainty in the <i>x</i>-coordinate of the particle, Δ<i>p</i><i><sub class=""ind"">x</sub></i> is the uncertainty in the <i>x</i>-component of the particle's momentum, and <i>h</i> is the <a href=""entry://Planck constant"">Planck constant</a>. An explanation of the uncertainty is that in order to locate a particle exactly, an observer must be able to bounce off it a photon of radiation; this act of location itself alters the position of the particle in an unpredictable way. To locate the position accurately, photons of short wavelength would have to be used. The high momenta of such photons would cause a large effect on the position. On the other hand, using photons of lower momenta would have less effect on the particle's position, but would be less accurate because of the longer wavelength"

"Van de Graaff generator","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Van de Graaff generator</b><br>An electrostatic generator used to produce a high voltage, usually in the megavolt range. It consists of a large metal dome-shaped terminal mounted on a hollow insulating support. An endless insulating belt runs through the support from the base to a pulley within the spherical terminal. In the original type, charge is sprayed by point discharge from metal needles, held at a potential of about 10 kV, on to the bottom of the belt. A row of needles near the upper belt pulley removes the charge from the belt and passes it to the outer surface of the spherical terminal. The voltage achieved by the device is proportional to the radius of the spherical terminal. A typical device with a terminal having a radius of 1m will produce about 1MV. However, terminals can be made smaller, for a given voltage, by enclosing the apparatus in nitrogen at a pressure of 10&ndash;20 atmospheres (1&ndash;2 MPa) to reduce sparking. Generators having a positive-ion source are fitted with an evacuated tube through which the particles can be accelerated for research purposes (see <a href=""entry://linear accelerator"">linear accelerator</a>). Machines having an electron source are used for various medical and industrial purposes. The generator was invented by R. J. Van de Graaff (1901&ndash;67).
<br>Modern patterns of the generator have a chainlike belt of alternate links of metal and insulator. The metal links are charged by contact with a metal pulley, and discharge to the dome in the same way. This permits much higher current drain that the point discharge.<center class=""pic""><img src=""000080.jpg"" ></img><br>Van de Graaff generator</center>"

"van der Waals' force","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>van der Waals' force</b><br>An attractive force between atoms or molecules, named after J. D. van der Waals (1837&ndash;1923). The force accounts for the term <i>a</i>/<i>V</i><sup class=""expo"">2</sup> in the van der Waals equation (see <a href=""entry://equation of state"">equation of state</a>). These forces are much weaker than those arising from valence bonds and are inversely proportional to the seventh power of the distance between the atoms or molecules. They are the forces responsible for nonideal behaviour of gases and for the lattice energy of molecular crystals. There are three factors causing such forces:
<blockquote class=""blk"">(1)&nbsp;dipole-dipole interaction, i.e. electrostatic attractions between two molecules with permanent dipole moments;
<br> (2)&nbsp;dipole-induced dipole interactions, in which the dipole of one molecule polarizes a neighbouring molecule;
<br> (3)&nbsp;dispersion forces arising because of small instantaneous dipoles in atoms.

"wave","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>wave</b><br>A periodic disturbance in a medium or in space. In a <i>travelling wave</i> (or <i>progressive wave</i> ) energy is transferred from one place to another by the vibrations (see also <a href=""entry://stationary wave"">stationary wave</a>). In a wave passing over the surface of water, for example, the water rises and falls as the wave passes but the particles of water on average do not move forward with the wave. This is called a <i>transverse wave</i> because the disturbances are at right angles to the direction of propagation. The water surface moves up and down while the waves travel across the surface of the water. Electromagnetic waves (see diagram) are also of this kind, with electric and magnetic fields varying in a periodic way at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation. In sound waves, the air is alternately compressed and rarefied by displacements in the direction of propagation. Such waves are called <i>longitudinal waves</i> .
<br>The chief characteristics of a wave are its <i>speed of propagation</i> , its <i>frequency</i> , its <i>wavelength</i> , and its <i>amplitude</i> . The speed of propagation is the distance covered by the wave in unit time. The frequency is the number of complete disturbances (cycles) in unit time, usually expressed in <a href=""entry://hertz"">hertz</a>. The wavelength is the distance in metres between successive points of equal phase in a wave. The amplitude is the maximum difference of the disturbed quantity from its mean value.
<br>Generally, the amplitude (<i>a</i>) is half the peak-to-peak value. There is a simple relationship between the wavelength (λ) and the frequency (f), i.e. <div class=""equ"">λ = <i>c</i>/<i>f</i></div>, where <i>c</i> is the speed of propagation.

<b>year</b><br>The measure of time on which the calendar is based. It is the time taken for the earth to complete one orbit of the sun. The <i>calendar year</i> consists of an average of 365.25 mean solar days &mdash; three successive years of 365 days followed by one (leap) year of 366 days. The <i>solar year</i> (or <i>astronomical year</i> ) is the average interval between two successive returns of the sun to the first point of Aries; it is 365.242 mean solar days. The <i>sidereal year</i> is the average period of revolution of the earth with respect to the fixed stars; it is 365.256 mean solar days. The <i>anomalistic year</i> is the average interval between successive perihelions; it is 365.259 mean solar days. See also <a href=""entry://ephemeris time"">ephemeris time</a>"

"Zeeman effect","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Zeeman effect</b><br>The splitting of the lines in a spectrum when the source of the spectrum is exposed to a magnetic field. It was discovered in 1896 by the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman (1865&ndash;1943). In the <i>normal Zeeman effect</i> a single line is split into three if the field is perpendicular to the light path or two lines if the field is parallel to the light path. This effect can be explained by classical electromagnetic principles in terms of the speeding up and slowing down of orbital electrons in the source as a result of the applied field. The <i>anomalous Zeeman effect</i> is a complicated splitting of the lines into several closely spaced lines, so called because it does not agree with classical predictions. This effect is explained by quantum mechanics in terms of electron spin"
"Zener diode","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>Zener diode</b><br>A type of semiconductor diode, consisting of a <i>p-n</i> junction with high doping concentrations on either side of the junction. It acts as a rectifier until the applied reverse voltage reaches a certain value, the <i>Zener breakdown voltage</i> , when the device becomes conducting. This effect occurs as a result of electrons being excited directly from the valence band into the conduction band (see <a href=""entry://energy band"">energy bands</a>). Zener diodes are used in voltage-limiting circuits; they are named after the US physicist Clarence Melvin Zener (1905&ndash;93)"

"zone refining","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>zone refining</b><br>A technique used to reduce the level of impurities in certain metals, alloys, semiconductors, and other materials. It is based on the observation that the solubility of an impurity may be different in the liquid and solid phases of a material. To take advantage of this observation, a narrow molten zone is moved along the length of a specimen of the material, with the result that the impurities are segregated at one end of the bar and the pure material at the other. In general, if the impurities lower the melting point of the material they are moved in the same direction as the molten zone moves, and vice versa"

"zwitterion","<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
<b>zwitterion</b><i>(ampholyte ion)</i>
<br>An ion that has a positive and negative charge on the same group of atoms. Zwitterions can be formed from compounds that contain both acid groups and basic groups in their molecules. For example, aminoethanoic acid (the amino acid glycine) has the formula H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>N.CH<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>.COOH. However, under neutral conditions, it exists in the different form of the zwitterion <sup class=""expo"">+</sup>H<sub class=""ind"">3</sub>N.CH<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>.COO<sup class=""expo"">-</sup>, which can be regarded as having been produced by an internal neutralization reaction (transfer of a proton from the carboxyl group to the amino group). Aminoethanoic acid, as a consequence, has some properties characteristic of ionic compounds; e.g. a high melting point and solubility in water. In acid solutions, the positive ion <sup class=""expo"">+</sup>H<sub class=""ind"">3</sub>NCH<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>COOH is formed. In basic solutions, the negative ion H<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>NCH<sub class=""ind"">2</sub>COO<sup class=""expo"">-</sup> predominates. The name comes from the German <i>zwei</i>, two."
