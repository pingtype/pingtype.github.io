I'm stuck! 
Get back! 
Mr. Tweedy. 
What is that chicken doing outside the fence? 
Oh! I don't know, love
Just deal with it. Now! 
I'll teach you to make a fool out of me
Let that be a lesson to the lot of ya! 
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm! 
Morning, Ginger. Back from holiday? 
I wasn't on holiday, Babs. 
I was in solitary confinement
Oh, it's nice to get a bit of time to yourself
isn't it? 
Roll call! 
Come along, now. You'll be late for parade
Pip, pip. Quick march. Left, right, left, right
Left, right, left, right! 
Come on. Smarten up. 
Discipline! Order! 
Back in my R. A. F. days
when the officer called for a scramble
you'd hop in the old crate and tally- ho. 
Chocks away! 
Give over, you old fool. 
They just want to count us
How dare you talk back to a senior ranking officer? 
Why, back in my R.A.F. days! 
Fowler, they're coming
Oh, right, right. 
There will be a stern reprimand for you, lad. 
You're grounded
Attention! 
Welcome back, hen. Is there a new plan? 
I thought we tried going under
Ah! Over. Right
How's the egg count? 
I've laid five eggs this morning. Five! 
Well- chuffed with that, I was! 

Oh, no. Edwina
Bunty, why didn't you give her some of yours? 
I would have. She didn't tell me. 
She didn't tell anyone
Oh, is Edwina off on holiday? 
We've got to get out of here
Ginger! Are we still on? 
Oh, we're on, all right
Spread the word, Mac. Meeting tonight in hut 17
You called? Nick and... 
- Fetcher. - At your service
Over here
We need some more things
Right you are, miss. 
How about this quality handcrafted tea set? 
Uh, no
Or a lovely necklace and pendant? 
It's love... 
Or this beautiful number
all the rage in the fashionable chicken coops of Paree
Simply pop it on like so
and as the French hens say, " Voila! " 
That's French
That's two hats in one, miss. 
For parties, for weddings
Oh, but madame, this makes you look like a vision
like a dream
- Like a duck. - No, thank you
We're making this. We need THESE things. 
Can you get them? 
Oh, oh, oh, this is a big job, miss
Oh, bigger than the others. 
No, no. This is gonna cost
Same as always. One bag of seed
- You call this pay? - It's chicken feed
- What else could we give you? - Eggs
- Eggs? - Eggs
We can't give you eggs. They're too valuable
And so are we
After you, Fetcher
After I what? 
Move! 
Twenty- two and nine
Fourteen shillings and threepence
Seven and sixpence times three
Two and nine
Fourpence ha'penny
D- oh! Stupid, worthless creatures! 
I'm sick and tired of making minuscule profits



Oh, yes
Those chickens are up to something
Quiet. I'm onto something
They're organized. I know it
- I said, quiet. - That ginger one
I reckon she's their leader
Mr. Tweedy! 
I may finally have found a way to
make us some real money here
and what are you on about? 
Ridiculous notions of escaping chickens
But... But... 
It's all in your head, Mr. Tweedy. Say it! 
It's all in me head. It's all in me head
Now, you keep telling yourself that
because I don't want to hear another word about it
- Is that clear? - Yes, love
But you know that ginger one... 
It's chickens, you dolt! 
Apart from you
they're the most stupid creatures on this planet! 
They don't plot, they don't scheme
and they are not organized
Order! Order! 
Quiet, everyone. Settle down. 
I would like to call to order! Please
if you could just... 
Let's have some discipline in the ranks! What, what! 
- Thank you, Fowler. - In my R. A. F. day
we were never allowed to waste time
with unnecessary chit- chat
Yes, thank you, Fowler
I... 
Right! 
Carry on
Now, I know our last escape attempt was
a bit of a fiasco
but Mac and I have come up with a brand- new plan
- Show 'em, Mac. - Right
We tried going under the wire and that didn't work
So, the plan is... we go OVER it
This is us, right? 
We get in like this
Wind her up and... let her go! 
Good grief! The turnip's bought it! 
Farmer's coming! 
Operation Cover- up! 
Mr. Tweedy! 
- Where are you? - Ooh. It's all in your head
It's all in your head. It's all in your head
Think, everyone, think. What haven't we tried yet? 
We haven't tried NOT trying to escape
Hmm. That might work
What about Edwina? 
How many more empty nests will it take? 
Perhaps it wouldn't be empty
if she'd spent more time laying
and less time escaping
So laying eggs all your life... 
and then getting plucked, stuffed
and roasted is good enough? 
It's a living
You know what the problem is? 
The fences aren't just round the farm. 
They're up here in your heads
There's a better place out there
somewhere beyond that hill
and it has wide open spaces and lots of trees... 
and grass
Can you imagine that? Cool, green grass
- Who feeds us? - We feed ourselves
- Well, where's the farm? - There is no farm
Then where does the farmer live? 
There is no farmer, Babs
- Is he on holiday? - He isn't anywhere
Don't you get it? 
There's no morning head count, no farmers
no dogs, coops and keys
and no fences
In all my life I've never heard such a fantastic... 
load of tripe! 
Oh, face the facts, ducks
The chances of us getting out of here
are a million to one
Then there's still a chance
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. What am I doing? 
Who are you trying to fool? 
You can't lead this bunch of... 
Oh, heaven help us
Freedoooom! 
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen
You've been a wonderful audience
Oh, yes
That's it! 
Get him inside quickly
THIS is our way out of here
We'll make posters? 
No. What's ON the poster, Babs. What's ON the poster
We'll fly out! 
He must be important to have his picture taken. 
What does he do? 
Isn't it obvious? He's a professional flying rooster
He flies from farm to farm, giving demonstrations
- Do you suppose? - Oh, absolutely
Not in the dark, no. No, not in there. No
Get out. Good. Gotta get... 
Who are you? Where am I? What's going on? 
Ouch! What happened to my wing? 
You took a rather nasty fall
And sprained the anterior tendon
I gave it a wee bit of a tweak and wrapped her up
Was that English? 
You sprained a wing. She fixed it
- I made the bandage. - I- I carried you in
Let's back up and start from the top. Where am I? 
You're right. How rude. We're just very excit... 
This is a chicken farm
And we're the chickens
Yeah, with you so far. Chicken farm, chickens... 
I don't like the look of this one. 
His eyes are too close together
- Fowler, please. - And he's a Yank! 
Easy, Pops. Cockfighting's illegal where I come from
And where is that exactly? 
A place I call the land of the free
and the home of the brave
- Scotland! - No! America
Oh! America
Poppycock. Pushy Americans. 
Showing up late for every war
Overpaid, oversexed and over here! 
What's eating Grandpa? 
Oh, don't mind him, Mister! Mister? 
Name's Rocky. Rocky the Rhode Island Red. Rhodes for short
- Rocky Rhodes? - Catchy, ain't it? 
Um, Mr. Rhodes, is this you? 
Uh, who wants to know? 
A group of rather desperate chickens
You see, if it is you
then you just might be the answer to our prayers
Well, then, call me a miracle, dollface, 'cause that's me
And what brings you to England, Mr. Rhodes? 
Why, all the beautiful English chicks, of course
Give over! 
You see, I'm a traveler by nature
I've done the whole barnyard thing
but I couldn't get into it
Hi. How are you? Nope
The open road. That's more my style
Yep, just give me a pack on my back
and point me where the wind blows
In fact, you know what they call me back home? 
You're gonna love this. The Lone Free Ranger
Isn't that great? 
- I knew it was possible. - Oh, it's possible, all right
- I knew the answer would come. - Amen! 
We're all going to fly over that fence
and Mr. Rhodes is going to show us how, right? 
That's... What? Did you say " fly" ? 
- You can teach us. - No, I can't
Listen. Shh. You hear that? 
That's the open road calling my name
and I was born to answer that call
He must have very good hearing
Okay, okay, where's the exit? Ah, this way
Mr. Rhodes, um, perhaps
I didn't explain our situation properly
We lay eggs day in and day out
and when we can't lay any more, they kill us
It's a cruel world, doll face. 
You might as well get used to it
Which part of " they kill us" do you not understand? 
I got my own set of problems to worry about
Besides, this birdcage can't be that hard to bust out of
In fact, watch me
It's not so hard to get one chicken
out of here or even two
but this is about all of us
All of you? 
That's what I've been trying to tell you
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight
You want to get every chicken
in this place out of here at the SAME TIME? 
- Of course. - You're certifiable! 
You can't pull off a stunt like that. 
That's suicide
Where there's a will, there's a way
Couldn't agree more. I WILL be leaving that way
- But... Please! - I'm the type of guy
That likes to roam around I'm never in one... 
So that's it. You're from the circus
You're on the run, aren't you? 
You wanna keep it down? 
I'm trying to lay low here. 
I should turn you in right now
You wouldn't. Would you? 
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
Because I'm... cute? 
Hey, hey, hey! What kind of crazy chick are you? 
Do you know what'll happen if he finds me? 
It's a cruel world
I just decided. I don't like you
I just decided. I don't care. 
Now, show us how to fly
- With this wing? - Teach us, then
No! 
He's valuable, you say? 
- Sure. - Get the torch
Now, you listen here, sister. 
I'm not going back to that life
I'm a Lone Free Ranger. Emphasis on FREE! 
And that's what we want. Freedom! 
Fancy that. They're coming this way
Oh, oh, no. No. They're on to me
Teach us to fly and we'll hide you
And if I don't? 
Was your father by any chance a vulture? 
Do we have a deal? 
Time to make good on that deal, doll... 
The name is Ginger
- Comfortable? - Not really
Maybe this will help
Nice hideout
Ouch. I had more room in my egg
We've held up our end of the deal. 
Tomorrow you hold up yours
- What deal? - The flying! 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right, right. Don't worry
I'll teach you everything I know
Now, which bunk is mine? 
Absolutely outrageous! 
Asking a senior officer to share his quarters... 
and with a noncommissioned Yank, no less
Why, back in my day, I'd never! 
You weren't exactly my first choice, either
And scoot over. Your wing's on my side of the bunk
Your side of the bunk? 
The WHOLE bunk is my side of the bunk! 
Just... What's that smell? Is that your breath? 
It's absolutely outrageous
So you wanna fly, huh? 
Well, it ain't gonna be easy
and it ain't gonna happen overnight
You see, flying takes three things
Hard work, perseverance and... 
- Hard work. - You said hard work twice! 
That's because
it takes twice as much work as perseverance
Codswallop! 
Now, the most important thing is
we have to work as a team
which means... you do everything I tell you
Right! Let's rock and roll! 
Mrs. Tweedy! The chickens are... 
Pecking? 
And left, two, three. And right, two, three
And... stop right there. Oh, yeah, down
Down. Yeah, make little circles. That's it. Faster
Faster. Oh, yes. Perfect
Oh, that's the spot. 
I thought you were going to teach us how to fly
That's what I'm doing
Isn't there usually some flapping involved? 
Hey, do I tell YOU how to lay eggs? 
Relax. We're making progress
Really? I can't help feeling we're going around in circles
What the... Hey! Cut it out! You're making me dizzy
I think they're ready to fly now
Good, because they certainly can't walk anymore
Up and at 'em, gals. Let's flap
Watch, Fetcher
Let's see if old Attila the Hen has come to her senses
It's raining hen! 
- What's this caper, love? - We're flying
Obviously
Flipping hell. Look at this, Fetch
They're gonna kill themselves
- Wanna watch? - Yeah, all right
Hey! Careful of those eggs! 
Sunny- side up. 
Now they're over easy! 
Definitely scrambled
Go! Go! Go! 
Go, go, go, go! Go! 
Poultry in motion! 
Birds of a feather flop together
Great work, ladies. Great work! 
The pain you're feeling is a good thing. It's good
Pain is your friend, okay? It's a positive thing
Just keep the faith, uh... What's your name? 
Agnes! You'll get there
Ducky, I think you flew four feet today! 
Right, four feet! From the roof to the ground
It's all part of the process, ladies. 
Nothing to worry about! 
Ya cheese- eating little... 
That doesn't sound good. Ha, ha, ha
Okay, the ground's shaking. Are we worried? 
Are we worried? 
The circus. Quick. Hide me
- Hide me. - Come on
One isn't awarded a medal
like this for flapping about like a lunatic
Now, see here! This is an officer's quarters
Quick. In here. 
Get out of here immediately, sir! 
Give it a rest, Pops
Out of here! I shall have you on a charge within the week

Cheers, mate
It's all in your head. It's all in your head
It's all in your head
What... What... What's all this, then? 
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy
No more wasting time with petty
egg collection and minuscule profits
No more eggs? But we've always been egg farmers
Me father and his father and all their fathers. 
They was always... 
Poor! Worthless. Nothings
But all that's about to change
This will take Tweedy's farm out of the dark ages... 
and into full- scale automated production
Melisha Tweedy will be poor no longer

I'll put it together, then, shall I? 
This isn't good, Mac
Whatever's in those boxes is for us
and I don't think it's softer hay
Aye, hen. And I hate to be the voice of doom
but I've been calculating
and I just don't think we're built for flying
But I saw him. He flew in over that fence
Aye, aye, I believe you
but if we could just see it for ourselves
that may answer some questions
You're right. I'm sorry
We've been at this all week, and we're getting nowhere
If his wing were better, he could! 
Oh! I'll have a word with him
Where is he? 
They didn't give me this medal for being a Yank nanny
A simple " I don't know" would suffice
Beware of that one, young Ginger
That Yank is not to be trusted
That YANK is our ticket out of here
And the pig says to the horse
" Hey, fella, why the long face? " 
Oh, oh, look, look
Oh. Cocktail! 
Give over! 
So, um, anyway... 
Remember those flying tips tomorrow. 
They're very important
Keep thinking those flighty thoughts
Oh, yeah
They're swell chicks. They really are
Look at what Babs made me
A beak warmer. Isn't that the cutest? 
And that Bunty. She really packs a punch
Is there a problem here? 
- Have we flown over that fence? - Not quite
Then there's a problem
Good things come to those who wait, dollface
Ginger! 
- Okay, how long did it take you? - To do what? 
To learn how to fly
Apples and oranges, baby doll. 
I'm gifted. They're not
You can't compare the two, okay? 
The point is, these things take time
Which we are rapidly running out of
We haven't even lifted off the ground. Why? 
Trust. I went over my calculations
and I figured the key element was trust
I- I didn't get a word of that
When birds like ducks and geese take off
what do they have? Trust! 
I swear she ain't using real words
- She said we need more thrust. - Oh, thrust
Well, of course, we need thrust. 
Thrust and flying are like... this! 
- Would you excuse us? - Aye
Ah, the wing, the wing, the wing
If we don't see some results by tomorrow, the deal is off
No more hiding. They will find you
and it's back to the circus, flyboy! 
You're the first chick I ever met with the shell still on
Sleep tight, angel face. The Rock's on the case
Cock- a- doodle- doo! What, what
Oh, it was a beaut, guv'nor
A fine piece of work, if I do say so meself
- I say so meself, too. - Wish I could have seen it
We slipped into the farmer's room, all quiet like
- Like a fish. - Yeah, and we... 
" Like a fish" ? You stupid Norbert
Anyway, guv, here it is
- El merchandiso. - That's Spanish
What are these two crooks doing here? 
- So, you know each other? - She don't think we're valuable
Guys, you are without a doubt the sneakiest
most light- fingered thieving parasites I've ever met
- Oh, don't, don't. Stop it. - I've gone bright red
So, uh, how about them eggs? 
Eggs? Don't tell me you promised them... 
Yep! Promised them every egg I lay this month
And when can we expect the first installment? 
I'm brewing one up as we speak. I'll keep you posted
Pleasure doing business with you, sir
Sucker
- What? - You've lied to them
I didn't lie, dollface. I just... omitted certain truths
I'll give them exactly what I promised
Which is nothing. 
Which is what I'll give them
And what will you give us? 
Thrrrust! 
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good
Now this is just a little helper
Something to get you going. It's a thrust exercise
- The tension's killing me. - It's gonna kill her! 
- Release! - Whoa! 
Come on! Flap! 
You can do it. Flap, flap, flap! 
Yes, yes, yes! 
Is that your first offense? 
Roll call! I haven't laid any eggs
- Hide me. - Three days and not one
- Oh, no! - Why didn't you tell us, Babs? 
- Hide me! - We've been busy with the flying... 
- They're coming! - Hide me! 
Hide yourself! 
Double their food rations, Mr. Tweedy
I want them all as fat as this one
All of me life flashed before me eyes! 
It was really boring
Chicken feed. My favorite! 
Wait. Wait
No. Wait! 
Babs, please! Bunty! Stop it! Wait! 
Stop! 
Stop it! 
Something is wrong here. Can't you see that? 
Strange boxes arrive in the barn. Babs stops laying
but she's not taken to the chop
and now they're giving us extra food
Don't you see what's happening? They're fattening us up
They're going to kill us all
Whoa, whoa! Heavy alert. 
She didn't mean that, gals. 
Do you mind? 
Keep eating. Save some for me
What are you doing? How dare you! Let go of me! 
Listen! I've met some hard- boiled eggs in my day
but I'd say you're about 20 minutes! 
What's that supposed to mean? 
It means you got to lighten up
Over in America, we have this rule
If you want to motivate someone, don't mention death
Funny. Over here, the rule is:Always tell the truth
That's been working like a real charm, hasn't it? 
Here's some free advice. You want them to perform? 
- Tell them what they want to hear. - You mean lie
Here we go again. You know what your problem is? 
You're... difficult
Why? Because I'm honest? 
I care about what happens to them
something I wouldn't expect
a Lone Free Ranger to know anything about
If this is the way you show it
I hope you never care about me! 
- I can assure you, I never will. - Good! 
Fine! 
What's all this? 
Well, here she is. Ask and you shall receive
That's biblical
That's real craftsmanship, is what it is. 
Solid as a rock
It's supposed to do that
- It's perfect, guys. - And how's that egg coming? 
This is a double yolker
I don't see what this has to do with... 
You will
We've been working too hard
Time to kick back a bit, shake those tail feathers
Look at him. Nellypodging around like a... 
Oh, good heavens. What's happening? 
That's called a beat, sister. 
Feel it pulsing through your body! 
Oh, yes. Pulsing. Fancy that
Hey, well, then go with it, baby
Oh, my. Look! I'm going with it! 
Bunty, what's got into you? 
Same thing that's got into you apparently
Flip flop fly I don't care if I die
Just go with the flow, gal! 
Flip flop fly I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye
Now, see here. I don't recall authorizing a hop
Oh, shut up and dance
What are you sobbing about, you nancy? 
Little moments like this, mate
It's what makes the job all worthwhile
Wanna dance? 
Yeah, all right
Now give me one more kiss hold it a long long time
Give me one more kiss hold it a long long time
Love me baby till the feeling hits my head like wine
So fine so glad that you're mine
Flip flop fly I don't care if I die
Flip flop fly I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye
Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye
Yeah don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye yeah
Did ya see that? I flew! 
Attagirl, Babsy. Attagirl
- Oh! Your wing. It's better. - Well... 
- How about that? - Fantastic
You can fly for us tomorrow
Uh, uh, yeah, so it seems
I flew! I flew! 
Looks like I owe you an apology
I didn't think you cared about us
but after all this... 
Well, it seems I was wrong
Hey, easy, Miss. Hard- boiled
I might think you're turning soft
Uh, listen, there's something I got to tell ya. I... 
No. You'd better wait here
Ooh, that's champion, that is. What is it? 
It's a pie machine, you idiot
Chickens go in, pies come out
Ooh! What kind of pies? 
- Apple. - My favorite! 
Chicken pies, you great lummox! Imagine it
In less than a fortnight
every grocers' in the county... 
will be stocked with box upon box... 
of Mrs. Tweedy's Homemade Chicken Pies
Just Missus? 
Woman's touch. Makes the public feel more comfortable
Oh, right. How does it work? 
Get me a chicken and I'll show you
I know just the one
I've got a score to settle with you
Blooming heck! They've got Ginger! 
We mustn't panic. We mustn't panic! 
Quiet there! 
Quiet, I say! Let's have some discipline. What, what
The enemy has taken a prisoner. 
This calls for retaliation
Retaliation! 
What's going on? What's happening? 
They got Ginger, Mr. Rhodes. 
They're taking her to the chops
Well, what are you waiting for, laddie? 
Fly over there. Save her! 
Of course... No, no! No
that's just what they'd expect
But I say we give them the old element of surprise
And catch Jerry with his trousers down
I like the sound of that. What's the plan? 
The plan... The plan
The plan... Uh, Babs! 
Give me that thing. Bunty, give me a boost
Look at the size of that thing
Oh, no! 
Chickens go in
pies come out
Chicken pies
Not... Not apple pies. Chicken
Oh, great. Brilliant! 
- Yo, baby doll! - Rocky! 
- I'm coming! - Hurry! 
- I'm still coming! - Come on! 
- Stop this thing! - I'm getting there! 
Oh, shoot! 
Rocky! 

I'll be down before you can say! 
mixed vegetables! 


D- oh! Get it? Dough! 
- I'm stuck! - Nothing to it. Oops
Hang on! 
Look out! 

Yes! 
Oh, it's like an oven in here
Come on! 
Wait up! I'm com... 
Don't leave... 
Get over to the... 
The door! Come on! 
She's gonna blow! Run! 


What did you do, you great pudding? 
I didn't do 'owt! 
- Turn it off! - It won't turn off! 

- Ouch! - We've got to show the others
Look! I fixed it! 
Chicken pies? 
- Yes, but... - I don't want to be a pie! 
I don't like gravy
Ladies, please. Let's not lose our heads
Lose our heads? 
What I meant was, Rocky sabotaged the machine
and bought us time
And better still, he's going to fly for us tomorrow
And once we've seen how it's done, we'll get it! 
So don't worry
because tomorrow everything's
going to go much, much smoother
All right, Pops, what did I do now? 
A very brave and honorable deed, sir
In the light of your action this evening
I dutifully admit that I have misjudged your character
So I present you with this medal for bravery
And... 
I salute you
In honor of the occasion
I surrender the bunk entirely
I shall sleep under the stars. 
Oh, uh, I await tomorrow's flying demonstration... 
with great anticipation
You and me both, Pops
- Oh! - I'm sorry. Were you... 
Is this your... I'll go. 
No, it's just... 
Since you're here! 
I'm glad you're here, because... 
I'm sorry. You go first. 
You go ahead. I'll... 
Um, I just wanted to say... 
I may have been a bit harsh at first
Well, what I really mean is
thank you... 
for saving my life
For saving OUR lives
You know
I come up here every night! 
and look out to that hill
and imagine what it must be like on the other side
It's funny, I've... 
I've never actually felt grass beneath my feet
I'm sorry
Here I am rambling on about hills and grass
and you had something to say
Um, it's just that, y- you know
life, as I've experienced it, you know, out there
lone free ranging and stuff, it's, uh
it's full of disappointments, and, uh... 
What, you mean grass isn't all it's cracked up to be? 
Grass! Exactly. Grass
It's always greener on the other side
And then you get there and it's brown and prickly
You see what I'm trying to say? 
What I'm trying to say is... 
you're welcome
You know
that hill is looking closer tonight
than it ever has before
Well, good night... Rocky
Good night... Ginger
Company, attention! 
Today's the day, girls. We're going to fly! 
I can feel it! 
Finally, we get to see a real professional in action
Better start warming up. I'll go and get him
Rocky. Knock- knock. 
Everyone's waiting, so I told them to... 
R- Rocky? 
Oh, a cannon
Aye, that would give you thrust
I knew he was fake all along
In fact, I'm not even certain he was American
So, what's the next plan, hen? 
Let's face it
The only way out of here is wrapped in pastry
Perhaps he just went on holiday
Perhaps he just went to get away
from your infernal knitting! 
You were always hitting him
See how YOU like it! 
Don't push me, four- eyes! 
Quiet there! Quiet, I say! 
Dissension in the ranks. 
Precisely what Jerry would have wanted
The old divide and conquer
A proper squadron work together
like we did in my R. A. F. days
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map... 
and old Whizzbang at the tail- end Charlie
Wing Co would give the call
hop in the old crate, chocks away! 
Wizard show it was. That's how you get medals
Will you shut up about
your stupid blooming medals! 
How dare you! 
Madam, forgive me. A- As an officer
I offer my most... 
Fowler? 
Everyone, shut up! 
Fowler
What exactly is the R. A. F. ? 
What do you mean, what is it? 
The Royal Air Force is what. 
Then what's the " old crate" ? 
Ahh! There she is
Gorgeous, isn't she? 
You mean, you flew in one of these? 
Beautifully built. 
In fact, there's a bit of a story to that
We were out on a " recce, " you see
Ops had given the go- ahead
but the weather duffed up... 
Yes. Of course
We might actually be able to pull this off
- We're STILL going to fly! - What, what? 
Fowler's provided the answer
I have? 
Uh, yes, yes, yes. Of course I have
Uh, how have I? 
We'll make... 
a crate
Mac, you'll handle the engineering
Babs, manufacturing
Fowler will be chief aviation advisor
Bunty, eggs
- Eggs? - Eggs
Right, just like the ones that rooster was gonna lay
Only roosters don't lay eggs, do they? 
Don't they? 
No, it's a lady thing, apparently
Ask your mum
One egg for every item on the list. 
First payment in advance
Right! When do we start? 
Come on! 
What the dickens? 
Oh, gnomes now
Voila! 
Give me
Eggs from heaven! 
No! From her bum! 
- Idiot! - That was close
Too close
We can't stop now. Come on
everyone! Go for it! 
Really go for it! Go, go, go, go! 
Mac, we need those calculations quickly
Agnes, that has to be really secure
- Careful up there, Fowler! - Roger! 
Bunty, give him a hand
Well done, Babs. Keep it up
No problem, dollface
Oh, I'm the type of guy
That likes to roam around
I'm never in one place
I roam from town to town
And when I found myself falling for some girl
I'd hop right in that car... 
And travel 'round the world
Cause I'm a wanderer
Yeah a wanderer
I roam around and round around and round... 

Oh, boy
Come on
Please
Oh, no. He's fixed it
Get the chickens
Which ones? 
All of them
Me tools! 
Why, you thieving little buggers! 
What's the plan? 
Attack! 
Nice plan
Mrs. Tweedy! 
Aaaah! Mrs. Tweedy! 
The chickens are revolting! 
Finally something we agree on
Help! Mrs... . 
Under the hut
- What have we done? - This is it, everyone
We're escaping
- What, now? - Now! 
- But, Ginger, she's not ready. - Listen
We'll either die free chickens or die trying
Are those the only choices? 
- Let's do it! - Scramble! 
This way! 
Mrs. Tweedy! 
The exits are located here and here
In the quite likely event of an emergency
put your head between your knees and... 
Kiss your bum good-bye
All right, Fowler, ready for takeoff
Behind you all the way
But you're supposed to be up there
You're the pilot
Oh, don't be ridiculous. 
I can't fly this contraption
Back in your day... The Royal Air Force... 
6- 4- 4 Squadron, poultry division
We were the mascots
You mean you never actually flew the plane? 
Good heavens, no
I'm a chicken! 
The Royal Air Force doesn't
let chickens behind the controls
of a complex aircraft! 
We're all gonna die! 
Fowler, you have to fly it
You're always talking about back in your day. 
Well, today is your day
You can do it, you old sausage
Wing Commander T. I. Fowler... 
reporting for duty
Well, come on. What are you waiting for? 
We haven't got all day. 
Let's get this crate off the ground
Fowler! Now! 
Roger! Contact! 
Cleared for takeoff! 

Chocks away! 
Chocks away! 
- Full throttle! - Full throttle! 
We need more power! 
I cannot work miracles, Cap'n! 
We're giving her all she's got
- Gotcha! - Hard right! 
Oh, mother! 
Turn her around. I'll get the ramp
Put the ramp down. 
You are going to be a pie! 
Ginger! 
Rocky! 
Heads up! 
- Look out! - Clear the runway! 
Ginger! Let's go! 
We're flying! 
That's for leaving
And this is for coming back
Great Scott! What was that? 
A cling- on, Cap'n
and the engines can't take it! 
Oh, goodness
Babs! Scissors! 
Bingo
Lower me down
- But, Ginger, I... - Just do it
Increase velocity! 
What does that mean? 
Pedal your flipping giblets out! 
- Lower! - I'm trying! 
Fowler, look out! 
Oh! Ginger! 
Fire! Fire! 
Me eggs. 
No! 
More ammo! Hurry! 
- We got no more eggs! - Ginger! Look out! 
No! 
Bye-bye
Bombs away! 
Mr. Tweedy! 
Oh, that was good. That was good! 
The old bird bought it! 
Mrs. Tweedy! Mrs. Twee... 


I told you they was organized
We did it, everyone! 
Keep pedaling! We're not there yet! 
You can't see paradise if you don't pedal! 
Put your drumsticks into it! 
That's what I told him. What, what
We were losing altitude
you see, and heading for a fearful prang
This is a lovely holiday
I'll be sad to go back
Safety at all times is imperative
Now, wind 'er up and... 
Let 'er go! 
So... is it as good as you imagined? 
No. 
It's better. 
Come on. I'll show you how to play cricket
Here's a thought
Why don't we get an egg and start our own chicken farm? 
That way we'll have all the eggs we could eat
Right. We'll need a chicken, then
No. No, we'll need an egg
You have the egg first. 
That's where you get the chicken from

No, that's cobblers. Without a chicken
where you gonna get an egg? 
From the chicken that comes from the egg
Yeah, but you have to have an egg to have a chicken
But you gotta get the chicken first to get the egg
and then the egg to get the chicken out of
Hang on. Let's go over this again

Yeow
All right
Oh yeah
When I get the blues gon'get me a rocking chair
When I get the blues gon'get me a rocking chair
When the blues overtake me
Gonna rock on away from here ohh
Here comes my baby flashing a new gold tooth
Here comes my baby flashing a new gold tooth
Yeah she's so small
She can rumba in a pay phone booth
That's the truth ha- ha! 
Flip flop fly
I don't care if I die
Flip flop fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye
Yeow! 
Now give me one more kiss
And hold it a long long time
Give me one more kiss
And hold it a long long time
Love me baby till the feeling hits my head like wine
So fine so glad that you're mine
Flip flop fly
I don't care if I die
Flip flop fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye
Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye
Bye-bye bye-bye
Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye
Yeah! 
Bye-bye! 
The egg, obviously
Rolling along, happy as Larry
Then, crack! Hatches into the first chicken
Yeah, but where'd the egg come from, then? 
What do you mean, where'd it come from? 
Egg comes rolling along, happy as Larry
It's wondering where'dit come from? 
Without a chicken, you get no egg to come rolling along
Well, conversely, without an egg to hatch into the chicken
there will be no chicken to lay the other egg
that hatches into the chicken
that lays the egg I mentioned first
- We got two eggs now? - No
We're still talking about the very first egg
What about the very first chicken? 
He's in the very first egg! 
- Aren't you listening? - Uh, guys. Guys? 
Trying to enjoy paradise over here
- Oh, sorry, guv. - Beg your pardon
- Won't happen again. - Thanks
- Gitface. - Pillock
Thinks he's such a big shot 'cause
he's got his name on a poster
These show biz folk are all the same
- The rats are the stars. - Yeah, of course they are
We do all the 'ard work, he gets all the credit
- He gets everything. - Yes, he does. Everything
